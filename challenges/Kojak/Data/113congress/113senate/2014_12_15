So for those who are watching, he has his uniform on \nbecause he is an admiral in the U.S. Navy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/15/senate-section/article/S6822-5", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to debate the Murthy, Santos, Rose, \nSaldana, and Blinken nominations.\n\n\n                           Blinken Nomination\n\n  I am not going to speak extensively on any of these. I will just say \nnow, Tony Blinken I have known for many years. He was integral to the \nsuccess of Joe Biden, as U.S. Senator, and has been with him as Vice \nPresident. Now he is going to be the second in command at the State \nDepartment.\n  When we have our briefings in the classified room, there is no one \nwho is more articulate and can answer the questions any better than \nTony Blinken. I have great admiration for him. I think we as a country \nare so fortunate he is going to be in the position he is in.\n  At 5:30 today there will be four rollcall votes. Those votes will be \nas follows: cloture on Murthy to be Surgeon General of the United \nStates, confirmation of the Murthy nomination, cloture on the Santos \nnomination to be a member of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety \nBoard, and cloture on Executive Calendar No. 635, Frank Rose to be an \nAssistant Secretary of State.\n  This man has been waiting 513 days, an extremely important job: \nverification of plants, nuclear. I don't think the Republicans dislike \nhim. They don't like the job he is going to have. They have left it \nbasically empty for all this time.\n  So we have some important stuff to do. We can complete everything we \nwanted to today--today. Everything that is scheduled now for the week, \nwe can finish today. I hope everyone understands we can move forward, \nbut we are going to have to be here until we finish our work, whether \nthat is Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday or Saturday. So everyone \nshould understand they can't be leaving.\n  I know we all have things to do. I haven't been home in such a long \ntime and I want to go home. I bought a new home there. As everyone \nknows, I sold my place in Searchlight and bought a home in the Greater \nLas Vegas area. I would like to be able to see the home. I have not \nslept in it. We bought it in May and I have not been there. My wife is \nthere waiting, getting ready for the move in, which is now taking \nplace. So we have a lot of work to do. We have to work together to get \nit done as quickly as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/15/senate-section/article/S6822-6", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6822-S6823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DEPARTING SENATORS\n\n\n                              Mark Begich\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Alaska is a State unlike any other State in \nthe country. Often referred to as the ``last frontier,'' Alaska's \nlandscape is as breathtakingly beautiful as it is immense. Its \nresidents are some of the most kind and accepting people one would ever \nmeet. Any person who represents the State of Alaska must possess a true \nlove for the exceptional beauty of this region and the vastness of it. \nIt is so far away from everything. The capital Juneau, you can only get \nthere in an airplane. That is the only way you can get to the capital \nof the State of Alaska. So I am going to spend a little bit of time \ntalking about Senator Mark Begich and his faithful service to the \npeople of Alaska.\n  There is no surprise that he is dedicated to Alaska and the people of \nAlaska. His father, Congressman Nick Begich, was dedicated to Alaska, \nas has been his mom Peggy. They moved to the then-Territory of Alaska \nin 1957 to teach school. Congressman Begich became involved in Alaskan \npolitics and successfully ran for a seat in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Tragedy struck. The whip of the House, Hale Boggs, and he were in \nAlaska campaigning and they were flying to an event. The plane \ndisappeared. They searched, they searched, they searched. After 2 \nmonths, Congressman Boggs, Congressman Begich, and the pilot were \ndeclared dead. Their plane and bodies to this day have not been found. \nThey are hidden someplace in the vastness of Alaska, in one of the \nmountains or the many bodies of water. We don't know.\n  In spite of this heartbreaking loss, the Begich family has pushed on. \nHis mother continued to raise six children alone while managing real \nestate properties and being active in local politics.\n  By the age of 17, Mark had already acquired his mother's business \nacumen, starting his first business, a jewelry venture, and also owning \nand managing real estate. One reason Senator Begich has been a good \nSenator is because of his innate business acumen.\n  At age 26, he was elected to the Anchorage Assembly, which is the \ncity council, a position he held for 10 years. Then in 2003 he was \nelected mayor of Anchorage. He served two terms before running for the \nSenate.\n  Now, 2008 was a dark time for Alaskan politics, but Mark's Senate \nvictory brought a fresh face and new hope to the State. From the time \nhe stepped foot on the Senate floor, he has not let the people of \nAlaska down. He has fought to expand economic opportunity, to defend \nthe rights of Alaska Natives, and to fortify rural Alaska. Senator \nBegich's efforts to reform the Alaskan veterans health care system was \nexemplary, and it is a blueprint for a bipartisan solution that the \nSenate reached this year to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  Senator Begich has made tremendous contributions to the Senate over \nthe past 6 years. I know he will continue to fight for what is best for \nAlaska as he transitions into the next stage of his life. I hope public \nservice is somewhere in Mark's future. Every State needs a man of his \nquality. He will always have his wife Deborah and his son Jacob by his \nside.\n  I can remember the first time I saw Jacob was right behind us by the \nOhio clock. President Obama walked by and that little boy yelled \n``Obama!'' So his little boy loves politics.\n  It has truly been an honor to serve with Senator Begich. I am glad he \nhas been part of our leadership team as head of the steering committee. \nHe has done a remarkable, good job. I thank him again for his service \nto the Senate and certainly to our country.\n\n\n                               MARK UDALL\n\n  Mr. President, the famous English poet William Blake once said, \n``Great things are done when men and mountains meet.'' There could be \nnothing more apt when talking about Mark Udall than when we talk about \nmen and mountains. He knows mountains.\n\n[[Page S6823]]\n\nHe has climbed nine Himalayan peaks. He has climbed Mount McKinley. He \nhas climbed 99 of the highest summits in Colorado, and that is the \nplace where we have the great Rockies. Those are big mountains. He once \nattempted to scale Mount Everest but was stopped by a severe storm. \nSome of us, while we were waiting to finish our work on Saturday, told \nme they were hoping to go skiing on Sunday.\n  I said: Where are you going to go skiing?\n  I don't know the name of the place.\n  How high is that place?\n  Eight hundred feet.\n  In the Sierra Nevada mountains where I am from, and the Rockies, that \nis not a mountain. We have mountains in Colorado and Nevada.\n  Mark Udall once attempted to scale Mount Everest and was nearly there \nwhen one of the most violent storms came. Using good sense, he decided \nthey shouldn't do it, and it was the right thing to do. People die by \nsaying they are stronger than nature. He understands his limitations, \nand his limitations are not very much. Mark is a tremendous athlete. He \ncould do anything athletically. He has the genes of his dad, Morris \nUdall, whom I had the good fortune of serving with in the House of \nRepresentatives. Morris Udall is the only person to have played \nprofessional basketball being blind in one eye, couldn't see, but he \nwas able to adjust his perceptive qualities with a basketball hoop to \nplay professional basketball.\n  We all felt Mark's loss when his brother Randy was found dead. He was \nfound dead in the place he loved more than anyplace else, the Wind \nRiver Mountains in Wyoming. That is where Randy loved to go. That is \nwhere Mark loves to go. People told Randy he shouldn't go alone, but he \nwent alone and it appears maybe he had a heart attack while he was out \nthere. They found him several weeks later in the mountains he loved, \ndead. It was real tough for Mark, who looked up so much to his brother. \nMark, though, has met many mountains and done many great things.\n  He served in the House of Representatives where he was stellar. But \nit is the work in the Senate where his greatest feats have been \naccomplished. In 2013 there were storms in Colorado and there was \ncatastrophic flooding. It was very bad. Lives were lost, homes washed \naway. The people of Colorado needed help, and Mark would not stop. He \nheld up legislation until the people of Colorado got what they \ndeserved. He helped secure nearly $1 billion in Federal assistance for \nthe people of his State, money to rebuild homes, bridges, roads, and \nreestablish lives.\n  While he dedicated himself to protecting the people of Colorado, he \nalso was committed to safeguarding the constitutional rights of all \nAmericans. Who has done more in exposing what has been going on with \nthe invasion of people's privacy? No one has done more than Mark. He \nhas done this in a number of different ways. But as a member of the \nIntelligence Committee, his work sounded the alarm about the National \nSecurity Administration's bulk data collection program. He fought to \nend the CIA's detention and interrogation program, and together with \nSenator Feinstein has pushed to make public the committee's study of \nthe CIA's torture program.\n\n  People have said: Perhaps if Mark had not been so concerned about \nindividual rights, about the bulk data collection, about the torture, \nmaybe he would have been reelected. But that is not Mark Udall. He \ncomes from a family with a long tradition of public service, as I have \nindicated. His uncle Stewart was Secretary of the Interior, after \nhaving served in Congress for many years representing the State of \nArizona, as did his dad Mo Udall. Mo Udall was one of the most \nrecognizable Congressmen in the entire 20th century, having run for \nPresident, and he had a sense of humor that was really quite \nremarkable.\n  Here in the Senate Mark has cousins. It has been interesting. During \nthe last few years, we have had a lot of cousins: Mark, Tom, Mike Lee, \nGordon Smith--all cousins, first cousins. How did that come about? Mark \nwould, as he did just a day or two ago, look and kind of smile and say: \nIt could have been polygamy. And it was. But they are a very, very \nclose family, a very close family.\n  In spite of the closeness of Tom and Mark--two brothers could not be \ncloser than these two men. They climb mountains together. I have talked \nto them about putting on crampons, these spikes you put on your shoes \nto climb the ice. These are adventurers.\n  So we are going to miss Mark. But he has forged his own path and his \nown legacy.\n  Now, as his time in the Senate draws to a close, he will carry that \nlegacy to other endeavors.\n  I wish Mark all the best. It has been such a privilege to serve with \nhim. He will be deeply missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/15/senate-section/article/S6823-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TAX INCREASE PREVENTION ACT OF 2014--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Murthy Nomination\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I rise today to oppose the nomination of Dr. Vivek \nMurthy to be Surgeon General of the United States. The Surgeon General \nis known as America's doctor. Americans have great respect for this \nimportant position. They expect their Surgeon\n\n[[Page S6824]]\n\nGeneral to be someone who has substantial experience in helping \npatients, in helping improve their health, and in helping them reduce \ntheir risk of illness and injury.\n  This important position has been vacant since July of 2013, about a \nyear and a half. It is far too long, and it has been completely \navoidable. We have seen how the Obama administration has struggled in \nresponse to important health issues such as the Ebola crisis. America \nshould have had a Surgeon General in the job to lead in the fight \nagainst Ebola and to take on other serious health challenges as well.\n\n  Dr. Murthy is a smart man who is very well educated. He has an \nundergraduate degree from Harvard, an MBA from Yale, and an M.D. from \nthe Yale School of Medicine. These are impressive academic credentials, \nand I am sure he will be a fine doctor, but they are simply not \nsufficient qualifications for this important job.\n  Is Dr. Murthy a renowned expert in treating patients or researching \ndiseases? No, not at all. Has he actually built a career teaching \nmedicine or leading major public health organizations? No, not yet. In \nfact, Dr. Murthy only completed his residency in 2006--just 8 years \nago. I speak as someone who has actually practiced medicine for 25 \nyears, has been an instructor of surgery at Yale Medical School, which \nDr. Murthy attended, and I saw that being a doctor is about much more \nthan going to school. Doctors learn more and more as they progress \nthrough their careers and spend more time with their patients, \nlistening to patients and the patients' families. Dr. Murthy has not \nhad the time to develop these kinds of skills.\n  So what qualifies him to be Surgeon General of the United States? \nWell, in 2008, just 2 years out of his residency, he founded a group \ncalled Doctors for Obama; the purpose: to elect a President. The \nmajority of his career has been spent not as a doctor treating patients \nbut as an activist--an activist focused on gun control and political \ncampaigns.\n  Even former Surgeon General Richard Carmona has said Dr. Murthy \ndoesn't have the medical experience to serve in such an important \nposition. Let me point out that Dr. Carmona is a Democrat. He wrote an \narticle for the Huffington Post on December 4. It was entitled ``In \nSearch of a Surgeon General.'' I will read a little bit of what he \nwrote. He said:\n\n       We don't appoint doctors early in their career to be a \n     university Dean or Chairman. Graduate business students at \n     the top of their class don't become instant CEOs. Top law \n     graduates of elite law schools don't get nominated to be U.S. \n     Attorney General or a Supreme Court Justice. Why would the \n     U.S. Surgeon General be any different?\n\n  He concludes by asking:\n\n       Is the health, safety, and security of the Nation any less \n     important?\n\n  Is the health, safety, and security of the Nation any less important? \nWell, no, the health, safety, and security of the Nation are not less \nimportant, and the job of Surgeon General is not less important.\n  Americans want the same thing from a Surgeon General as they want \nfrom their own doctors. People want honest and straightforward advice \nabout medical dangers, such as cancer, heart attacks, and stroke. They \ndon't want an inexperienced, unqualified political appointee. Patients \ndon't want a doctor who might let political ideology get in the way of \ntreatment and their best interest. Americans don't want a Surgeon \nGeneral who might use this position of trust to promote his own \npersonal campaign against the Second Amendment of the Constitution.\n  This is just another example of President Obama giving someone an \nimportant job based solely on their support of the President's \npolitical career--just like his nomination of a soap opera producer to \nbe Ambassador to Hungary or the President's nomination of a man to be \nAmbassador to Norway when the person didn't know the first thing about \nthe country. Of course, both those nominations to be Ambassadors had \nfunneled hundreds of thousands of dollars to the President's campaigns. \nWell, those nominations were embarrassing, and so is this nomination to \nbe Surgeon General.\n  This office of Surgeon General is not just an honorary title. It is \nnot just a figurehead position. The Surgeon General commands the entire \nCommissioned Corps of the uniformed public health officers. There are \n6,700 people whom the Surgeon General commands. It is one of the key \npositions leading America's public health efforts.\n  America has a long history of qualified and talented people filling \nthis job. When President Bill Clinton nominated David Satcher in 1998, \nDr. Satcher had already served as president of a medical school and as \nDirector of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. C. Everett \nKoop spent 35 years as a leading world-renowned pediatric surgeon. They \nwere substantial candidates who brought serious experience to the job. \nThe responsibilities of being America's Surgeon General require a \nstrong, professional leader, and the American people deserve a \nqualified nominee. There is a long list of capable doctors who could \nmeet those requirements. The President should pick one of them.\n  Over the years, we have seen that when the President has nominated \nqualified people for this position, the Senate has approved their \nnominations on overwhelmingly bipartisan votes. When President Obama \nnominated Regina Benjamin to be Surgeon General, she was confirmed \nunanimously, as was Richard Carmona when President Bush nominated him. \nToday, even Democrats have objected to the nomination of Dr. Murthy.\n  So why are we wasting the Senate's time talking about this now? Well, \nif President Obama thinks Dr. Murthy is qualified, why haven't we \nalready voted on him? He was nominated more than a year ago--more than \na year ago. We had the Ebola crisis and no Surgeon General. He was \nnominated more than a year ago. His confirmation hearing in the \ncommittee was last February. The majority leader could have brought \nthis up for a vote at any time in the past 9 months, but he didn't do \nit. Why? Because he knew this nominee--this unqualified, partisan \nnominee--didn't have the votes. He could not get the votes on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle. The nomination would have been an \nembarrassment before the election.\n  Now is not the right time for this nomination, and this is not the \nright job for Dr. Murthy. The Ebola problem and the other health crises \nfacing our Nation are enormous challenges that require skills and \ntalents that this nominee has simply not had time to develop and which \nhe has so far not demonstrated in his career.\n  I wish to close by quoting from a letter former Surgeon General \nCarmona sent to all of the Members of the Senate earlier this month. He \nsent it to each and every one of us. I ask unanimous consent that the \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 December 1, 2014.\n       Dear Senator, I am writing to express my concern over the \n     present nominee for U.S. Surgeon General whose name may be \n     submitted to you for confirmation during the remaining Senate \n     session. The U.S. Surgeon General is the doctor of the nation \n     and the commander of the U.S. Public Health Service \n     Commissioned Corp, one of the seven uniformed services of the \n     United States. The nominee, Dr. Vivek Murthy is a physician \n     very early in his career with great promise but no formal \n     public health education, training, leadership or management \n     experience.\n       However, he was the founder of Doctors for Obama, a \n     partisan organization supporting the election and policies of \n     President Obama. His partisanship and lack of qualifications \n     for the job of Surgeon General give this nomination the scent \n     of political patronage. In addition, the position of Surgeon \n     General is a uniformed services position with the rank of \n     Vice Admiral. The nominee has no uniformed service \n     experience, does not merit this rank and his confirmation \n     would undermine the credibility and authenticity of the \n     Office of the Surgeon General while demeaning the selfless \n     service of qualified career uniformed officers who merit \n     consideration.\n       The public we have the privilege to serve deserves and \n     expects a Surgeon General who, through extensive education, \n     experience, training and service, merits the position of \n     Surgeon General of the United States.\n       For these reasons, I respectfully request that if this \n     nomination comes before you that you reject it in favor of a \n     qualified career USPHSCC officer who merits your \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Richard H. Carmona,\n                                               M.D., M.P.H., FACS.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Dr. Carmona writes:\n\n       His partisanship and lack of qualifications for the job of \n     Surgeon General gives this nomination the scent of political \n     patronage.\n\n  That is from a Democrat who actually served as Surgeon General and \nknows what it takes to do the job well.\n\n[[Page S6825]]\n\n  Dr. Carmona added in his letter to all of the Members of the Senate:\n\n       His confirmation would undermine the credibility and \n     authenticity of the Office of Surgeon General, while \n     demeaning the selfless service of qualified career uniformed \n     officers who merit consideration.\n\n  That is whom the President of the United States has chosen to \nnominate--someone who would undermine the credibility and authenticity \nof the Office of Surgeon General, while demeaning the selfless service \nof qualified career uniformed officers who merit consideration.\n  Americans deserve a Surgeon General who has substantial experience in \nmanaging complex crises and delivering patient care. The American \npeople deserve a Surgeon General who has proven throughout his or her \ncareer that their main focus is a commitment to patients, not a \ncommitment to politics.\n  Dr. Murthy has time to learn, time to gain experience, and that may \nmake him a fine Surgeon General someday, but that day is not today. I \ncall on the Senate to defeat the nomination of Dr. Murthy for Surgeon \nGeneral of the United States.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I see my friend from Wyoming, who spoke \non the floor earlier and is in the Chamber, and I wish to publicly \nacknowledge--and I hope he will too--that we are friends, but we \ndisagree on the nomination of Dr. Murthy to be the next Surgeon \nGeneral. I will speak for a few moments about why I support him, and I \nhope a majority of Members will join me in supporting his nomination.\n  This is an indication of what can go wrong in the Senate. We received \nthis nomination from the President of the United States to fill the \npost of Surgeon General, which was reported from the committee in \nFebruary of this year. Obviously we are in December. It has been \nsitting here since February. In fact, the post of Surgeon General has \nbeen vacant since July of 2013.\n  The Surgeon General is supposed to be one of the leaders in America \nspeaking to issues on public health. Can anyone think of a public \nhealth issue we have had to face since February when Dr. Murthy was \nreported to the floor of the Senate? Perhaps one of the deadliest \ndiseases that has ever been recorded is being fought in west Africa, \nand we are being asked on a regular basis how we will respond in the \nUnited States. The Centers for Disease Control plays a major role in it \nbut, historically, Surgeons General have played a major role when we \nfaced similar public health challenges.\n\n  I can remember coming to the U.S. House of Representatives years ago \nwhen President Reagan had been elected, and he had chosen C. Everett \nKoop to be his Surgeon General. C. Everett Koop was a controversial \nchoice by President Reagan because he had been outspoken on some major \npolitical issues. He personally had strong feelings against abortion \nand had said as much before his nomination, and some other issues. It \nled many people to believe he was too political for the job and that \nPresident Reagan had made the wrong choice. But Koop was chosen. \nDespite the fact that he had been at least engaged as a medical doctor \nin discussing political issues, he was chosen. I wasn't in the Senate \nat the time; I didn't have a vote when it came to his choice, but I \nwill tell my colleagues this: When Dr. Koop took over as Surgeon \nGeneral, he made it clear he understood his obligation was to be the \nNation's doctor, not the Nation's leading medical politician. He did \nsome extraordinary things. I don't know what America would have been \nlike if it were not for Dr. Koop's presence, pushing back on a lot of \npolitical spin when it came to public health issues--issues involving \nAIDS, for example.\n  It is no secret--it is well known--that many politicians--in both \nparties, for that matter--were reluctant to go into the whole issue of \nthe AIDS crisis in America for a variety of reasons. But if my \ncolleagues will remember, history shows that under Dr. Koop, we ended \nup mailing every household in America to let them know about the danger \nof the AIDS epidemic. That was an extraordinary act of public \nleadership when it came to public health, and Dr. Koop was Surgeon \nGeneral when that occurred. So those who worried that C. Everett Koop \nwas too political for the job were disabused of that notion as we \nwatched his service to our country.\n  I make that point because I don't want the same mistake to be made in \ncriticizing Dr. Vivek Murthy whom we are going to vote on later today \nto be our next Surgeon General. It is true that he has engaged in \npolitical activity, as any American citizen is entitled to. I hope that \nwill not disqualify him. When I read in a few moments the groups that \nare supporting him, people will understand he isn't in this position of \nbeing nominated simply because of his political activity. He has \nextraordinary backing of individuals in the medical profession.\n  Now we need him more than ever. We need to fill the post of Surgeon \nGeneral of the United States of America. We hope we can see an end to \nthe Ebola epidemic, but we are not quite there. But we ought to have a \nSurgeon General in the United States of America. To think we have \nwaited since February while this doctor's name has been on our \ncalendar, and we had to use some extraordinary parliamentary moves to \neven bring his name up for a vote. I think it is time for us to vote \nand it is time for us to confirm the nomination of Vivek Murthy as our \nnext Surgeon General.\n  This past year, Americans have battled public health crises on all \nfronts. Here at home, parents watched while a severe strain of \nenterovirus spread from State to State, threatening young children. My \nhome State of Illinois was one of the hardest hit. I heard from doctors \nacross the State that the minute they discharged one child with \nrespiratory symptoms from the emergency room, another came in.\n  Abroad, we still face the worst Ebola epidemic in history. With over \n6,300 deaths and many more diagnosed with this devastating disease, now \nmore than ever America needs to fill the spot of top doctor. It has \nbeen vacant since July--since July of last year. Dr. Murthy is that \ndoctor, and I am proud to vote for him as the next U.S. Surgeon \nGeneral. I am hoping my colleagues will join me.\n  Let me tell my colleagues a little bit about his background. Dr. \nMurthy is an attending physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital and an \ninstructor at the Harvard Medical School. Part of what is extraordinary \nabout him is that as well as treating his patients individually, he \nalso thinks about the systemic issues affecting the health of patients \nand tackles those as well. He is a leading voice in public health, \npublishing his research on the participation of women and minorities in \ncancer clinical trials and top journals, including Science, Journal of \nthe American Medical Association, and Journal of the National Cancer \nInstitute.\n  Critics of Dr. Murthy who say he is not up to the job should look at \nthe literature. He has published in medical research areas of great \nimportance. He also cofounded and chairs the Trial Networks, a software \ncompany that helps clinical researchers collaborate more effectively \nand efficiently with drug developers to speed up drug discovery.\n  In 2011, Dr. Murthy was appointed to the Advisory Group on \nPrevention, Health Promotion, and Integrative and Public Health. Over \n100 national, State, and local public health organizations have \nendorsed his nomination. They describe him as ``a well-qualified, \nforward-thinking, innovative leader with a strong commitment to public \nhealth.''\n  Does that sound like a political hack when 100 organizations say that \nabout this doctor?\n  The organizations that support Dr. Murthy include the American \nCollege of Physicians, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, the American Public Health Association, \nthe American Hospital Association, the American Cancer Society, the \nAmerican Heart Association, the American Diabetes Association, and the \nlist goes on from there.\n\n[[Page S6826]]\n\n  In his confirmation hearing before the Senate HELP Committee last \nFebruary, Dr. Murthy stated that, if confirmed, he would prioritize his \nefforts on obesity and tobacco-related disease and ``make prevention \nand health promotion the backbone of our communities.''\n  This is a priority I share with Dr. Murthy. For the past 30 years, \nserving in the House and Senate, I have worked on the issue of tobacco \nand public policy. I have worked to reduce youth smoking, implement \nprograms to help people quit, and rein in the most insidious practices \nof the tobacco industry. Moreover, as a cochair of the Senate Hunger \nCaucus, I have become familiar with the complex and arguably unjust way \nfood is distributed and consumed in America, leaving communities--\nincluding many in Illinois--simultaneously facing high levels of food \ninsecurity and high rates of obesity.\n  Obesity and tobacco-related diseases are part of a growing trend of \nchronic disease that account for 7 out of the top 10 causes of death in \nAmerica and make up 84 percent of America's health care costs. Dr. \nMurthy says these are his priorities. They should be. These statistics \nare unacceptable.\n  I believe Dr. Murthy understands the importance of the national \ncrises before him. I feel confident that his experience, his training, \nand his tenacity have proved that he has the qualifications needed to \ntackle these issues.\n  Not only is Dr. Murthy an outstanding doctor and public health \nexpert, he also remains closely connected to his community and family.\n  Dr. Murthy was born to parents who originally were from the southern \npart of India. He came to the United States at the age of 3 and grew up \nin Miami, FL. He did very well in school. He was valedictorian of his \nhigh school, graduated magna cum laude from Harvard in just 3 years, \nand then got a combined medical and business degree from Yale.\n  So Senators come to the floor and question this man's resume, his \nability? For goodness sakes. He has an extraordinary background and \nthat is why the President nominated him.\n  From a very early age, Dr. Murthy did not set out to make money, he \nset out to make a difference. In 1995 he cofounded Visions Worldwide, a \nnonprofit organization that conducts and supports HIV/AIDS education \nand empowerment programs in India. Until 2003, he served as the \npresident of that organization and then board chair. He is a dedicated \nuncle and friend, consistently described by those who know him as \nhumble, soft-spoken, and tireless. I know the Indian-American community \nacross this Nation is so proud of Dr. Murthy's accomplishments, as all \nof us should be.\n  Many years ago I worked for a State Senator in Illinois named Cecil \nPartee. Cecil Partee used to say, For every political controversy, when \nyou listen to the arguments, understand there is a good reason and a \nreal reason.\n  What is the real reason for the opposition to Dr. Murthy? It may have \ncome down to just one thing he said. It was alluded to by the Senator \nfrom Wyoming earlier. In an online post, he said he believed gun \nviolence was a public health issue. Gun violence, a public health \nissue. For making that statement, he has been pilloried and excoriated \nby the gun lobby, and that may be a major reason why his nomination is \ncontroversial.\n  I am proud to represent the city of Chicago and the State of \nIllinois. Gun violence is a public health problem. Go into the \nemergency rooms--and I can give the names of the list of hospitals in \nChicago to start with. Go to the emergency room on Friday or Saturday \nnight and you tell me that gun violence isn't a public health issue. In \nthose emergency rooms we see the victims of gun violence, many of them \nfighting for their lives. If we go to Mount Sinai Hospital in the \nEnglewood section of Chicago, we can look across the street to a rehab \ninstitute. Those who have survived gun violence at Mount Sinai go \nacross the street to the Schwab Rehabilitation Hospital and learn how \nto live a life as a paraplegic or a quadriplegic. Does that have \nanything to do with public health? It certainly does. Gun violence is a \npublic health issue, no apology necessary.\n  I think Dr. Murthy, as has Dr. Koop, has made it clear they are not \naspiring to be the leading doctor in America to engage in a political \ndebate, but rather to engage in public health debates about obesity and \ntobacco and things that make a dramatic difference to the lives of so \nmany people who live in this country.\n  I am supporting Dr. Murthy. I think he will be an extraordinary \nSurgeon General. I am sorry he and America have had to wait so long for \nthis vote. I hope the majority of my colleagues will step up and \nsupport his nomination as well. At this time of challenge when it comes \nto public health issues, we need his leadership. We need his expertise. \nWe need a person of this quality as Surgeon General of the United \nStates.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Tribute to Kay Hagan\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, North Carolina's official motto is a Latin \nphrase which means, simply translated, ``To be, rather than to seem.'' \n``To be, rather than to seem'' means don't talk about being a hard \nworker--be a hard worker. Don't just pretend to be honest--be honest. \nIf you talk about being sincere, be genuine about it. Senator Kay \nHagan, a native of Shelby, NC, embodies her State's motto. She is as \ngenuine and honest as anyone could be. It is no wonder that in 2008, \nwhen the country was seeking change, the people of North Carolina \nelected Kay Hagan to the Senate. From the moment she arrived, she got \nto work. The very first piece of legislation she cosponsored was the \nLilly Ledbetter Act. Having worked as a corporate executive, Kay is \naware of the difficulties working women face. This legislation was \npersonal to Kay, and she saw it through until completion. The daughter \nof a veteran, Kay spent her time in the Senate creating sound policies \nto protect and benefit members of the U.S. armed services and their \nfamilies. She has done this by virtue of her position, not only as a \nSenator but on that important Armed Services Committee.\n  As a former executive of North Carolina National Bank, Kay knows all \nof the challenges facing businesses in her State and how women have a \nlittle different view of how difficult it is to work their way through \nthe corporate world. She has fought tirelessly to create a better \nclimate for small businesses to create jobs and grow. On any given \nissue, at any given time, Kay Hagan has advocated her position and has \ndone it well. She refused to give up until meaningful solutions were \ndiscovered.\n  While I am sure Senator Hagan will take some well-deserved time off \nto think about her future, I am convinced that her service on behalf of \nthe people of North Carolina and the American people is not going to \nend.\n  Senator Hagan has a lovely family. We all like Chip very much. He is \na Navy Vietnam veteran. She has three children--Tilden, Jeanette, and \nCarrie. I wish her family the very best as they transition into a new \nchapter of their lives.\n  On a personal basis, no one has impressed me more as being a hard \nworker. We are so disappointed that she is now going to have to find \ndifferent public service. I have no inside information, but she could \nbe back in this body. I have no doubt the people of North Carolina are \ngoing to miss her dearly.\n  I applaud Kay Hagan for serving the American people with conviction, \nand I look forward to the great things she will accomplish for North \nCarolina and our country in the future.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President,\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6827]]\n\n             National Women's History Museum Commission Act\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, last week the Senate passed the \nNational Women's History Museum Commission Act, a bill that I authored \nwith the dean of the Democratic women Senators, Senator Mikulski of \nMaryland. It passed finally as part of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  Our legislation will create a commission to evaluate and plan the \nestablishment of a museum dedicated to women's history right here in \nour Nation's Capital. I know the Presiding Officer shares my view that \nthis is long overdue.\n  I am in fact pleased to have had all of the women Senators as \ncosponsors of this bill, and I am thankful for the support of many of \nour other colleagues as well. Senator Mikulski has been a terrific co-\nleader, and I thank her for her leadership.\n  A women's history museum is long overdue in Washington, DC. Think of \nit. We actually have a museum dedicated to honoring buildings. We have \nmuseums along the mall that commemorate various aspects of our history. \nWe have the Air and Space Museum. There is a privately run Spy Museum. \nThere is the Newseum, which honors journalism. There is a museum that \nhonors Native Americans. Americans from all over this country can come \nto Washington and learn about our history and the contributions of the \npeople who have made our Nation the greatest country in the world. \nDespite the plethora of museums, however, there has been no museum \ndedicated to the women who have helped to shape our Nation's history.\n  The legislation that was finally approved last week calls for a \ncommission to fund its own costs, and it would be paid for entirely \nwith private funds at no cost to American taxpayers.\n  This commission would put forth a plan for establishing a museum on \nwomen's history so that people who are coming to Washington can learn \nabout the enormous contributions of women to our Nation's history.\n  Indeed, American women have made invaluable contributions to our \ncountry across such diverse fields as government, business, medicine, \nlaw, literature, sports, entertainment, the arts, and the military. A \nmuseum dedicated to women's history will help ensure that future \ngenerations understand what it is we owe to the many American women who \nhave helped to build, sustain, and advance our society.\n  Such a museum will share the stories of pioneering women such as \nabolitionist Harriet Tubman, the founder of the Girl Scouts, Juliette \nGordon Low, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, astronaut Sally \nRide, and my personal inspiration, Maine Senator Margaret Chase Smith.\n  I first introduced legislation to establish a museum for women's \nhistory in 2003. Early the following year, the Senate unanimously \napproved my bill. Unfortunately, that legislation was not taken up by \nthe House and died.\n  In 2005, the Senate again approved the legislation, but it too \nstalled in the House. With the passage finally of this commission bill, \nthe effort to establish a museum for women's history in our Nation's \nCapital takes a positive step forward.\n  This bill will convene a talented, diverse, and skilled panel of \nhistorians, educators, museum administrators, and other experts with \nexperience in women's history to make recommendations for the creation \nand the sustainment of such a museum.\n  It is important to emphasize that this museum will portray all \naspects of women's contributions to our history, without partisanship \nor bias. The only political statement we will be making is to correct \nthe longstanding omission of the role of women in America's history.\n  I also recognize and thank Chairwoman Landrieu and Ranking Member \nMurkowski for their careful consideration of our bill by the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, which unanimously approved it last month.\n  Telling the history of the contributions of American women matters, \nand this bill takes a long overdue first step toward recognizing and \nhonoring those who have shaped our shared American heritage. I look \nforward to the day when young girls and young boys visiting Washington \nwill be able to visit a women's history museum to learn more about the \nremarkable contributions of American women to our Nation.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Saxby Chambliss\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, it is a great pleasure but a \nbittersweet moment for me to rise on the Senate floor to pay tribute to \na dear friend and an esteemed colleague, Senator Saxby Chambliss.\n  After 20 years in Congress--8 in the House and 12 here in the \nSenate--Senator Chambliss retires from this phase of service to Georgia \nand to our Nation with a well-deserved reputation as a true statesman.\n  At a time when the coarsening political discourse across our Nation \nand here in Congress is a growing concern, Senator Chambliss is a \nshining example of expertise and ability combined with civility and \nrespect. He leaves Congress not only with many friends on both sides of \nthe aisle, but also with many accomplishments to his credit.\n  His leadership in national security and intelligence in both Chambers \nhas been a great asset to our Nation. From agriculture to armed \nservices, Senator Chambliss has been an informed and effective advocate \nfor his constituents and for the American people.\n  The golfers here might consider the hole-in-one he famously scored in \na foursome with President Obama last year to be worthy of mention. \nPersonally, as the founder and cochair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I \nwould consider his dedication to the cause of juvenile diabetes to be a \ntrue highlight.\n  I have also had the great pleasure of serving with Senator Chambliss \nboth on the Intelligence Committee, where he is the vice chairman, and \npreviously on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I saw firsthand his \nextraordinary grasp of complicated issues that are so critical to the \nsecurity of our Nation. I also witnessed how he would listen carefully \nto the views of others, whether on the Republican side of the aisle or \nfrom the Democratic Members on both committees.\n  But if there is one shining moment that stands out for me, it would \nbe Senator Chambliss's leadership in the Gang of 6 during the 2011 debt \nceiling crisis. At a time when it was far easier to stand back, point \nfingers, and fix blame, Senator Chambliss, along with Senator Mark \nWarner, led the way in producing a framework to provide a bipartisan, \ncomprehensive, and balanced way to put our Nation on a stable fiscal \npath. The fact that our national debt has grown from $16 trillion to \n$18 trillion since then makes it all the more imperative that we \ncontinue the effort, with the leadership that was shown by Senator \nChambliss and that he so courageously helped to start.\n  The fact that this dedicated and wise leader cited Washington \ngridlock and partisan posturing as the driving force in his decision to \nretire from the Senate should give us all cause to reflect.\n  Senator Saxby Chambliss has always been a voice of reason. No matter \nhow bitter the debate, he has always engaged in thoughtful discussions \nthat result in solutions. As he returns to private life, his advice \nwill continue to be sought after and I hope heeded. His knowledge and \ninsight will still be valued, and the example of decency and civility \nhe has set should guide us all. I know his beloved wife, his children, \nand his grandchildren will be happy to have more of Senator Chambliss's \ntime, but for those of us who have been privileged to serve with him in \nthe Senate, his decision to retire is a great loss.\n  The people of Georgia, the people of America, and those of us who \nhave been privileged to serve as Saxby Chambliss's colleagues are \ngrateful for his service. I wish him all the best in the years to come, \nboth on and off the golf course.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6828]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Tributes To Departing Senators\n\n                             MARY LANDRIEU\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, a noted author and analyst of human \nbehavior, Stephen Covey, said, ``Strength lies in differences, not in \nsimilarities.''\n  For the last 18 years, Senate Democrats were stronger because of \nSenator Mary Landrieu. Her ability to shun political labels--instead of \njust going the route with Democrats and Republicans and Independents, \nshe went her route. She made the United States a better place. She made \nthe Senate a better place.\n  She had good training for being a consensus builder and somebody who \nliked compromise. I had the good fortune to serve in the Senate with \nother Louisiana Senators. I served with Bennett Johnston for many years \non the Appropriations Committee. He was chairman of the Energy and \nWater Subcommittee on Appropriations. He was a good legislator. Not \nonly did he help Louisiana a lot, he helped the country. And then there \nwas John Breaux. He and I came to the Senate together. He was the \ndealmaker. He could put a deal together when no one thought one could \nbe put together. So Mary Landrieu has had good Louisiana genes with \nthose two men, and that is one of the reasons she has been as effective \nas she has been.\n  As I indicated, Mary came to the Senate with no partisan agenda. She \nwas not interested in representing just liberals or just conservatives. \nShe worked to represent all of Louisiana, which meant that sometimes \nshe and I were not on the same side of an issue, and other times we \nwere on the same side of an issue, but one thing was always certain: \nShe was always on Louisiana's side.\n  The Landrieu family's political legacy runs long and deep in the \nState of Louisiana. She is the oldest of nine children. She is the \ndaughter of Moon Landrieu, and her brother Mitch Landrieu is the mayor \nof New Orleans. Moon was a former mayor of New Orleans from 1970 to \n1978, and was Jimmy Carter's Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment.\n  A number of years ago, I toured New Orleans because she asked me to, \nas a member of the Appropriations Committee. I said, OK, I will go, but \nI have to see those pumps--p-u-m-p-s. I watched this show on national \npublic broadcasting, and they talked about these old pumps that had \nbeen there since 1900 that still worked every day pumping the water.\n  New Orleans is below sea level and those pumps have to work 24 hours \na day. I went to see those old, old pumps. They were so clean. That \nplace was spotlessly clean using those very old pumps.\n  I toured Lake Pontchartrain. I learned so much about it. Most all of \nthe highways in New Orleans were built using the seashells from that \nlake. Thousands and thousands of tons of shells have come out of that \nlake. They recently stopped doing that, after so many years, because \nthey thought it would be damaging to the environment. But over the last \n50, 60, 100 years, thousands and thousands of tons of shells came out \nof that lake. We all heard about Lake Pontchartrain during that huge \nstorm that hit.\n  Also, as part of the tour of New Orleans, you had to go to her home, \nthat little home where nine children were raised. It is really a \nbeautiful little home--but nine children, wow. Her mom and dad were \nthere. That was the first time I had been able to meet the famous Moon \nLandrieu.\n  When we came there, unannounced, he was making peanut brittle, and I \ngot some peanut brittle. On occasion, that good man has sent me some of \nhis homemade peanut brittle. So I think the world of Mary and her \nfamily.\n  She was very quick to follow in her father's footsteps. At the age of \n23, she was elected to the State legislature, making her the youngest \nwoman to have ever been elected to that body.\n  After 8 years in the legislature, she became the State treasurer for \n8 years. In 1996, she was elected to the Senate, becoming the first \nwoman in Louisiana ever elected to a full Senate term.\n  Since coming to the Senate, Mary has chaired the Senate committee on \nsmall business, and she was really good there. She is now the chair of \nthe Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the same full \ncommittee her predecessor Bennett Johnson chaired.\n  On the committee on small business, she reduced heavy Federal \nregulations and created tax relief for small businesses. As chair of \nthe Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Mary Landrieu \nfought for Louisiana's industry and jobs. Even before she became chair \nof that committee, she did something that was impossible. People had \nbeen trying to do something like this in Louisiana for 50, 60 years, 70 \nyears, 80 years, but she did it--she was able to get New Orleans and \nthe whole State of Louisiana and the gulf coast some financial benefit \nfrom the offshore drilling. She did that. That is a legacy she will \nalways have.\n  She always had Louisiana's interests at heart, and the people of \nLouisiana have been all the better because of it. For example, in the \naftermath of Katrina, she stood up to the Bush administration and \ndemanded more disaster relief for the people in Louisiana. The New York \nTimes called her ``the national spokeswoman for victims of the \nhurricane.''\n  As her time in the Senate comes to an end, all Louisianans will miss \nhaving Mary in their corner. I wish Mary Landrieu and her husband Frank \nand their children Connor--who was recently married--and Mary Shannon \nthe very best.\n  I remember when Mary brought that little baby Mary Shannon to the \nSenate. She was a tiny little baby. Now this beautiful child has grown \nto be an expert horsewoman. She is one of those people who rides horses \nall the time. She has entered her horses in different contests and has \ndone very well.\n  I have known Connor since he was a little boy. He is married, and \nthey have a little baby named Maddox, and Mary is so proud of her \ngrandchild. Her husband Frank is a wonderful human being. I think so \nvery much of him. I hope we will continue seeing them. Very often Mary \nwill bring her family to my office. She takes them out on the balcony \nthat overlooks the Mall.\n  Mary has touched my heart for a number of things, but the one thing \nshe has done, which has been unsurpassed, is her caring for children \nwho have no parents--adoptions. She led the Senate in adoptions. Her \ntwo children were adopted. Connor and Mary Shannon were adopted. She is \nso involved in that program, and I know she will continue to be \ninvolved.\n  Here on the Senate floor we will all miss Mary, her voice of reason \nand moderation. I consider her to be a good friend, and I appreciate \nall she has done for me, the people of Louisiana, and our country.\n\n\n                               John Walsh\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there is only one combat veteran of the \nIraq war in the Senate, and that is GEN John Walsh--Senator John Walsh.\n  In 2004 General Walsh led the deployment of several hundred National \nGuard men from Montana to Iraq. He did the same thing a year later. It \nwas a very difficult time for Americans in Iraq. General Walsh's men \nwere in some of the heaviest battles. Many of them were wounded, and a \nnumber of them gave the ultimate sacrifice.\n  He led the largest deployment of Montana soldiers and airmen since \nWorld War II. For his service, John was awarded the Bronze Star, the \nLegion of Merit Award, and the Combat Infantry Badge. John came to the \nSenate a hero, and he will leave the Senate a hero.\n  He treated his time in the Senate like his time in the Army--he \nvolunteered for the most difficult assignments here in the Senate. For \nexample, Saturday night it was late--we thought we may have to be in \nhere all night--and he volunteered to be here all night, not having to \nbe relieved. He agreed to be here all night. He said: That is what I am \nhere for.\n  He served the people of Montana admirably in the Senate. I thank him \nfor his service over the past year.\n  I thank his family--his wife Janet, his sons Michael and Taylor, and \ngranddaughter Kennedy--for their sacrifice in supporting his work here \nin Washington, DC.\n  I wish him the very best. He was the lieutenant governor of Montana, \na job I held in the past, and we talked about that.\n\n[[Page S6829]]\n\n  I don't know what the next chapter in his life will be, but knowing \nthe courage and integrity of John Walsh, it will be an important \nchapter.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, my friend Senator Thune and I are on the \nfloor this afternoon to speak together about the Internet Tax Freedom \nAct. Before that, I wish to spend a few minutes discussing Senator \nRockefeller and his extraordinary accomplishments. I know that Senator \nThune, after he and I have spoken about the Internet Tax Freedom Act, \nwill make some additional remarks. I commend the work of Senator Thune \non charitable contributions. He and I have led the effort to protect \ncharitable donations. Neither of us consider charity efforts as some \nkind of tax loophole. We consider them a lifeline for the American \npeople.\n  So I look forward to the remarks of the Senator from South Dakota on \nseveral issues.\n\n\n                       Tribute To Jay Rockefeller\n\n  With respect to Senator Rockefeller, one of the challenges right now \nfor some of us is to get our arms around the idea that Senator \nRockefeller will no longer be serving in the Senate. This is a \nchallenge for me especially because I remember watching Senator \nRockefeller's work years before I had entered public life.\n  Right after I got out of law school, we started the Oregon Gray \nPanthers. I had a full head of hair and rugged good looks. We were \npassing around petitions for the wonderful work Senator Rockefeller was \ndoing on behalf of the elderly. He was in the vanguard even then in the \nhealth care field. I know the Presiding Officer from the State of \nWisconsin has been very interested in this--in ensuring that there are \nmore options for older people, particularly in the long-term care \nsetting.\n  We were passing petitions around--the Gray Panthers back in those \ndays--urging that Americans and the Senate all rally to Senator \nRockefeller's work to ensure that there were more alternatives to \nnursing home care. It was just the beginning of the effort to create \nmore options for home care for seniors. Now it is an idea we pretty \nmuch accept as gospel. But Senator Rockefeller, as has been the case, \nwas way ahead of his time. That is really the time when I began to \nreally be a charter member of what I guess I will call the Rockefeller \ngrassroots delegation that was sweeping the country for health care \nreform.\n  As the Presiding Officer and our colleagues know, Senator \nRockefeller's accomplishments in a number of fields have been \nexceptional. They span a host of issues, from cyber security to \nreducing violence on television to improving our transportation system \nand, of course, we have all seen his leadership in reining in some of \nthe excesses of the CIA. He is a very strong supporter of the rank and \nfile--the thousands of individuals who work in the intelligence field \nwho are as patriotic as it is possible to be and do wonderful work to \nprotect our people. Senator Rockefeller has said that as they do that \nwork, they are stronger when there is vigorous congressional oversight, \nand we are very grateful for his work. I have sat next to him on the \nIntelligence Committee for many years and have watched his leadership \nthere.\n  Today, though, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I wish to \nfocus in particular on Senator Rockefeller's work on that committee. I \nwill start by noting that his service on the Finance Committee is \nreally a family legacy. His great grandfather, Nelson Aldrich, the \nSenator from Rhode Island, not only served on the Finance Committee but \nis often described as one of the committee's most distinguished chairs. \nOn the committee Senator Rockefeller has exercised similar influence.\n\n  Jay Rockefeller has served on the Senate Finance Committee for 28 \nyears--longer than all but 11 other Senators--and his tireless work on \nthe committee has had a profound and positive impact. He has been a \nleader on maintaining a strong U.S. trade policy, while thinking \ncreatively about Asia long before it became cool. He also has been a \ngreat advocate for fairness in the tax system--something I know many of \nus consider a special priority at this time.\n  Senator Rockefeller has paid special attention to programs such as \nthe Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, including the health coverage \ntax credit, the earned-income tax credit, and the child tax credit. \nThat was drawn from recommendations of the National Commission on \nChildren which Senator Rockefeller, as is the case so often, ably \nchaired.\n  So I wish to speak about the common denominator in these kinds of \nefforts. It is really pretty direct because it captures Jay \nRockefeller's approach to public service and to life: Reach out to \nthose who don't have power and clout, those who don't have a lot of \npolitical influence and political action committees, and lend a hand. \nMake the difference. Particularly for millions of Americans to whom Jay \nRockefeller gave voice, now they have an opportunity--millions of men, \nwomen, and children--to enjoy better lives and a more secure future \nbecause of Jay Rockefeller's strong moral compass.\n  Now, as I touched on at the beginning of my comments, my first \nexperience in watching Jay Rockefeller--I am of the view that health \ncare is the area where Senator Rockefeller's legacy is going to be \nespecially important. In a sense, Jay Rockefeller always captured the \nnotion that if you and your loved ones don't have their health, it is \npretty hard to do anything else. In other words, if you aren't feeling \nwell, if you are facing a chronic illness, how do you jump up and enjoy \nthe wonderful outdoors of Oregon, Wisconsin, and West Virginia? So Jay \nRockefeller always said that health care was a special priority for \nhim, and we see it in a whole host of accomplishments.\n  Jay Rockefeller has been a leader in the fight against Alzheimer's \nand other neurological conditions. He was a powerful and persistent \nvoice, particularly in advocating for low-income Americans in the \nAffordable Care Act. I am especially pleased to note that Senator \nRockefeller, along with my colleague and partner on the Finance \nCommittee Senator Hatch, really played the key role in creating the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. This is a program I hope not only \nwill be extended but also strengthened in the next Congress. As many \nMembers of this body know, Jay Rockefeller's work to protect and expand \nMedicaid is without equal.\n  Over the past half century, we can count on one hand the Senators who \nhave done an extraordinary amount to improve the health care of \nAmerica, and when we look at that handful of Senators, Jay Rockefeller \nis right at the top.\n  I started with a personal comment about Jay Rockefeller, and I wish \nto end with one. When Chairman Baucus chose to take the Ambassador \nposition in China, where he is doing a fine job, Jay Rockefeller was \nnext in line to replace Chairman Baucus. Make no mistake about it, Jay \nRockefeller would have been an outstanding chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee. But his decision to decline that opportunity and to \ncontinue his work on the Senate commerce committee allowed me to accept \nthe position as the chairman of the Finance Committee and the \nresponsibility that has gone along with it. That kind of approach was \nreally characteristic of Jay Rockefeller--not wanting to push himself \nout front. As I have indicated, I told him I think he would have been a \nsuperb chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. But I wish to note on \nthe personal side, as I started on the personal side, my thanks to Jay \nRockefeller.\n  So I close simply by saying that now, as the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee and in the years ahead, my goal--when we take up issues such \nas health care, tax fairness, and a trade policy that lets us tap \nglobal markets but works for the middle class worker--and I think it is \nthe goal of other members of the Senate Finance Committee--it is our \ngoal in the days ahead\n\n[[Page S6830]]\n\nto live up to the high standard that Senator Jay Rockefeller has set.\n  With that, I yield the floor on my remarks about Senator Rockefeller.\n\n\n                        Internet Tax Freedom Act\n\n  Now, for a few minutes, Senator Thune and I are going to talk about \nthe Internet Tax Freedom Act and our involvement in it. The story about \nthe Internet Tax Freedom Act really starts in the 1990s. This was a \nperiod when I think policymakers were starting to think about how we \nlay out a framework for addressing the various challenges to ensure \nthat the Internet would tap its full potential. We wanted to ensure \nthat the Internet would tap its full potential for innovation, for \ncommerce, for learning, for health care. I want to make it clear, we \nweren't talking about inventing the Internet. What we were talking \nabout was laying out a set of policies to ensure it would be possible \nfor our country and for persons all around the world to tap the full \npotential of the Net.\n\n  I got my start with the former Congressman from California, Chris \nCox, when we were looking at the challenge of what would happen if a \nWeb site or a blog was held liable for something that was posted on the \nWeb. The two of us, much like Senator Thune and I have done over the \nyears on the Internet Tax Freedom Act, tried to really unspool all the \nimplications. It became very clear back in the 1990s that if a Web site \nor a blog was held liable for something that was posted on the site, \nnobody would ever go out and invest in what we now know to be the \nsocial media because the last thing they would do is put their money \ninto something where they would be hit and hammered with all kinds of \nlitigation and lawsuits. Our former colleague Chris Cox and I wrote the \nlaws that ensured that a Web site would not be held secondarily liable. \nIn fact, at that time, all this was so new that our approach, which \nrelied on voluntary filters and the like to deal with smut, and another \napproach that was more of an old-fashioned censorship approach--both--\nwent to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court upheld our approach \nand struck down the other.\n  Today, if you talk to many people in the social media, they cite that \nlaw as really being the key that unleashed modern investment in the \nsocial media because if you ran a Web site or a blog, you knew you \nwouldn't be held secondarily liable for something you couldn't control. \nI think it is fair to say that Congressman Cox and I, we were \nintoxicated about the fact that we had written this law, upheld by the \nSupreme Court, and we thought about what ought to go next in terms of \ntrying to lay out a framework, as I indicated, to tap the full \npotential of the Net. Early on in our discussions, we came across a \nsituation with respect to taxing the Internet that was particularly \ntroubling. What we found was that if someone bought a subscription to a \nnewspaper and they bought the online edition, they got hit with a big \ntax. But if they bought the offline edition--what we call now the \nsnail-mail edition--they didn't get taxed. Congressman Cox and I said \nthen that this is not going to help promote innovation. That is not \ngoing to allow the Internet to grow. It is just plain discrimination. \nIt is discriminating against the Internet. It is singling the Internet \nout. You have to pay taxes for the online edition of the publication \nbut you don't have to pay a tax if you buy the snail-mail edition. We \nwrote the Internet Tax Freedom Act to protect the openness and \nviability of the Net for the platform for commerce speech and the \nexchange of ideas.\n  As both Senator Thune and I have seen over our years of working \ntogether on this, this has become important to the millions of American \ncitizens and businesses who depend on the Net. I think it would be fair \nto say--Senator Thune and I discussed this--it is likely the Internet \nwould be subject to the same level of punitive taxation that is \ncurrently inflicted on wireless services without the legislation we \nwrote. Without the Internet Tax Freedom Act, access to information in \nAmerica would no longer be tax-free--access to online communication \nwould no longer be tax-free. Access to the global marketplace so \ncrucial to America's economic future would no longer be tax-free. The \ncost to consumers could be hundreds of dollar a year per household, \nwhich certainly is a burden to many working-class families who right \nnow are walking on an economic tightrope trying to balance the food \nagainst the fuel and the fuel against the college costs and all of the \nchallenges we know for working-class families in Wisconsin, Oregon, and \nacross the country.\n  Senator Thune and I have been working together on this issue for a \nnumber of years. I want to thank him for our partnership over the \nyears. Now we have gotten a bit of seniority. We chaired a subcommittee \non the Finance Committee, and we really see these issues as central to \neconomic competitiveness.\n  This is what we need to grow and prosper with more good-paying, high-\nskill and high-wage jobs for middle-class people. That is why we have \nintroduced together legislation that would really set our tax policy in \nthis part of the economy into the 21st century. That is the Digital \nGoods and Services Tax Fairness Act. This legislation ensures the \ndigital goods will continue to be treated fairly, consistently, and \npredictably across State lines, just as their nondigital competitors. \nBecause the Internet Tax Freedom Act has been temporary, Senator Thune \nand I authored new legislation to make the Net tax-free permanently. \nOur bill is cosponsored by more than half of our Senate colleagues.\n  Most importantly--and this is why I think we are on the ascent in \nterms of support for our cause--the House passed a permanent bill in \nJuly putting the ball in the Chamber's court here. This body could take \nup and pass our permanent legislation--the permanent legislation \nSenator Thune and I have authored--on a permanent basis if it chose to \ndo so. But because the Congress has become too reliant--we certainly \nhave seen this in a number of areas on stop-and-go government--it was \nnecessary to once again pass a yearlong extension as part of a larger \nbill. The extension, in my view, is certainly a positive step. But in \nmy view, it is clearly time. In fact, it is long overdue to enact a \npermanent law, to guarantee the certainty and predictability to all who \nare seeking to innovate online, to the people in a garage, whether it \nis in Wisconsin, Oregon or anywhere else, and to have some sense of \nwhat the ground rules are going to be.\n  That is what I sought to be a part of in the 1990s. That is why I am \nso grateful for Senator Thune's leadership, because he has been a \npartner in this cause now for many years on the Finance Committee. Our \nview is that a permanent law in this area would be hugely valuable to \ninnovation, to the small businesses, and to the people who have a good \nidea, because it would provide them a new measure of certainty and \npredictability when they are looking at what is coming out of \nWashington, DC.\n  We have temporary measures, and we have measures that last a few \nweeks. Senator Thune and I want to get away from that.\n  I am very hopeful that next year a permanent version of the Internet \nTax Freedom Act will be enacted. Senator Thune and I are going to \ncontinue to work together on a bipartisan basis until that is done.\n  With that, I yield the floor for my partner from South Dakota and \nthank him for all his leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                       Tribute To Jay Rockefeller\n\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank my colleague from Oregon Senator Wyden for his \ncontinued leadership on this issue. I want to echo what he said about \nSenator Rockefeller.\n  I had the opportunity to serve as his ranking Republican on the \nSenate commerce committee and really enjoyed serving with him during \nhis chairmanship and learned a lot. He is someone who has great \nexperience here--36 years in the Senate. I have been here now for 10. \nSo I have a lot to learn from people like Senator Rockefeller.\n  We did some good things together. We just recently got through the \nSenate the cyber security bill that the commerce committee passed \nearlier this year and the satellite television reauthorization this \nyear, which ended up being--it is always somewhat controversial to move \nthat legislation, but we were successful in getting that ultimately \nenacted this year. We moved\n\n[[Page S6831]]\n\nthe STB reauthorization bill, Surface Transportation Board, which had \nrail reforms in it, out of the commerce committee. Unfortunately, they \ndidn't get it considered on the floor of the Senate but had hearings on \nnumerous issues that are under the jurisdiction of the commerce \ncommittee. I appreciate so much Chairman Rockefeller's leadership and \nhis service here. Like him, I come from a small State. We share a lot \nof things in common. We came from small communities and represent \npeople who work hard and just want a fair break and want to make sure \nthat the people they elect to represent them in Washington, DC, are \nstaying focused on the issues that are important to their livelihood. I \nappreciate his leadership on those issues.\n  I have to say that he stands tall among our colleagues. I think he \nprobably has the distinction of being the tallest Senator. The Senator \nfrom Oregon, Senator Wyden, and I are not far behind. But if Senator \nRockefeller ever stood up all the way, I think he would have us by \nseveral inches. The tall-guy caucus here in the Senate will be less \nrepresented when Senator Rockefeller departs. I have always enjoyed his \nsense of humor and the way in which he approaches the job and the \npassion he feels for public service. We wish him well in his retirement \nand thank him for a long and distinguished career here in the Senate.\n\n\n                        Internet Tax Freedom Act\n\n  I wish to say to my colleague from Oregon--he mentioned earlier that \nhe was the pioneer on this issue, going back to 1998 when he worked \nwith former Congressman Chris Cox. That was the original Internet Tax \nFreedom Act. I am hopeful that both our permanent bill, which Senator \nWyden mentioned, the ITFA bill, and our Digital Goods and Services Tax \nFairness Act can be considered as early as possible in the next \nCongress.\n  The Senator from Oregon, Senator Wyden, is the chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee--a very powerful committee here in the Congress--and \nwill continue his leadership in the next session of Congress as the \nranking Democrat on that committee. He will be a very influential voice \non all of these issues--tax matters, trade matters, health care \nmatters. The Finance Committee has a very broad jurisdiction. It is \nreally important that we get this part right.\n  If you look at what most Americans have dealt with when it comes to \nInternet service, they have not been taxed on Internet access for 16 \nyears due to the Internet Tax Freedom Act moratorium that Senator Wyden \nand Senator Cox were able to get instituted back in 1998. That \nmoratorium has been extended three times. It has been critical to the \nrapid growth of the Internet. All of this would change if we allowed \nthe Internet Tax Freedom Act to expire.\n  We were able to get through the end of this next fiscal year--which \nwill be September 30 of next year--an extension of the moratorium. But \nthe fact of the matter is, as Senator Wyden mentioned, we need \npermanency with regard to this tax policy. We need certainty. We need \npredictability. We need people in this country to know--American \nfamilies to know--they are not going to be hit with substantial taxes \nas a result of the lapse of this particular legislation.\n  You look at what it could do to the average American family. The \naverage State telecommunications tax rate is roughly 12 percent. \nImagine a married couple with two children where everyone in the family \nhas a phone with a $50 data plan. Currently, the Internet Tax Freedom \nAct prevents taxes on the data plan in States that didn't have these \ntaxes prior to the law's enactment, which is a large majority of the \nStates. If this law expires, this family of four would be likely to see \nat least a $20 increase in their monthly phone bill, meaning a tax \nincrease of more than $200 a year. For families struggling to make ends \nmeet, as Senator Wyden pointed out, this is real money.\n  This tax increase would not just be bad for American families and \nAmerican consumers, it would also be bad for American economic \ncompetitiveness because we know that higher costs for the deployment of \nhigh-speed Internet will mean a slower rollout of this technology.\n  This is especially the case in rural America, where the cost of \nexploring high-speed Internet is often higher than urban or suburban \nareas. By keeping the cost of Internet access as low as possible, we \nhelp to encourage the continued use of the Internet as a source of \neconomic growth, creativity, and entrepreneurship.\n  As the incoming chairman of the Senate commerce committee, I am \ncommitted to increasing Internet connectivity in this country. Whether \nit is through the Universal Service Fund, by getting additional \nspectrum into the hands of the private sector, or by providing \nregulatory certainty to encourage broadband buildout, our committee is \ngoing to be looking at all available options to make sure more \nAmericans have access to high-quality Internet.\n  Unfortunately, if the Federal Government allows new taxes to be \nlevied on Internet access, we risk canceling out our other efforts to \nget more Americans online. This does not make any sense. We all need to \nbe rolling in the same direction if our country is going to be \nconnected and engaged in this expanding Internet ecosystem.\n  Earlier this year the House of Representatives, as Senator Wyden \npointed out, by voice vote passed a bill to make the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act permanent, which is a very positive step forward. I am \nhopeful that next year we will move on a much longer term extension of \nITFA as well as other measures that promote the digital economy, such \nas the Digital Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act that I mentioned \nearlier.\n  As incoming chairman of the commerce committee and as a member of the \ntax-writing Finance Committee, I am looking forward to a new agenda \nnext Congress, one that is optimistic and forward-leaning, an agenda \nthat recognizes that the dynamism in our economy today should not be a \nsource of concern but, rather, a source of opportunity for jobs, \ngrowth, and economic freedom. This agenda begins with support for the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act. That is why I am pleased the bill we passed \nSaturday evening extends the Internet Tax Freedom Act through September \n2015 so that we can have a debate next year about how we promote the \nInternet economy with all of its benefits on a much more permanent \nbasis.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague from Oregon, Senator \nWyden, and Senators on both sides who I think care deeply about this \ncritical issue moving forward early in the next Congress. As the \nSenator from Oregon mentioned, I think half of the Members of the \nSenate are cosponsors of this bill. That suggests to me that obviously \nthere is broad, bipartisan support for what we are talking about here.\n  I also look forward to working with Senator Wyden on other issues \nthat are important to the digital economy. Digital trade is something \nhe and I have partnered on in the past as well. As we look at the trade \nagreements that are currently being negotiated--the TPP as well as the \nTTIP trade agreements with Europe--all need to include important \nprotections for the digital economy.\n  This is one of the areas in our economy where we actually have a \ntrade surplus. Because of American ingenuity, know-how, creativity, and \ninnovation, we continue to lead the world in this area. We need to make \nsure that we not only are putting in place the important safeguards \nhere in this country against taxing these services but also ensuring \nthat we have access to other markets around the world where we know \nAmerican know-how and American ingenuity and creativity can lead the \nway.\n  I very much look forward in the next Congress to continuing to work \nwith my colleague from Oregon on these important matters so that we can \ncontinue to see middle-income families in this country benefit from the \ngains in productivity that come, hopefully a higher standard of living, \nhigher take-home pay, better wages, and better job opportunities that \ncome with a robust, vibrant digital economy that enables our broader \neconomy to continue to make great gains.\n  I thank the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, for his leadership on \nthis issue both past and present. I look forward to working with him as \nwe try in the future to make sure that those gains are protected and \nthat we move even further in the direction of economic freedom when it \ncomes to the Internet.\n\n[[Page S6832]]\n\n                   Supporting America's Charities Act\n\n  I would like to shift gears and speak, if I might for just a moment, \nabout another issue which I think is very important to our overall \neconomy and very important to a lot of people across this country, both \nthose who give to--empower charitable giving in this country and those \nwho benefit from it.\n  Last week the House of Representatives voted on a piece of \nlegislation that would empower Americans to give more to charity. The \nlegislation would accomplish this by making permanent three tax \nincentives for charitable giving that have been in law on a temporary \nbasis. All three of these tax provisions have historically enjoyed \nstrong bipartisan support.\n  First, the bill would make permanent the law allowing individuals \n70\\1/2\\ years of age and older to donate up to $100,000 of their \nindividual retirement account to charity without incurring a tax \npenalty for doing so.\n  Second, the bill would make permanent the enhanced deduction for food \ninventories, thus encouraging businesses to donate food that might \notherwise go to waste to food pantries and other organizations that \nhelp to feed the hungry.\n  Finally, the bill would make permanent certain tax rules that make it \neasier for farmers and other land owners to donate land for \nconservation purposes, thus helping to preserve America's natural \nhabitat. This last provision, I might add, is included in President \nObama's 2015 budget.\n  These are commonsense measures that will help to promote what I \nbelieve is a core element of the American experience; that is, private \ncitizens helping friends and neighbors in their time of need. What \ncould be more appropriate during this season of giving than the \ngovernment making it a little bit easier for Americans to lend a \nhelping hand?\n  Unfortunately, this Christmas season the Obama administration has a \ndifferent message for America's charities and the millions of \nindividuals they serve. That message is ``bah humbug.'' That is right. \nInstead of working with us to help America's charities, the Obama \nadministration promised to veto this bill should it pass the House and \nthe Senate. Apparently the President is so opposed to any new tax \nrelief, he has decided to oppose a bill with significant bipartisanship \nsupport.\n  Let's be clear that this measure is not some budget-busting bill. In \nfact, this bill would provide about $1 billion per year in tax relief \nto Americans who donate to charity, which would have almost no impact \non a Federal budget of nearly $4 trillion.\n  One measure of the bipartisan nature of this legislation is the fact \nthat the Democratic chairman of the tax-writing Finance Committee, \nSenator Wyden, who was here briefly a moment ago, supports this \nmeasure. In fact, Chairman Wyden recently indicated that he hoped we \ncould get this measure to the President's desk quickly. He stated:\n\n       My view is we'll pass it as a clean bill and send it on to \n     the President. I really don't see a lot of controversy.\n\n  That was from the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.\n  Unfortunately for Senator Wyden and me, along with many of our \ncolleagues in both parties who see an opportunity to get something \nmeaningful enacted before the end of this year, this White House sees \nyet another opportunity for gridlock. So I would say I strongly believe \npromoting charitable giving should be a high priority.\n  Earlier this year Senator Wyden and I circulated a letter signed by \n33 of our Senate colleagues to then-Finance Committee Chairman Baucus \nand Ranking Member Hatch urging them not to weaken the charitable tax \ndeduction in any tax reform effort.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, I have not signed many letters \non tax reform, as I generally believe that everything needs to be on \nthe table. However, I made an exception when it came to charitable \ngiving because I believe so strongly that promoting charity is an \nintegral part of who we are as a nation.\n  Much like the deduction for charitable contributions, the provisions \nof the Supporting America's Charities Act represent important means by \nwhich to encourage Americans to give more to charitable organizations. \nUnfortunately, due to opposition from the President, this legislation \nfell a few votes short of passage last week in the House when it was \nconsidered under suspension of the rules, which is a process that \nrequires a two-thirds majority vote.\n  That being said, I intend to introduce similar legislation early next \nyear, and I strongly urge the President of the United States to \nreconsider what I believe is his misguided opposition to these very \nworthy provisions. I hope the administration will join us in a spirit \nof good will toward all men and women, especially those of our fellow \ncitizens most in need of assistance.\n\n\n                                able act\n\n  I wish to finally speak today regarding a bill that I am very pleased \nhas moved through this Congress--I should say will be moving shortly--\nand that is the Achieving a Better Life Experience, or ABLE, Act. This \nbill will assist individuals with disabilities by creating a mechanism \nto achieve long-term personal savings--something individuals with \ndisabilities are effectively prohibited from doing today under \ncurrently law.\n  The ABLE Act would create tax-favored savings accounts for people \nwith disabilities that would count toward the $2,000 individual asset \nlimits that apply to the Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid \nPrograms. The ABLE Act will allow individuals with disabilities and \ntheir families to save money to pay for qualified disability expenses, \nsuch as education, a primary residence, transportation, and other \npersonal support expenses.\n  This legislation helps achieve a world where disabilities are no \nlonger viewed as a limiting factor as individuals plan for jobs, for \nschool, and for family life. It helps achieve a world where Federal \npolicies no longer impede individuals with disabilities from achieving \ntheir dreams. It helps give parents peace of mind as they think about \nwhat the future holds for their children.\n  I have met with many families on this issue, and one story in \nparticular stands out, the story of Tim and Jamie Geels from Dakota \nDunes. They have three sons, and their middle son, Tyler, is a concrete \nexample of a young South Dakotan who will see tangible changes to his \nfuture as a result of the ABLE Act.\n  The ABLE Act is one of the most far-reaching pieces of legislation to \nhelp individuals with disabilities in nearly 25 years. I am proud to be \na cosponsor. Long hours and intense effort shaped this legislation into \na package that helps Americans with disabilities and is fiscally \nresponsible as well. I am proud to support the ABLE Act, as modified. I \nlook forward to Senate passage of this very worthy legislation later \nthis week as part of the tax extenders legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                     Work of the Commerce Committee\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, before the Senator from South Dakota \nleaves the floor, let this Senator say that I am looking forward to \nworking with him since he will be our chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee next year. I will have the privilege of being the ranking \nmember. We have a fairly full plate of things that must be done: FAA \nreauthorization, telecommunications rewrite. Fortunately, it looks as \nthough we have just done a Coast Guard bill, but there can always be \ntweaks to that. There are a host of things. We are way beyond on NASA \nreauthorization. Fortunately, we have been able to build on the NASA \nreauthorization that was done in 2010, but that needs to be updated. \nThere are all kinds of consumer legislation as we get into things such \nas this thorny issue of Internet access. It is going to take some real \nbipartisan cooperation.\n  In my discussions with the future chairman, Senator Thune, I am \nlooking forward to working with him on this very important committee.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I know the Senator from Florida has \nthings he wants to talk about, but I do want to take this opportunity \nto mention that I very much look forward to working with him. I think \nwe have the potential for a real foundation, hopefully, for \naccomplishment on our committee.\n\n[[Page S6833]]\n\n  The Senator from Florida is someone who has an interest in working in \na bipartisan way to get things done for our country. I know of his \ngreat interest, being from Florida, in the space program and NASA, in \noceans. Oceans are not an issue we have to deal with a lot in South \nDakota; it is an issue our committee deals with. It is an issue that is \nvery important to a lot of our colleagues on the committee as well as \nthe Senator from Florida. So I welcome the opportunity to work with \nhim.\n\n  As he mentioned, these are tough, thorny issues--telecommunications \nissues, transportation issues, the highway bill, FAA authorization, \nperhaps something on rail. There is a whole range of issues falling \nunder the jurisdiction of the commerce committee that are going to \nrequire an extraordinary level not only of support from the members of \nour committee but a willingness on the part of those of us--the Senator \nfrom Florida and I--to hopefully craft an agenda to get things done for \nthis country.\n  I appreciate his kind words and would reciprocate by saying how much \nI look forward to working with him and hopefully to have a real record \nof accomplishment as we head into this next year.\n  I thank the Senator from Florida for his kind words and wish to let \nhim know we will be doubling down next year, working as hard as we can \nto put some points on the scoreboard that are good not only for the \nState of Florida and for the State of South Dakota but for America and \nfor our economy, because we have so many things under the jurisdiction \nof the commerce committee that contribute to a stronger and more robust \neconomy in this country.\n\n\n                             Tax Extenders\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I wish to speak about a tax bill that is \ncoming up that is fairly necessary for the country. The Senator from \nSouth Dakota and I have the privilege also of serving on the Finance \nCommittee, and there is an example where we just haven't been able to \nget a lot done. Now, here we are at the eleventh hour and fifty-ninth \nminute with a whole bunch of provisions about to expire that are \nextremely important to American taxpayers, such as the research and \ndevelopment tax credit.\n  American businesses and American taxpayers would like to have some \ncertainty of knowing, as they are doing their planning for the year, \nthat they can plan on this or that deduction or tax credit. In \nCongress, for the entire past year, we have not had etched into law, \nbecause it has expired, a number of these tax deductions and credits \nthat I am going to go through. But the R tax credit is only one \nexample.\n  So how in the world can American business and the American taxpayers \nplan? Take, for example, the Senator has a State where agriculture is \npredominant. So does this Senator.\n  There are a number of ranchers in the State of Florida who want to \ndonate a conservation easement on their property to keep that property, \nin this case of ranching families, that they have been ranching for \ncenturies. They want that way of life to continue.\n  There is an interest in environmental restoration; for example, the \nEverglades restoration, that the headwaters that ultimately flow to the \nEverglades be preserved from being developed. So there is an interest \nin the environment to obtain the development rights or a conservation \neasement.\n  It is clearly in the interests of the taxpayer, likewise, to have \nobserved that conservation easement because that is the easiest way of \ncleaning up the water that ultimately flows into the Everglades. So the \nconservation easement is a win-win-win. It is a win for the rancher, it \nis a win for the taxpayer, and it is a win for the environment.\n  But the poor ranchers, because we have not passed the tax extenders \nbill, here they are at the end of the year and they would like to make \nthe donation of the conservation easement. How are they going to get it \ndone in the next couple of weeks if we don't pass it until almost the \nmidnight hour?\n  It is just another example, and I look forward to working with the \nSenator from South Dakota. I hope we can pass it this week so at least \nsome of it can be salvaged before the end of this tax year.\n  I have given two examples and I will give another: the wind energy \nproduction tax credit. It provides a credit for electricity produced by \nthe wind.\n  There is a lot of wind out in the middle of this country. It is a \ngood way to produce electricity. It is called renewable electricity. It \nhas brought our electricity sector into the 21st century. It has \nreduced our dependence on carbon-based electricity.\n  It makes sense. If someone visits a country such as Denmark, look how \nmany windmills there are. I still call them windmills, but they are \nwind turbines. They are highly sophisticated, finely tuned machines, \nblades that will take the least bit of wind and turn that big blade \nthat is hundreds of feet long. As it turns, it is generating \nelectricity.\n  Yet for the entire past year people who want to establish these wind \nfarms don't have any certainty that they will be able to get this wind \nenergy production tax credit.\n  The purpose for the tax credit is to give the businesses an incentive \nto establish wind farms which, No. 1, becomes a win for the \nenvironment; No. 2, becomes a win for the business that is in the \nbusiness of wind energy production; and, No. 3, becomes a win for the \nconsumers because it is weaning us from producing electricity only from \na carbon-based fuel that ultimately sends CO2 into the \natmosphere. We know what is happening with a lot of CO2 up \nthere, it creates the greenhouse effect.\n  As the Sun's rays come in and bounce off the surface of the Earth and \nreflect or radiate back out into space, suddenly the glass ceiling--the \ngreenhouse effect of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases--traps \nthat heat. What happens? The increasing temperature of the planet, 90 \npercent of that heat is absorbed into the oceans and, as a result, we \nare seeing the sea level rise.\n\n  For a State such as mine, the State of Florida, NASA has measured \nover the past 50 years--not drafts, not projections, measurements--5 to \n8 inches in South Florida of sea level rise in Florida.\n  By the way, check the papers. Yesterday the pumps didn't work. Alton \nRoad in Miami Beach was flooded. The mayor of Miami Beach, when he was \ncampaigning 1 year ago, went in a kayak down Alton Road as a \ndemonstration of how the sea level rise at high tide is flooding \nstreets of Miami Beach. It brings me back to this extenders tax bill we \nneed to pass this week: the wind energy production tax credit.\n  Another example is the work opportunity tax credit, which encourages \npeople who work to hire disadvantaged people. It provides a tax credit \nfor businesses that hire people who have a difficult time getting a \njob. It encourages the private sector to help these folks get out of a \ndifficult spot in their lives, because they have disadvantages, to \nbecome independent, to stand on their own two feet because they can go \nto work. That is the purpose of a tax credit for work opportunity, but \nthat hasn't been in effect all this year, 2014.\n  We pass this tax extenders bill and it will retroactively take it \nback to the 1st of the year and make this tax credit--and these others \nI have mentioned--available as people are calculating their Federal \nincome tax for the calendar year 2014.\n  Another is rollover IRAs to charities. It is when you get to a \ncertain age--and I believe the age is 70--and you have an IRA. By law, \nsetting up the IRAs which are nontaxable--recall all the years you put \nmoney in those IRAs, you put that money into the IRA before you paid \ntax on it.\n  When you bring money out of the IRAs that you have had all of your \nlife, you are going to pay the tax, and that more than likely is going \nto be during your retirement years. That is what an IRA is for. It is \ncalled an Individual Retirement Account.\n  By law, under the IRA law, when someone gets to be 70, they have to \nstart taking out a certain amount of that IRA.\n  We have had a provision in the Tax Code that is an incentive to give \nthat money that people have to take out to charity. Therefore, it \nprovides an easier way for people who have to take the money out of \ntheir retirement accounts to give that money to charity because, when \nthey take it out, it doesn't become taxable before they give it to the \ncharity.\n  In other words, it is a transfer of the tax-free dollars in the IRA \ndirectly\n\n[[Page S6834]]\n\nover to charity. It is a win for the taxpayer, and it is a win for the \ncharitable organizations because there is an incentive there to give \nthat money to charitable organizations.\n  If we don't pass this tax extenders bill, that is not available for \nall of this year of 2014. Think what that is going to do to some \ncharities and what it is going to be doing to taxpayers who have been \nplanning on that deduction and suddenly find it is not available.\n  Another example is there are a few States--maybe half a dozen--that \ndo not have a State income tax, but often the State government is in \nfact funded by the State sales tax. My State of Florida is one of those \nStates. The State of Washington is another, and the State of Texas is \nanother. There are about three others.\n  Therefore, if someone is in a State that has a State income tax, and \nthey are calculating their Federal income tax, they can deduct the \nState income tax in the deduction of the Federal income tax.\n  What about the poor people in the States that don't have the income \ntax? They should be able to deduct the similar tax that we pay in our \nStates, the State sales tax, and that provision has been there in the \nTax Code, but it is not in there for 2014 because it lapsed, and we \nneed to reenact it.\n  This is not a way to run a railroad and tax policy, but \nunfortunately, because it seems to have the word ``tax'' to it, it \nseems to be radioactive and, as a result, we have to wait until the \neleventh hour and the fifty-ninth minute to pass it.\n  I certainly hope we will pass it this week.\n  Let me give you another example--the deduction for mortgage insurance \npremiums. When you want to buy a home, the bank negotiates and sets up \na mortgage so you can buy the home. Most banks will require you to take \nout an insurance policy should you fail to pay on that mortgage. We \nhave always had the deductibility of that insurance premium in \ncalculating Federal income taxes, and it particularly helps low- and \nmiddle-income people deduct the amount they pay for private mortgage \ninsurance. So, therefore, what does that do? That helps those low- and \nmiddle-income folks buy a home.\n  Isn't home ownership something that is desirable in America? I think \nso. Well, we better pass this tax extenders bill.\n  I will give another example--excluding forgiven mortgage debt from \nincome. It allows people to exclude forgiven mortgage debt from their \nincome. Why am I raising this? Well, haven't we just gone through the \nworst recession since the Great Depression? Didn't some people get so \nupside down in their mortgage--with their mortgage being at this level, \nbut the value of their home dropping to this level--so that they owed a \nmuch greater amount on their mortgage than the value of their home? \nWhat they tried to do was work with the purchaser and the bank that \nholds the mortgage. That is called a short sale. The bank forgives part \nof that debt--the difference between the mortgage amount and the value \nof the home.\n  The poor taxpayer, the homeowner, instead of treating what they have \nbeen forgiven as income--they have just had to take a shellacking \nbecause of the value of their home dropping below the value of the \nmortgage. Lo and behold, when they get a break and sell in a short \nsale, they end up having to pay income tax on that amount of debt that \nwas forgiven.\n  I don't think we want to do that. That is why we have this provision \nto exclude that debt forgiveness from the income tax. But for all of \nthe last 12 months it is not going to be forgiven if we can't pass this \ntax extenders bill. I think we better get serious about it. We are \ntalking about looking at this as the last piece of legislation this \nweek to pass before we leave. We better get serious about it.\n  And lastly, let me say that every one of us wants to treat teachers \nthe right way. Teachers haven't been treated the right way. As a matter \nof fact, a lot of teachers are pulling money out of their own pockets \nbecause their school districts are not providing enough money for \nschool supplies for those little children. Those unselfish teachers are \ngoing into their own pockets to bring out money to provide the supplies \nso the kids can learn. Now if a courageous and unselfish teacher does \nthat, should we not at least give them a deduction of that amount they \npaid for those school supplies for their children? Shouldn't we let \nthem deduct that in calculating their income tax?\n  We have in the past. But we haven't for calendar year 2014--this \npresent year. And that is another one of the deductions that I hope the \nCongress will pass this week in order to take care of our people.\n  But as we go through this in the future, why do we have to keep \nwaiting until the last minute so people can't plan, so people get \nnervous, so people don't know what to do, so people don't know how to \ninvest, so people don't know how to preserve their land, their \nbusiness, and the future for their families? This is no way to run a \nrailroad.\n  Let us at least salvage some kind of victory from the jaws of defeat. \nI hope we will pass this bill in short order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Walsh). The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                            Social Security\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, it is no secret to anyone in America that \nthe middle class of our country today is struggling; that while \nmillions of American workers are now working longer hours for lower \nwages than they did in some cases 30 or 40 years ago--we are looking at \na 40-year decline of the middle class--that almost all of the new \nincome being generated today is going to the top 1 percent. Tragically, \nthe United States has the most unequal distribution of income and \nwealth of any major country on Earth.\n  But the issue is not just for the middle class right now or for \nworking families. The issue of the economic crisis we are in \nsignificantly impacts senior citizens and children, the most vulnerable \npeople in this country. My hope always has been that as a great nation \nwe will not turn our backs on the children of America. But year after \nyear that is exactly what we do. We continue to have millions of \nchildren living in poverty. In fact, we have the highest rate of \nchildhood poverty of any major country on Earth. Almost 20 percent of \nour kids live in poverty. We have about one out of four children in \nAmerica who gets their nutrition from the food stamp program.\n  I worry very much about the future of this country if we cannot stand \nwith the children of America; if we cannot make sure that working \nparents all over this country have high quality, affordable childcare. \nThat is certainly not the case right now, despite the fact that \nvirtually all psychologists recognize that the most important years of \na human being's life are zero to four. But our childcare system is a \ndisaster.\n  It is not only the children we have turned our backs on. Increasingly \nwe are turning our backs on senior citizens as well. It has distressed \nme for a number of years to be hearing many of my Republican friends \nand some Democrats talking about the need to cut Social Security--to \ncut Social Security. There are various schemes out there--some of them \nhave to do with the so-called chained CPI--which would reformulate how \nwe determine cost-of-living adjustments for seniors. This means, in \nfact, over a period of years significant reductions in what seniors and \ndisabled veterans would get.\n  We have worked, I have worked, in opposition to that concept for \nyears. I think we have beaten it back, but I have no doubt that it will \nsurface again. There are folks who want to cut Social Security, and, in \nmy view, we have to do everything we can not only to defeat that \nproposal but we have to begin talking about how we expand Social \nSecurity benefits. Because today the kind of benefits that millions of \nseniors get are simply not adequate for them in terms of giving them \nthe income they need to purchase the medicine they require, the food \nthey need, the fuel to heat their homes in the wintertime, and other \nbasic necessities.\n\n  In terms of Social Security, let me be very clear. Despite what folks \non TV may be saying, and some politicians may be saying, Social \nSecurity is not going broke. Let me repeat: Social Security is not \ngoing broke. Today Social Security has a surplus in the trust fund of \n$2.76 trillion--a surplus of $2.76 trillion--and can pay out benefits \nto every eligible American for the next 19 years, to the year 2033. So \nanyone who comes forward and says Social Security is\n\n[[Page S6835]]\n\ngoing broke, that is just factually not true. Social Security can pay \nout every benefit owed to every eligible American for the next 19 \nyears.\n  We also hear the argument: Well, we have a large deficit, and Social \nSecurity is one of the causes of our deficit and our national debt. \nThat is absolutely inaccurate. Social Security has not contributed one \nnickel to our deficit or our national debt, because Social Security, as \nevery worker in America knows, is independently funded through payroll \ntax contributions from workers and employers--6.2 percent from each--\nand it does not receive funding from the Federal Treasury.\n  So, a, Social Security is not going broke; and, b, it is not \ncontributing to the deficit. But I will say this about Social Security. \nIn an incredibly volatile economy, the stock market goes up, the stock \nmarket goes down. Social Security, from its inception 79 years ago, \nthrough good economic times and bad economic times, has paid out every \nnickel owed to every eligible beneficiary with minimal administrative \ncost.\n  Social Security is not an investment program. You can invest money on \nWall Street, and sometimes you do well. You can invest money on Wall \nStreet, and sometimes you lose your shirt. Social Security is a social \ninsurance program. It has never failed 1 American in 79 years. That is \na pretty good record.\n  But even with Social Security being strong and solvent for the next \n19 years, we have to recognize we do have a retirement crisis in \nAmerica today. I fear very much that the appropriations bill just \npassed the other day, which will allow pensions for millions of workers \nto be cut, is only going to exacerbate that problem. Today in America \nonly one in five workers has a traditional defined benefit that \nguarantees income in retirement.\n  Amazingly enough, when we talk about anxiety among the American \npeople, stress among the American people, and why people are angry, why \nthey are fearful, over half of all Americans have less than $10,000 in \nsavings. Stop and think about that. If you have less than $10,000 in \nsavings, an automobile accident or needing a new car can wipe you out; \nan illness can wipe you out; a divorce can wipe you out. So we have \nmillions and millions of Americans sitting there wondering how they are \ngoing to retire with dignity when they have $5,000, $8,000 or less in \nsavings.\n  Here is the importance of Social Security: Two-thirds of senior \ncitizens today depend upon Social Security for more than half of their \nincome; one-third of all seniors depend upon Social Security for at \nleast 90 percent of their income.\n  So when we talk about cutting Social Security, understand that a \nthird of seniors depend upon Social Security for at least 90 percent of \ntheir income. This is not extra money; this is not fun money; this is \nlife-and-death money. This is money that people need to buy medicine, \nfood, and to keep their homes warm in the wintertime.\n  I wish I could say otherwise, but the truth is that the percentage of \nseniors living in poverty in America is going up. In 2011, the official \nsenior poverty rate was 8.7 percent. Last year the official senior \npoverty rate was 9.5 percent. That is a pretty significant increase in \nsenior poverty.\n  But if we look at the Census Bureau's more comprehensive measure of \npoverty, which takes a careful look at the out-of-pocket medical costs \nfor seniors, the poverty rate for seniors is even worse. According to \nthis supplemental poverty measure from the Census Bureau, the real \nsenior poverty rate in America is actually 14.6 percent. What that \nmeans is that one out of seven seniors living in America last year \ncould not afford to meet their most basic needs.\n  The average Social Security benefit today is just $14,000 a year. As \nsomeone who will be the next ranking member of the Budget Committee, I \nintend to do everything I can not only to oppose vigorously any efforts \nto cut Social Security, I am going to do everything I can to expand \nSocial Security benefits.\n  In fact, the best way to expand Social Security is to ask the \nwealthiest people in our country to pay more into the system by \nscrapping the cap on income that is subject to the Social Security \npayroll tax. As the Presiding Officer knows, right now a billionaire \npays the same amount into Social Security as someone who makes $117,000 \na year. So if there is a multimillionaire here--somebody who is making \n$50 million--and somebody who is making $117,000, they both contribute \nthe same amount into the Social Security trust fund. This is \nregressive. This is unfair. This is absurd. If we lifted this cap and \napplied the Social Security payroll tax to income above $250,000--not \n$117,000, but $250,000 a year, we could not only extend the solvency of \nSocial Security for decades to come--which is what we want to do--but \nwe could also provide the resources necessary to expand Social Security \nbenefits. That is exactly what we should be doing, and that in fact is \nwhat the American people want us to do.\n  In August 2014, a poll by Lake Research Partners asked likely voters \nif they support the idea of:\n\n       . . . increasing Social Security benefits and paying for \n     that increase by having wealthy Americans pay the same rate \n     into Social Security as everybody else.\n\n  Interestingly, the poll found that 90 percent of Democratic voters \nsaid they support the idea, and 75 percent strongly support that idea \nof lifting the cap; 73 percent of Independent voters support that idea, \n55 percent strongly support it; 73 percent of Republican voters support \nthat idea, 47 percent strongly support it.\n  So there is for that idea enormously strong support across the \npolitical spectrum, Democrats, Independents, Republicans.\n  Sadly, despite this overwhelming support for expanding Social \nSecurity, the CEOs at the Business Roundtable--the organization \nrepresenting the largest corporations in America--came out with a plan \nlast year which does exactly what the American people do not want to \ndo. The American people want to expand Social Security and the Business \nRoundtable came out with a plan that would increase the Social Security \nretirement age from 67 to 70 and severely cut the COLA of senior \ncitizens and disabled veterans.\n  The Congress and the Senate here have got to make a very fundamental \ndecision, and that is: Do we listen to the American people who are \nhurting today--the seniors who have worked their whole lives but who \ncannot get by in what in many cases are meager and inadequate Social \nSecurity benefits--do we listen to them? Do we stand up for and with \nthe people who helped build this country--who worked the farms, who \nworked in our factories, who served us in our Armed Forces? Do we stand \nwith them and expand Social Security, or do we listen to those on Wall \nStreet and corporate America who want to cut Social Security benefits \nand in some cases want to privatize Social Security?\n  This is a huge issue for tens of millions of Americans. I intend to \ndo everything I can not only to resist cuts to Social Security but to \ndo everything we can to expand Social Security benefits for those \nseniors and disabled vets who desperately need that expansion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                            Bough Nomination\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Members of the Senate, in a few hours, \nmaybe within this day or tomorrow, the Senate will be voting on several \nnominees to be district judges. I come to the floor to speak about one \nof these, Stephen Bough, of Missouri, for a seat on the District Court \nof the Western District of Missouri.\n  As I do with every nominee, I thoroughly examined Mr. Bough's record \nwith an eye at giving him and others the benefit of the doubt if \nproblematic issues arose. After full consideration of that record, I am \nregrettably unable to support this nominee. There are just too many \ndata points--red flags, if you will--which tell me that Mr. Bough \ndoesn't have what it takes to serve in a lifetime appointment on the \nMissouri District Court.\n  These red flags all relate to one troubling question the nominee's \nrecord raises: whether Mr. Bough has the temperament to be a Federal \njudge. I have come to the conclusion that he doesn't have that type of \ntemperament. So I would explain my conclusion.\n  First, there is the issue of this nominee's professional conduct. A \nspecific incident from last year demonstrates how Mr. Bough has engaged \nin what I\n\n[[Page S6836]]\n\nbelieve to be unethical behavior that precludes him from service on a \nFederal bench.\n  Last October, a member of the Mississippi bar drew my attention to \nthe nominee's participation in a civil case in Federal District Court. \nThe presiding judge on that case was the nominee's former employer, \nSenior District Judge Scott O. Wright.\n  About a week before the nominee signed on to the case, the \nplaintiff's attorney asked the court to transfer the case to another \njudge. Judge Wright denied that motion the next day. Then, just 1 week \nlater, the nominee entered his appearance in the case. Mere hours after \nthat, Judge Wright recused himself without any motion from the parties.\n  Now why did Judge Wright do that? Well, when Mr. Bough joined the \ncase, he created a conflict of interest with Judge Wright. You see, Mr. \nBough was Judge Wright's law clerk and remains his close personal \nfriend today. In fact, Judge Wright had added the nominee to his \npersonal conflicts list in January 2006, and Mr. Bough was well aware \nthat he was on the conflicts list. So Mr. Bough knew that by joining \nthe case Judge Wright was guaranteed to recuse himself--and that is \nexactly what the plaintiffs tried unsuccessfully to do just 1 week \nbefore Mr. Bough signed on and forced that recusal by creating the \nconflict with the judge.\n  Now we can reasonably ask, why is this significant? Well, what the \nnominee did here is known as judge shopping. It is an unethical \nlitigation practice that has been strongly criticized by courts \nthroughout the country. Essentially, it is when a lawyer knowingly \ncreates a conflict with a judge in order to get the judge kicked off a \ncase and replaced with a new and perhaps more favorable judge. That is \nthe shopping part.\n  The Michigan Supreme Court has explained that judge shopping \n``exposes the legal profession and the courts to contempt and \nridicule.'' The Fifth Circuit calls judge shopping ``sheer manipulation \nof the justice system.'' Another Federal court has noted that the \npractice is ``universally condemned.''\n  This isn't the kind of professional conduct we can accept in a \nnominee to the Federal bench.\n  I gave Mr. Bough several opportunities to explain his conduct in \nquestions for the record that I submitted to him. What I learned from \nhis responses was this: The nominee knew that by joining the case he \ncreated conflict requiring Judge Wright's recusal.\n  I also asked the nominee to provide our Judiciary Committee with the \nwork he says he did while he was an attorney on that case. You see, I \nwanted to know whether the nominee joined the case in good faith to \nwork and to do it for the client, or joined just to create a conflict \nwith the judge.\n  Mr. Bough responded that he provided advice and edits on only three \ndocuments. I requested those documents twice, and I told the nominee to \nredact any content protected by attorney-client privilege. The nominee \nhas refused to provide those documents to me. The nominee has not \nprovided to me memorandums, billing records, or any other materials to \nsupport his claim that he actually was working on that case; nor did \nthe nominee attend any depositions or other pretrial hearings in that \ncase. He made no filings with the court.\n  In short, Mr. Bough has provided me with almost nothing to support \nhis claim that he actually did substantial work on the case during the \n7 months he represented the client.\n  It is for this reason and for the circumstances I have already \ndescribed that I am led to believe that the nominee's entry of \nappearance was not in good faith. It looks to me like a textbook case \nof judge shopping.\n  But the judge shopping is only one of many red flags. Let me discuss \nanother that gives me serious pause.\n  The nominee has been active in Democratic Party politics in the \nKansas City area for a number of years. Now I want to make it very \nclear that I don't hold that against him. I have said frequently over \nthe years that I never disqualify a judicial nominee just because he or \nshe has been politically active. Instead, the issue for me is whether a \nnominee has shown that they can shift gears and put aside their \nprevious political advocacy once they put on the judge's robe. This \nnominee's record makes it abundantly clear that he wouldn't be able to \nmake the switch from political advocate to impartial arbiter of law.\n  I will give you an example. In recent years the nominee has written a \nnumber of blogs and those posts have been about national politics. I \nhave read his posts. I would say some are of a stridently political \nnature. Those don't bother me. Others though are simply too crude and \nsexist for me to quote. I challenge any Democrat who is voting for this \nnominee to read those blogs aloud to the public. I am confident none of \nmy colleagues will do that. So I will just say that the sheer \ncoarseness of those posts led me and other members of our Judiciary \nCommittee to question whether Mr. Bough has a temperament suited to the \nlifetime judicial service.\n  Unfortunately it is not just the blog posts that make me ask that \nquestion. The nominee has shown in other contexts that he is first and \nforemost a political operative rather than a zealous advocate for a \nclient or officer of the court. For example, Mr. Bough has lodged two \nobviously frivolous and abusive complaints with the Federal Elections \nCommission against a congressional candidate whom he opposed \nideologically. In 2008 the Commission dismissed the first of these \ncomplaints in a brief opinion. But in 2012, Mr. Bough redoubled his \nefforts and filed a second 93-page complaint against the same \ncandidate. This time the Commission responded with a lengthy and \nmeticulous opinion that is striking in its strong language dismissing \neach of Mr. Bough's allegations.\n  The Commission criticized Mr. Bough's allegations as ``vague and \nspeculative'' and said any violation which may have occurred was so \nminor as to not merit consideration. The opinion concluded that Mr. \nBough's complaint had no basis for its allegations and was without \nmerit. So the bottom line is that the nominee was using a government \nagency as a tool to harass a political opponent.\n  As I said earlier, that is behavior indicative of a political \noperative, someone who is not going to be able to put it all aside and \nconsider cases objectively once he becomes a judge.\n  From time to time some of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee \nhave commented that the best evidence for the type of judge a nominee \nwill be is the type of lawyer they have been. So I think there is a lot \nof wisdom in that view. With this nominee we know what kind of lawyer \nhe has been, defending an unsavory client or representing an unpopular \ncause is one thing; we expect lawyers to do that--our system in fact \ndemands that they do that--but acting as a political operative is an \nentirely different matter, and that is the kind of lawyer this \nnominee's record shows him to have been: a lawyer steeped in bare-\nknuckled political combat.\n  I said at the beginning of this statement that I am inclined to give \nnominees the benefit of the doubt when I come across something in their \nrecord that raises my eyebrows. I probably would have done that with \nthis nominee, too, if there had been just an isolated issue or a \nnoncharacteristic lapse in judgment. But that is not what we have here \nwith Mr. Bough. Not only do we have unethical judge shopping, to that \nwe have to add a number of crass, sexist, and insulting blog posts, and \nto that we also add a pair of frivolous complaints that abused the \njurisdiction of a government agency in order to harass a political \nopponent.\n  There are too many red flags for me to support this nominee.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Tax Increase Prevention Act\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I am here today to discuss the Tax \nIncrease Prevention Act. We are now getting down to the end of the \nyear. It is important that we get our work done. An important part of \nthat work is passing the Tax Increase Prevention Act. It is often \nreferred to as the tax extenders package. What it really does is it \nextends tax credits and deductions used\n\n[[Page S6837]]\n\nby small businesses across this country. The Tax Increase Prevention \nAct will extend for 1 year 55 different tax credits and deductions that \nexpired either at the end of 2013 or during 2014.\n  This is a bill that has already passed the House, and it passed with \na huge margin, with a bipartisan vote of 378 to 46.\n  One of the most important provisions in the act is the section 179 \ndepreciation and expensing provision for small businesses. That is the \nprovision I particularly want to focus on today and talk about and \ndiscuss why it is so important for our small businesses and for our \nentire country.\n  Section 179 allows farmers and other small businesses to expense and \ndepreciate property they have purchased or repaired for their \noperations. That is important to them so that they don't see a tax \nincrease, but it also keeps our economy going. Without it, small \nbusiness will buy and repair less equipment, slowing down our \nmanufacturing base and slowing down our economy. Quite simply, that \nmeans fewer jobs. It is not only because small business's costs are \nincreased, but it is also because of the uncertainty that is created \nwhen they don't know the rules of the road. That is why this fix needs \nto be done on a permanent basis.\n  I think it could have been done on a permanent basis this year. We \nwere working on a deal until the President threatened to veto that \nlegislation. So now we have a 1-year fix, but we have broad support in \nthis Chamber for the 1-year fix. We need to pass it now and then go \nback to work on a permanent fix next year.\n  I was home for the weekend about a week ago, and I was talking to \nsome of the farmers in our State. They told me what they have been \ntelling me for some time now; that is, they need the section 179 \nexpensing and depreciation, they need to know the rules of the road, \nand they need to know it now.\n  We are at year-end. They are doing their year-end planning. They are \ndoing their tax work. Some are still negotiating on buying equipment \nfor next year. The depreciation and expensing rules affect the \ndecisions they make. They will also affect the number of jobs in our \neconomy. Agriculture alone is responsible for 16 million direct and \nindirect jobs in our economy. Ag is also a sector of our economy that \nproduces a positive balance of trade. American agriculture provides the \nhighest quality and lowest cost food supply in the world. It is \nsomething that benefits every single American every day.\n  Section 179 expensing and depreciation is important for other small \nbusinesses as well. And it is not just small businesses, it helps keep \nour large industries going too. For example, Case New Holland and John \nDeere have manufacturing plants in my home State. They produce \ntractors, balers, and other equipment. In addition, they also make \nindustrial equipment. When farmers and other small businesses slow down \ntheir purchase of equipment, these manufacturing facilities slow down \nas well. It means less business, fewer workers needed, and fewer jobs. \nThat is how it works. It is that simple. The truth is that small \nbusiness is the backbone of our economy in this country.\n  The hallmark of America is that it has historically been the best \nplace in the world to do business. It is where everybody has always \ncome to do business. We have always had the best legal, tax, and \nregulatory business climate. We provided the certainty businesses need \nto invest, to hire people, to create jobs, and to grow the economy. \nThat is the rising tide that lifts all boats--a higher standard of \nliving for our people and revenue from economic growth, not higher \ntaxes, to reduce our debt and deficit to get them under control as \nwell.\n\n  Let's create that certainty for our farmers and small businesses \nacross this great Nation. Let's make sure their taxes don't go up. \nLet's start by passing the Tax Increase Prevention Act and section 179 \nexpensing and depreciation now.\n  I would like to close by reading from some of the letters I have \nreceived from some of my constituents. I think so often that the hard-\nworking taxpayers of North Dakota, the small business people there who \nare getting it done every day, say it best.\n  The first one is from Dick Hedahl, owner of Bismarck-based Hedahls \nAuto Plus. He said: Without section 179 and the bonus depreciation, \nHedahls Auto Plus would really have felt the pinch last year when we \npurchased equipment to service diesel powered trucks and heavy \nequipment.\n  Since the growth in the Bakken, his services have been especially \nimportant because he can save clients thousands of dollars by \nrefurbishing worn diesel engine blocks. What makes the refurbishing \npossible is the 100 percent American-made equipment Hedahl bought in \n2012 and 2013 for $450,000. At a 34-percent tax rate, he says he would \nnot have been able to make those equipment purchases work, but with \nsection 179 expensing and depreciation, he was able to make those \nthings work. As a result, he is providing jobs in the western part of \nour State. Hedahls Auto Plus employs more than 200 people.\n  Another constituent wrote in. Leann Slaubaugh of Rolette writes:\n\n       I am concerned about Section 179 and what this is doing to \n     the agricultural sector in North Dakota. Farm equipment is \n     not being sold, as the farmers are concerned about the amount \n     they will have to pay taxes on. I farm with my husband and \n     work at a small town farm supply. Farmers have quit spending \n     due to low commodity prices and Section 179. I am concerned \n     with the effect on our small town economy if Section 179 is \n     not revised. After meeting with our tax consultant, we are \n     concerned with the possible tax liability we are facing and \n     what this means to the future of our family farm. Please push \n     for revision of Section 179.\n\n  Dennis Miller, who grew up in Stark County and worked for an ag \nequipment dealership for 28 years, is similarly concerned. I am going \nto paraphrase from his letter. Four years ago he started his own \nbusiness, Southwest AG Repair, Inc. He sells new McCormick tractors and \nrepairs all brands of farm equipment. He has six employees.\n  Mr. Miller wrote to me earlier this year, anxious about the \nexpiration of section 179:\n\n       It is going to cut sales of farm equipment drastically if \n     the farmers don't get a tax incentive to purchase equipment. \n     The loss of sales will create backlash in the economy \n     throughout the State and the country. There has to be a \n     better way to create the tax revenue.\n\n  Mr. Miller, there is. You create tax revenue with economic growth, \nnot higher taxes, just like you create jobs, create economic activity, \ngetting that rising tide that lifts all boats--that is when it enables \nus to invest in the future of our country, the roads and bridges, our \nschools, and all of the things people want for this great Nation. But \nit comes from a growing economy. Of course, that is what creates the \njobs we need for our families across America.\n  So when we talk about the Tax Increase Prevention Act, that is what \nwe are talking about. We are talking about making sure here at the end \nof the year that taxes don't go up on hard-working taxpayers across \nthis country, that taxes don't go up on our small businesses across the \ncountry, and that we understand that is truly the backbone of our \neconomy, that all those people and all those small businesses are the \nones who make our economy go every minute of every day.\n  It is time to act. The time is here. The votes are here on a \nbipartisan basis in this body to get it done. Let's get it done. Our \nAmerican citizens, our hard-working taxpayers have waited long enough.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Saldana and Deyo Nominations\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, it is good to see you here today. The \nplace is a little empty. I am glad the Presiding Officer, our staff, \nand our pages are all here.\n  I rise today to urge my colleagues to support two critical \nnominations to the Department of Homeland Security. They are Russ Deyo \nto be the Under Secretary for Management at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and Sarah Saldana to be the Assistant Secretary for \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement.\n  The committee which I am privileged to lead, along with Dr. Tom \nCoburn,\n\n[[Page S6838]]\n\nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, is \nresponsible for working with the administration and others to help \nprotect our Nation's security at home and abroad. At the same time, we \nstrive to make sure Federal agencies work better and more efficiently \nwith the resources that are entrusted to them by the American people.\n  During my years of public service, I have learned that the most \nimportant ingredient in helping organizations to work is leadership. I \ndo not care whether the organization is a body such as this, a \ngoverning body, I do not care whether it is a sports team, a business, \ncollege or university, a school, the most important ingredient in the \nsuccess of that organization is leadership.\n  The Presiding Officer is one who has led the National Guard for the \nState of Montana for a number of years. He knows just what I mean. I \nthank him for his service and for his leadership.\n  When it comes to the Department of Homeland Security, the absence of \nleadership throughout the Department has been a great challenge and a \nmajor cause of the low standing in terms of employee morale that \nDepartment faces.\n  As we know, the Congress is going to soon wrap up our session for the \nyear--in a couple of days. Senators have the obligation to fill two key \nleadership posts in the Department of Homeland Security in the days \nthat lie ahead. One is the Under Secretary for Management. Mr. Deyo has \nbeen nominated by the President. I believe he is a Republican. The \nother is the Assistant Secretary for Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, Sarah Saldana.\n  As we all know, this Department plays a critical role in protecting \nour Nation from a number of threats, including terrorism, cyber \nattacks, and natural disasters, just to name a few. Given the \nDepartment's significant role in the security of our country, it is \ncritical that Secretary Jeh Johnson have a full leadership team in \nplace. That includes Russ Deyo as his Under Secretary for Management. \nThat is the third highest position in the Department.\n  I wish to take a couple of minutes to explain why Mr. Deyo's \nnomination is so important. As of this week more than 10 months will \nhave passed since the last Senate-confirmed Under Secretary for \nManagement, Rafael Borras, stepped down from his post. He was an \nexcellent public servant, a great leader. We salute him and wish him \nwell. But he has been gone for almost a year, and since then the \nDepartment has not had Senate-confirmed leadership. They need it.\n  Under Secretary Borras was widely respected by members of our \ncommittee in the Senate and the House and others for his leadership, \nmanagement expertise, and most of all, maybe, for his candor. He helped \nthe Department make strides in many areas and led the Department to its \nfirst clean financial audit--something the Department was able to \nachieve again this year for the second year in a row. Why is that \nimportant? I have a friend, and if you ask him how he is doing, he \nsays: Compared to what? Well the Department of Homeland Security--it \ntook them almost a decade to get an unqualified audit, a clean \nfinancial audit. The Department of Defense has been around a whole lot \nlonger--since the end of World War II. They have yet to get a clean \nfinancial audit. They are making some progress finally. But the \nDepartment of Homeland Security achieved it 2 years ago and then again \nthis year.\n  I think it is safe to say that the Department needs somebody with the \nsame kind of commitment and leadership Rafael Borras brought. I \nbelieve, Secretary Johnson believes, and the President believes Russ \nDeyo is that person.\n  Mr. Deyo had an impressive career in the private sector, for 27 years \nhelping to lead Johnson & Johnson, one of the top companies not just in \nAmerica but in the world. There, he was the general counsel, and he was \nvice president for administration. We are so lucky that someone with \nhis capabilities, his commitment, his smarts, his leadership skills, \nand his integrity is willing to serve in the Federal Government at this \nlevel. He also spent the last 15 years serving on the executive \ncommittee at Johnson & Johnson, which is the principal management group \nresponsible for the company's global operations. He was also a partner \nat a major U.S. law firm.\n  Russ Deyo is no stranger to public service and working with law \nenforcement organizations. He was assistant U.S. attorney for New \nJersey for 8 years. That included a period of time as chief of public \ncorruption unit there.\n  His perspective from the private and public sectors will be an \ninvaluable asset to Secretary Jeh Johnson, particularly as the \nSecretary implements his Unity of Effort Initiative at the Department, \nwhich strives to help the Department operate in a more unified, \ncohesive manner across all components.\n  If confirmed, Mr. Deyo will have a number of other challenges on his \nplate. For example, our friends at the Government Accountability Office \ncontinue to remind us that the acquisition and budgeting systems at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security are not fully mature. In fact, the \noverall management of the Department remains on the Government \nAccountability Office's high-risk list of government operations that \nneed urgent attention. Of course, if Mr. Deyo is confirmed, he will \ninherit the challenges of improving morale across the Department. These \nare tough challenges, and some have been around since the creation of \nthe Department. But I believe Mr. Deyo has the leadership experience \nand the skills necessary to tackle these challenges and to really make \na difference.\n\n  I will take a moment here, if I can. Every year there is a nonprofit \norganization that looks across the Federal Government and asks \nquestions of a lot of employees to really ascertain where morale is \nhigh, where some of the favorite places are for people to work in the \nFederal Government. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a number of \nyears has led the pack there. There are roughly 15 big Departments that \nare part of that survey, but all told, there are something like 314 \nFederal agencies that are surveyed to make up this list, and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security runs dead last among the big \nDepartments that are surveyed. Out of all of the Federal agencies that \nare surveyed, and there are 314 in all, ICE, Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, which Sarah Saldana has been nominated to lead--dead last. \nDead last. One of the reasons why, when I talk to people at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, employees, whether they happen to be \ncustoms agents, whether they happen to be folks down on the border, \nBorder Patrol, whether they happen to be TSA folks--whatever role they \nare playing across the country and around the world, among the major \nfactors they point to, explaining the low morale, is lack of \nleadership, lack of confirmed leadership. We have worked so hard to \naddress that. We have two holes left. One of them will be filled by Mr. \nDeyo--we need to confirm him--and the other by Sarah Saldana.\n  Here is what former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff--Judge Chertoff--\nhad to say when he introduced Mr. Deyo at his confirmation hearing \nbefore the homeland security committee earlier this year. Here is what \nthe former Secretary said:\n\n       Russ brings to the position he has been nominated for a \n     broad range of experience with one of the best enterprises in \n     the world.\n\n  That is Johnson & Johnson.\n\n       You will find him to be a smart, experienced, and devoted \n     public servant who will actually bring a unique set of skills \n     to this job which are very critical.\n\n  This is a former Secretary of the Department. He said:\n\n       I could not give a stronger endorsement to Mr. Deyo for \n     this position.\n\n  Mr. Deyo has also received strong endorsements from three former \nUnder Secretaries for Management at DHS, people who have had this job, \ndone this job before: Paul Schneider, Elaine Duke, and the immediate \npast Under Secretary, Rafael Borras, whom I mentioned earlier. Here is \nwhat they had to say. Here is what the three of them, in unison, had to \nsay about Russ Deyo:\n\n       Russ Deyo is an outstanding choice by the President to be \n     Under Secretary for Management.\n       An impressive leader, he brings the requisite skills, \n     experience, and leadership to this important position. He is \n     recognized as a professional, unflappable statesman who can \n     meet head-on the challenges this position faces and get \n     results.\n\n  I have had the privilege of meeting with him. I don't make snap \njudgments about people, but he is one impressive\n\n[[Page S6839]]\n\nhuman being, one impressive leader. Everything I have learned about Mr. \nDeyo over the past several months has led me to conclude that he would \nbe not only an exceptional candidate to be a manager at DHS but a \nterrific Under Secretary if confirmed.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the nomination of Russ Deyo.\n  I wish to take a few more moments to turn to the nomination of Sarah \nSaldana to be the Assistant Secretary for Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement at the Department of Homeland Security.\n  We call it ICE, the acronym. As I said earlier, of the 314 Federal \nagencies that are evaluated top to bottom in terms of employee \nsatisfaction, ICE was dead last, No. 314.\n  It has been almost 1\\1/2\\ years since they had a Senate-confirmed \nleader. They need one--not just anyone, they need a terrific leader. We \nbelieve Sarah Saldana fills that bill and meets the qualifications and \nthe needs very well.\n  Immigration and Customs Enforcement--ICE, as we call it--is a vital \nlaw enforcement agency within the Department of Homeland Security. As I \nsaid earlier, it has been without a Presidentially appointed and \nconfirmed leader for almost 1\\1/2\\ years--far too long, particularly \nconsidering all the issues we face along our borders and the more than \n400 laws--think of that--that this agency, ICE, Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, is required to enforce.\n  Some of my colleagues may not be familiar with what ICE does and why \nit is so critical for the agency to have Senate-confirmed leadership in \nplace.\n  I wish to take a minute to address that. ICE is one of the Nation's \nlaw enforcement agencies, with more than 19,000 employees in all 50 \nStates, the District of Columbia, and 48 foreign countries. What do all \nthese people do? That is a fair question.\n  In 2013 ICE special agents initiated over 125,000 new investigations, \nmade over 40,000 criminal arrests, seized $1.3 billion in currency and \nassets and took $1.6 million pounds of narcotics and other dangerous \ndrugs off our streets. That is just part of what they do.\n  On any given day ICE arrests 370 criminal aliens in the interior of \nour country, has 34,000 people in detention, and moves nearly 500 \ncriminal aliens from our country--on any given day. Managing such a \nlarge agency, with one of the most complex missions in the Federal \nGovernment, is a tall order. Thankfully, Ms. Saldana has agreed to step \nup to this challenge.\n  She is a true American success story. She rose from humble beginnings \nin South Texas as the youngest of seven children to become an \naccomplished partner at a major law firm. She is now the Nation's top \nlaw enforcement officers.\n  Ms. Saldana was unanimously confirmed by the Senate in 2011 to her \ncurrent position as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas. \nShe has a distinguished record representing the U.S. Government as the \nsenior law enforcement officer in one of the largest districts in the \nNation.\n  It spans some 100 counties. I don't know how many counties the \nPresiding Officer has in the State of Montana--we have three--but she \npresides over a law enforcement operation that has 100 counties in the \nnorthern part of Texas.\n  In this role, she deals as closely and extensively as anyone else \nwith the threats this country faces every day from transnational \ncriminal networks. This experience will serve her well if confirmed to \nlead ICE.\n  Don't take my word for it. One of our good friends in the Senate, \nJohn Cornyn, the senior Senator from Texas, felt strongly enough about \nher qualifications that he personally introduced Ms. Saldana at her \nconfirmation hearing before the committee Dr. Coburn and I lead, the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Senator Cornyn said about Sarah Saldana:\n\n       In her role as U.S. Attorney and prosecutor over the past \n     decade, Ms. Saldana has served our State with honor, fighting \n     corrupt public officials, organized crime, sex traffickers, \n     and other dangerous criminals.\n\n  That sounds like a highly qualified candidate to me. That is not all \nSenator Cornyn had to say about Ms. Saldana. He went on to say this as \nwell:\n\n       If respect for the rule of law is our standard, and I think \n     it should be, we would be hard pressed to find a person more \n     qualified to enforce the law than Ms. Saldana.\n\n  That is high praise indeed and I couldn't agree more.\n  Some are arguing we should not confirm Ms. Saldana because of the \nPresident's recent Executive action on immigration. This decision will \nprovide, though, relief from deportation for as many as 5 million \nundocumented immigrants living in the shadows today, law-abiding people \nwho are productive members of our communities.\n  Still, some argue the President's actions should preclude the Senate \nfrom confirming even a highly qualified candidate such as Sarah Saldana \nto this critical position. I think that is absurd.\n  We have before the Senate a highly qualified candidate, a person \nwho--according to her neighbor and the senior Senator from Texas--is \nfiercely independent, has served with honor in her current role, and \nrespects the rule of law.\n  It does not punish the President to leave this position unfilled, it \npunishes the citizens of our country. It makes it harder for ICE to \naccomplish its mission, and it hurts the men and women at ICE who \ndeserve a leader to ensure that this agency runs as efficiently as \npossible.\n  I believe the President acted within the bounds of the law in \nannouncing his executive action. But whether you agree with me, \nopposing Ms. Saldana's nomination will do nothing to change what the \nPresident has done, nothing.\n  I hope Ms. Saldana, the first Hispanic person and second woman to be \nnominated to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, does not fall victim \nto politics as usual in the Senate. She is by all accounts exactly what \nthis critical agency needs: a proven leader and a respected member of \nthe law enforcement community.\n  What do they say about integrity? If you have it, nothing else \nmatters. Integrity, if you don't have it, nothing else matters. She has \nit.\n  She will have a tough job ahead of her if she is confirmed this week, \nbut I believe she is more than up to the task. I urge so strongly for \nour colleagues to join me, to join Senator Cornyn, and others to \nsupport her. We will never regret it.\n  With that, I am looking around the Senate Chamber. I know we are \ngoing to have a lot of folks voting, but I don't see anybody to speak.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER.

I thank the Senator for yielding.\n\n\n                           Murthy Nomination\n\n  I rise today to speak in strong support of the nomination of Dr. \nVivek Murthy for Surgeon General of the United States.\n  In these brief remarks I will explain why I think he is a highly \nqualified nominee, why his age should not be a limiting factor at all, \nand finally why we need a Surgeon General now.\n  Dr. Murthy has been waiting for a vote on this nomination for months. \nI am glad that today the time has come to give him that vote.\n\n[[Page S6842]]\n\n  I met with Dr. Murthy a little while ago and found him to be one of \nthe most interesting and likeable people I have met--and that is saying \na lot.\n  He has accomplished much already and has a deep commitment to giving \nback through his work. I found him to be a breath of fresh air.\n  I was particularly impressed by his work at a company he founded \nwhere he identified inefficiencies in clinical drug trials and came up \nwith a solution. His innovative ideas will help medical treatments move \nto market faster. In other words, he wanted to get drugs faster to the \npeople who needed them.\n  We often speak with admiration of Americans who are technologically \nproficient, and it is rare to find someone who is not only tech savvy, \nbut is able to take that skill and combine it with the kind of medical \ntraining, creative mind, and ability to identify and solve real-world \nproblems. In Dr. Murthy, we have that someone.\n  While there are some who feel Dr. Murthy is too young and \ninexperienced to be Surgeon General, anyone who has met and talked with \nhim as I have would, I believe, come away impressed.\n  Dr. Murthy is not yet 40, but certainly his age has not prevented him \nfrom accomplishing many things. He is someone who has done much to \nsolve public health challenges in his years as a physician, and well \nbefore that.\n  He has leadership experience through his work starting and running a \npublic health advocacy organization and this includes founding a \ntechnology company.\n  He has a strong medical background and experience that demonstrates \nhis ability to take complex health information and translate it for \nothers--exactly what we need in a Surgeon General.\n  If anything, we should be doing all we can to get young, bright, \ncommitted people such as Dr. Murthy into public service.\n  Recently, this Nation found itself worried about Ebola. \nMisinformation and fear were palpable in our communities. We did not \nhave a permanent Surgeon General to coordinate the information tsunami \nthat descended on the American people from government and scientists. \nAnd without a Surgeon General, it has been a struggle to ensure that \naccurate, timely information about Ebola was disseminated to the \npublic.\n  Today it is Ebola. We don't know what public health crisis will come \nnext. We need a Surgeon General who will roll up his sleeves, survey \nthe evidence, and take action.\n  Dr. Vivek Murthy has demonstrated he will be that kind of Surgeon \nGeneral because he does not shy away from asking tough questions, \nlistening, and then developing solutions that are driven by evidence.\n  His listening skills and his ability to engage and communicate with a \nbroad spectrum of people, combined with his medical and business \nbackground--he also has a master's degree in business--will make him an \nextremely effective Surgeon General.\n  Think about this: We have a nominee who is not only a well-trained \nphysician but also has business management skills and the ability to \nengage stakeholders--be they medical professionals, faith-based \norganizations, or the public at large.\n  He can start conversations and effect real change to improve the \nhealth of our communities, particularly in his priority areas of \nobesity and mental health.\n  Again, I found in Dr. Murthy a combination of an ability to be very \ncreative, with the very important ability to listen; because although \nhe has both a medical and business background, he doesn't think he \nknows more than everybody else. So this listening ability is very \nimportant, with the ability to solve real-world problems.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Dr. Murthy for U.S. Surgeon \nGeneral.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           Saldana Nomination\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nthe nomination of Sarah Saldana. She has been nominated to head the \nNation's top immigration law enforcement agency which has been at the \nepicenter of this administration's refusal to enforce our Nation's \nimmigration laws. I am sure she is a person of integrity and character \nand has some experience at least as a U.S. attorney in Texas, but I \nwill share with everyone some of the reasons I think this is not the \nright nomination at this critical time.\n  When asked in the Judiciary Committee whether she rejects the \nPresident's unlawful action to unilaterally grant legal residence and \nwork permits to 5 million individuals illegally in the country, Ms. \nSaldana said she supported the President's action. Her answer reflects \na remarkable disregard for the rule of law that demonstrates the \ndifficulty she will have being the leader of this important agency. \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, are immigration \nenforcement officials. They are hired to work as enforcement officials. \nAs U.S. attorney I worked with Immigration and Customs officers and \nprosecuted their cases in Mobile, AL, and the gulf coast with shipping \nissues and immigration issues. That is what they do. But the President \nhas decided to tell them not to follow their duties. Now he has gone so \nfar as to unilaterally direct that those officers not enforce the law. \nHe has established a new office in Crystal City, across the river in \nVirginia. That office will begin to process millions of claims for \nexecutive amnesty. They are hiring 1,000 new employees to do that work. \nWhat we are involved in is a situation in which a law enforcement \nagency is being instructed not to enforce the law--not only that, but \nthe administration has gone beyond that and is actually providing legal \nstatus, work permits, and Social Security numbers and photo IDs, \nMedicare, and Social Security benefits to all of these people who \nentered the country illegally--which Congress refused to do.\n  The President asked for it. Congress said no. The President said: You \ndidn't act, I am going to do it on my own, after saying more than 20 \ndifferent times he didn't have the legal authority to do so. So I am \nnot going to vote for and I don't think our colleagues should vote for \na person to head this agency who believes this action by the President \nis lawful, because it is not lawful.\n  One would say: Somebody said it is lawful, Jeff, and that is your \nopinion. I served 15 years in the Department of Justice. I have been on \nthe Judiciary Committee for 18 years. In my opinion it is not lawful, \nit is not constitutional, it is not a legitimate use of prosecutorial \ndiscretion. It goes beyond anything I have ever seen--perhaps this \nNation has ever seen--in terms of violating the laws passed by \nCongress. That is the problem we have, and I think we should take a \nmoment to listen to some excellent legal scholars on the question in \nplay.\n  I would just add parenthetically that the Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement officers have the lowest morale of any of the subcomponent \nagencies in the government. It got so bad and they were so frustrated \nat not being able to do their jobs, the ICE association--representing \nsome 7,000 agents and officers--sued their own director, John Morton, \nwho held this position previously. This is the job Ms. Saldana has been \nnominated for. They said: Our supervisor is violating the law. He is \ndirecting us not to do our duties that the law says plainly we must do \nand shall do, and they filed a lawsuit in Federal court. I have never \nheard of any group of law officers filing a lawsuit saying they are \nbeing denied the right to fulfill their oath to see that the laws are \nbeing enforced, and that is what happened.\n  The judge was very sympathetic. He said this President is not above \nthe law, but he found technically that the court did not have \njurisdiction to hear the suit, and that is now on appeal. It has been \non appeal for some time. It goes to show how demoralized this agency \nis, and the fundamental reason is that every officer out there knows \nwhat is happening. They are being directed not to do their duty, and it \nis up to Congress to pass laws and Congress has passed laws and the \nPresident cannot do away with that.\n  Let's examine some of the comments we have seen from professors. \nProfessor Jan Ting of Temple University, a law professor, he was also \none of the top officials--Assistant Commissioner of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service. He has experience in that. He testified before \nthe Judiciary Committee just last week. He said:\n\n\n[[Page S6843]]\n\n\n       . . . the most comprehensive analysis of the \n     administration's deferred action policies that has been \n     produced to date is a 77-page law journal article published \n     last year by Berkeley law professor John Yoo and St. Thomas \n     law professor Robert Delahunty. In that article the \n     professors catalogued and reviewed ``the most commonly \n     offered and generally accepted excuses or justifications \n     for the breach of [the president's] duty to execute the \n     laws'' and concluded that the DACA program ``does not fall \n     within any of them.''\n\n  So basically he agrees with the professor who has written this \ncomprehensive article saying this isn't a prosecutorial discretion \nquestion. Professor Ting continues:\n  The conclusions of Professors Yoo and Delahunty have been repeatedly \nendorsed during the past three years by a well-regarded former \nprofessor of constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law \nSchool, Barack H. Obama II. President Obama--then-Professor Obama--\nhimself.\n  Indeed, President Obama said over 20 times that he does not have the \nauthority to do what he has done. For example, on March 28, 2011, he \nsaid:\n\n       With respect to the notion that I can just suspend \n     deportations through executive order, that's just not the \n     case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has \n     passed . . . we've got three branches of government. Congress \n     passes the law. The executive branch's job is to enforce and \n     implement those laws. . . .\n       There are enough laws on the books by Congress that are \n     very clear in terms of how we have to enforce immigration \n     system that for me to simply through executive order ignore \n     those congressional mandates would not conform with my \n     appropriate role as President.\n\n  That is the President himself, in detail. He considered it at this \ntime, from the detail in that answer. These are people saying, just \ngive the people amnesty yourself, Mr. President, and he said no.\n  Later, on September 17, 2013, he said with regard to his unlawful \ndeferred action for childhood arrivals program--the same principle, \nsame program:\n\n       If we start broadening that . . . I would be ignoring the \n     law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend \n     legally. So that's not an option . . . What I've said is \n     there is a path to get this done, and that's through \n     Congress.\n\n  On March 6 of this year, he stated that the DACA Program ``already \nstretched my administrative capacity very far . . . But at a certain \npoint the reason that these deportations are taking place is, Congress \nsaid `you have to enforce these laws.' They fund the hiring of \nofficials at the department that's charged with enforcing. And I cannot \nignore those laws any more than I could ignore, you know, any of the \nother laws that are on the books.''\n  In August of this year, just a few months before announcing his \nExecutive amnesty--just a few months ago, he said:\n\n       I think that I never have a green light [to push the limits \n     of executive power]. I'm bound by the Constitution; I'm bound \n     by separation of powers. There are some things we can't do. \n     Congress has the power of the purse, for example. . . . \n     Congress has to pass a budget and authorize spending. So I \n     don't have a green light.\n\n  That is true. Congress does have the power of the purse and Congress \nhas not authorized the President to set up an office in Crystal City \nand hire 1,000 people to provide legal status and work authorization, \nSocial Security numbers, and other such documents allowing them to take \nany jobs in America, and has not authorized that and hasn't provided \nmoney for that.\n  Congress should explicitly and directly--and I am disappointed that \nit hasn't this year--blocked that, which it can easily do.\n  Article I, section 8 of the Constitution is clear that Congress is \nvested with the plenary power over naturalization law. In 1954 the \nSupreme Court stated ``that the formulation of these policies is \nentrusted exclusively to Congress has become about as firmly embedded \nin the legislative and judicial tissue of our body politic as any \naspect of our government.''\n  In exercising its plenary authority, Congress has declined to pass an \nimmigration bill bestowing legal status and work authorization upon \nillegal immigrants. Congress has recognized the need to control the \nnumber of individuals who can come to this country to live and to work. \nIt has passed laws to establish rules to protect the interests of \nAmerican citizens. It is a fair system in which people apply to come to \nthe United States, they are properly evaluated, and a certain number \neach year are admitted. We admit 1 million a year lawfully on a \npermanent resident status. Those are the most generous numbers in the \nentire world. In addition to that, we have 700,000 guest workers here \nand in addition to that it appears we have another 11 million illegal \nimmigrants who have gotten into the country.\n  Now what about what is happening today, that Ms. Saldana said she \nsupports, but I believe it is absolutely wrong. President Obama's \nrecent unlawful Executive amnesty and work authorization actions have \nessentially started another system of immigration apart from the one \nthat is in law. He has created another system of law to process people \nwho want to come to America. In so doing he has violated the \nconstitutional structure that gives Congress the power to set the laws \nfor immigration.\n  In a recent paper, Professor Jan Ting, whom I noted before, said \nthis:\n\n       In effect, the president's deferred-action program \n     constitutes an alternate immigration system authorized by a \n     cabinet secretary's memoranda. While the statutory system \n     limits the number of employment-based visas to several \n     hundred thousand per year, the presidential immigration \n     system in a single year allots comparable privileges to \n     several million illegal aliens. In light of the Supreme Court \n     rulings on the ``plenary,'' ``complete,'' and ``exclusive'' \n     authority of Congress to fashion immigration policy, an \n     alternative presidential immigration system that nullifies \n     the limits of the statutory immigration system is plainly \n     unconstitutional.\n\n  That is what Professor Ting, who spent years working in the \nimmigration system, described. Professor Ting further argues that the \nadministration's assertions of authority to justify its ``alternative \npresidential immigration system''--that is a pretty good way to \ndescribe it--through prosecutorial discretion to ``defer action,'' \n``parole'' authority, and the issuance of work authorization--directly \nviolate constitutionally enacted immigration laws in the following \nways:\n\n       Ordering ICE agents not to inspect and place into removal \n     proceedings illegal aliens they encounter violates 8 U.S.C. \n     Section 1225, which expressly curtails the President's \n     discretion concerning inspection and detention of aliens not \n     lawfully admitted to the United States.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Granting ``advance parole'' to ``deferred action'' \n     recipients so they may travel back and forth between the \n     United States and their native countries violates 8 U.S.C. \n     section 1182(d)(5), amended in 1996 specifically to prevent \n     the use of ``parole'' to ``admit aliens who do not qualify \n     for admission under established legal immigration \n     categories.''\n\n  Another quote:\n\n       Granting [work permits] to millions of illegal aliens \n     ignores a century of case law, including Supreme Court \n     decisions, holding that the Executive Branch may not \n     circumvent the statutory employment-based visa system by \n     opening the labor market to aliens not eligible for such \n     visas, thereby defeating ``Congress' purpose of protecting \n     American laborers from an influx of skilled and unskilled \n     labor.''\n\n  Those are some of the things Professor Ting laid out that are \ndirectly violating law that the President has carried out in this \nscheme. He concludes: ``In other words, the president's deferred-action \nprogram sits on a plainly unconstitutional stool, which itself rests \nupon three plainly illegal legs.''\n  I think that is a fair analysis.\n  Chapman University Law Professor John Eastman also testified before \nthe Judiciary Committee that ``the President has not just declined to \nprosecute (or deport) those who have violated our Nation's immigration \nlaws. He has given to millions of illegal aliens a `lawful' permission \nto remain in the United States as well, and with that the ability to \nseek work authorization, driver's licenses, and countless other \nbenefits that are specifically barred to illegal immigrants by U.S. \nlaw. In other words, he has taken it upon himself to drastically \nrewrite our immigration policy, the terms of which by constitutional \ndesign are expressly set by Congress.''\n  I think that is indisputable. Somebody could say that is just your \nopinion. Well, I am here to decide the question. All of us are here to \ndecide the question. Did the President act responsibly, lawfully or \nunlawfully in this action? It is not a close question, colleagues. You \ncan find excuses, you can find some professor who says this or\n\n[[Page S6844]]\n\nthat, but it is not accurate. At some point in our Nation's life we \nneed to be able to ascertain and speak with clarity: Congress has the \npower to write immigration laws. Congress rejected the President's \nrequest to provide this power, and Congress should not allow this to \ncontinue because it is unlawful and in fact violates the Constitution.\n  Additionally, George Washington University Law School Professor \nJonathan Turley, a nationally recognized constitutional scholar, who \ndescribes himself as a supporter of President Obama and his policies, \ntestified before the House Judiciary Committee recently regarding the \nPresident's unilateral actions on immigration. He testified many times \nbefore Congress and frequently most usually, I believe, as a Democratic \nwitness. He said this:\n\n       It's not prosecutorial discretion to go into a law and say \n     an entire category of people will no longer be subject to the \n     law. That's a legislative decision. Prosecutorial discretion \n     is a case-by-case decision that is made by the Department of \n     Justice. When the Department of Justice starts to say, we're \n     going to extend that to whole sections of laws, then they are \n     engaging in a legislative act, not an act of prosecutorial \n     discretion. Wherever the line is drawn, it's got to be drawn \n     somewhere from here. It can't include categorical rejections \n     of the application of the law to millions of people.\n\n  I think he is exactly right. He goes on to say:\n\n       Many of these questions are not close, in my view. The \n     President is outside the line. . . . And that's where we have \n     the most serious constitutional crisis, I view, in my \n     lifetime, and that is, [Congress] is becoming less and less \n     relevant.\n\n  Professor Turley further testified:\n\n       I believe the president has exceeded his brief. The \n     president is required to faithfully execute the laws. He's \n     not required to enforce all laws equally or commit the same \n     resources to them. But I believe the president has crossed a \n     constitutional line in some of these areas. . . . The problem \n     of what the President is doing is that he is not simply \n     posing a danger to the constitutional system; he is becoming \n     the very danger that the Constitution was designed to avoid: \n     that is, the concentration of power in any single branch.\n\n  That is exactly what Madison and the Founders of our country wanted \nto create, was a system where there is separation of power, and the \npower to make law is in Congress's hands.\n  According to ICE officers and agents, they are already being ordered \nto implement the President's unlawful directives. One ICE supervisor \ntold my office:\n\n       If you sneak in through the border, get past Border Patrol, \n     stay under the radar for a few years, have kids, you will be \n     rewarded with protection from deportation. This is not merely \n     [prosecutorial discretion], this is a flagrant disregard for \n     the rule of law and our sovereignty as a nation. Even if you \n     come to the [port of entry] and claim credible fear, you will \n     eventually be released from custody because you are not a \n     priority.\n\n  According to the Partnership for Public Service's ``Best Places to \nWork in the Federal Government'' rankings released on December 9 of \nthis year--just a few days ago--the Department of Homeland Security is \nthe lowest of all the Federal agencies. That is a tragedy--that great \nagency. Of all Federal agencies----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). Senator, your time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I didn't know we had a time limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nof debate equally divided in the usual form. After that, a vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture on the Murthy nomination.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I ask unanimous \nconsent for 30 seconds and I will wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Of all federal agency subcomponents, ICE is ranked dead \nlast by its employees.\n  In June 2010, the National ICE Council, the union that represents \nmore than 7,000 agents within ICE, cast a unanimous vote of ``No \nConfidence'' in former ICE Director John Morton. That vote stemmed from \nthe fact that the agents were prevented by senior leadership from \ncarrying out their lawful duty to enforce immigration laws. Several ICE \nagents later sued Secretary Napolitano, Director Morton, and former \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Mayorkas, arguing \nthat the administration's amnesty policies caused the ICE agents to \nviolate their oath of office and Federal law by commanding them to \nrefrain from detaining certain illegal aliens. The court held that \n``DHS does not have discretion to refuse to initiate removal \nproceedings [where the law requires it to do so].'' The court also \nreaffirmed that Congress, and not the President, has the plenary power \nto set immigration law and that the administration's prosecutorial \ndiscretion and DACA policies violate Federal law.\n  Congress cannot further capitulate to this President's overreach. I \nwould ask my colleagues to heed Professor Jonathan Turley's warning:\n\n       I believe that [Congress] is facing a critical crossroads \n     in terms of its continued relevance in this process. What \n     this body cannot become is a debating society where it can \n     issue rules and laws that are either complied with or not \n     complied with by the president. I think that's where we are. \n     . . [A] president cannot ignore an express statement on \n     policy grounds. . . [I]n terms of the institutional issue . . \n     . look around you. Is this truly the body that existed when \n     it was formed? Does it have the same gravitational pull and \n     authority that was given to it by its framers? You're the \n     keepers of this authority. You took an oath to uphold it. And \n     the framers assumed that you would have the institutional \n     wherewithal and, frankly, ambition to defend the turf that is \n     the legislative branch.\n\n  The first priority of Congress must be to restore the rule of law, \nsecure the border, and bring the administration into compliance with \nthe laws of the United States. Congress cannot and must not confirm \nanyone to lead an agency in DHS or other law enforcement agency who \nsupports Executive amnesty. Congress cannot vote to accelerate its own \ndemise. It would be unthinkable to yield to the confirmation of such \nnominees in the face of so grave a threat to our constitutional order.\n  This individual is going to take this law enforcement office, U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, and she is going to execute at her \ndirection to all those officers a policy that violates law and violates \nthe Constitution of the United States as a bipartisan group of \nprofessors have so declared, and therefore I think none of us should \nsupport such an action, and therefore I would urge my colleagues to \nvote no on this nomination.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I don't understand this. I am glad the \nSenator from Alabama is still on the floor, but I just don't understand \nthis.\n  How many speeches have we heard on the floor of the Senate that the \nNo. 1 priority on the Republican side is border enforcement? How many \ntimes have we heard over and over again that before we can have any \nconversation about those in the United States, we have to seal our \nborders from the illegal immigrants coming into our country? I have \nheard it from the beginning. In fact, I heard it every time a \nRepublican Member initiated a conversation about immigration. Isn't \nthis interesting.\n  Two days ago we passed the budget bill for the remainder of this \nfiscal year that was initiated by the House of Representatives and sent \nover here. It was not called an omnibus spending bill, which would have \nmeant all of the agencies of the government are in the budget. It had \nthis peculiar name--CRomnibus. I don't know who came up with it, but \nwhat they were trying to say was that there was one agency of \ngovernment that was not included in the overall budget. What was that \nagency? Well, it turned out it was the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The Republican leadership in the House of Representatives refused to \nsend any spending bill here that would give ordinary appropriations to \nthe Department of Homeland Security. Well, what does the Department of \nHomeland Security do? They guard our borders and stop illegal \nimmigration. They have a massive responsibility at the borders, which \nthe Republicans have said repeatedly is their highest priority.\n  So the first thing they do is send us a spending bill that has what \nis known as a continuing resolution to tie the hands of the Department \nof Homeland Security when it comes to spending money to enforce our \nborders and stop illegal immigration. But that was not enough. Now we \nhear the opposition of\n\n[[Page S6845]]\n\nthe Republican side to filling the position that is responsible for \nenforcement of our borders, the position responsible for stopping \nillegal immigration. It is called ICE--Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement--which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. It \nwas created in 2003. It is the largest investigative agency in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. It is the second largest criminal \ninvestigative agency in the entire Federal Government. It has an annual \nbudget of approximately $6 billion. It has more than 20,000 employees \nand more than 400 offices in the United States and 48 foreign \ncountries. What is the responsibility of Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement? To enforce the border and to stop illegal immigration.\n  So the first--\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will not yield until I finish making my statement, and \nthen I will be happy to yield.\n  First the Republicans send us an appropriations bill, and they will \nnot pay for the agency to enforce the border and stop illegal \nimmigration, and now they come to the floor and argue against filling \nthe position that is responsible for enforcement at the border and \nstopping illegal immigration.\n  How long has it been since the Senate has confirmed a person to head \nthis critical agency? July 2012 was the last time--more than 2 years--\nbecause of repeated objections by the Republicans to filling the \nvacancy of the person responsible for stopping illegal immigration.\n  The President has sent us a nominee. I will read what has been said \nabout that nominee. Her name is Sarah Saldana. I quote:\n\n       Ms. Saldana [is] the first Latina United States Attorney in \n     Texas history, and only the second woman to hold that \n     position in the 135-year history of Texas' Northern District \n     . . . In her role as U.S. Attorney and prosecutor over the \n     past decade, Ms. Saldana has served our state with honor--\n     fighting corrupt public officials, organized crimes, sex \n     traffickers, and other dangerous criminals. Throughout her \n     career, Ms. Saldana has developed a reputation for her \n     decisive and fair temperament and her commitment to \n     excellence.\n\n  Can you imagine a more ringing endorsement for someone to head up \nICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement? You would expect that came \nfrom the White House, wouldn't you? You would think such a glowing \ntribute to this nominee must have been personally written by President \nObama. No. The quote I read to you comes from the senior Senator from \nTexas, Mr. John Cornyn. Senator Cornyn, of course, sits on the \nRepublican side of the aisle. Senator Cornyn didn't vote for Ms. \nSaldana in committee. I take that back. Every Republican Senator in the \nJudiciary Committee, including Senator Cornyn, voted against her \nnomination, so that part is accurate, but all the Republicans voted \nagainst her. Get the picture?\n  All the speeches about border enforcement, all the speeches about \nstopping illegal immigrants being the No. 1 priority of the Republican \nParty on immigration--first, they don't fund the agency; second, they \nwon't fill the position responsible for administering the law.\n  Then comes an imminently qualified woman to run the agency--to \nparaphrase the words of Senator Cornyn of Texas--and they object to \nher. They refuse to stand by her nomination.\n  If you think this is hard to understand or follow, imagine what we \nhave seen over the last 2 years. It has been about 540 days since the \nSenate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill with 68 votes. \nFourteen Republicans and the Democrats passed a comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill that had the strongest border protection in the \nhistory of the United States. It would have virtually created a \nseamless fence--literally and figuratively--on the border between the \nUnited States and Mexico from San Diego to Galveston. It would have put \nmore technology and more people on the border. Under this bill, the \npeople on the border who are working for us to stop illegal immigration \nwould have been able to literally stand and see another person standing \nhalf a mile away along the 2,000-mile border, 24/7. That is how many \npeople were in this bill. We passed it with 68 votes. It was lauded by \nconservatives and liberals, the chamber of commerce, the AFL-CIO, faith \ngroups, justice groups. They all said this is a good bill.\n\n  It passed the Senate and went to the House of Representatives, where \nit was never ever called in over 500 days. Speaker Boehner refused to \ncall the bill on the floor. Why? Because it would have passed. He knows \nit would have passed, and that is why he would not call it. It was \nbecause of the failure of the Republican leadership in the House to \neven call this bill that the President issued his Executive order.\n  We had a hearing--the Presiding Officer chaired it--last week in a \nsubcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and we discussed the \nPresident's Executive order on immigration. There were two witnesses \nwho opposed the President's order, two professors. It was Professor \nEastman and Professor Ting, if I remember correctly. I will correct the \nRecord if I am mistaken. They opposed the President's Executive order.\n  I asked a simple question: This is a world of choices, and we have \nthree choices, and I would like to ask each of you which one you would \nchoose.\n  The first choice is to continue this broken immigration system in \nAmerica and do nothing, which is the position taken by the House \nRepublicans. They have done nothing for a year and a half. So that is \nthe first choice. We could leave it as is--a broken system that we know \nhas 11 million undocumented people in the United States with no \nregistration, no guarantee they are paying taxes, and no criminal \nbackground checks. That is choice No. 1.\n  Choice No. 2 is deport 11 million people in the United States of \nAmerica who are here undocumented. Deport them. That was Mitt Romney's \nchoice when he was running for President.\n  Choice No. 3 is what the President has proposed--that anyone who has \nbeen here for at least 5 years must come forward, register with the \ngovernment, submit themselves to a criminal background check, pay their \nfair share of taxes for a temporary work permit, which must be \nregularly renewed so we can check again. If they have done anything \nwrong or if there is a criminal record, they are gone. If there is no \ncriminal record, they can stay and work on a temporary basis.\n  I said to them: Those are the three choices--the broken system, mass \ndeportation, or the President's approach. Take your pick.\n  They didn't want to make the choice. Of course not. Those are \nterrible choices if you oppose the President's position.\n  I think the President has done what is reasonable, and it is what 11 \nother Presidents have done--Executive orders on immigration.\n  I want strict border enforcement. I voted for it here on the floor of \nthe Senate, the strongest in our history. But I can't understand the \nRepublican position which opposes funding border enforcement on a \nregular basis, opposes filling the position that administers border \nenforcement, and which has no alternative to offer. That is what we \nhave before us.\n\n\n                           Murthy Nomination\n\n  I will yield the floor and add in closing that coming up for a vote \nat 5:30 p.m., if I am not mistaken, will be the nomination of Dr. Vivek \nMurthy to be Surgeon General of the United States of America. I gave a \nspeech about him earlier today. He is eminently qualified. Here is a \nman who has an extraordinary academic background, including graduating \nmagna cum laude from Harvard. He has worked on a combined degree of a \nmedical degree and a business degree. He has taught at Harvard. He is \npublished in the journals and has the support of over 100 professional \nmedical organizations that believe he would be an extraordinary Surgeon \nGeneral.\n  I ask, at a time when we are facing the greatest public health crisis \nin current memory with the Ebola epidemic, how in the world can we \nleave this post vacant?\n  I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Saldana Nomination\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to strongly oppose the nomination \nof Sarah Saldana to head ICE for a very simple reason: If confirmed as \nthe head of ICE, Ms. Saldana would be a key player in the \nadministration to help\n\n[[Page S6846]]\n\nPresident Obama further a very bad policy that is very unconstitutional \nand completely beyond the President's proper constitutional authority.\n  In my opinion, it all comes down to this very important issue of his \nExecutive amnesty--his recent decision, without authority, to move \nforward on his own, without legislative approval and without \ncongressional action, to grant about 5 million illegal aliens in this \ncountry an Executive amnesty.\n  I think that is a horrible and dangerous decision for two reasons.\n  First of all, I think the policy is wrong and is guaranteed--alas, \neven designed--to produce more illegal border crossings, which will \nincrease the problem, not solve it. Some things are pretty simple, and \none simple rule with regard to law enforcement is that when you reward \ncertain behavior, you are going to get more of it, not less of it. \nThrough his Executive amnesty, President Obama is clearly rewarding \nthat behavior and rewarding illegal crossings. In every instance in our \npast when that has happened--including a 1986 amnesty that was at least \npassed through Congress--it produced more of that behavior, more of the \nillegal crossings, and more of a problem, not less of it. I think it is \nhorrible policy from that point of view.\n  The second reason I am very concerned about this recent Executive \naction is even more fundamental, and that is because I think this is \nclearly beyond the President's proper legal constitutional authority. I \nthink his actions are clearly unconstitutional, beyond that authority, \nand therefore a very serious matter for the country and the Congress to \nfocus on.\n  I am the first to admit that every President has significant \nExecutive power, and every President has the power to provide details \nwhen statutes are silent about them, to figure out necessary details in \nimplementing and in executing statutes. His job as the Executive is to \nexecute. But that is fundamentally different from taking action that is \ncompletely contrary to statute. Of course, that is what the President \nis doing in this case--granting amnesty to about 5 million illegal \naliens when the statute, properly passed through Congress, says these \nfolks came into our country illegally, they are here illegally, and \nallowing them to stay here and work is contrary to law.\n  Again, it would be one thing if the President had to figure out \ndetails consistent with that statute, but instead he is taking action \ndirectly contrary to those statutes and that directive. It is not \nsimply prosecutorial discretion. It is not simply saying, well, because \nof a particular circumstance, we are not going to prosecute that case \nor this case or that case over there. He is making a broad policy which \nwill affect about 5 million cases, and he has gone way beyond saying: \nWe won't prosecute these cases. He is having his bureaucracy--his \nadministration--actually issue work permits by giving folks who cannot \nwork legally in this country work permits. He is telling employers to \nhire them because they have this new work permit. He is giving them \nSocial Security numbers and other affirmative identification. Again, \nthat is not figuring out the details on how to execute law; that is not \nfiguring out unspoken details about how to further law; that is acting \ndirectly contrary to our law and to our statutes on this very topic. \nClearly, anyone in the position of heading ICE, including this nominee, \nMs. Sarah Saldana, if she is confirmed, would be clearly and directly \nfurthering that bad policy and illegal and unconstitutional action.\n  To the point of this being unconstitutional, don't take my word for \nit. There are a lot of authorities on the subject, a lot of legal \nauthorities, such as professors and academic experts.\n  The Supreme Court directly recognized that on the policy of \nimmigration in particular, Congress absolutely has clear authority to \nact in that area under the Constitution. In fact, in previous opinions, \nthe Supreme Court has written that ``over no conceivable subject is the \npower of Congress more complete'' than on immigration.\n  Another interesting expert and source on this topic is President \nObama himself. Prior to taking this enormous action--in the years \nprior--President Obama said very directly to his supporters urging him \nin this direction: I don't have the authority to do it. He repeatedly \nacknowledged that.\n  He said:\n\n       This notion that somehow I can just change the laws \n     unilaterally is just not true.\n\n  He also stated:\n\n       For me to simply, through executive order, ignore those \n     congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate \n     role as President.\n\n  Well, President Obama was right back then. The problem is his recent \nactions--his Executive amnesty--constitute a complete turnaround on \nthat by doing exactly what he himself previously said he doesn't have \nthe authority to do.\n  Again, why is this pertinent? Because Sarah Saldana, if confirmed to \nhead ICE, will be a key participant in the administration thereby \nfurthering this policy that is a bad policy. It is a counterproductive \npolicy that will make it worse, not better. Even more seriously, it \nwill further this action, which is illegal, unconstitutional, and well \nbeyond the President's constitutional authority.\n  This is serious stuff. This is serious constitutional business, and I \nurge my colleagues to look hard at these matters. After they do look \nseriously at these matters, I urge my colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to vote no on this confirmation.\n\n  Again, the whole issue is serious. Illegal immigration is a vexing \nproblem. Yes, we need to act. It is a complete straw man for the \ndistinguished leader on the Democratic side to say that Republicans in \nthe House--or anybody else--just don't want to act. Of course we need \nto act. Of course we have proposed actions.\n  The question is, what actions, in what order, in what time?\n  This action is wrong on so many grounds. It is wrong on policy \nbecause it is going to make the problem worse. It is rewarding illegal \ncrossings, so we will get more of them. It is wrong, even more \nseriously, on constitutional grounds. It has gone well beyond President \nObama's legal and constitutional authority. Based on those serious \nareas of concerns, I urge my colleagues to vote no on this \nconfirmation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Murthy Nomination\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I rise to speak briefly to say that Dr. \nMurthy is about as well qualified to be Surgeon General as anyone has \never been. He brings a unique set of skills, background, and \nperspective that is going to serve our Nation very well. It is my hope \nthe Senate will take this great opportunity to ensure he is given the \nposition to serve our country with his incredible background in the way \nthat I know all Americans are ultimately going to come to be very \nproud.\n  I want everyone to know that in Massachusetts we are very proud of \nhim. We in Massachusetts know that he has developed a skill set which \nis much needed for the 21st century, much needed in an era where \ndiseases cross international boundaries, where there is a recombinant \nof DNA of disease that increasingly, because of the global nature of \nthe world we live in, is coming back here to the United States. This is \nour opportunity to put a real leader in this position--a leader who \nthen can give leadership not only to our own country but to the rest of \nthe world as well.\n  So I urge an affirmative vote for Dr. Murthy to become our new \nSurgeon General.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Small Business Legislation\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I know that so many of my colleagues are \nlooking forward to wrapping up this year's business and hopefully \ngetting home soon for the holidays.\n\n[[Page S6847]]\n\n  I wish to take a few minutes to speak about a couple of issues. First \nI wish to give some remarks about my colleague, the Senator from \nLouisiana, on her retirement, and to mention a few things that have \nbeen going on in the small business committee which will be wrapping up \nbusiness. The small business committee and Senator Landrieu are kind of \nsynonymous in my mind because my colleague Senator Landrieu has been, \nfor the better part of the last couple of years, the Chair of that \ncommittee and has done some incredible work. As legislation is moving \nthrough the final days in the U.S. Senate, we have been very successful \nin getting some important legislation passed for small business.\n  One piece of legislation we were able to make a part of the Defense \nauthorization bill is sole-source contracting for women entrepreneurs \nso they can more easily get contracting with the Federal Government. \nThat is going to help us have their great products and services more \neasily contracted and get access to those contracts.\n  There is also money for microlending programs. My colleague from \nMichigan, Senator Levin, has pioneered an idea that is so important to \nwomen entrepreneurs and that involves the kind of lending they would \nlike to see from the Small Business Administration, which is \nmicrolending, and for women to be able to get access to microloans. \nThey also want an intermediate loan level of $200,000 or less. That \nhelps them target some of the business interests they have, because we \ndefinitely need more women entrepreneurs in our country.\n  The third item is the STEP program, which is a small business export \nassistance program that works with States. The Federal Government and \nthe Small Business Administration work with States to help them target \nbusinesses within their States that can use export assistance to become \nexporters. This is such an important issue for our country, because we, \nwith a growing middle class around the globe, have a great opportunity \nto sell new products and services around the globe. But many of our \nsmall businesses are challenged by the risk of making those kinds of \nattempts to sell in those markets. So this export assistance program, \nwhich had been a pilot, is now going to be a funded permanent program. \nSo we are excited about that and excited it is moving through.\n\n\n                        Tribute To Mary Landrieu\n\n  I also didn't get a chance last week to speak about my colleague \nSenator Landrieu on the floor, so I wanted to take a few minutes now to \nremind my colleagues that as someone who has served with her on the \nenergy committee and served with her on the small business committee, I \nhave been so impressed with the accomplishments she has achieved in her \ncareer here in the U.S. Senate. For much of the time she was talking \nthe other day--rightfully so--she shared a lot of moments of her career \nand a lot of personal moments. I wanted to remind my colleagues of some \nof the very big challenges she faced as a Senator and how impressed I \nam with what she was able to actually overcome.\n  Many people know that obviously being hit by Katrina was one of the \nbiggest economic challenges not just in Louisiana but to our country, \nand her impassioned leadership and calls to hasten the efforts to make \nsure we were doing everything we could for those individuals to receive \nmedical aid and shelter and help find loved ones was nonstop for many \ndays. She successfully, as she mentioned on the floor, urged OMB to \nfully fund the repairs of the levee system in southeast Louisiana and \ncontinues that work. She succeeded in passing legislation that directed \nthe Army Corps of Engineers to analyze, design, and strengthen the \nstorm mitigation systems against category 5 hurricanes.\n  Now if any of my colleagues in the U.S. Senate have ever worked with \nthe Army Corps of Engineers, say no more. You know how challenging it \nis. We don't control them. They base all of their work on science. They \nhave a budget. It is never enough money. It can seem as though we are \nfighting them for ever and ever to get something we think is essential \nto protect the people in our State to move forward. So she did all of \nthat and moved the focus to make sure we establish a defense against \ncategory 5 hurricanes.\n  Also, if any of my colleagues ever had a flood or a storm in their \nState post-Katrina, they know the first person they were going to hear \nfrom was Mary Landrieu. She didn't stop her efforts in Louisiana. She \nwanted to take everything she learned from that emergency and call you \nup and tell you these are the things you need to do immediately and \nthis is how you should get prepared. I know she did that for many of my \ncolleagues and we so appreciated it.\n  Then another catastrophe happened--the Deepwater Horizon oilspill. As \na member of the Commerce Committee, I can tell my colleagues I spoke to \nher many times about issues as they related to the Clean Water Act and \nwhat was eventually passed, the RESTORE Act, which was a bipartisan \neffort. Basically, the bill made sure that 80 percent of the Clean \nWater Act fines from BPA went directly into the Gulf States, making \nthis the biggest individual investment in environmental conservation \nand restoration in our country's history. That was no easy task. There \nwere a lot of people at the time who wanted to focus on many different \naspects of that disaster, and so many events have taken place since \nthen. But I can remember clearly the catastrophe and what it meant for \nthe fishing community, the individuals, the States' economies--all of \nthe questions. A lot of people were looking backwards about what \nhappened, but the Senator from Louisiana was looking forward to make \nsure those funds were invested right there in the gulf. That was a big \nchallenge that she was successful in meeting.\n  Obviously, she used her voice for many issues related to Louisiana, \nbut I wish to emphasize to my colleagues how much she also used her \nvoice for many other people who didn't seem to be here in the Halls of \nWashington and made sure that those issues were at the top of the \nagenda.\n  We had the 2009 economic crisis in our country and many people \nremember because it had such a huge economic impact to individual \nfamilies. The Senator from Louisiana made sure she was standing up for \nsmall businesses during that time period. There were millions of \nAmericans who lost their jobs during that time period, and as everybody \nwas here talking about what to do to help these big banks--and we all \nknow that they got a bailout--many small businesses across the country \nactually had performing lines of credit cut out right from under them. \nSo they didn't have anybody knocking on the door to make sure they were \nbeing helped. But the Senator from Louisiana got very vocal here about \nthe prioritization of making sure that we did something about \nconventional lending and tried to tackle this issue.\n  From 2007 to 2009, the number of SBA borrowers dropped by more than \nhalf and the amount of loans dropped by more than one-third. Many of \nthese small businesses were paying the price. So Senator Landrieu got \nbusy fighting for what was the Small Business Jobs Act. If my \ncolleagues remember that debate, there were many times that some people \non the other side of the aisle didn't want to support that legislation \nor even moments when Treasury didn't know if they wanted to support \nthat legislation. She was successful in the end in getting that \nlegislation passed 61 to 38. The Small Business Jobs Act leveraged more \nthan $42 billion in loans to more than 90,000 businesses throughout the \nSBA. The bill, along with other measures, helped target about $12 \nbillion in tax cuts for small business. So while the big banks had \nimmediate relief, they had someone here in DC fighting for small \nbusinesses, and that was Senator Landrieu.\n  That legislation also saw a small business lending fund increase so \nthat there was more capital on Main Street for small business. As a \nresult of the legislation, 2011 and 2012 were the two biggest years on \nrecord for the 7(a) and the 504 program, which are kind of the premier \nprograms for the Small Business Administration. That went a long way to \nhelping small businesses begin to recover. Also, the small business \ncredit initiative helped small businesses get access to capital.\n  So all of these things were what my colleague from Louisiana fought \nfor to help small businesses. I think it is a perfect example, along \nwith those\n\n[[Page S6848]]\n\nother things about how she used her voice to try to bring clarity to \nthe challenges we were facing and stand up for those who weren't being \nheard.\n  She also, though, lent her voice to another group that is often--we \ndon't necessarily always understand all of the issues surrounding it. I \nkind of think that she took over for Senator Byrd who was a great \nadvocate on behalf of animals and spoke a lot about his dog, and many \nof the stories he shared warmed everybody's heart. Senator Landrieu \nlast year was the Humane Society's Legislator of the Year for her \nconsistent work to prevent the cruel practices of horse slaughter, to \nprotect wild animals, and strengthen provisions against animal \nfighting. So she clearly deserved that title and we certainly \nappreciate her efforts there. She was also a voice for the District of \nColumbia. People get committee assignments, and, yes, she had that \ncommittee assignment, but the thing about Senator Landrieu is that once \nshe took an assignment, she was tough on making sure those issues were \naddressed. She did that for the District of Columbia.\n\n  I want to add my sincere thanks to the Senator from Louisiana for all \nof her work and public service here in the Senate. She will be missed. \nI know she and I share a passion for the Land and Water Conservation \nFund. It is an issue that is near and dear to my heart and something \nshe has tried in her time in the Senate to get fully funded. We are \ngoing to continue that work on her behalf in the energy committee.\n  Again, I thank my colleague and dear friend for her incredible \npassion and for fighting for those whose voices were not always heard. \nThere is no mistake her voice was heard here in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Murthy Nomination\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be here today to \nspeak on behalf of President Obama's eminently qualified nominee to be \nSurgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy.\n  I request that I be permitted to yield to my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Murphy, at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. The Surgeon General of the United States is a person \nof public trust in this country who has a long and eminent record of \ninforming the Nation and fighting on behalf of the public health of \nAmericans. He has addressed some of the Nation's most pressing public \nhealth problems. Over time, there have been a variety of people in that \nposition of public trust to address some of the most pressing public \nhealth problems in this Nation. Those challenges have included nicotine \naddiction, the menaces of Big Tobacco, AIDS, and other emerging \ndiseases, nutrition and food labeling. These challenges require someone \nof courage and expertise, indeed eminence as a public health warrior.\n  In just a few months, the Nation has faced a public health crisis \nthat caused many to question who would be that warrior, that fighter, \nthat eminent and expert physician, and who would defend this Nation at \na time of public health crisis.\n  Many decried President Obama's appointment of an Ebola czar to fill \nthat position when no one could step forward as Surgeon General, and \nthe reason is that there was no Surgeon General. We lacked someone who \ncould fulfill that role because of a misplaced and misguided \nopposition. That position has been vacant for far too long. Hopefully \ntoday we will confirm Dr. Murthy and allow him to get on the job and \nget to work on this and other pressing problems facing our country.\n  Ebola cases continue to present a dire threat to our Nation because \nin parts of Africa they are still spreading. Just last week the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention announced that there are serious \ndoubts about whether the Nation's supply of flu vaccine will be \neffective against the strain of flu that is circulating this winter. We \nneed a Surgeon General to handle that potential public health crisis as \nwell. We are not out of the woods, to quote what Dr. Frieden told me in \na conversation just last week on Ebola. We are about to go into the \nwoods in the flu season, and the Surgeon General, as a leader, is \nneeded right now.\n  The Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, under the leadership of \nthe Attorney General, was deployed to field hospitals and emergency \nclinics in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the Deepwater Horizon \noilspill, and the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. They are fighters and \nwarriors for public health as well.\n  Dr. Murthy's credentials are without question. They are impeccable, \nunquestionable, and indisputable. He is a graduate of Harvard College \nand Yale School of Medicine. He completed his residency at the Brigham \nand Women's Hospital in Boston. He is one of our country's most \nrespected medical professionals. He now works and teaches at the \nBrigham and Women's Hospital. He also earned an MBA, also from Yale. He \nhas been a leader of business and nonprofit organizations that work on \nmany aspects of medical practice, biotechnology and domestic and \ninternational public health issues.\n  If the question were only about his qualifications, he would be in \nthat position right now, confirmed by the Senate, but unfortunately he \nhas been blocked. The only point raised against him, unconscionably and \nunnecessarily, is a political smokescreen, essentially, going to \ncomments he has made about gun violence as a public health issue.\n  The simple fact is gun violence impacts far too many people. It \ndestroys far too many lives. It is the second leading cause of death in \nthis country after car crashes. Gun violence kills twice as many \nchildren as cancer, 5 times as many children as heart disease, and 15 \ntimes as many children as infection. Between 2000 and 2010, more than \n335,000 people died as a result of gun violence.\n  Pointing out these facts and asking whether there are strategies we \ncould apply to bring that number down is exactly what a person tasked \nto keep Americans healthy ought to be doing. But he has said he is \ngoing to focus on issues that concern the American public health and \nwill be a fighter for American children, for Americans, against heart \ndisease and cancer and other kinds of issues that affect public health, \nespecially of children, and that is to be valued.\n  That smokescreen about gun violence should not have blocked him and \nshould not impede this body voting for him today, approving him as \nSurgeon General because of his qualifications and because he will \ncontribute enormously to make Americans healthier and safer in this \ncountry.\n  I am enthusiastically and proudly a supporter of him, and I ask my \ncolleagues to approve him as Surgeon General of the United States to \nmake America safer and healthier and to reject the slick smokescreen \nthat has tried to stop him.\n  I yield to my colleague from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his advocacy on \nthis issue. I know we are approaching a vote, so I will be brief in my \ncomments. Not to repeat those of Senator Blumenthal, but he is exactly \nright--there are absolutely no questions about the qualifications of \nDr. Vivek Murthy to do this job.\n  In addition to his professional background and his teaching \nresponsibilities, he also has a very impressive history of commitment \nto international public health--building two international \norganizations, one that empowers hundreds of youth in the United States \nand India to educate over 45,000 students on HIV prevention and another \none which works in rural health partnerships in India training young \nwomen to be health educators and counselors for thousands of patients.\n  That is a pretty impressive record, when you combine it with what \nSenator Blumenthal already laid out, for a still fairly young \nphysician, someone who will bring an enormous amount of energy to this \njob at a moment we need it. Ebola is at the top of the list as to the \nreasons why we need a Surgeon General now, but we are in a remarkable \nperiod of contraction when it comes to health care spending increases. \nHealth care costs grew by 3.6 percent in 2013, which is the slowest \nrate on record since the government started keeping track in 1960.\n  Frankly, a sound, good, sensible public health policy has a lot do \nwith our\n\n[[Page S6849]]\n\nability to continue curtailing the rate of health care spending \nincreases. Why? Because obesity rates in this country--even if they \nwere just trimmed by 5 percent, that could save $160 billion over the \nnext 10 years. Smoking, which will hopefully be a centerpiece of the \nSurgeon General's advocacy plan, contributes about $133 billion in \ndirect costs.\n  If we want to do something about the size of the health care budget \nin this country--which is something the Republicans and Democrats \nbelieve in--then we need a Surgeon General because that is the person \nwho is leading our public health conversation all across the country, \neminently qualified and desperately needed. I am glad we are having a \nvote here today.\n  Let me say just a few words about this controversy that has \nsurrounded his choice. The criticism effectively amounts to comments \nthat Dr. Murthy made saying two things, generally--one, that he thinks \ngun violence is a problem; two, that he generally agrees with where the \nPresident stands on this issue.\n  Let's take the second first. It is not surprising that the President \nis choosing people to be part of this administration who agree with him \non a variety of issues. But, as many of my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle have said, the Surgeon General doesn't set gun violence \npolicy in this country, and so there shouldn't be a question as to \nwhether he can separate his views on guns from his job, just as there \nis not a question as to whether Secretary Castro or Secretary Burwell \ncan do the same. But it is also not surprising that he has those views \nbecause the President is entitled to pick people for important \npositions who generally think the same way he does on issues that are \nrelevant to the job they are taking but also on issues that aren't in \nthat particular appointees's responsibilities.\n  But let's take the first criticism--that he made these statements \nabout guns being a public health problem, gun violence being an issue \nthat we should confront. If a nominee for Federal office is unqualified \nsimply because they have pointed out that gun violence is an issue we \nshould work on, then this debate is so far removed from what is \nhappening on the ground floor of this country as to possibly be \nirretrievable for the purposes of commonsense debate. That is what Dr. \nMurthy essentially said, that gun violence is a problem we should be \nworking on. If we can't even get to point where we all agree on that \ngeneral notion, separate and aside from whether you agree with what he \nthinks we should do about it or what somebody else thinks we should do \nabout it, well, maybe this is more hopeless than I thought.\n  I am glad we are going to move forward on a vote on Dr. Murthy today. \nHe is qualified to do this job, and he has an admirable background in \npublic health policy, in the practice of medicine, and in the teaching \nof medicine. We need a Surgeon General right now, whether it is to \nconfront Ebola or to help us continue on a path toward controlling \nhealth care costs.\n  Separate and aside from this nomination, let's agree to agree that \nDr. Murthy is right that gun violence is a problem that this country \nshould be addressing. No matter what your view on how we get there, \nthat is something we should all be able to unite around.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Murthy Nomination\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has been 10 months since the Senate \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions favorably reported \nthe nomination of Dr. Vivek Murthy to serve as Surgeon General of the \nUnited States. While this seat sat vacant, our Nation has suffered \nthrough concerns and divergent information about the possibility of an \nEbola outbreak and is on the cusp of what is predicted to be a \ndifficult flu season. It is past time to move forward and confirm this \nnomination.\n  The Surgeon General is the Nation's chief medical officer and plays \nthe role of chief medical information ``explainer'' for all Americans. \nThere is a vast amount of information available about how to best take \ncare of your health and the health of your family. The Surgeon General \nhas the authority to distill the best research to present a clear \nmessage on effective disease prevention and health promotion. As the \nhealth policy advisor to the President and the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, the Surgeon General plays an important role in \nproactively\n\n[[Page S6850]]\n\naddressing the many public health issues that face Americans. With an \naging population and chronic diseases such as diabetes on the rise, \nthis is a key position in the effort to improve the overall health and \nwellbeing of the American people.\n  Unfortunately, this nomination has been stalled for months due to \ncomments Dr. Murthy made in the context of the school shootings in \nNewtown, CT. Dr. Murthy referred to gun violence as an ``important \npublic health issue'' but also acknowledges that the causes of gun \nviolence are ``complex and multi-faceted.'' He urges Congress ``to \ndevelop a comprehensive national plan to stop gun violence.''\n  While there is significant disagreement over firearm regulations in \nour country, we should all be able to agree that reducing gun violence, \nand the devastating effects it can have on our communities, is a \npriority. Many doctors' groups treat gun violence as a public health \nconcern and believe it is a relevant and important issue to discuss \nwith patients. Dr. Murthy testified in his confirmation hearing before \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that he does ``not \nintend to use the Surgeon General's Office as a bully pulpit for gun \ncontrol. That is not going to be my priority.''\n  Dr. Murthy further explained that his ``concerns with regards to \nissues like gun violence have to do with my experience as a physician, \nseeing patients in emergency rooms who have come in with acute \ninjuries; but also seeing many patients over the years who are dealing \nwith spinal cord injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other \nchronic complications from gun violence.''\n  I am a gun owner myself, and I and have enormous respect and \nappreciation for the freedoms the Second Amendment protects. However, I \ndo not believe that gun violence, and the injuries and fatalities that \nresult from it, is a problem we can simply ignore. On average, more \nthan 100,000 people are shot every year in the United States. From 2000 \nto 2010, more than 335,000 people were killed by guns in the United \nStates. This is an issue about which we must be able to have an honest \ndiscussion.\n  Dr. Murthy's impressive background as both a hospitalist attending \nphysician and instructor in medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital at \nHarvard Medical School, and his background as the founder and president \nof Doctors for America make him well qualified to serve as our Nation's \nSurgeon General. I hope his nomination is confirmed today.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to express my opposition to the \nnomination of Vivek Murthy to be Surgeon General.\n  While Dr. Murthy may have future promise as both a physician and \npublic health expert, I have serious concerns about his current \nqualifications, as well as his choices regarding public health \nadvocacy.\n  One former Surgeon General, Dr. Richard Carmona, shared a letter with \nthe Senate highlighting his opposition to the nomination. In his words, \n``The nominee, Dr. Vivek Murthy is a physician very early in his career \nwith great promise but no formal public health education training, \nleadership or management experience.'' He goes on to say, ``His \npartisanship and lack of qualifications for the job of Surgeon General \ngive this nomination the scent of political patronage.'' This insight, \nfrom someone who served in that position, is concerning.\n  Dr. Murthy's main public policy and public health activity to date \nhas been to use the group he founded, Doctors for America, to promote \nPresident Obama's campaign to advocate for expansive gun control, going \nso far as to even recommend that doctors counsel their patients about \ngun ownership. He is entitled to his opinion, but the opinion of the \nSurgeon General becomes something much more significant.\n  At a time when our Nation is at risk from deadly chronic conditions, \ndangerous disease outbreaks like Ebola, and the ever-present threat of \npublic health disasters and pandemics, this is not the moment to \ndevalue the role of the Surgeon General. The person who serves as \nSurgeon General must be someone Americans can trust. But Dr. Murthy, so \nfar, has not demonstrated that he is capable of fulfilling that role, \nand so I must oppose his nomination at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all postcloture time \nis expired.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Vivek Hallegere Murthy, of Massachusetts, to be Medical Director in \nthe Regular Corps of the Public Health Service, subject to \nqualifications therefor as provided by law and regulations, and to be \nSurgeon General of the Public Health Service?\n  Mr. RISCH. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer) \nand the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Brown) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

On this vote, the yeas are 54, the \nnays are 39. The motion is agreed to.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the two votes scheduled in the morning will \nbe done by voice. The first vote is going to be at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow \nafternoon.\n\n\n                    Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, shortly, the senior Senator from \nConnecticut, Senator Blumenthal, will ask consent that the Senate take \nup and pass the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act.\n  The reason Clay Hunt was used as a model for this situation we have \nis because of his outstanding record. And ``60 Minutes'' has done \nspecials about him. He had two tours of duty. He was a marine who \nserved in Iraq and Afghanistan and received the Purple Heart. He was a \nwonderful human being. He even helped out in Haiti after they had an \nearthquake. But he could not overcome what happened to him in his \ncombat mission.\n  This issue is so important for our veterans. Since 7 a.m. this \nmorning until 7 a.m. tomorrow morning, 22 veterans will have killed \nthemselves. They commit suicide every day. They don't take weekends \noff. It happens 7 days a week. We need to stop this devastation--and \nthat is what it is.\n  Suicide is very personal to me. As some of you know, my good dad \nkilled himself. The heartbreak that is caused--the total loss and \ninability to understand--from a needless and preventable death of a \nloved one is hard to comprehend.\n  The Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act is bipartisan legislation. The \nbill passed the House last Tuesday.\n  I thank Senators McCain and Walsh for their work on this veterans \nsuicide issue. They have both introduced their own legislation to \naddress this important issue--a Vietnam veteran and an Iraq veteran.\n  I commend Senator Blumenthal for all of his efforts to get this \nimportant bill passed. We should not delay a minute more in passing \nthis legislation. The bill is supported by an overwhelming majority of \nthe Senate. We could pass it just like that if we could have \ncooperation. It is my understanding that there is only one Senator \nstanding in the way.\n  Let's do what is right for our veterans one more time before we close \nthe 113th Congress. Twenty-two veterans are dying by their own hand \nevery day.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 5059\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am honored and proud to follow the \nmajority leader, and I thank him for his remarks. I will make my \nremarks in support of my request for unanimous consent.\n  If there is an objection, in deference to the Senator from Oklahoma, \nI will withhold the body of my remarks until after there is an \nobjection.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of H.R. 5059, the Clay Hunt SAV Act, which was received \nfrom House and is at the desk; and further, that the bill be read three \ntimes and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  I will proceed at the conclusion of any remarks by the Senator from \nOklahoma and the Senator from Ohio.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object.\n\n[[Page S6852]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first of all, I will say that I recognize \nthe honor of the Senator from Connecticut for his distinguished service \nin the military.\n  I didn't serve in our military. I was actually in college during the \nVietnam war. I drew No. 354 on the lottery the week before I was to be \ndrafted. I had two brothers who served--not in Vietnam--in the \nmilitary. My father and both uncles served during World War II. My \ngrandfather was awarded the Croix de Guerre, the highest honor the \nFrench give, for his work during World War I.\n  I will also state that, as a physician, I know suicide all too well. \nI have failed patients in the past even though I did everything I knew \nto do. Yet they still took their lives.\n  I have also experienced it personally in my own family. I know this \nissue. I also know what we did 3\\1/2\\ months ago--we passed the \nVeterans Choice Act, which I ultimately voted against because it didn't \ndo what we promised the veterans we would do.\n  To this day Secretary McDonald has fired one person out of hundreds \nwho should have been fired because we didn't give him the right \nauthority on that day to hold the VA accountable.\n  I have treated patients with the demons that these young men and \nwomen have when they come back from war--the night terrors and the \nconflict that happens when they turn a corner and get a flashback of \nwhere they were versus seeing their wife and daughter. On top of that, \nthey have the guilt that has built up, and they wonder to themselves, \nwhat is wrong with me?\n  Thirty-four percent of the people who are applying for mental health \nbenefits today from the VA are getting seen within the appropriate \ntime. Almost everything in the bill has already been authorized and \napproved with the $10 billion that we sent to the VA.\n  When every veteran--regardless of how long his hair is or how \nunshaven or how scraggly or how nice he looks--is greeted with a smile \nand a ``yes, sir'' or ``yes, ma'am,'' when they are treated with the \nrespect they deserve at every veterans facility because they served and \nsome of us didn't, that is when we know we have put the VA back on \ncourse.\n  My great colleague from Connecticut is going to be the ranking member \non the VA Committee, along with Johnny Isakson from Georgia. I have a \nchallenge for him. I am going to be objecting to this bill because it \nthrows money out there and doesn't solve the real problem. I know most \nof my colleagues disagree with me on that, but I actually did the work.\n  I started a year before all the VA scandals started, and I documented \nnearly 1,000 deaths at the hands of lack of our oversight and the lack \nof us holding the VA accountable. People are going to make mistakes all \nthe time, but we are the ones who have no excuse for not holding the VA \naccountable.\n  Our veterans deserve the very best. We cannot eliminate all of the \ntragedies that occur with war. Some of the most remarkable things \nhappened during this bill.\n  I have a military liaison who had significant injuries as a result of \nserving this country. He got targeted by the veterans groups who wanted \nto pass this bill--talk about dishonoring a veteran. You are going \nafter my MLA who served this country with distinction, who has had \nmultiple operations because of his injuries and second degree burns in \nhis service to this country. Nothing could be lower than that. That is \npolitics at its worst.\n\n  So I believe in all my heart--I prayed all weekend. How do I answer \nthis question? And the answer to the question is to do the hard work \nover the next year. Don't pass another bill. Hold the VA accountable. \nThere should be a hearing every week on every aspect of every aspect of \neverything the VA does for the whole next 2 years so that they, in \nfact, will treat the people who put their lives on the line with the \nvery respect, the very service that they so richly earned and we have \nspoiled because we undervalue it.\n  We have great employees at most of the VA facilities, but we have \nsome stinkers. Until we change the attitude, until we hold the \nadministration of the Veterans' Administration accountable, we will \nnever change the attitude that our veterans aren't getting the very \nbest. And they deserve the very best.\n  My heart breaks for the people who commit suicide. Do we know what it \nis? They find no relief anywhere else except death. There is no answer \nfor them. We don't give it to them. We have failed them. I personally \nhave failed them in my own medical practice. So they look at the only \noption that gives them relief from the tremendous pressure and tension \nthey are experiencing.\n  I had a very close friend in the House whose son took his own life. \nWe spent years building and loving that family to help them to deal \nwith that loss. Catastrophic events, depression, and situations lead \npeople to suicide--not any one individual. They are searching for an \nanswer we have failed to give them. They are searching for the support \nand the nurturing and the love that needs to be there to say: I am \ngoing to mentor you and get you through this. That is where the VA has \nfailed. That is where the military has failed. That is where we have \nfailed.\n  Even the Veterans' Administration says everything in this bill has \nalready been authorized. So what is it really about? It is about \naddressing an issue without addressing the issue. The real, hard work \nwill come when, on C-SPAN, with me sitting in Oklahoma, I get to see \nDick Blumenthal and Johnny Isakson grilling every aspect of the VA to \nmake sure they are top notch, they are putting their sacrifice on the \nline the same way our soldiers do. That is when we start changing \nthings.\n  So, regrettably, I object to this bill, not because I don't want to \nhelp save suicides but because I don't think this bill is going to do \nthe first thing to change what is happening. What is going to change \nwhat is happening is when we as Members of the Senate and the Congress \nstart bearing down and creating the transparency that is necessary so \nthat Americans can see that our veterans are getting everything they \ndeserve and a ``yes, sir'' and a ``no, sir,'' a ``no ma'am,'' a ``yes \nma'am,'' a smile, and a greeting, and when they interact with the VA, \nthey leave there fulfilled and proud that they are a veteran.\n  I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to respond to the Senator from \nOklahoma by, first of all, expressing my deep respect and appreciation \nfor the work he has done to hold accountable the Veterans' \nAdministration and many other agencies of our U.S. Government. In fact, \nhe leaves a legacy of oversight that I will be honored to continue and \nI hope will continue through the Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  The efforts of the Senator from Oklahoma to scrutinize government \nspending through individual and independent assessments, in fact, are \naddressed in this bill in section 2, which requires, in fact, an \nindependent third party to annually evaluate the Department of Veterans \nAffairs to establish metrics, to identify the cost-effectiveness of \nprograms, and to propose best practices. Holding the VA accountable is \none of the core purposes of this bill.\n  I am asking that the Senate take up a bill that was passed \nunanimously in the House of Representatives and that is supported on a \nbipartisan basis by 21 of our colleagues, that is blocked by a single \nMember, and that will make an impact on the spreading scourge of \nsuicides among some of our very bravest and best warriors. We don't \nknow--it remains a mystery--how some of our most courageous and \nsteadfast warfighters can stare down death on the battlefield and \nsuccumb to it at home by their own hand. Those demons, those inner \ndoubts, the invisible wounds of war, post-traumatic stress and \ntraumatic brain injury are taking their toll at the rate of 22 a day.\n  This measure is actually scaled back. It is targeted and focused to \nprovide incremental benefits to those veterans who are at risk by \nproviding additional resources--psychiatrists and counselors--by \nmandating accountability in the use of those resources. That is more \nthan we did 3\\1/2\\ months ago in another measure I strongly supported.\n  I express my appreciation to our 21 colleagues who have supported \nthis measure but also to the IAVA and the VFW, to the survivors of \nveterans' suicides across the country and their families, and the \nfamilies who came before\n\n[[Page S6853]]\n\nus in the committee such as Susan Selke's, whose son, Clay Hunt, is in \nthe name of this bill. Susan Selke urged us to pass this legislation \nthat will provide for an independent and strong source of \naccountability, because she believes it is necessary to help others \nsuch as her son before they succumb, as her son did.\n  That kind of outside review to impose discipline on the VA is, as my \ncolleague has said, absolutely necessary not only for the VA but for VA \nclinics and hospitals around the country. But we need more \npsychiatrists in those VA clinics and hospitals, and this measure will \nprovide those resources, along with accountability.\n\n  In one of his most recent reports, my colleague from Oklahoma \nhighlighted the appalling case of Dr. Margaret Moxness, and I thank him \nfor that report and others he has authored.\n\n       Dr. Margaret Moxness, a former physician at the Huntington \n     VA Medical Center in Charleston, West Virginia, said that \n     when she reported patients who needed immediate mental health \n     treatment, supervisors instructed her to delay care anyway. \n     She saw at least two patients commit suicide while waiting \n     for treatment between psychological appointments.\n\n  I share my colleagues' view that we cannot simply hire our way out of \nthis problem. We have a nationwide shortage of mental health care \nprofessionals, and that is why this legislation, in section 4, grows a \npool of psychiatrists through tuition assistance, and that is why in \nsection 6 it requires the VA to collaborate with outside nonprofit \nmental health organizations to improve the efficiency and the \neffectiveness of suicide prevention efforts.\n  This scaled-back bill is a down payment. It is not the end of \nsolutions to this problem. It is a worthwhile measure that takes \nlimited, targeted steps. Much more can and should be done. It has been \nchampioned by Chairman Sanders, and I thank him and Ranking Member Burr \nfor their efforts in the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability \nAct. This job will not be done until we end every suicide--not just the \n22 every day, but every one of those 22 every day in this country.\n  Every single one of us, if we are honest with ourselves, knows a \nfamily that has been touched by this problem--every single Member of \nthis body. I know it all too well because a friend of mine, Justin \nEldridge of southeastern Connecticut succumbed to suicide as well. He \nwas deployed in combat in Afghanistan where he braved mortar fire and \nsniper fire, and he returned to his family, his children, and his \nwife--his very young family--suffering from traumatic brain injury and \npost-traumatic stress. As brave as he had been on the battlefield, he \ncould not win that war at home. He sought mental health care at the \nConnecticut VA facility. He had gone through a long battle for \nbenefits. I helped him with it. But there was a significant gap in the \ncontinuity of his medical care. Basically, he slipped through the \ncracks and eventually took his life.\n  I knew him as the founder of the Marine Corps League in southeastern \nConnecticut, which I was proud to join as a member. How he fell into \nthat black hole of depression and despair I certainly will never \nunderstand. But I hope someone could have understood it if we had \nprovided the kinds of resources that are necessary in Connecticut and \naround the country. We have an obligation to leave none of these \nveterans behind, to hold the VA accountable, to make sure the resources \nare well spent, to avoid duplication, but to reach out to those brave \nand fearless warriors who fight on our battlefields and defend our \nNation, and then are threatened and sometimes lose the war at home to \npost-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injuries--medical conditions \nthat can be overcome with the right care as soon as possible.\n  I hope my colleague from Oklahoma will withdraw his objection. I \nthank my colleagues for supporting this measure. If it fails this time, \nwe will bring it back and we will win and leave no one behind.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. WALSH. Mr. President, today the Senate had an opportunity to act \nand pass important legislation that will continue to address the crisis \nof veteran suicide. The numbers have been talked about. We are losing \n22 servicemembers--veterans--each and every day across this country. \nThousands of men and women each year are dying by suicide. If we were \nlosing 22 of our servicemembers on the battlefield each and every day, \nthe citizens of this country would be up in arms. The Members of \nCongress would be up in arms. We would be taking action to ensure that \nwe were doing something about it. I recall when this body did take \naction, I was in Iraq, in Kuwait, getting ready to go across the \nborder. There was the Secretary of Defense at that time who came over \nfor a townhall meeting, and we talked about how poor the equipment was \nthat our Reserve component members were being given to go across the \nborder from Kuwait to Iraq. Shortly after that time, the Reserve \ncomponent started to receive up-armored Humvees. The action this body \ntook made a difference. Once the Reserve components started to receive \nup-armored Humvees--the same type of Humvee our Active-Duty \ncounterparts are receiving--it did make a difference.\n\n  This body has an opportunity to take action. We have put over a \nmillion men and women into the VA health care system over the past 13 \nyears, and we have not provided the resources our men and women in the \nVA need to take care of these men and women who have been put into the \nVA health care system.\n  When we talked about the fact that the VA health care system needs to \ndo a better job, think about us not providing them with the resources \nthey need to do their job. That is what this body is being asked to \ndo--to provide the VA health care system with the resources and provide \nadditional psychological health care providers in VAs all across our \ncountry so that the men and women who are coming back with \npsychological wounds of war can be dealt with.\n  When I introduced the first version of this important legislation \nback in March, I committed to use my time in office to bring attention \nto this issue. I thank all the Members of this body who have stood up \nand all the organizations that have come together and realized we have \na problem. There are 22 men and women each and every day dying by \nsuicide. We need to do something. We have done some things, but it is \nnot enough.\n  It is a terrible disservice to millions of veterans and their \nfamilies that this important bill has been blocked from passing because \nwe are not doing everything we can do. Congress can't just thank our \nveterans. We hear each and every day on this floor and in the House how \nmuch we appreciate our veterans and how much we appreciate the men and \nwomen who are willing to sign on the dotted line, how much we \nappreciate their families for the sacrifice they make each and every \nday while our men and women are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Our men and women who serve in the Armed Forces are willing to put \ntheir lives on the line for our freedoms and the things we enjoy each \nand every day across this country. We need to do more than provide \nlipservice from this Chamber about taking care of our men and women who \nsign and are willing to give their lives for this country and for those \nwho have given their lives for this country.\n  As somebody who has seen the invisible wounds of war in the men and \nwomen under my command, I am deeply disappointed today that we haven't \nbeen able to pass this legislation and begin taking action to help our \nmen and women who are contemplating dying by suicide.\n  One of the pieces of this legislation--right now when a young man or \nwoman comes home, he or she can go to the VA, and they are taken care \nof for up to 5 years. Sometimes the wounds of PTSD or traumatic brain \ninjury take longer than 5 years to surface. We need to continue to \nprovide that service for up to 10 years or, in my opinion, for as long \nas these men and women are around and still living. Again, they were \nwilling to put their lives on the line for this country.

I ask unanimous consent that the energy committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of H.R. 2126 and the Senate \nproceed to its immediate consideration; that the bill be read a third \ntime and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, this is with regard to the energy \nlegislation that passed the House and has four commonsense, simple \nprovisions we hoped to be able to pass by unanimous consent tonight, \nand hopefully I will be able to convince my colleagues it is something \nthat is good for American jobs, American business, and for energy \nefficiency. There are four or five speakers who would like to talk on \nthis. What I would like to do, if I could, is ask them to begin the \ndebate here and then I will wrap it up at the end.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of my colleague and my \npartner in this energy efficiency effort, Senator Portman, to support \nhis unanimous consent request that the Senate pass H.R. 2126, the \nEnergy Efficiency Improvement Act.\n  I am disappointed to hear Senator Coburn's continued objection to \nthis legislation and to energy efficiency measures. This bill is \nidentical to a more narrowly focused energy efficiency bill Senator \nPortman and I introduced recently in the Senate. It tracks closely to \nlegislation we have been working on actually for 4 years, the Energy \nSavings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, also known as Shaheen-\nPortman.\n  The legislation before us, H.R. 2126, is really a shortened version \nof Shaheen-Portman. Unfortunately, as we know, the longer version, the \nenergy efficiency act, has stalled twice on the Senate floor--not due \nto concerns about what was in the bill but because of disagreements \nover other issues that were related to energy but unrelated to our \nbill.\n  While we may not be able to pass the larger bill this session, the \nSenate still has an opportunity to pass meaningful energy efficiency \nlegislation by passing H.R. 2126. This is bipartisan legislation that \nwas introduced in the House by Representatives McKinley, a Republican \nfrom West Virginia, and Welch, a Democrat from Vermont, and passed the \nHouse earlier this year with overwhelming support from both sides of \nthe aisle, 375 to 36.\n  That broad bipartisan support extends beyond Capitol Hill. It enjoys \nthe support of business groups and environmental organizations and \nefficiency advocates who all recognize that energy efficiency is the \ncheapest, fastest way to begin addressing the Nation's energy needs. \nSupporters include everyone from the Natural Resources Defense Council, \nto the U.S. Green Building Council, to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nand the Real Estate Roundtable. The list of businesses and \norganizations that have endorsed this bill numbers over 200.\n  This bill contains several provisions that will encourage efficient \nenergy consumption, and as a result of this legislation, consumers and \nfamilies will save money. The legislation will grow our economy, create \njobs, and it will reduce pollution. It really is a win-win.\n  Even though it is not the longer version of energy efficiency \nlegislation Senator Portman and I have been working on for the last 4 \nyears, it will do a number of things that are critical to address our \nenergy needs.\n  First, it will create a voluntary, market-based tenant star program. \nThis is modeled after the successful ENERGY STAR labeling program from \nbuilding owners. It sets up a voluntary certification system for \nefficiency and commercial tenant spaces.\n  I see my colleague from New Hampshire Senator Ayotte, who I think is \ngoing to speak to this provision in the bill.\n  I think it is important to remind people that what it does not do is \nprovide financial incentives or create new regulations. It does not do \nthat. It is a voluntary, market-based, business-friendly approach to \nencourage energy efficiency in commercial buildings. It also will \nestablish a benchmarking and disclosure process for energy consumed in \nfederally leased buildings, so we will all know how much energy is \nbeing consumed.\n  Third, it will require Federal agencies to implement strategies to \nincrease the efficiency of data centers that are operated by the \nFederal Government--a huge user of energy.\n  Finally, it will remove a regulatory barrier to the manufacturer of \nlarge-scale water heaters. It is something Senator Hoeven has been \nworking on for a long time.\n  These four commonsense, targeted provisions are widely supported. As \nI said, they will grow our economy and help create jobs and demand for \nthe American-made energy efficiency technologies. They will save \nbusinesses and families money on their energy bills, and they will cut \npollution.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Portman in this unanimous consent \nrequest, and I am disappointed that once again we are going to be \nprevented from moving forward with commonsense energy efficiency \nmeasures. I do hope that with the continued support on both sides of \nthe aisle for energy efficiency, we will be able to come back before \nthe end of this year and pass this measure.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire for her leadership on this important legislation, \nand I join her request, as well as the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Portman's \nrequest for unanimous consent on H.R. 2126 that passed the House \noverwhelmingly in March by a vote of 375 to 36. Why is that? Because \nthis is commonsense, bipartisan legislation that creates jobs, \nincreases energy efficiency, reduces the amount of energy we need to \nuse, and less pollution--and think about our overall goals of making \nsure America remains safe, energy independent, and energy secure, and \nit does it all in a way that is market-based, in a way that you have \nseen overwhelming support from both the business community and the \nenvironmental community.\n  This House bill on which we are asking unanimous consent is a \ncompanion bill to the work done by Senators Portman and Shaheen in the \nEnergy Efficiency Improvement Act, of which I am proud to be a \ncosponsor. This is an area where I believe we can find strong common \nground in this body--energy efficiency measures that are market based, \nthat move us forward to use less energy and create American jobs.\n  Within this bill is a provision called the Better Buildings Act, \nwhich I was proud to introduce with Senator Bennet from Colorado, and \nthis is commonsense, no-cost legislation that would help boost energy \nefficiency in commercial buildings through the design and construction \nof efficiency improvements in leased tenant spaces in commercial \nbuildings. So one of the important pieces of this legislation that is \ncontained in the Better Buildings Act actually brings the tenants into \nthe discussion. It is voluntary. It creates a situation where we have \ntenants and owners working together to reduce energy costs, save us \nmoney, and create jobs.\n  So I am hopeful that this bill will be cleared, this legislation. If \nyou look at the list of groups that are supporting this legislation, it \nis not often that these groups all come together, and it really speaks \nto the commonsense nature of this legislation, the importance of it.\n  I, again, want to thank my colleagues for their leadership, \nespecially Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman. I hope as a body we can \nget this done because this is just plain common sense.\n\n[[Page S6855]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I too want to join in the unanimous \nconsent that has been raised by my colleagues Senator Portman and \nSenator Shaheen on this very important bill. I have to say it feels a \nlittle bit like instead of calling it the energy efficiency bill, we \nneed to call it the groundhog day bill because it just keeps coming \nback. It is a measure that, as my colleagues have mentioned, is so \ncommonsense. When we think about ways that we can do more to be \nresponsible stewards of our energy resources and do more to reduce our \ncosts, energy efficiency is just calling to us all.\n  What we have in front of us today is not the full-on energy \nefficiency bill that Senators Shaheen and Portman have been working so \ndiligently on for so many years now, but it is a slimmed-down version \ncoming across from the House, a House-drafted, Republican-sponsored, \ncost neutral bill that passed that Chamber on suspension back in March, \nas was noted, by an overwhelming margin of 375 to 36. There are four \nmajor provisions in the bill, but none of these provisions are \ncontroversial. Probably the most important to us right now is the time-\nsensitive provision that provides regulatory relief for our rural \nelectric co-ops. Under a consent decree from 2010, water heater \nmanufacturers have until just mid-April--April 16--of this next year to \nmeet revised minimum efficiency standards from the Department of \nEnergy.\n\n  So you have got a situation where, in anticipation of this deadline, \ncompanies that make certain types of water heaters are already stopping \ntheir production. As a result, you are going to have co-ops that will \neffectively no longer have the ability to purchase them and use them in \ntheir systems. So they are coming to us and saying, ``Help.'' We need \nto have some certainty here and now.\n  What we do in this measure--what the House does is simply exempt \nrural co-ops and creates a different, achievable standard for them. It \nis a compromise that has been forged by the co-ops, the industry, the \nDepartment of Energy. Senator Hoeven has been leading on this and has \nbeen great. This is something that needs to be addressed and it needs \nto be addressed now rather than later.\n  The remaining provisions within this measure are all voluntary \nefficiency programs. One focuses on the efficiency of commercial office \nbuildings, another provides greater information about energy usage in \nthe buildings, and then the third looks at energy-efficient government \ntechnology and practices.\n  Again, none of these are controversial. None of them impose mandates, \npenalties, or taxes. CBO has deemed them to cost nothing. So there is \nonly benefit. There is only an upside. So, again, we have seen the \nfull-on energy efficiency measure before us now two separate times on \nthis floor. We have reported that bill from the energy committee on a \nstrong bipartisan basis.\n  We really should be moving to do right when it comes to energy \nefficiency. Senators Shaheen and Portman have led that effort. The \nHouse has now acted. It is unfortunate that we will not be able to \nresolve this. But I am certainly committed to working with my \ncolleagues in the new year to advance what, again, is just simple \ncommon sense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nAlaska for her leadership of our energy committee on this and many \nother important energy issues. I want to follow along with much of what \nshe just covered and why it is important.\n  In this legislation, which is sponsored by Senator Portman and \nSenator Shaheen, there are a number of energy efficiency measures. But \nthe one she emphasized and the one which I want to emphasize is the \nwater heater efficiency provision. This is a commonsense provision. It \nis very important for people in rural areas across the country.\n  The rural electric cooperatives have been very strong on working to \nget this legislation passed. They have gotten it passed in the House on \nbehalf of all of those people out there in rural America where this can \nmake a real difference in terms of quality of life, but at the same \ntime save energy and save money. So it is one of those measures where \neveryone wins all the way around.\n  We have sponsored this in a number of different forms. We have not \nbeen able to move it through the Senate yet. We will, I am convinced, \nmove it through next year. But as the good Senator from Alaska said, \nthere are some timelines here that make it very important that we get \nthe measure passed.\n  Essentially what we are dealing with is in 2010, the Department of \nEnergy issued a rule on water heaters that will effectively ban the \nmanufacture of large electric water heaters beginning in 2015--so next \nyear--which could greatly affect consumers in rural areas and hurt the \neffectiveness of some of our demand-response rural programs.\n  Many of our rural areas are not serviced by natural gas, and \ngeothermal water heaters can cost many thousands of dollars. So this is \na practical win-win amendment that improves the efficiency of electric \nwater heaters but still lets our rural areas have access to affordable, \nefficient water heaters that can supplement renewable energy.\n  Electric cooperatives and other utilities have voluntary demand-\nresponse programs that use electric water heaters to more effectively \nmanage power supply and demand. In those areas where renewables are \npart of the electric generation system, those water heaters facilitate \nthe integration of renewable energy that can be stored for use during \npeak hours, like wind and solar energy.\n  So this provision would allow the continued manufacture of large \ngrid-enabled electric resistance water heaters only for use in electric \nthermal storage or demand-response programs, meaning you are using \noffpeak load. So you are using lower cost energy, energy that otherwise \nwould be lost. So, again, it really is a win for everybody involved.\n  This provision would require grid-enabled water heaters to have a \nvolume of more than 75 gallons, be energy efficient, and work on grids \nthat have a demand-response program. It is that simple. It is that \nstraightforward. It is that commonsense.\n  But it affects a tremendous number of people across rural America, \npeople in States such as Indiana, North Dakota, Ohio, across the \ncountry. I am convinced we are going to get this. The issue is when. We \nare facing this timeline, as I say, in 2015.\n  I will conclude with some of the organizations that support this \nlegislation. I do not know of anyone opposing it. We have got a \ntremendous number of organizations that support it, including the Air \nConditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, the American \nCouncil for an Energy-Efficient Economy, the American Public Power \nAssociation, Edison Electric Institute, the General Electric Company, \nNational Rural Electric Cooperative Association, the National Resource \nDefense Council, the Northwest Energy Alliance.\n  The bill saves money, it saves energy, it benefits the environment, \nit benefits consumers. Look, we need to get it passed. This bill on the \nfloor easily gets more than enough to pass on a bipartisan basis with \nflying colors.\n  I would certainly yield the floor to our leader on this important \nissue, the good Senator from Ohio.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota. \nHe has done a great job of talking about the importance of the overall \nbill, and then these four small provisions we are trying to do tonight. \nBut specifically he made a great point about the importance of dealing \nwith this water heater issue. He feels it every day, because in North \nDakota he is hearing from his rural electric co-ops saying: This is \ncrazy. Why would we not go ahead and pass this legislation?\n  In effect, what he just said was: We need to pass this legislation to \nbe able to keep the Federal Government from imposing a regulation that \nmakes no sense for anybody, whether you believe in energy efficiency or \nnot. It makes no sense for anybody.\n  I am hopeful we can get this done. I know we had an objection earlier \nin the\n\n[[Page S6856]]\n\nprocess this evening. I am hopeful we can convince the colleague from \nOklahoma who objected that this is commonsense legislation that has to \nget passed.\n  We have heard from Senator Shaheen also, who has been the Democrat \nleader on this with me. We also heard from the chairman of the energy \ncommittee come January, Senator Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska. \nShe is a strong supporter. We have heard from Senator Ayotte, also a \nRepublican from New Hampshire, who is an expert on energy efficiency as \nit relates to what is called Tenant Star and better building programs. \nThis is one thing that we ought to be getting done here during this \nlameduck session of Congress. We are doing other things that I think \ncould be improved, but this is one where it is so simple.\n  Just to be sure people understand what we are talking about tonight, \nthese are four provisions that have all passed the Senate committees, \nhave all passed the House committees--unanimously, by the way, these \nfour provisions passed unanimously in the Republican House of \nRepresentatives. It has come to the floor twice here in the Senate.\n  For other reasons which had to do with process and not allowing \namendments, the overall bill was objected to, but not these four \nprovisions. Then these four provisions went to the House floor for a \nvote. They were passed overwhelmingly 375 to 36. This is the sort of \nlegislation that has been fully vetted. Everybody knows what is in it. \nIt is being supported across the spectrum. We could help people right \naway.\n  There is also an urgency here, because these manufacturers that are \nmaking these water heaters that the Department of Energy, under their \nregulations, wants to prohibit, those manufacturers are telling us the \ndeadline is right now. Even though it is not until March-April that the \nregulations have a deadline, the manufacturers are already stopping \nproduction of these water heaters because it takes that long to get \nthem manufactured and get them distributed out to those rural co-ops.\n  It is urgent that we do this now and not wait until January. If we do \nnot, we are going to hurt a lot of consumers and we are going to hurt a \nlot of these rural electric co-ops, and again do something that makes \nno sense. You want to encourage these water heaters to be built, \nbecause these water heaters are part of a program where, because they \nare not used during peak times, called the demand-response program, \nthey actually save energy. This is a good thing. I am hopeful that \nprovision will be able to get through, along with the others.\n  This is a bill, again, that has already passed the House, unanimously \nout of committee, overwhelming vote on the floor. All we have to do \ntonight is say yes and it goes to the President for his signature. The \nadministration has indicated they will sign it. It will then become \nlaw.\n  There are three other provisions we should also talk about. One is \ncalled the Tenant Star provision. It was talked about a little bit \nearlier tonight. Let me be sure people understand what it is.\n  Some of you are aware of a program for appliances called ENERGY STAR. \nThat is so you, as the consumer, can go into an appliance store and \ndetermine whether something meets the standard, the Good Housekeeping \nSeal for energy efficiency. When we bought a dryer recently, that was \nnice to be able to know whether it had the stamp of approval. Some \npeople like energy-efficient appliances. Why? It saves you money. It is \nalso good for the environment. So that is not a mandate. It is not a \ntax incentive. It is not a grant program. It contains no regulatory \nauthority. There is nothing in it that requires any new spending. But \nit does give a boost and a powerful branding opportunity to commercial \nreal estate owners to market their buildings to tenants, investors, and \nother key audiences. It says, just as the appliance Good Housekeeping \nSeal says, it says to a business owner: This tenant space is efficient. \nIt meets the Tenant Star requirements. That is why this provision is so \nstrongly supported by the commercial real estate industry, \norganizations such as the Real Estate Roundtable, the International \nCouncil of Shopping Centers.\n  By the way, the industry considers this provision as an important \nalternative to onerous regulations. They like this because this is \nvoluntary. As consumers, we should all like it, because it is something \nthat gives us more information to be able to make a good decision.\n  The third provision we are talking about tonight has to do with the \nFederal Government. Let me make this very clear. The Federal Government \nis the biggest user of energy in the world, and one of the \nmost inefficient, unfortunately. So the Federal Government said: \nEverybody needs to be more focused on energy efficiency.\n\n  As I looked at this, we ought to get the Federal Government to \npractice what it preaches. That is what this provision does. It does it \nwith regard to information technology. We hear constantly from outside \ngroups that this is one area that is ripe for savings. In other words, \nthere are lots of energy savings that could be accomplished in the \nenergy area through information technology being used more efficiently.\n  We have had hearings on this, had testimony on this. We know this is \nan area where we can have a lot of savings. This would require the \nFederal Government, again, to coordinate with the Office of Management \nand Budget, with the Department of Energy, with EPA, to develop an \nimplementation strategy that includes best practices, measurements, \nverification techniques for the maintenance of IT, the purchase of IT, \nthe use of energy-efficient information technology.\n  There is so much more we can do here with regard to IT. We know that. \nThat is why it passed the House unanimously in committee and \noverwhelmingly on the floor, because we know this is an area where the \nFederal Government--your tax dollars being spent can be much more \nefficient, good for the environment, good for taxpayers, less energy, \nand overall good for our energy policy in this country.\n  Finally, the fourth provision. Remember, four simple provisions have \nto do with an existing requirement that commercial buildings leased by \nthe Federal Government have to disclose their energy usage. This \nmodifies that provision. It says you have got to provide more \ninformation with regard to what the actual energy usage is in these \nbuildings.\n  Again, the Federal Government--recall, largest energy user in the \nworld--to make them more efficient with regard to their buildings makes \nall the sense in the world. These are commercial buildings leased by \nthe Federal Government. So, again, this is not a mandate on the private \nsector. This does not cost anything. It does say that we need to modify \nthe requirements of commercial buildings leased by the Federal \nGovernment to disclose their energy usage data.\n  This would help all of us. These are commonsense proposals. They are \nbipartisan. They are long overdue. They can go to the President after a \nvote tonight for his signature. They could become law.\n  I want to thank everyone who has been involved in this small bill, \ngetting it to the floor, including Senator Murkowski, whom we heard \nfrom earlier, who is the ranking member, soon to be Chair of the energy \ncommittee; also Senator Landrieu, the current Chair of that committee. \nAlso Senator Ayotte we heard from, Senator Shaheen, Senator Hoeven, \nSenator Bennet were on the floor earlier to speak on this issue.\n  I want to thank the many industry groups, the businesses, the energy \nefficiency organizations out there that have helped us to craft \nlegislation with such broad support.\n  The least expensive energy is energy we don't use. Yes, we should \nproduce more energy. I am for that. We should also use the energy we \nhave more efficiently. It helps create jobs. It helps make our country \nsafer because it is a national security issue to make America energy \nindependent.\n  It ensures that we will have a better environment, and it ensures \nthat every dollar a small business or manufacturer is spending on \nenergy is used most efficiently. It makes us more competitive in this \nglobal economy we find ourselves in. That leads to more jobs, higher \nwages, all the things we should be doing in this Congress.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for listening tonight. I thank the \nAmerican people for listening, and I hope they\n\n[[Page S6857]]\n\nwill strongly support the legislation we are putting forward tonight \nand the broader bill that will come to the floor we hope after the \nfirst of the year, because after the first of the year we will have a \nchance to take up this issue, not only these four provisions if they \naren't passed over the next couple of days but a broader bill that will \nbe broadly supported by Republicans and Democrats alike that will help \nour country become more energy efficient.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WALSH. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, on first glance, one might not think that \nMichigan and Vermont share much in common. But to delve deeper is to \nsee that both States have deep roots in their rural populations, strong \nagricultural bases, and stunning natural landscapes. Senator Carl Levin \nhas represented the people of Michigan in the U.S. Senate since 1979. \nHe is one of this Chamber's most senior Members and one of the longest \nserving Senators in history. He has cast more than 12,500 votes on \nbehalf of his constituents.\n  Senator Levin has worked to ensure that the lakes of Michigan will be \nclean and safe for generations of Michigan residents to come. He has \nsponsored legislation to protect and restore the Great Lakes and their \nabundant wildlife habitats and secured millions to bring Michigan's \nlakes back to their natural pristine glory, and he has supported the \nGreat Lakes Fishery Commission, which has supported the Great Lakes, \nLake Champlain, and international waterways.\n  As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin has \nbeen a powerful force in crafting our Nation's defense policy, \nparticularly in the post-9/11 era. The battlefield has been vast, and \nhis support of our troops has never wavered. He has consistently worked \nto ensure that the brave men and women serving in uniform have the \nsupport they need to keep our Nation and our allies safe. He and I \nshared reservations about launching a war in Iraq, reservations that \nhave proven sound.\n  I was particularly moved by Senator Levin's strong support--and \nsteadfast leadership--in advancing the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd \nJr. Hate Crime Prevention Act. That measure ultimately became law in \n2009, in large part to Senator Levin's commitment to ensuring its \ninclusion in the National Defense Authorization Act. This Federal hate \ncrimes law took years to achieve. At a time when it may have been \neasier to push a final vote down the road, Senator Levin worked with me \nto ensure that it was considered by the Senate and then upheld through \na conference committee. This alone would be a remarkable achievement, \nbut Senator Levin's Senate career boasts many achievements.\n  I have also been honored to work with Senator Levin to reaffirm our \nNation's commitments to those citizens of the world who, persecuted, \noppressed and stateless, look to our country for protection. He has \nbeen a voice on behalf of displaced Iraqis and Syrians, and a \ndependable cosponsor of my Refugee Protection Act.\n  From protecting America's waters to crafting America's actions \nabroad, Senator Levin has been a powerful and invaluable presence in \nthe Senate. He heads now into retirement, where I know he and Barbara \nwill enjoy spending time with their three wonderful daughters and \nbeautiful grandchildren. Marcelle and I wish him and Barbara the very \nbest in this new chapter. I will miss him.\n\n\n                               Tom Harkin\n\n  Madam President, Senator Tom Harkin and I came to Washington in the \nsame year--Tom, to the House of Representatives, and I, to the Senate. \nFor nearly 40 years, he has represented Iowans with the even temper and \nstrong commitment that has become a hallmark of his tenure.\n  Senator Harkin has been a leading defender of rights for persons with \ndisabilities, anchored by the landmark law he authored, the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act. Inspired by the challenges faced by his own deaf \nbrother, Harkin led a crusade to enact this historic legislation, \nensuring that individuals living with disabilities could not be \ndiscriminated against because of those disabilities. The ongoing effort \nto protect and support Americans--and people around the world--living \nwith disabilities, has become a cornerstone of Senator Harkin's career.\n  As chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions, HELP, Senator Harkin has helped create a new model of health \ncare, one focused on prevention and health rather than reaction and \nsickness. He was one of the leaders in crafting the Affordable Care \nAct, giving millions of Americans better access to health care. He has \ncontinually fought for the missions of and the funding for the Centers \nfor Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health, and the Food \nand Drug Administration.\n  I have worked with Senator Harkin on a number of matters, from \ninternational human rights to critical funding for breast cancer \nresearch. Senator Harkin and I have worked together in our shared \ncommitment to America's farmers and farming, an industry that it so \ncritical to both our States. Together we have worked to increase \nconservation funding, promote water quality, and protect the \nenvironment while supporting our family farmers.\n  Tom Harkin is a lifelong Iowan. He and his wife Ruth have given \ndecades in public service representing the people of Iowa. I want to \ncongratulate him on an accomplished career and wish him, Ruth, their \nwonderful children and grandchild all the very best.\n\n\n                            Jay Rockefeller\n\n  Madam President, for nearly 30 years, West Virginians have elected \nJay Rockefeller to represent them in the U.S. Senate. When he retires \nin January, he will leave a record of tireless service on behalf of \nWest Virginians and all Americans.\n  Senator Rockefeller ranks among the champions of affordable health \ncare. He coauthored the Child Health Insurance Program, CHIP, a program \nI have also been proud to support, which provides health care coverage \nto more than 6 million children each year, who would otherwise be \nuninsured. A former chair of the Veterans Affairs Committee, he \nauthored legislation to improve care for our Nation's heroes. He was \ninstrumental in the creation of a commission on long-term care to look \nfor solutions to a lack of essential long-term medical support for \nmillions of Americans. With Ted Kennedy, he led the charge for health \ncare reform in the Senate in the 1990s. The list of achievements goes \non.\n  For nearly 50 years, Senator Rockefeller has served the people of \nWest Virginia as a State representative, a secretary of state, a \ncollege president, a Governor, and, for the last 30 years, as a U.S. \nSenator. He is a dear and valued friend. I wish Jay and his wife Sharon \nthe very best as he retires from the Senate.\n\n\n                              Tim Johnson\n\n  Madam President, the senior Senator from South Dakota, Tim Johnson, \nis as fine a public servant as I have known. These are words I have \nused before about Senator Johnson. As he approaches his retirement from \nthe Senate, they are as true now as ever before.\n  Senator Johnson embodies the traits of a dedicated public servant. He \nrepresents South Dakotans with every fiber of his being. He is the \ngreat-grandson of a homesteader who settled in South Dakota when it was \nstill a territory. And he has never lost sight of the interests of the \nconstituents he has served in Congress for more than 25 years. Never \none to rest on the job, he introduced more legislation in his freshman \nterm than any of the almost 60 new Members of Congress that term.\n\n[[Page S6858]]\n\n  Vermont and South Dakota share similar rural challenges, and in \nSenator Johnson, I have found a partner in such efforts as protecting \nrural schools and giving them a voice in national competitions like \nRace to the Top. He and I share a strong commitment to supporting small \nfamily farms, an effort he has been recognized for by the National \nFarmers Union and others. Through the Appropriations Committee, Senator \nJohnson has been a stalwart defender of our Nation's veterans, and \nthrough his chairmanship of the banking committee, he has fought for \nmiddle-class families with steadfast diligence.\n  Senator Johnson has faced no shortage of challenges in his life. But \nwith his wife Barbara by his side, he has met all of these challenges \nwith determination and with grace, and he remains a fierce defender of \nSouth Dakota and a friend. As he retires from the Senate, I wish him, \nBarbara, his children and grandchildren and his entire family all of \nour best wishes.\n\n\n                             Mary Landrieu\n\n  Madam President, for nearly 20 years, Louisianans have had no greater \nadvocate, and no stronger voice, than that of Mary Landrieu. She has \nbeen a crusader for her State, and even today continues to fight to \nbuild on Louisiana's recovery from the devastating storms of 2005 that \nwreaked havoc across Louisiana and throughout the city of New Orleans.\n  It was in 2005 that Hurricanes Katrina and Rita ravaged the gulf \ncoast, devastating New Orleans. Then in 2010 the Deepwater Horizon \noilspill sent millions of barrels of oil into the gulf, coating \nLouisiana's beaches and wildlife. During these terrible times Louisiana \ncould have had no better advocate than Senator Landrieu. After Katrina, \nSenator Landrieu secured more than $120 billion in recovery money to \nhelp restore New Orleans and Louisiana's coast. After the Deepwater \nHorizon spill, Senator Landrieu worked tirelessly with both Democratic \nand Republican colleagues to move the RESTORE the Gulf Coast Act \nthrough the Senate. Her leadership secured essential reparations from \nBritish Petroleum to restore the battered gulf coast.\n  In 2009, Senator Landrieu and former Senator Olympia Snowe made \nhistory as the first two female lawmakers to lead a full congressional \ncommittee--the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship--as \nchair and ranking member. Senator Landrieu is also the first female \nSenator to chair the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  She has been an active member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nand I have appreciated her willingness to work with me on so many \nissues in her capacity as the chair of the Homeland Security \nSubcommittee. When Vermont was devastated by Hurricane Irene, Senator \nLandrieu was a key ally in helping me secure needed resources to help \nrebuild roads, bridges, businesses, and communities in Vermont. I thank \nher for that, Vermonters thank her, and I will never forget her \ninvaluable work and support.\n  Louisiana has been well represented by Senator Landrieu. She has been \na steadfast and stalwart defender of her State's priorities and needs. \nI wish her, her husband Frank, and their entire family the very best.\n\n\n                               Mark Pryor\n\n  Madam President, since 2002, Senator Mark Pryor has been a dedicated \nrepresentative in the U.S. Senate for the people of Arkansas. \nThroughout his career he has carried on a strong family tradition of \nservice. I worked alongside his father, Senator David Pryor, for nearly \n20 years. Both father and son are two of the finest public servants I \nhave known. Their conscientiousness and their decency are but two of \nthe many distinguishing features of their work in this body.\n  Throughout his tenure here, Mark Pryor has been a fierce defender of \nand advocate for rural communities, a commitment both he and I share. \nHe has promoted expansion of rural broadband infrastructure to ensure \nthat families, farmers, businesses, and students in even the most rural \ncommunities in Arkansas, in Vermont, and across the Nation have access \nto the World Wide Web. As the chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Agriculture, he has been a partner of mine in working \nto ensure that farms small and large have the resources and support to \nmaintain and contribute to the rich agricultural history of the Nation. \nWe have also worked together to advance key conservation programs to \nhelp protect farmlands across the country.\n  I have also greatly admired Senator Pryor's commitment to the \nNational Guard. As cochair of the Senate National Guard caucus I have \nseen how active and effective he has been as a caucus member and as a \nvalued ally in our bipartisan efforts to protect, defend, and bolster \nresources for the men and women of the National Guard.\n  In the day-to-day work of the Senate, I will miss Senator Pryor's \ninsight, his evenhandedness, and his friendship. He has been a \npassionate voice in the Senate for the people of Arkansas. I wish him \nand the entire Pryor family all best wishes in the years ahead.\n\n\n                               Mark Udall\n\n  Madam President, for nearly 20 years in Congress, Mark Udall has \nrepresented the people of Colorado with commitment and courage. He is a \ndedicated public servant, whose drive and responsibility to the people \nof Colorado will not wane with his retirement.\n  An experienced mountaineer and proud environmentalist, Senator Udall \nhas spent weekends exploring and enjoying the great outdoors, and his \nweekdays protecting them. He has authored legislation to create \nwildlife refuges and preserve wilderness in Colorado. He is also a \nleader in renewable energy, helping his home State adopt a renewable \nelectricity standard and working to bring a similar innovation to the \nnational stage.\n  Senator Udall has worked hard to bridge the partisan divide during a \nperiod of unprecedented polarization. Many of the bills he has authored \nhave enjoyed wide bipartisan support, including proposals to \nreauthorize NASA and to protect public lands. He was one of the \nSenate's newest Members when he successfully called on Republicans and \nDemocrats to sit together in a show of national unity at the 2011 State \nof the Union, following the tragic shootings in Tucson, AZ.\n  Senator Udall has been a tireless advocate for the protection of \ncivil liberties. His work on the Senate Intelligence Committee has been \nfocused on protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all Americans, \na commitment that I strongly share. His departure will be a loss to the \nwork of the Intelligence Committee.\n  Mark Udall comes from a family with an uncommon history of public \nservice. Though Senator Udall is retiring from the Senate, I know this \nservice will continue. I wish him, his wife Maggie, their children and \ntheir entire family all best wishes as they begin their next chapter.\n\n\n                               Kay Hagan\n\n  Madam President, back when I was in law school, I tried to get an \ninternship here on Capitol Hill, with no luck. Senator Kay Hagan has a \ndifferent story. She first walked these Halls as an intern in the \n1970s.\n  Her tenure here in the Senate has been too short, but she has \nrepresented her constituents in North Carolina with vigor and \ndedication. She has been a tireless advocate for women and children and \nwas a key ally in my efforts to reauthorize the Violence Against Women \nAct in 2013. I have long felt that she has placed conscience above \npolitics. She has shown a willingness to take tough votes on difficult \nissues, from LGBT rights to gun safety.\n  Senator Hagan comes from a strong military family. North Carolina has \none of the highest per capita enlistment rates in the country, and \nSenator Hagan has understood that behind every officer, behind every \nenlisted member of the military, is a family that needs our \nappreciation and support. She was an active partner in our efforts to \nstrengthen the National Guard, and she authored such important \nlegislative initiatives as the Hire a Hero Act.\n  After decades of public service, I know that North Carolina can \nexpect more service from Senator Hagan. I wish her, her husband Chip \nand their wonderful daughters the best.\n\n\n                              Mark Begich\n\n  Madam President, Senator Mark Begich comes from a long line of public \nservants. In his 6 years in the U.S. Senate, he has been a strong \nadvocate for the people of Alaska. Senator Begich has worked tirelessly \nto promote Alaska's economy and business. During his\n\n[[Page S6859]]\n\nSenate tenure, he has been a partner on such issues as voter \nprotection, the USA PATRIOT Act and FISA reform, and empowering the \nNational Guard.\n  Alaska has more veterans per capita than any other State. As a member \nof the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Senator Begich has fought \nto improve veterans access to care, increase funding for the VA, and \nfor research to better understand mental illnesses such as post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, PTSD, and traumatic brain injury, TBI. These \nare priorities I share as well. He has also worked through the commerce \ncommittee to ensure that Alaska's many fisheries and their booming \nindustry remain sustainable. His commitment to his constituents \nsimilarly extended to his work on the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, \nwhere he fought to protect native voters from discrimination and to \nensure that laws reflect and respect their needs and traditions.\n  I have appreciated the opportunity to work with Senator Begich on \nsome of the unique challenges that face rural states like Vermont and \nAlaska. Senator Begich has consistently worked to improve rural schools \nthrough legislation such as his Investing in Innovation for Education \nAct, which I was pleased to cosponsor and which would have given 25 \npercent of its grants to rural schools. Senator Begich has supported \nlegislation to facilitate rural Alaskans' access to quality health \ncare. And he has supported measures to address the high heating costs \nfacing our northern constituents.\n  He is a man with an unfailing optimistic outlook on life. I wish \nSenator Begich, his wife Deborah, their young son Jacob, and his entire \nfamily best wishes.\n\n\n                               John Walsh\n\n  Madam President, Senator John Walsh has served but a brief time in \nthe Senate, but he came to this body with a long history of public \nservice. A decorated veteran, he enlisted in the Montana National Guard \nin 1979, and he rose through the ranks, ultimately being selected as \nMontana's adjutant general. He is the first veteran of the Iraq and \nAfghanistan wars to serve as a Senator, and during his tour of duty, he \nearned the Bronze Star, the Legion of Merit, and the combat infantry \nbadge.\n  As a Senator, John Walsh has been a strong advocate of mental health \ncare for veterans, preserving native languages, and bringing outsourced \njobs back to the United States. As cochair of the Senate National Guard \nCaucus, I recognize and greatly appreciate his deep understanding and \nstrong support for the Guard, its needs, and its future.\n  I wish him, his wife Janet, and their children and grandchild all the \nbest in the next chapter of their lives.\n\n\n                            Saxby Chambliss\n\n  Madam President, in Senator Saxby Chambliss, Georgians have had a \ndiligent voice in Congress for nearly 20 years. We may not always \nagree, but I have appreciated his willingness to cross the aisle on \nsuch important issues as budget priorities and agriculture policy.\n  Senator Chambliss is the former chairman and ranking member of the \nSenate agriculture committee. In his time in Congress, Senator \nChambliss has participated in enactment of four bipartisan omnibus \nagriculture bills, the most recent of which is the 2014 farm bill. He \nplayed an important role in reforming the Crop Insurance Program and \nhas been an advocate for supporting the Nation's agricultural sector. I \nhave particularly appreciated his support for critical conservation and \nforestry programs.\n  Senator Chambliss was recognized as a key legislator in the 2011 \ndiscussions surrounding deficit reduction. He has been an active member \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee and a strong supporter of the \nNational Guard. Through his tenure, he has been a steadfast \nrepresentative for the people of Georgia, and one prominent publication \nin the State gave him the title ``Georgian of the Year'' in 2009.\n  Senator Chambliss will retire at the end of this Congress, and I wish \nhim, his wife Julianne, their children, and grandchild all the very \nbest.\n\n\n                               Tom Coburn\n\n  Madam President, while several Members of this Senate class will be \nretiring this year at the end of their terms, another Senator will also \nbe taking his leave of this Chamber, in the midst of his current term. \nFor a decade, Senator Tom Coburn has represented his constituents in \nOklahoma with steadfast dedication and perseverance. He and I have not \nalways agreed, but I have always respected and admired his commitment \nto his principles.\n  Senator Coburn has built a record and reputation as a fiscal hawk, \nreminiscent in some ways of the role that the late Senator Howard \nMetzenbaum of Ohio assumed for many years in the Senate. Senator Coburn \ncan be a tough bargainer, and sometimes he has chosen not to seek or \naccept compromise at all. But he also has shown the ability to work \nacross the aisle, whether on reducing government spending or promoting \ntransparency in government. In the first Congress in which he served in \nthe Senate, he partnered with then-Senator Barack Obama and others to \nauthor the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act, which \nestablished a public, online database detailing Federal spending. For \nmany years he served as an active member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, where we worked together on such policy issues as patent \nreform, copyright protections, and support for law enforcement.\n  Senator Coburn is a longtime public servant for the State of \nOklahoma. Members retire from Congress for a host of reasons, and I \nknow Senator Coburn's retirement has been hastened. He has left his \nmark on this institution, and I wish him, his wife Carolyn, their three \ndaughters and their grandchildren good health and all the best in Tom \nCoburn's retirement from the Senate.\n\n\n                              Mike Johanns\n\n  Madam President, it is not uncommon for Senators to leave this \nChamber to serve in Cabinet positions. Senator Mike Johanns, however, \nbrought that executive branch experience with him when he was elected \nby the people of Nebraska to represent them in the Senate. A former \nmayor, Governor, and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, Senator Johanns has \nserved at every level of government.\n  While we have often supported competing proposals, we have found \nimportant and meaningful places to work together. Senator Johanns \njoined me in coauthoring legislation to improve the Food for Peace \nprogram, helping to feed an additional 200,000 people in dire need. \nServing on the agriculture committee together, we are both committed to \nfarming, family farming, and supporting our Nation's agriculture \nsectors and the people and communities that are part and parcel of \nfarming and food production in America. Senator Johanns has also been \nan important advocate for veterans, working on programs to help \nreturning soldiers find civilian employment.\n  I wish Senator Johanns, his wife Stephanie, and their family the very \nbest in this next chapter of their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/15/senate-section/article/S6859-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6859-S6860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MURTHY NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I wish to congratulate Dr. Vivek H. \nMurthy on his confirmation as the 19th Surgeon General of the United \nStates.\n  Earlier today, the U.S. Senate held a series of votes in order to \nconfirm Dr. Vivek H. Murthy as Surgeon General of the United States. \nThe first vote was held to invoke cloture on his nomination, the second \nto confirm. Dr. Murthy was successfully confirmed by a vote of 51-43.\n  My flight from Cleveland to Washington, DC was delayed causing me to \nmiss both votes. Had I been present, I would have voted to support Mr. \nMurthy's nomination.\n  President Obama nominated Dr. Murthy for this position last November. \nDr. Murthy's extensive experience as an entrepreneur, health \nprofessional, and public health advocate make him an exceptionally well \nqualified candidate for Surgeon General. Although I was unable to make \nit to DC in time to vote to help confirm Dr. Murthy, I would have voted \nto support his confirmation.\n  Dr. Vivek H. Murthy will be an exemplary Surgeon General, and it is \nfor this reason that I wrote to President Obama asking that he nominate \nDr. Murthy for this position. His long record of innovative business \nleadership and unwavering belief in a more inclusive health care system \nadvance our Nation's public health agenda.\n\n[[Page S6860]]\n\n  I look forward to working with Dr. Murthy in his role as Surgeon \nGeneral.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/15/senate-section/article/S6860-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mr. RUBIO.

Madam President, I wish to clarify my understanding of \nthe following report language included with H.R. 83, the Omnibus \nAppropriations Act:\n\n       The Secretary is directed to operate the marketing \n     assistance loan program in a way that encourages redemption \n     and minimizes forfeitures of loan commodities to the Federal \n     government, and enables the orderly marketing of loan \n     commodities throughout the year. Further, the Secretary shall \n     ensure that the marketing assistance loan program remains a \n     viable tool for all producers to use in marketing loan \n     commodities freely and competitively.\n\n  The Senate Agriculture Committee has confirmed this language simply \nintends to encourage USDA to better inform farmers of the status of any \nmarketing loan gains they may receive during a marketing year for \neligible commodities.\n  Furthermore, it was also conveyed by minority staff of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee that the referenced language in no way seeks to \nchange implementation or enforcement of Section 1603 of the \nAgricultural Act of 2014.\n Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I wish to thank Chair Mikulski for \nher tireless work in keeping our government open for another year. I \nunderstand Chair Mikulski and Ranking Member Shelby have worked hard on \nthis bill.\n  In the big picture, this bill continues to honor our commitment to \nour veterans by allowing advance funding for Veterans Administration \naccounts so they are locked in a year in advance, ending uncertainty. \nThis bill also provides desperately needed funds to respond to and \nprepare for Ebola at its epicenter. This bill keeps faith with the \nAmerican people who dream of a better life by increasing Pell Grants \nand making college more affordable. It creates jobs by strengthening \nour infrastructure, building roads and bridges, to keep the economy \nmoving, and helps develop our economy by investing in research in \nagriculture, health, and geosciences, among other areas.\n  I am glad that the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program \nwas fully funded at $40 million. The program is one of the successes in \ncollaboration and forest management and deserves strong support. The \nLand and Water Conservation Fund--LWCF--also received sustained funding \nat the same level as last year. Although this is only one-third of the \ntotal authorized for LWCF, I am pleased that the program received \nconsistent funding and I remain hopeful that we will fully fund this \nprogram in the future. I am also glad that the National Park Service \nreceived $10 million for the Centennial Challenge. As the National Park \nService moves into celebrating its centennial, it is so important that \nour parks receive the care and attention they need.\n  However, I also have to voice my disappointment over a number of \nprovisions included in H.R. 83, as well as several provisions that were \nblocked from inclusion in H.R. 83. Keeping the government running is \nimperative but it should not come at the cost of stripping the rights \nof voters, further chipping away at what is left of our eroding \ncampaign finance laws, and rolling back Dodd-Frank protections meant to \nreduce taxpayer risk from ``too-big-to-fail'' entities, just to name a \nfew of the objectionable provisions in this bill.\n  One such provision greatly expands donations to the Republican and \nDemocratic parties by allowing a tenfold increase in the maximum amount \nthat donors may contribute to their political party's various national \ncommittees in one election cycle. The donation amounts skyrocket from \n$32,400 to $324,000 per year and ultimately up to a total contribution \nof $1.5 million to a party per each 2-year election cycle. At a time \nwhen more and more Americans are convinced our political system is \nrigged toward the rich, this provision only confirms that view.\n  This bill also contains a provision that will put taxpayers back on \nthe hook for big banks by rolling back the regulatory protections that \nCongress put into place in response to the financial crisis that \ndevastated our economy in 2008. With the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress \nsought to ensure that high-stakes gambling on Wall Street by reckless \nrisk takers would not threaten the livelihood of the American taxpayer. \nAs part of this effort, Dodd-Frank included a provision known as the \n``swaps push out'' which requires Federally insured banks to separate \nout their riskiest activities into subsidiaries. This way, the risky \ntrading activities that contributed to the meltdown would be separated \nfrom the insured banking entity and ensure that banks--not taxpayers--\nwould be responsible if risky trades fail. Today, this spending bill \nrepeals that provision and once again potentially leaves the taxpayer \non the hook for Wall Street gambling gone wrong.\n  I am particularly dismayed that last-minute partisan maneuvering has \nleft America's rural counties in the dust. Two funds that are lifelines \nfor cash-strapped rural counties and school districts struggling to \nfund basic education, road improvements, law enforcement, and other \npublic services were hurt by this bill. First, House Republican \nLeadership blocked repeated efforts to include the Secure Rural \nSchools--SRS--funding program, though it came with offset funding. \nInstead, they split it from the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program--\nPILT--funded PILT, and left SRS behind. This is a problem for two \ndistinct reasons. First, PILT is a laudable program for rural counties \naround the country who host our public lands. But so is SRS, which \nfunds education, roads and critical services in more than 700 counties \nacross the country, and these counties will now be forced to lay off \nteachers, close libraries and jails, and lay off sheriffs. Second, \nPILT's formula is connected with SRS funding levels, in fact, and while \nthis bill includes funding for PILT, in the absence of Secure Rural \nSchools, the funding level for PILT provided in this bill actually \nreduces PILT payments as compared to last year. We have seen this movie \nbefore and it never ends well--a last-minute scheme worked out largely \nin private to solve a complex problem without the full and public \nconsideration of Congress--leads to mistakes. This is one of those \nmistakes that will reverberate across rural America. I am disappointed \nthis mistake was not averted simply by providing SRS funding.\n  Speaking of hampering rural America, there is another provision \nmissing that would help the rural West and one missing that would help \nthe rural West were it included. This package fails to include the \nWildfire Disaster Funding Act--a bill I introduced with my colleague \nSenator Crapo and 17 additional bipartisan cosponsors, and which was \nalso a strong bipartisan measure in the House. This legislation would \nhave solved the problem of paying for the ever-increasing costs of \nfighting wildland fires without decimating the agencies' core budgets, \nwhere they get the money to pay for their essential work--including the \nforest restoration work that can help us get ahead of these infernos. \nOur commonsense solution would have paid for these natural disasters \nlike other natural disasters are paid for, instead of cannibalizing the \nagencies' budgets.\n  In addition, this bill interferes with the work that private \nlandowners are\n\n[[Page S6861]]\n\ndoing for sage grouse restoration. This bill blocks the administration \nfrom complying with its Endangered Species Act obligations--and its \ndeadline in a court-approved settlement agreement--by barring any funds \nfrom being used in efforts to list the sage-grouse under the Endangered \nSpecies Act. Now, while I join my colleagues and others in wanting to \nsee a listing avoided, this kind of blunt force prohibition of \ncompliance with legal obligations--one that sends the message that \nthese obligations can be ignored when they are deemed inconvenient--is \nvery disturbing. In my State, and across the West, numerous parties \nhave come together to try to tackle the threats to this species, which \nis just an indicator of threats to an entire ecosystem. I commend these \ngreat efforts by ranchers, conservationists, Governors and others who \nhave come to the table, signed agreements, and worked hard on the \nground to protect the landscape and avoid a sage-grouse listing. Those \nefforts are the right way to avoid a listing, not through dangerous \nriders as we see in this bill. It is my hope the administration will \ncontinue to work to manage and improve sage-grouse habitat to avoid \nundermining those efforts.\n  On a global scale, this legislation would reverse a policy that takes \na step toward saving our global climate. The United States has made \ntremendous and continued progress to reduce its greenhouse gas \nemissions as well as transition our electricity sector to cleaner \nenergy sources. That progress gets undermined if other nations continue \nto grow their economies based upon high-carbon emitting electricity \nsources such as coal, without also putting in place the technologies to \nclean it up, capture, and store the emissions from those powerplants. \nIt only makes sense then that the United States currently has in place \na policy that it will not use its funds, through the Export-Import Bank \nand through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to build power \nsources overseas that are dirtier than are allowed here at home, and \nthat will continue polluting the atmosphere for many decades. A rider \ncarried by this legislation up-ends that agreement.\n  This bill is flexible in its approaches to environmental \ndegradation--it easily transitions from the global, as discussed above, \nto the very local: this legislation bans the Department of Energy--\nDOE--from implementing or enforcing light bulb efficiency standards. No \nenvironmental improvement is too small or too commonsensical to not \nattract an opponent.\n  This legislation hampers progress by taking aim at particular \nagencies: it takes aim at environmental protection by going directly \nafter the Environmental Protection Agency. At a time when climate \nchange is already hurting Americans and holding back the United States \neconomy, the omnibus takes aim at the only agency with the authority to \nregulate greenhouse gas emissions, slashing its budget to levels not \nseen since 1989.\n  And this bill takes aim at the Internal Revenue Service by cutting \ntheir budget by another $400 million. That's the lowest level since \n2008. Now, I get it. Some people might think that is a good thing: who \nwants to fund the tax collector? Except that the IRS is responsible for \nmore than just cashing checks; it also has to make sure that tax fraud \nis under control, that Americans get their tax refunds in a timely way, \nand that taxpayers can get their questions about their taxes answered, \nagain, in a timely way. All of that is hobbled by an insufficient \nbudget.\n  In addition, it is hard to pick up a newspaper or turn on the news \nthese days without finding a story about ever more aggressive efforts \nto dodge taxes. The average American does not cheat on her taxes, but \nfor those who do, the IRS needs the resources to catch them. Otherwise, \nevery honest, hard-working American ends up on the hook for more. By \ncontinuing to cut the IRS budget, I am afraid Congress is sending a \nmessage that tax enforcement is not so important. It communicates an \nunfortunate signal that fighting tax cheating is not a priority, and \nenforcement is not a priority. Ultimately, that is a problem for every \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  Congress also continues to cut funding to the IRS while adding more \nduties to the agency, including in this spending bill. Next year is \nalready a busy year for the IRS. In addition to administering the \nfiling season and combating identity theft and fraud, the IRS will also \nbe implementing the late-passed extenders bill, the Foreign Accounts \nTax Compliance Act, and the health premium tax credits.\n  But that is not all. Congress is cutting the funding, but telling the \nIRS to use the funding to improve the 1-800 help line service and \nallocate resources to improve response time. Why? Because maintaining \nan acceptable level of service for the American taxpayer has been \nstrained substantially due to previous budget cuts.\n  Congress is asking the IRS to do all these things while cutting \nfunding. Congress is telling the IRS to do more, but with much, much \nless.\n  I have long been an ardent proponent of tax reform. We have a broken \ntax code in desperate need of fixing. Why does that matter in this \ncontext? I will tell you why. If Congress finally succeeds in \nmeaningfully reforming our antiquated tax code, implementing those \nchanges will require a substantial investment in the IRS. Will Congress \nhave the same attitude toward funding the IRS when it is charged with \nthe implementation of a reformed and modern tax code? I wonder, and I \nworry.\n  On the defense side, there is no doubt that this omnibus bill \nincludes funding for important national security priorities. However, \nit also contains billions in wasteful and unnecessary military \nspending--like nearly $500 million to buy more F-35 Joint Strike \nFighters than the Pentagon requested. The bill also contains more than \n$8 billion for nuclear weapons activities, which is nearly $390 million \nmore than the President requested. During the Reagan years, we spent \nabout $8 billion annually to develop, test, produce and maintain more \nthan 20,000 nuclear warheads. Today we spend that same $8 billion on \nfewer than 5,000 warheads. What is wrong with this picture?\n  This bill also handicaps efforts to invest in infrastructure and keep \nour Nation competitive. Buried in the pages of this bill is a $100 \nmillion cut to the Transportation Investment Generating Economic \nRecovery, or TIGER, grant program. Since Congress created this program \nin the 2009 Recovery Act, the competitive grants have played a critical \nrole in funding road, rail, port and transit projects across the \ncountry. Cutting this program makes absolutely no sense when Congress \nis struggling to shore up the Highway Trust Fund and meet \ninfrastructure needs in Oregon and across the country.\n  And I would be remiss if I didn't highlight my disappointment with \nthe multiemployer pension provisions. These reforms were rushed through \nby a few House Members in private during the final days of the \nlegislative year without consideration by the Senate Finance Committee \nand other committees of jurisdiction. That flawed process has produced \na lopsided solution leaving existing retirees to shoulder a \ndisproportionate share of sacrifice. It also will result in the rolling \nback of a major tenet enshrined in pension law--never take away money a \npensioner has already earned. Under this bill, for the first time, \nCongress will allow multiemployer plans to cut retirees' earned pension \nbenefits. This is unprecedented and I worry about the impact on \nretirees and the slippery slope we are about to head down.\n  No matter what one thinks about the underlying policy, legislation \nthis complex and controversial requires thorough review and analysis. \nThat hasn't happened here. In fact, no one in the Senate, including the \ncommittees of jurisdiction, had the opportunity to fully review these \nprovisions. Even a single, small, unintentional misstep in the rush to \nlegislate could have serious and negative consequences to retirees and \nbusinesses alike. I am working hard to protect retirees' pensions, and \njamming these reforms through Congress virtually sight unseen is no way \nto solve the problems with multiemployer pensions.\n  As a conglomerate, these provisions tip the balance of this fine bill \nto one that I cannot support and with that I regretfully voted against \nits final passage.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I wish to explain my opposition to the \nFiscal Year 2015 Omnibus Appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S6862]]\n\n  For months, I worked hard alongside Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski, \nRanking Member Richard Shelby, and our colleagues on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee to craft a bipartisan agreement, which fit \nwithin stringent spending limits, to fund the government and strengthen \nour economy.\n  Regrettably, the last minute addition of an unrelated bill on \nmultiemployer pension plans tilted the balance away from a bill that \nreflects a tough bipartisan compromise to a bill that, hastily and \nwithout thorough review, makes fundamental changes to numerous private \nretirement plans. Moreover, another provision of the bill seeks to undo \na portion of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection \nAct that would force large banks to separate the riskiest derivatives \ntrades away from subsidiaries that benefit from federal deposit \ninsurance.\n  Because of the inclusion of these provisions, I am unable to vote for \nthe omnibus. It is a shame, because there is otherwise much good here.\n  This compromise bill includes federal funds, which I advocated for, \nto boost economic and community development and environmental \nrestoration projects in Rhode Island, as well as key education, \nmanufacturing, workforce training, health care, nutrition, energy \nefficiency, transportation, and defense initiatives.\n  I thank Chairwoman Mikulski for her boundless energy and ceaseless \nefforts in putting a bill together with these kinds of investments.\n  As chairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, I am \nproud of what we were able to accomplish. I particularly commend \nSenator Lisa Murkowski for being an outstanding partner, as well as her \nclerk, Leif Fonnesbeck, and her subcommittee staff, Brent Wiles, and \nEmy Lesofski. I also thank the majority staff: Rachael Taylor, Virginia \nJames, Ryan Hunt, and Rita Culp for their work and guidance during my \ntenure as chairman.\n  I especially wish to recognize Virginia James, who is retiring this \nJanuary after a distinguished 27-year Senate career. Ginny has served \nas a trusted adviser on tribal health, science, and arts and cultural \nissues to both Democrats and Republicans, stretching back to her days \nserving as an aide to former Appropriations Committee Chairman Mark O. \nHatfield. There are many Federal agencies--from the Smithsonian and the \nNational Gallery of Art to the U.S. Geological Survey and the Indian \nHealth Service--that owe Ginny a debt of gratitude for her work, as \ndoes the Senate. She will be missed for both her skill and her humor.\n  Because of the bipartisan efforts of the staff and members of our \nSubcommittee, the Interior Appropriations bill included in this omnibus \nlegislation has $2.356 billion for the Clean Water and Drinking Water \nState Revolving Funds, which is $581 million above the fiscal year 2015 \nbudget request. This funding will help states and localities make \nimportant infrastructure investments, create jobs here in the U.S., and \nimprove environmental quality.\n  While I am disappointed that the House insisted on the inclusion of a \nfew controversial policy riders, I'm pleased that we were able to \neliminate many of the most damaging legislative provisions that those \non the other side of the aisle were demanding. These provisions would \nhave impacted the ability of agencies under the Subcommittee's \njurisdiction to do their jobs to protect the public and the \nenvironment, including their ability to address climate change.\n  I am dismayed, however, that the House refused to accept the Senate's \nlanguage that would have allowed for a more rational way to account and \npay for emergency wildfire suppression. Every member of the House \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee had cosponsored nearly identical \nlegislation and the House Committee report expressed support for this \nchange. Yet the House refused to adopt it in this agreement. I believe \nmy colleagues in the West may regret not taking the opportunity when \nthey had the chance.\n  I am also disappointed that my colleagues in the House could not \nagree, at long last, that it is time for oil and gas companies to pay a \nshare of the costs of inspecting their on-shore drilling operations.\n  There are other aspects of the omnibus that are troubling.\n  As the long time champion of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram (LIHEAP), along with Senator Susan Collins, I regret seeing the \nprogram cut by $34 million. Although significantly higher than the \nPresident's request, the reduction comes after years of cuts or \nstagnant appropriations. Meanwhile, the number of households eligible \nfor LIHEAP assistance continues to exceed available funds and those \nreceiving assistance have seen their grants decrease. I hope we can do \nbetter in the future.\n  While the bill includes important investments in surface \ntransportation and aviation systems, I think we should be doing more, \ngiven the benefits to our economy. I am especially disappointed that \nthe TIGER grant program, which has helped advance a number of critical \ntransportation projects in Rhode Island, has been cut by $100 million \nfrom a year ago.\n  I am also troubled by language that would set aside the Federal Motor \nCarrier Safety Administration's Hours of Service regulation in order to \nhave further study of the rule, which has been in effect for nearly \n1\\1/2\\ years. While I welcome additional studies on driver safety, I \ndon't think it is appropriate to simply set aside a rule that has been \nthe subject of more than a decade of work and legal review. What \nconcerns me most is that it could force truck drivers, who have one of \nthe most grueling jobs in the country, to work longer hours, \npotentially increasing fatigue and putting more people at risk on our \nroadways.\n  The bill also hobbles the Department of Homeland Security, providing \nonly enough funding to keep it running until February 27 of next year. \nThis is the response by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to \nthe actions the President has taken with respect to immigration. Due to \nthis intransigence, some initiatives to secure the border cannot be \nfunded nor can measures to address the humanitarian crisis of children \ncrossing our Southwest border or security weaknesses at the White \nHouse.\n  Even if these faults could be overlooked because of the many positive \nprovisions in the bill, it is, for me, irreparably damaged by two \ncontroversial riders that have nothing to do with funding the \ngovernment.\n  The bill would repeal section 716 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nReform Act. Section 716 prevents bank subsidiaries that are covered by \nfederal deposit insurance or that take advantage of Federal Reserve \nlending programs from engaging in the riskiest derivatives trades. In \nessence, the riskiest derivatives trades would be pushed out from these \nsubsidiaries in an effort to reduce systemic risk and provide greater \nassurances that Wall Street gambles would not be subsidized by \ntaxpayers.\n  Whether you are in favor of preserving or repealing section 716, \neveryone should understand by now that the last thing Congress should \nbe doing is passing incredibly complex and consequential derivatives \nlegislation with little deliberation as part of an omnibus \nappropriations bill.\n  Serious concerns have been raised about repealing Section 716. Some \nhave pointed out that the riskiest derivatives are so volatile that it \nwill be impossible to charge the proper deposit insurance premium to \naccount for the additional risk that the most unpredictable swaps will \nbring to FDIC insured banking subsidiaries. In other words, the \npotential losses could far exceed the amounts that have been reserved \nfor contingencies. This should be concerning to all of my colleagues, \nespecially in light of the 2008 financial crisis.\n  It is clear that big Wall Street banks have more than had their say. \nI merely ask that taxpayers be given an equal opportunity to have their \nsay before they are asked yet again, perhaps years from now, to bail \nout Wall Street for their excesses.\n  The deep irony is that when my colleagues and I transparently fight \nfor foreclosure prevention for Americans who were harmed by the \nrecklessness of big banks and financial institutions, we are told that \nit was our constituents who were reckless and that we shouldn't be \nencouraging moral hazard. By repealing a section that seeks to \nestablish a prohibition against federal government bailouts of swaps \nentities, some of my colleagues are revealing\n\n[[Page S6863]]\n\ntheir view that our largest banks should be held to a significantly \nlesser standard than distressed American homeowners. They seem to \nbelieve that when it comes to the potentially reckless choices of \nbanks, they can continue to wreak havoc in our financial markets--and \nif their bets fail spectacularly, taxpayers will be there to clean up \ntheir mess. This shouldn't be the case.\n  If Members want to debate and vote on this issue in the open, I \nwelcome the opportunity, but to avoid the debate by tucking this \nprovision in a 1,600 page funding bill is a disservice to the \nseriousness of the issue. I am disheartened that despite what past \nexperience has shown us, we are rushing towards what could be another \ngrave mistake.\n  While much attention has been paid to the repeal of section 716 and \nother controversial pieces of this legislation, I am even more troubled \nby the last-minute addition of a bill that would make major changes to \nthe multiemployer pension system.\n  The multiemployer pension program, guaranteed by the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation (PBGC), is in financial distress. Just 1 month \nago, the PBGC's annual report raised a number of concerns about the \nincreasing deficits of the multiemployer pension program. Alarmingly, \nthe report predicted a high likelihood of many plans failing over the \nnext decade, which would jeopardize the PBGC's ability to ensure \nretirees even a minimum guarantee on their pensions. We must take \naction to ensure that middle-income employees and retirees do not have \nthe rug cut out from under them and lose retirement benefits.\n  We should have a thoughtful, open debate about how we ensure that \nmiddle-income employees and retirees receive the pension benefits they \nhave earned so they are able to enjoy a secure retirement. We need a \nsolution that honors these retirees' lifelong work.\n  Regrettably, this legislation--for the first time--opens the door to \ncutting pension benefits for current retirees. It would renege on the \ncommitments made to middle-income families across the country. \nHamstrung by budget constraints over the last few years, we have not \ndone as much as I would have liked to protect programs that provide \nmuch needed support to hard-working families. My efforts to extend \nunemployment insurance, which benefits a broad cross-section of \nAmericans, have been rebuffed by House Republicans time after time this \nyear. And now even hard earned pension benefits are not safe.\n  The financial stability of multiemployer plans is a serious challenge \nthat Congress will have to confront. However, we must consider a range \nof options before we move to dismantle the longstanding protections \nafforded to employees and their families by the Employee Retirement \nIncome Security Act (ERISA). One of the most important aspects of this \nlaw stipulates that benefits for troubled multiemployer pension plans \nmust be paid out first with remaining assets. The legislation we are \nconsidering flies in the face of that commitment by allowing benefit \ncuts to be the first option for restoring solvency to these plans.\n  Any solution is going to require tough compromises from everyone, but \nall stakeholders should have the opportunity to participate in crafting \na solution instead of having it developed in secret and rammed through \nas part of a must-pass spending bill. This is the sort of action that \ninfuriates the people we represent. But more important than process, \nthis bill will have an effect on people's lives for years to come and \ngives further cause for Americans to think that their government \ndoesn't have their back or care about their economic security. We \nshouldn't approach it so frivolously. We need to make sure the policy \nis right.\n  Given the outstanding efforts of Chairwoman Mikulski and my \ncolleagues on the Appropriations Committee it is difficult for me to \nsay this, but because of the reasons I have explained, I voted no on \nthis bill.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President, this is not the time for another \ngovernment shutdown. The American people have had enough of \nWashington's dysfunction. They want us to do our job and work together \nto get the job done. Since the Budget Committee, on which I serve, \ncrafted a bipartisan agreement that ended last year's government \nshutdown and paved the way for a cease-fire on recent budget wars, the \neconomy has gained an average of 240,000 jobs per month. In Wisconsin, \nour economy continues to lag behind, so we need to build on this \nprogress and strengthen the economic security of families and \nbusinesses that are working hard to move our economy forward.\n  This bipartisan appropriations bill will help do that by increasing \nthe Child Care and Development Block Grant funding by $75 million; \nincreasing the maximum Pell grant award; providing a cost of living pay \nraise for our men and women in the Armed Forces; increasing funding for \nscience and research at the National Institutes of Health by $150 \nmillion; providing grants to States for job training and assistance to \ndislocated workers; extending Trade Adjustments Assistance for workers \nwho lose their jobs due to international trade; and moving bipartisan \nManufacturing Hubs legislation forward that I support to keep our \ncountry on the leading edge of advanced manufacturing.\n  I also fought to include in this legislation a number of provisions \nthat will help us build a stronger made in Wisconsin economy, including \nsupport for our shipbuilding industry and transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  With all of these benefits, I am the first to admit that this bill is \nfar from perfect. But we have a divided government and I recognize that \nI can't get everything I want in this bill, just as my colleagues \nacross the aisle can't get everything they want in this bill. This bill \nis a compromise.\n  Let me be very clear here: Republicans' insistence on including a \nWall Street giveaway is extremely objectionable to me. I also strongly \noppose a provision that weakens our already loose campaign laws and the \nchanges made to multiemployer pensions deserved a full debate in the \nSenate, as separate legislation, not tucked into an appropriations bill \nby the House of Representatives at the last minute. I agree with my \ncolleagues who have said these provisions represent the very worst of \ncreating an uneven playing field for those hard working Americans who \nask for nothing more than a voice in Washington and fair shot at \ngetting ahead. I would also add that these provisions in particular are \na direct assault on our proud progressive traditions in Wisconsin.\n  But what would have happened if we did not pass this bill now? I can \ntell you what will happen because we saw the path the Republican \ncontrolled House of Representatives wanted to take. Republicans tried \nto add more than 30 additional harmful policy provisions--from more \nWall Street giveaways to rolling back workers' rights to eroding \nenvironmental policy--but Senate Democrats were able to use their \ncurrent leverage as the majority party in the Senate to keep them out. \nIf this bill did not pass now, Republicans would have had the power to \nadd more objectionable provisions when they will hold majorities in \nboth the House and Senate next year.\n  I supported this bipartisan compromise because I believe it is our \njob to deliver progress for the American people, not an endless drift \nfrom one crisis to the next or a government shutdown.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/15/senate-section/article/S6863-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6863-S6864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, 15 years ago, in the days after the \nshooting at Columbine High School stunned our Nation, I spoke to the \nEconomic Club of Detroit. There, as our country reflected on gun \nviolence's horrific toll, I asked a simple question: ``Are we willing \nto say enough is enough?''\n  Now, so many years later, that question still haunts us. Today, in a \ncountry dedicated to ``life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,'' \nguns kill over 32,000 people a year. That is almost 88 people a day. On \ntop of that, there are over 73,000 nonfatal gun injuries each year. \nThat is 200 a day. Some statistics have shown that 50 percent of \nsuicides in the United States are committed with a firearm. Others have \nfound that children and young adults account for 38 percent of gun \ndeaths and nonfatal injuries, and that when guns are present during \nincidents of domestic violence, the risk of homicide escalates over 500 \npercent.\n\n[[Page S6864]]\n\n  Each of these statistics represents tragedy: people with stories, \nfamilies, loved ones left behind and dreams shattered. A recent CNN \nreport, for example, analyzed all the gun incidents that occurred in \nAmerica on a day picked at random--July 12, 2014. Their research found \non that day alone, at least 83 gun incidents occurred in our country. \nAt 3:20 a.m., a 23-year-old man was shot and killed at an apartment \ncomplex in Tallahassee, FL. At 11:01 a.m., in Ohio, officers responding \nto a domestic violence complaint arrived to a firefight that ended when \nthe gunman turned his weapon on himself. At 6:20 p.m. an elderly man \nmistakenly shot and killed his neighbor, whom he mistook for an \nintruder. At 8:40 p.m., in South Carolina, after an altercation at a \nparty, a man sprayed bullets into the crowd, killing a 47-year-old man \nand injuring another. And these are just a few examples: in the \nreport's words, ``we are certain about one thing--we did not capture \nevery gun incident.''\n  Congress can take commonsense steps to make things better. We should \npass a bill making background checks mandatory on all gun sales, a step \nthat study after study has shown is supported by 90 percent of the \nAmerican people, as well as 95 percent of American internists and 55.4 \npercent of gun dealers and pawnbrokers. We should pass legislation to \nban military style assault weapons, so as to stop the flood of these \nweapons into our neighborhoods and streets. The bottom line is that law \nenforcement personnel who put their lives on the line every day need \nand deserve our support in their effort to ban assault weapons, require \nbackground checks and take other steps to reduce gun violence.\n  We recently observed the 2-year anniversary of the day when a \nderanged individual took the lives of 26 people, 20 of them children, \nat Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT. The children were first \ngraders, 6- and 7-year-olds. Today, they would have been 8- and 9-year-\nolds, third graders, celebrating birthdays, learning about fractions \nand decimals, and reading books. Instead, we can only honor their \nmemory and rededicate ourselves to the work of preventing these \ntragedies in the future.\n  So I must ask the question again, Are we willing to say that enough \nis enough? After so many years and so much senseless death, injury and \npain, when will we come together to stop this violence?\n  I am still hopeful. I am hopeful that Congress will finally answer \nthe question in the affirmative ``Enough is enough.'' I am hopeful that \nCongress will listen to our communities, our educators, and clergy, our \nlaw enforcement officials and businesspeople, our families and loved \nones and join them in saying ``enough is enough.'' And I am hopeful \nthat one day soon, Congress will pay victims and survivors of American \ngun violence the highest tribute that it can: legislation to stop the \nbloodshed, and to make this country that we love better and safer for \ngenerations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/15/senate-section/article/S6864-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6864-S6865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 GENERIC DRUG REPORT AND STUDY REQUEST\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, today I wish to call attention to a \nreport released by the Senate Special Committee on Aging, ``Medicare \nPart D Prescription Drug Benefit: Increasing Use and Access of \nAffordable Prescription Drugs.'' I have long been an advocate in the \nfight for affordable prescription drugs for our seniors--in fact, when \nthis body was considering the legislation that created the Medicare \nPart D benefit, I voiced concerns that we did not go far enough to \nensure that every senior had access to the lifesaving and life-\nsustaining treatments they need.\n  During the debate in the Senate on the Affordable Care Act, I fought \nto eliminate the so-called Medicare Part D doughnut hole because no \nsenior should have their drug coverage disappear when they need it \nmost. I believe that closing the prescription drug doughnut hole was \none of the best things we did in the Affordable Care Act, and in my \nState alone seniors have saved more than $756 million on their drugs \nsince the law was passed.\n  Over the past 2 years, the Aging Committee has held hearings, drafted \nlegislation, solicited multiple reports from the Government \nAccountability Office, GAO, and the Department of Health and Human \nServices Office of the Inspector General, OIG, on selected topics, and \nmet with industry and beneficiary stakeholders. I requested a study by \nthe GAO on the Part D plan finder tool's accuracy of information on \nplans and drug pricing.\n  I chaired a hearing to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the \ncreation of Medicare Part D. During that hearing, witnesses raised \nissues of specialty drug costs, coverage denial, and customer service \nissues. As a result, Senator Collins and I introduced the Part D \nBeneficiary Appeals Fairness Act, S. 1365, to give beneficiaries the \nright to appeal for a lower copayment for drugs on the specialty tier, \nthe tier on which the most expensive drugs are. I have worked hard with \nmy colleagues to rectify issues with the Medicare Part D appeals \nprocess when I learned that seniors were still having difficulty when \ncoverage for needed medications was denied. I also requested a thorough \nreview by the OIG into beneficiaries' access to generic drugs in \nMedicare Part D plans, the results of which are in the report submitted \ntoday, as well as a continued review of the differences in prices for \ndrugs in the Medicaid Program as compared with the Medicare Program.\n  I will continue to improve the Medicare Part D Program, and that is \nwhy my colleagues and I issued this committee report to inform the full \nSenate on innovative ways to use the tools within the Part D program to \nbetter control drug costs for seniors and taxpayers.\n  This report is the culmination of 2 years of work by the Senate \nSpecial Committee on Aging to assess the status of the Part D program \nand recommend improvements.\n  One undeniable factor that keeps costs down in the Part D program is \nthe use of generic drugs. Competition in the generic drug market \ntranslates into real savings for both taxpayers and beneficiaries. The \nCongressional Budget Office, CBO, estimated in 2010 that the use of \ngeneric drugs in the Part D program saved beneficiaries and taxpayers \napproximately $33 billion; approximately 72 percent--$24 billion--of \nthose savings accrued to the Medicare program and 28 percent--$9 \nbillion--went to beneficiaries. CBO estimates that such savings are \nshared by beneficiaries and the Part D program through a combination of \nlower copayments and lower premiums than would have been charged \notherwise.\n  While the proportion of generic drug use has increased over time, \ncertain high-cost beneficiary groups continue to miss savings. The \ncommittee's report finds four areas for improvement that should be \naddressed in order to continue to improve on value-based prescription \ndrug use. These include:\n  Incentivizing and supporting plan sponsors to not only include \ngeneric drugs on plan formularies but also to proactively promote the \nmaximum use of generic alternatives where appropriate. Currently, most \nplan sponsors offer a full array of generic alternatives, but they are \nnot required to do so, leaving a small number of plan formularies that \ndo not maximize generic offerings. In addition, there are no mechanisms \nthat reward or incentivize plan sponsors that have undertaken \nsuccessful strategies to further increase generics use. Encouraging \nvalue in Part D plans as much as possible will be increasingly \nimportant in coming years.\n  Finding ways to increase the adoption of generic drugs among \nbeneficiaries that receive low income subsidy, LIS, benefits. \nGenerally, insurance companies have been successful at encouraging \nenrollees to use generic alternatives when available in part because \nthere are large differences in copays between brand and generic drugs. \nHowever, in the LIS population, these cost differences do not exist; \ntheir copays are set by statute. Innovative methods to improve use of \ngeneric drugs in this population, while still ensuring full access for \nthis vulnerable population, must be explored.\n  Improving education among beneficiaries and health professionals. \nThere continues to be a need to educate beneficiaries and health \nprofessionals on the efficacy of generic medications and incentivizing \nthem to substitute brand-name drugs for generic drugs, when \nappropriate.\n  Maximizing program integrity efforts at pharmacies. In some \nsituations,\n\n[[Page S6865]]\n\nquestionable pharmacy billing practices could thwart efforts that have \nbeen made to incentivize generics. HHS OIG, GAO, and others have \nidentified important program controls in the Part D program that could \nbe improved.\n  While the report deals only with those levers in the Part D program \nthat can be adjusted to incentivize the less-costly drug option where \nappropriate, it is undeniable that recent reports indicate certain \nsituations where the price of a selected generic drug dramatically \nincreases. This trend--and the factors that contribute to this \ndisturbing trend--must be better understood. Generics have been \ncritical to overall fiscal sustainability of the health care system, \nand we must understand and address volatility that results in \ninexplicable price spikes for patients and taxpayers. I believe this is \na hugely complex and recent phenomenon but one that must be studied \nfurther. That is why today, in addition to releasing this important and \ntimely report, I intend to request an investigation by the GAO into \nthose factors that underlie the recent price increases of certain \ngeneric drugs.\n  It is my hope that these actions, taken together, are efforts that \nboth sides can agree to and will inform us on the best way to move \nforward to achieve the maximum drug savings possible and provide \nbetter, more affordable care for our seniors in coming years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/15/senate-section/article/S6865-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ENROLLED BILLS PRESENTED\n\n  The Secretary of the Senate reported that on today, December 15, \n2014, she had presented to the President of the United States the \nfollowing enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1353.
