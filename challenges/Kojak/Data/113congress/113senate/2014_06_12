The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                          Veterans Health Care\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yesterday the Senate passed bipartisan legislation to \naddress the VA scandal. The Sanders-McCain bill will increase patient \nchoice, it will infuse some much needed accountability into the VA \nsystem, and it was important for us to show some urgency in addressing \nthe crisis. That is why I voted for it, and that is why I am glad that \nthe majority leader decided to move forward on this effort, even if it \ntook a vote to set aside a partisan bill in order to take up this \nimportant bipartisan legislation.\n  It will now go to conference so it can be improved further. The \nsooner the bill managers begin negotiations with their colleagues in \nthe House, the sooner we can get a bill on the President's desk. I am \noptimistic they will do just that.\n  As I have said all week, the systemic failures and scandals we have \nseen within the administration are a national disgrace. When you see \n100,000 veterans--100,000 of them--waiting for care, that is a national \ndisgrace. When you see so many veterans waiting 3 months or longer just \nto get an appointment, that is a national disgrace. And when you see \nveterans dying before they even receive care they were counting on, it \nis completely unacceptable.\n  So this problem needs to be solved, and there is more to be done. A \nlot of the responsibility here resides with the President himself. He \nstill needs to nominate a capable manager who possesses the necessary \nskills, leadership, and determination to fix this scandal. He needs to \nsupport the thousands of VA workers committed to serving our veterans \nand to provide all those who serve bravely with the timely care they \ndeserve, and he needs to use all the tools in his toolbox to address \nthe systemic management failures--both the tools he already has and the \nnew ones we can provide him, such as those contained within the \nlegislation we passed yesterday. Our veterans have waited long enough \nfor care, and they shouldn't be made to wait any longer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3622-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              90TH BIRTHDAY OF PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Obviously much of Washington's focus this week has \nbeen on doing right by our veterans. That is exactly what we should be \ndoing. We owe so much to the men and women who protect us. In that \nspirit I would be remiss if I failed to acknowledge an important \nmilestone just reached by one of America's most famous veterans.\n  Today our Nation's 41st President, George H.W. Bush, turns 90. It is \na rare milestone. Only 4 other presidents have ever reached it: Herbert \nHoover, John Adams, Gerald Ford, and the man President Bush once served \nunder, Ronald Reagan.\n  Beyond wishing him a very happy birthday, I want to acknowledge \nPresident Bush's extraordinary record of service. On his 18th birthday \nthe future President volunteered as a World War II Navy pilot, going on \nto receive the Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery. From there he \nwould go on to excel in a dizzying number of fields as a businessman, a \nCongressman, a diplomat, CIA Director, leader of his party, Vice \nPresident and President, and Commander in Chief during Desert Storm and \nDesert Shield.\n  Even his post-Presidency has been marked by continuing and gracious \nwillingness to serve. Yet for all of his professional distinction, I \nknow President Bush's favorite job never appeared on his resume. It was \nhis role as proud husband to Barbara, who also turned a year older this \nweek, and as the father of five adoring children and proud grandfather \nand great-grandfather. Maybe that is why every time you see him these \ndays he always has a big smile on his face and a lively pair of socks \non his feet. With a loving family like that, it is not hard to see why.\n  So I am proud to cosponsor the resolution we agreed to yesterday \nhonoring this good man and former President for such a long lifetime of \nservice. I know my colleagues join me in sending President Bush the \nwarmest of birthday wishes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3622-4", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3622-S3623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MARTHA J. CASSITY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, one final note concerning our Nation's \nveterans. I want to honor an exemplary citizen of my home State, the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky, who has devoted her life to service of our \ncountry. Martha J. Cassity is a veteran of the U.S. Army, a member of \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars, and this Saturday she will be named the \nfirst female veteran State commander of the Kentucky VFW. Her ascension \nto this post is an accomplishment I believe is deserving of recognition \nand praise here in the Senate.\n  Martha was born on September 29, 1957, in my hometown of Louisville. \nShe was raised there by her parents Joan and Charles Blanford. While \nattending Western High School, Martha joined the Ladies Auxiliary to \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars in 1974, thus beginning her life of \ndevoted service to her country.\n  The stated mission of the Ladies Auxiliary is to serve ``the veterans \nof this country and our communities in honor of the sacrifices and \ncommitment of every man and woman who has served in uniform.'' For 9 \nyears Martha worked tirelessly to advance this mission, holding \nmultiple chairmanships in the organization.\n  Martha joined the U.S. Army in October of 1984 as a track vehicle \nrepairer and gave 10 years of honorable service to the Army, including \npostings in Germany and South Korea. She became eligible to join the \nVFW while stationed in South Korea, and she did so in 1991.\n  Upon returning from South Korea, Martha was stationed at Fort \nStewart, GA, where she was injured during the battalion's preparations \nfor Operation Desert Storm. She was honorably discharged in 1994. After \nleaving the Army, Martha earned her associate's degree in applied \nscience from Alabama Southern Community College. Although her days in \nthe military were behind her, Martha's service to America and her \nfellow veterans would continue. Since 1999 Martha has been heavily \ninvolved in the Veterans of Foreign Wars. She has held numerous \nchairmanships and chairs on the post and\n\n[[Page S3623]]\n\ndistrict levels. She has served as VFW post and district commander. She \nhas held chairmanships on the national level and has been on the \nNational Women Veterans Committee for the past 3 years. She currently \nserves as senior vice commander of the Kentucky VFW, and this Saturday \nshe will be named the first female veteran State commander of the \nKentucky VFW.\n  We owe our veterans an unimaginable debt for their service to our \ncountry. In this new post Martha will continue to serve her Nation by \nadvocating on veterans' behalf. Martha works to make real the VFW's \nvision: ensuring that veterans are respected for their service and \nrecognized for the sacrifices they and their loved ones have made on \nbehalf of a grateful America.\n  So today I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in recognizing \nMartha J. Cassity's lifetime of service to our country and wishing her \nwell in her new post as veteran State commander of the Kentucky VFW. \nShe is a true friend to Kentucky veterans, to the Commonwealth, and to \nour country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3623-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING TWO GREAT MEN\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to join our Republican leader in \nrecognizing the birthday of the 41st President of the United States, \nGeorge H.W. Bush. It is possible that nobody ever came to the \nPresidency with a preparation that exceeded his in both diplomacy--he \nserved as the first U.S. emissary to China in those decades and he \nserved as the head of the CIA. He served as Vice President.\n  I was just reading a few days ago another and new retelling of what \nhappened as the Soviet bloc fell apart--the importance of both \nPresident Reagan and President Bush, who brought his unique background \nto that time when it was so unpredictable what might happen. Frankly, \nthe results turned out to be carefully managed by this President as the \nBerlin Wall fell, as these countries came together, and President \nBush's skills were in great evidence, as they were when the coalition \nwas put together to push back what the Iraqis had done in Kuwait.\n  But probably his greatest example to all of us is an example of a man \nof kindness and generosity--some would say an almost too forgiving \nnature to have risen in politics as he did. But on his 90th birthday it \nis a good time for Americans to reflect about his service to the \ncountry. His wife's birthday was just a few days ago, and on her \nbirthday we also want to think about their family and what their family \nhas meant to the country.\n  My understanding is that President Bush has announced that he intends \nto jump out of an airplane for the third decade in a row as he did on \nhis 70th birthday and 80th birthday, and will do on this 90th birthday. \nI am not sure the judgment to do that is quite as good as the judgment \nhe showed in managing the future of the country. But if you are 90, you \nonly get to be 90 once, and I am sure he is the only 90-year-old \nPresident to have jumped out of an airplane in 3 different decades. We \nappreciate the service of George H.W. Bush to his country, from signing \nup to be the youngest pilot in World War II until the service that he \ncontinues to provide as a former President of the United States.\n  I was thinking about him and the other World War II veterans as we \nsee them leave us as heads of families, as examples we could turn to, \nand of the thought of another veteran whom one of my colleagues was \nmentioning just a few days ago, Senator Moran's father Raymond Moran.\n  Raymond Moran died on D-day at 98 years old. Senator Moran and I have \nbeen good friends for a long time. I know we speak on this floor in the \nSenate about ``my good friend, our long time relationship.'' This is a \ncase where we really have been close friends. We have been so close \nthat in the couple of decades now that we have known each other, I have \nheard a lot about Jerry Moran's father and his mother.\n  Jerry was lucky enough to have both of his parents until just a \ncouple of years ago, and his mom and dad were together until just a \ncouple of years ago. Jerry's father was a staff sergeant in North \nAfrica and in Italy. He was not part of the D-day invasion, even though \nhis death on June 6, the 70th Anniversary of D-day, is a significant \nday for all the veterans of that conflict.\n  The stories I heard about Senator Moran's father were the stories \nthat you would think a man from Plainville, KS, would be part of--\nquiet, unassuming, church-going, passing along the values that he stood \nfor to his family, and working hard and believing in some way that \nsomehow his children could do anything they wanted to do. Then he had \nthe opportunity to see his son in the Congress of the United States \nrepresenting that huge district in western Kansas and then in the \nSenate of the United States.\n  These two stories are very different--the stories of George H.W. Bush \nand Raymond Moran. But the lives that these two men led are very \nsimilar in the values that they stood for and the values of their \ngeneration--the generation that Tom Brokaw called ``the greatest \ngeneration.'' These are fundamental and foundational values to what we \nare all about as a nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3623-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3623-S3624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  This week the Senate stepped up united as we seldom are these days to \ntalk about the veterans of that war and our other wars and the \nobligation that we have to our veterans. The bill that the Senate \npassed yesterday, which I cosponsored and I voted for, can be better \nand, frankly, it will be better after we get a chance to have a \nconference with our House colleagues--maybe a conference similar to the \nconferences we used to hold. It is time we get back to the normal way \nof doing business.\n  But the underlying approach and key significant change this bill the \nSenate passed yesterday brings to the veterans is more options and more \nopportunities. Particularly our younger veterans want to see more \nchoices. They want to have more information.\n  When Senator Stabenow and I sponsored and initially put the bill \nforward in early 2013, the Excellence in Mental Health Act, the Iraq \nand Afghanistan veterans were among our greatest supporters along with \nlaw enforcement and the mental health community. This was for an act \nthey thought had the potential to provide more options for treatment, \nmore places to go, more ways to get the mental health treatment and \naccess you would like to have that worked with family, that worked with \njobs. These are young veterans who left the military but still have \nlots of obligations that they want to, need to, and should be trying to \nfulfill for themselves, their families, and the work they have chosen \nto do, so the assistance we can give them with more options is \nimportant.\n\n  This bill will give veterans more options. If the Veterans' \nAdministration fails to meet their needs in an appropriate way or if a \nveteran is 40 miles or an hour away--or any way you measure traffic and \ntime--from a veterans facility, that veteran will have the ability to \npermanently get the care they need at any facility that accepts \nMedicare patients at the Medicare rate, and that would be the \nreimbursement rate the government and the VA will be obligated to pay.\n  Even if a veteran lives next door to a VA hospital, if that hospital \ncould not see that veteran within the time the law will ultimately \ndecide is the critical time--by the way, there are occasions when the \ncritical time is right away. For a veteran suffering from a heart \nattack or contemplating suicide, there is no waiting period for them. \nIf a veteran can't be seen within 14 days for routine medical care, \nthat veteran will get a card that says they can go wherever they want \nto go.\n  I hope that is the way this final bill works out so veterans will \nhave lots of options. I think the Veterans' Administration is going to \nbe better if they have to compete. I have thought that for a long time.\n  I was at the Truman veterans facility--I stand here at one of the \ndesks Harry Truman used when he was in the Senate. His name is carved \nin the desk drawer. Anyway, I was at the Truman veterans facility in \nColumbia, MO, with my longtime good friend Dewey Rehms, who advises me \non veterans issues with the VFW, and we were meeting with the people \nwho run that hospital. Dewey Rehms said: As Senator Blunt has been \nsaying for at least\n\n[[Page S3624]]\n\n10 years, we need to have more options for veterans, and I am here \ntoday to say that I think he has been right. Even though defenders and \nadvocates of veterans hospitals and veterans systems want to make it \nbetter, we have been slow to embrace the idea that they want more \noptions, but they, along with Congress, are now willing to accept more \noptions, and this system will be better because veterans will have more \nchoices.\n  There are some issues that the Veterans' Administration is clearly \nbetter at than other facilities, and if they are not better than \nanybody else in dealing with those issues, we need to ask why. They are \nbetter at dealing with injuries that result from IEDs and explosive \nattacks, and so they should be better at dealing with eye injuries, \nloss of limb, and rehabilitation than anybody else in America. They \nshould also be better at dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder \nthan anybody else in America. But there is no reason they would be \nbetter at dealing with cancer or a heart problem or a lung issue. There \nis no reason to believe that at all.\n  This is the time to really rethink not what is best for the Veterans' \nAdministration but what is best for the veterans. Our goal should be \ndoing what is best for veterans, not what is best for the Veterans' \nAdministration.\n  We have all seen the list, and too many Missouri facilities are high \non that list with veterans waiting to get service. We have all heard \nabout the lists and heard the stories about supervisors from one \nfacility after another. And I am sure not every facility is telling the \npeople they supervise: Here is how we are going to manage the people \nwho want to be here so that it appears we are doing a better job than \nwe are doing.\n  We have had enough of that. We have had enough with appearing to be \ndoing a better job than they are doing. Now is the time to insist that \nthey do a better job. I think we took a big step in that direction \nyesterday.\n  I look forward to this bill improving as the House and Senate work \ntogether to bring the two bills to a final vote so it can get on the \nPresident's desk to be signed into law and ultimately change the way we \ndeal with veterans.\n  While I am on the floor, I have a few additional items to mention. My \noffice continues to get more letters about the unintended consequences \nwhen government thinks it can better manage people's health care than \nthey can themselves. I have three examples with me today that have come \ninto my office over the last few days.\n  Brandon from St. James, MO, said:\n\n       I purchased a separate health insurance policy for my \n     college-aged son because it was cheaper than continuing to \n     carry a family policy. It was a good policy with a decent \n     deductible through Blue Cross Blue Shield. We received a \n     notice that his insurance was going to be cancelled. This was \n     alarming to us and just plain wrong. The goal of Obamacare \n     was supposed to get more people insured. Instead it was doing \n     the opposite, it was cancelling his insurance.\n\n  Brandon goes on to say:\n\n       Then we got another notice later saying that he could keep \n     his current insurance after the President decided to extend \n     the mandate for another year.\n\n  Brandon says now he is concerned about what will happen--as many \npeople are--at the end of that year.\n  The more we postpone and delay and say the law doesn't mean what the \nlaw says, the more we are confused. When you have a bad law, postponing \nand delaying it has some merit.\n  Jerry from Jefferson City says he has a plan with really good \nbenefits. Under the President's health care plan, his plan will now and \nin the future be subject to an additional tax because he was fortunate \nenough to have a really good plan.\n  If they are really trying to get people the insurance they want--and \nhopefully as good an insurance plan as they could have--that is not \nsomething you would expect them to do.\n  The third example is from Earl, who resides in Palmyra, MO. He said \nhe is a senior citizen and found that his longtime preferred doctor is \nno longer in the network, so he has to pay to see the doctor he has \nalways seen. His doctor visits have gone from $20 a visit to $45 a \nvisit. So much for the pledge that if you like your health insurance, \nyou can keep it or if you like your doctor, you can keep him.\n  I hope we can find a way to rally around the health care challenge \nfor everybody the way we figured out a way to rally around the health \ncare challenge for veterans. We need a system that doesn't create all \nkinds of unintended consequences but just makes it easier for people to \nhave access to the insurance they want, not the insurance the \ngovernment says they should have.\n  I see my colleagues are joining me, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Walsh).

BUSH\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great American, \nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush, on the occasion of his 90th \nbirthday. As I reflect upon his remarkable life, I am amazed that he \nhas managed to pack so many accomplishments into just 90 short years. \nIn fact, today President Bush will mark this milestone by doing what he \nhas done on other birthdays so many times: He will jump out of an \nairplane--or as Barbara Bush once put it, he will jump out of a \nperfectly good airplane.\n  President Bush has spent every summer of his life--except during the \nwar years--at the family home in Kennebunkport, ME. A few years ago his \nneighbors in Kennebunkport came together to acquire a Navy ship's \nanchor in his honor. It is a fitting tribute to President Bush, who so \noften describes Walker's Point in Maine as his anchor to the windward. \nIt is fitting in another way. As a Navy aviator in World War II, as a \nMember of Congress, as U.N. Ambassador, as an envoy to China, as \nDirector of the CIA, as Vice President, and as President, George Bush \nembodies the values that are the anchor of American society. Courage, \nduty, honor, and compassion define our Nation and his life.\n  I am sure it is a great joy for him to share this special day with \nhis First Lady Barbara Bush, who also recently celebrated a birthday \nand who has done so much to promote family literacy in this country.\n  Last night our Senate colleagues unanimously passed a resolution that \nI submitted with dozens of our colleagues, including Maine Senator \nAngus King, the two Senators from Texas, and our two leaders, wishing \nboth President and Mrs. Bush the happiest of birthdays and honoring \nthem. The love within this extraordinary family anchors their \ncommitment to one another, to their community, to their two home \nStates, and to their Nation.\n  Another great President, Abraham Lincoln, spoke a great many eternal \ntruths that still inspire us today. Nothing he said was ever truer than \nthis:\n\n       It's not the years in your life that count. It's the life \n     in your years.\n\n  President George H.W. Bush has filled his years with a lifetime of \nservice and contributions marked by integrity and humility. I wish him \nand his family many more years of celebration, and I thank him for his \nextraordinary service and dedication to the country he loves so much.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3624-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3624-S3625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Last night the Senate passed the Intelligence \nauthorization bill, and it contains some very important provisions \nrelating to whistleblowers. While Senator Collins is on the floor, I \nwish to commend her for her extraordinary work on this issue. She has \nbeen at this for years, and it is a pleasure to be able to team up with \nher in this effort. I think it is fair to say both of us are very \nappreciative of the work done by our chair, Senator Feinstein, who did \nso much to make this possible.\n  I am going to be very brief. Chairman Harkin has some important \nremarks to make this morning. He graciously allowed me to go ahead of \nhim.\n  I wish to reflect a little bit on where we are with respect to \nwhistleblowers and the ability of intelligence agency employees to \nspeak out on matters that do not affect national security but are \nimportant to the debate about how to ensure our country resolutely \nfights terror and protects the public's right to know.\n\n[[Page S3625]]\n\n  I think it is fair to say--and I make this judgment on the basis of \nhaving been on the intelligence committee for 13 years now--that the \nvery important and worthwhile efforts to protect our national security \nafter the terrorists murdered more than 3,000 of our people on 9/11 \nwere also accompanied by a lot of overreaching by the intelligence \nleadership.\n  In recent years I think it is fair to say reformers have made some \nreal progress in our efforts to address that overreach, and now with \nthe PATRIOT Act and other measures coming before us--and the country \ntruly understanding what is at stake--I think it is going to be \npossible to make additional progress.\n  The reason I have come to the floor to discuss whistleblowers and the \nability of intelligence employees to speak out is a lot of the progress \nwe have seen recently would not have happened without whistleblowers \nand without some of the intelligence agency employees who are willing \nto risk their very careers to draw attention to real and serious \nproblems. I also make note of the fact that there were journalists, \njournalists who worked hard to report the facts responsibly to ensure \nan informed public debate that is so essential to our democracy.\n  Here is why the whistleblower issue is so important: There are \nexisting laws and regulations that say employees of American \nintelligence agencies who are concerned about possible misconduct, such \nas waste and fraud and illegal activity, are allowed to report that, \nand these laws and regulations lay out channels for doing it.\n  The reality is these principles--and the idea is that if there is \nmisconduct reported to one of these entities, the oversight entity \nwould have some opportunity to do something about it. Unfortunately, \nreporting misconduct by your colleagues or by your agency does not \nalways work out so well. That is why rocking the boat and reporting \nmisconduct can sometimes be hazardous for an individual's career.\n  If a government employee thinks about blowing the whistle on possible \nmisconduct, but can see that their supervisor or someone in their chain \nof command is condoning or participating in that misconduct, the \nemployee is rightly going to be concerned about possible retaliation \nand will not get that promotion and might not even be able to retain \ntheir security clearance.\n  So title VI of this year's Intelligence Authorization Act strengthens \nthe ability of those whistleblowers to come forward. It prohibits \nretaliation against intelligence whistleblowers who report misconduct \nusing approved channels, and it includes disclosures to the Congress or \nto an inspector general. It requires the executive branch to establish \nan appeals process for whistleblowers who have their security clearance \nunjustifiably revoked. Establishing these protections in statute--in \nstatute--in my view is an important advance forward. So we are making \nsome progress there with respect to whistleblowers, but we are not \ndoing so well with respect to making sure we are protecting the ability \nof our employees in the intelligence field to speak out.\n  Recently the head of National Intelligence issued a new policy \ndirective regarding agency employees' contact with the media. I will \ntell you, I am troubled by how sweeping in nature this is. At the \noutset, this is supposed to prevent disclosures of genuinely sensitive \ninformation. That is obviously an important goal, but it is also \nimportant to make sure that as we carry out that provision, we do not \nkeep employees, for example, from being able to talk about \nnonclassified matters.\n  The new policy makes it clear that intelligence agency employees can \nbe punished for having ``contact with the media about intelligence-\nrelated information.'' Make no mistake about it, that is so broad it \ncould cover unclassified information. It does not lay out any limits on \nthis extraordinarily broad term that I have described.\n  For example, is an employee's opinion about the scope of the NSA's \ndomestic surveillance activities intelligence-related information? Are \npublicly available assessments about developments in Syria or the \nUkraine intelligence related? This new directive does not say that, but \nit certainly points in that direction.\n  It becomes even more problematic if we read further down into this \nnew policy and review the definition of the word ``media.'' It includes \nany person or entity ``engaged in the collection, production or \ndissemination to the public of information in any form related to \ntopics of national security, which includes print, broadcast, film and \nInternet.'' This is extraordinarily broad. It goes well beyond \nprofessional news gatherers to include anyone who uses the Internet--\nthe Internet--to disseminate any information at all relating to \nnational security topics. So if someone is an employee of an \nintelligence agency and if they have a family member who likes to post \nor retweet articles about national security, suddenly having a \nconversation with that family member about important issues, such as \nNSA surveillance or the war in Afghanistan, could lead to them getting \npunished for having unauthorized contact with the media, which this \ndirective says ``will be handled in the same manner as a security \nviolation'' regardless of whether any classified information is \ndisclosed.\n  So I am willing to give everyone the benefit of the doubt; that some \nof the authors of this policy did not intend to have this happen. I \nknow that trying to make definitions of who is and is not a member of \nthe media is going to be a challenge with these new media technologies, \nbut that does not remove the fact that this policy is too broad, is too \nsweeping. It incorporates too much of what we want in Montana, in \nOregon, which is to make sure our people can talk about the policy \nissues that afford them the information so they can cast a ballot.\n  My hope is we can get this corrected because I think it is going to \nhave a chilling effect on intelligence professionals who simply want to \ntalk about unclassified matters on important national security issues--\nsuch as how to reform domestic surveillance or whether our country \nshould go to war.\n  In closing--and I thank my colleague from Iowa--we have made \nprogress. Back in 2012 there was an overly broad antileaks bill \nreported by the intelligence committee. It came out of the committee on \na 14-to-1 basis. I was the opposing vote. At that time I knew it was a \nflawed policy, but I did not even know how flawed it was because we \nwere not able at the time to talk to outside parties. When it was ready \nfor the floor, the country and journalists and citizens saw how \nsweeping it was, saw how flawed it was and the damage it would have \ndone, again, to discussing nonclassified matters, and we got it \ncorrected, but suffice it to say, we are going to have a host of \nchallenges in the years ahead. While we have won victories--such as \nagainst that overly broad antileaks policy, when we were able to derail \nwhat would have been the biggest invasion of privacy in our country's \nhistory, the Total Information Awareness Program, which was derailed \nbecause a young person in our office found a memo that demonstrated how \nsweeping it was--while we have made progress, we have a lot to do.\n  We are in better shape this morning because of the passage of that \nintelligence authorization bill and the additional measure of \nprotections for whistleblowers, and Senator Collins and the chair of \nthe committee, Senator Feinstein, deserve enormous credit. But make no \nmistake about it; we have a lot of work to do, and certainly that new \nmedia policy that has come from the Director of National Intelligence--\nthat is so broad, so broad it could make it difficult to talk about \nunclassified matters on the Internet--is just one example of the kind \nof issue we are going to have to zero in on in the days ahead.\n  I also note that our next speaker, Chairman Harkin, has been a great \nadvocate on these kinds of issues as well.\n  I thank him for his courtesy so I could go ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3625-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3625-S3628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WORLD DAY AGAINST CHILD LABOR\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, June 12, 2014, is the day set aside \nby the International Labor Organization to bring attention to the \ntragic predicament of millions of children across the globe who \ncontinue to be trapped in forced and abusive labor, often in extremely \nhazardous conditions.\n\n[[Page S3626]]\n\n  So today is the World Day Against Child Labor. It is a day set aside \nevery year globally for people to take a look at what is happening to \nkids around the globe who are forced into very abusive and exploitative \nlabor conditions.\n  I think we should obviously think about these children more than just \n1 day a year. We should think about them every day.\n  In my travels I have seen the scourge of forced and abusive child \nlabor firsthand. Previously on the floor--going back for almost 20 \nyears--I have spoken about how shocked I was to see the deplorable \nconditions under which some of these kids are forced to work. I have \nwitnessed this personally in places from South Asia to Latin America, \nto Africa.\n  These pictures I have in the Chamber are, as a matter of fact, \npictures I took myself. This picture was taken in a rug-making place in \nKathmandu, Nepal. We were told there were no children being forced into \nthis kind of labor, but under the cover of darkness, on a Sunday \nnight--it was probably after about 8 o'clock in the evening--we were \nable to make entry into one of these back-alley places, and this is \nwhat we came across: young people, girls and boys, some as young as 8 \nyears of age, working at these looms. I remind you, this is at 8 p.m. \non a Sunday night. They lived in barracks. They were housed, kind of \nstacked in barracks, so they could not leave, they could not go \nanywhere, they could not see their families.\n  Here is another picture of some older girls. These are young teenage \ngirls working at the same place. I did not take that picture because \nthis is me in the picture. This picture was taken by Rosemary \nGutierrez, my staff person.\n  So I witnessed this firsthand. Even though we were told no such thing \nexisted, we found it did exist.\n  This witnessing I have done in all these places has also been a call \nto action, a call to become a voice for these kids. Since 1992, when I \nfirst introduced the first bill to ban all products made by abusive and \nexploitative child labor, I have been leading this effort in the \nSenate.\n  Since the introduction of the bill in 1992, we have made progress in \nraising awareness about abusive and exploitive child labor, and we have \nsignificantly reduced the number of kids working in these hazardous \nconditions.\n  This effort received a big boost through the International Labor \nOrganization's Convention 182, a treaty calling for the elimination of \nthe worst forms of child labor.\n  In June 1999, President Clinton traveled to Geneva to support and \nsign this treaty. I was proud to accompany him on this historic trip \nwhen, for the first time in history, the world spoke with one voice in \nopposition to abusive and exploitative child labor. Countries from \nacross the political, economic, and religious spectrum came together to \nproclaim unequivocally that abusive and exploitative child labor is a \npractice that will not be tolerated and must be abolished.\n  After returning from that trip with President Clinton, I worked with \nSenator Jesse Helms in the Senate--he was then chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee--to bring this treaty before the full \nSenate. Just 5 months later, the Senate unanimously gave its advice and \nconsent, in a 96-to-0 vote, to ratify this treaty.\n  I have to digress for a minute. We have another treaty that hopefully \nwe will be bringing up soon; that is, the U.N. treaty on the rights of \npeople with disabilities--the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities. There has been a lot of talk about sovereignty, that we \ncan't give up our sovereignty. That is just a red herring. I would say \nthat many Senators who are here today voted on that 96-to-0 vote and \nnobody ever raised an issue about sovereignty. Have we lost our \nsovereignty since we joined that treaty? Not one speck. So why is it we \nare so concerned about some sovereignty issue when it deals with people \nwith disabilities but we weren't in 1999 when we voted unanimously, \nRepublicans and Democrats, when it dealt with exploitative child labor? \nSo I just want to make that point for people to consider when we, \nhopefully, bring up the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities sometime this summer.\n\n  With that historic treaty on exploitative child labor, the global \ncommunity rejected the argument that abusive and exploitative child \nlabor is a practice that can be excused by a country's poor economic \ncircumstances.\n  In pushing the United States to lead by example, I worked with the \nClinton administration to issue Executive order 13126, the \n``Prohibition of Acquisition of Products Produced by Forced and \nIndentured Child Labor.'' This Executive order, in effect since 1999, \nprohibits the U.S. Government from procuring items made by forced or \nindentured child labor.\n  I have always believed that trade agreements--on the right terms--\npromise many broadly shared benefits and opportunities for all. That is \nwhy I have worked hard to improve the labor provisions in various trade \nmeasures, concentrating particularly on combating abusive and \nexploitative child labor.\n  Thereafter, in 2000, during consideration of the Trade and \nDevelopment Act, I again worked with Senator Helms to amend the \nGeneralized System of Preferences--GSP--so that ``efforts to eliminate \nthe worst forms of child labor'' would be included as a criterion and \ncondition for receiving trade benefits. That is in the law.\n  Additionally, that amendment also mandated that the Department of \nLabor's International Labor Affairs Bureau--called ILAB--the U.S. \nGovernment's foremost authority on child labor, must produce an annual \nreport in which our government formally monitors and documents the \neffort or lack of effort of 144 countries and territories receiving \nU.S. trade benefits to meet their international commitments to \neliminate the worst forms of child labor. This amendment enshrined into \nlaw something I had been working on for years through the previous \nDepartment of Labor reports.\n  I intended for this report to bring countries to account, to shine a \nspotlight on their need to reform their national laws, and to put in \nplace safety nets for those trapped in the worst forms of child labor. \nThe aim is not punitive but, rather, to jump-start individual and \ncollective action. I wanted this report to be equal in stature--and in \nimpact--to the State Department's human rights report, and we are well \non our way to achieving that status.\n  On the technical assistance side, ILAB has funded 269 technical \ncooperation projects to combat exploitative child labor in over 90 \ncountries around the world. Think about that. We have funded 269 \nprojects to combat child labor in over 90 countries around the world. \nAs a result of these efforts, about 1.7 million children have been \nrescued from child labor through the provision of education and \ntraining services and livelihood support for their families.\n  Let's be clear. Whether we are talking about trafficking of children \nfor sexual exploitation or for purposes of forced labor in dangerous, \nabusive circumstances, the outcome is the same. These children are \nrobbed of their childhood, robbed of their education, robbed of their \nfuture. And in the countries where this takes place, the cycle of \npoverty is perpetuated.\n  A nation can neither achieve nor sustain prosperity on the backs of \nits children. In the global economy, the exploitation of children must \nnot be tolerated under any circumstances or for any reason.\n  When children are exploited for the economic gains of others, \neverybody loses--the children lose, their families lose, their country \nloses, the world loses. When even one child is exploited, every one of \nus is diminished. That is why in 2001, after reading investigative \nreports by Knight-Ridder exposing the magnitude of forced child labor \non cocoa farms in West Africa, I resolved to do what we could to end \nthis tragic exploitation of children.\n  Together with Congressman Eliot Engel of New York, we engaged the \nmajor chocolate companies in lengthy, intense negotiations. The result \nis what has become known as the Harkin-Engel Protocol--a public-private \npartnership to tackle the problem of child labor on nearly 1.5 million \nsmall cocoa farms in four African countries, beginning with Ghana and \nthe Ivory Coast.\n  One might ask why we are so interested in that. Think about this: 60 \npercent of all of the chocolate consumed in America--think about our \nHershey bars, the chocolates we eat, the cocoa we make, chocolate that \ngoes into\n\n[[Page S3627]]\n\ncakes, whatever it is--60 percent of all of that we consume in America \ncomes from two countries: the Ivory Coast and Ghana. How many people, \nwhen they bite into that chocolate or eat that chocolate bar or that \npiece of chocolate cake or drink some cocoa in the morning, know they \ngot that through abusive child labor--kids 10 years of age with knife \ncuts, machetes taking off their fingers, not being allowed to go to \nschool, forced to work in terrible conditions in these cocoa fields \njust so we can have chocolate to eat. Is that something we are proud \nof?\n  So we developed this protocol to begin the process of getting them \nout of this kind of work.\n  Again, we have made some progress. The joint efforts of the \nstakeholders failed to rise to a level to match the magnitude of the \nchallenge. This is what an independent study by Tulane University in \n2010 concluded:\n\n       Despite the concerted efforts of the various stakeholders--\n\n  One of them being us--\n\n     it is evident that much more work is required and the \n     majority of children exposed to the worst forms of child \n     labor remains unreached by the remediation activities \n     currently in place.\n\n  That was reported by Tulane University. The study noted that over 1 \nmillion children were trapped in exploitative labor in the cocoa sector \nof just those two countries.\n  I was determined to take steps to accelerate our progress. To that \nend, in September of 2010 we worked--again with ILAB--to develop a \nframework of action that sets the goal of reducing the worst forms of \nchild labor in the cocoa industry in those two countries, Ivory Coast \nand Ghana, to reduce it by 70 percent by 2020. The framework is a \ncooperative effort by the governments of the United States, Ivory \nCoast, Ghana, the international labor organizations, the cocoa \nindustry, and civil society groups, including labor unions. To \ninitially fund this effort, the U.S. Government agreed to provide $10 \nmillion in new funding. In turn, the international chocolate and cocoa \nindustry has committed an additional $20 million toward this endeavor.\n  This is truly a historic step with the key stakeholders--the national \ngovernments, the industry, the Department of Labor--working as partners \nto intensify efforts to combat the scourge of child labor in the cocoa \nfields. Together, key stakeholders have undertaken a sustainable \nremediation process that includes better schooling and training \nopportunities for these young people, measures to improve occupational \nsafety and health related to cocoa production, and livelihood services \nto vulnerable families.\n\n  Additionally, the framework creates true accountability. It \nestablishes benchmarks with audits and puts in place a credible, \ntransparent monitoring system in 100 percent of cocoa-growing regions \nin the two countries. The stakeholders also produce an annual report \ndocumenting programs in the field.\n  I am proud of ILAB's determined work in reducing the worst forms of \nchild labor. We should all be proud of these efforts. We and our \npartners around the world have made significant progress in the \nmonumental task of eliminating this scourge of child labor. Since the \nyear 2000, we have reduced the number of child laborers from 246 \nmillion to 168 million--a reduction of almost one-third, or 78 million.\n  I especially wish to thank former Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis for \nher great leadership during this period of time that we were hammering \nout these agreements and these frameworks. I also thank the present \nSecretary of Labor Tom Perez for his continued support and leadership \nof ILAB. I might also mention Carol Pier, who heads the International \nLabor Affairs Bureau, for her dynamic leadership in working to reduce \nthese worst forms of child labor not just in Ghana and the Ivory Coast \nbut around the world.\n  I might also add that we began, annually--actually, sometimes \nsemiannually--with the governments of Ghana and the Ivory Coast, as \nwell as with the cocoa industry--and I must say I am very encouraged by \nboth of these countries.\n  I might especially point out Ghana. Ghana has done remarkably well. \nThey are moving in the right direction in reducing this child labor and \nproviding support for education. The Ivory Coast has now come--Cote \nd'Ivoire, as they call it, is now coming along really well. They have \nhad some problems in the past. They have had some civil wars, \ndisruptions in their economy. Now the new President and especially the \nFirst Lady of the Ivory Coast have really taken on this goal of \nreducing child labor in the Ivory Coast. I compliment both countries \nfor their work with us and with the cocoa industry.\n  I compliment the cocoa industry as well. They are working as a true \npartner to try to meet that goal of reducing child labor by 70 percent \nby the year 2020.\n  I thank Tulane University for their investigations--for their \nmonitoring, I should say, more than investigations--their monitoring of \nthis process and getting us the true picture of what is happening.\n  I think all of this demonstrates that when we work together in a \nbipartisan way, we can confront some of the worst human rights abuses \nthat exist. On the issue of forced and abusive child labor, we are \nresolved to act without regard to party affiliation and with high \nregard for the interests of children trapped in abusive labor.\n  As we are all aware, I am retiring from the Senate next year, but I \nassure my colleagues that I am not retiring from this fight. I will \nfind some way to continue to be involved, to help make sure we reach \nthose goals of reducing child labor by 70 percent by 2020 in both of \nthose countries, and to use that also as a springboard for further \nkinds of cooperative efforts with governments around the world to get \nkids out of this terrible scourge of child labor.\n  Again, we have to ensure that ILAB has the resources to continue \neffective U.S. efforts. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nlater this year to finally authorize ILAB so that it has the tools it \nneeds to get children out of these abusive circumstances and into \nschools where they can gain the knowledge and skills they need not only \nto build a decent life for themselves but to break the cycle of poverty \nin the countries in which they live. It has been a vicious cycle of \npoverty and using and exploiting these kids. They don't learn, they \ndon't go to school, they become impoverished, and the cycle just \ncontinues and continues. We have to break that.\n  In countries where they break that cycle, we have seen they then \nenter a virtuous cycle where the kids go to school. They learn. They \nbecome educated. They are then able to perform jobs with higher skills. \nThey then bring in people to do some of these jobs that are paid a \ndecent wage. They are adults. And we find that the whole country \nprogresses because it is a virtuous cycle, not a vicious cycle.\n  Again, on this day, June 12, which is, as I said, called World Day \nAgainst Child Labor, it is good for us to pause and think about our own \npolicies in this country and what we are doing to help the rest of the \nworld, not in a punitive way of hitting someone over the head but by \nworking together to solve what people thought was an intractable \nproblem of kids not going to school, being forced into terrible labor \nconditions. It is time for us to think about how we work with other \ncountries to help solve this problem.\n  If we read the history of the United States, we know we had terrible \nchild labor problems in this country back in the 19th century. In the \n1800s we can see all kinds of pictures of kids working in our mills, \nworking on road crews. Again, when we finally stopped it--and it is \namazing that the arguments we heard then against stopping child labor \nare some of the same arguments we hear now about stopping it in other \ncountries. We entered a virtuous cycle of educating our youth, getting \nthem into schools. That led to higher incomes, led to a better gross \nnational product, enabled us to become the most powerful, well-educated \ncountry in the history of the world. There are so many countries that \nwould like to do that. They need our help. They need our support. \nThrough our Department of Labor and the International Labor Affairs \nBureau we can give them that kind of help and that kind of support so \nother countries can finally put an end to this scourge of child labor.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning with \ngreat sorrow and great concern and an even deep alarm about the events \nthat are transpiring rapidly in Iraq.\n  ISIS, the most extreme Islamist organization, radical terrorist \norganization, now controls at least one-third of Iraqi territory. It is \nrapidly gaining more. The areas of Fallujah, Mosul, Tikrit, they are on \nthe outsides of Samarra. With these victories, ISIS controls a swath of \nterritory that stretches from the Syrian-Turkish frontier in the north, \ndown to the Euphrates River, all of the way down to the Iraqi city of \nFallujah, just 40 miles west of Baghdad. Of course, hourly they are \nexperiencing greater gains while the Iraqi military and police seem to \nbe dissolving before our very eyes.\n  ISIS social media published pictures of their fighters demolishing \nthe sand berm which hitherto marked the border between Syria and Iraq, \nan interesting symbolic gesture. ISIS released footage of large numbers \nof weapons and armored military vehicles being received by members in \neastern Syria, confirming fears that the looted weapons would fuel the \ninsurgency on both sides, both Syria and Iraq.\n  Sources in the Syrian city of Hasaka confirmed that large numbers of \ntrucks, convoys of trucks, carrying weapons, arrived late on Tuesday \nand were met by a senior ISIS figure Omar al-Chechani. General Keane, \nthe architect of the surge said:\n\n       This organization [speaking of ISIS] has grown into a \n     military organization that is no longer conducting terrorist \n     activities exclusively but is conducting conventional \n     military operations. They are attacking Iraqi military \n     positions with company--and battalion--size formations. And \n     in the face of that the Iraqi security forces have not been \n     able to stand up to it.\n\n  The most frightening part is that ISIS's strength will only grow \nafter today. It will use the cash reserves from Mosul's banks, the \nmilitary equipment seized from military and police bases, and the \nrelease of 3,000 fighters from local jails to bolster its military and \nfinancial capacity.\n  ISIS has now become the richest terror group ever, even after looting \n$429 million from Mosul's central bank. The governor confirmed Kurdish \ntelevision reports that ISIS militants had stolen millions from \nnumerous banks across Mosul.\n  Most disturbing is as the Iraqi security forces are collapsing, \nKurdish and Shia militias are, to some degree, filling the vacuum.\n  The story goes on and on, including the fact that the International \nOrganization for Migration says that as many as 500,000 citizens have \nfled Mosul. There are reports of tens of thousands of citizens forced \nfrom their homes in other areas as fighting escalates across northern \nand central Iraq.\n  Then the question arises: Could all of this have been avoided? The \nanswer is absolutely yes--absolutely yes.\n  I think it is probably the height of ego to quote one's self, but I \nthink it is important to have again on the record what I said during \nthis whole process when the only goal of the President of the United \nStates was to leave Iraq and Afghanistan--and he is about to make the \nsame mistake in Afghanistan that he did in Iraq.\n  Those of us who knew Iraq, who knew Al Qaeda, who knew how vital and \nhow fragile the Iraqi Government is--the day the President announced \nthat all U.S. troops would leave Iraq by the end of the year, I said on \nOctober 21, 2011:\n\n       Today marks a harmful and sad setback for the United States \n     in the world. I respectfully disagree with the President: \n     this decision will be viewed as a strategic victory for our \n     enemies in the Middle East. . . . Nearly 4,500 Americans have \n     given their lives for our mission in Iraq. Countless more \n     have been wounded. I fear that all of the gains made possible \n     by these brave Americans in Iraq at such grave cost are now \n     at risk.\n\n  On November 15, 2011, in the Senate Armed Services Committee, when \nAmbassador Crocker said it was a mistake, I said--and I will not give \nthe whole statement, but I said:\n\n       We cannot avoid the fact that Iraq's progress is now at \n     greater risk than at any time since the dark days before the \n     surge, and that it did not have to be this way.\n\n  Finally, on December 14, 2011, the day the President triumphed, \nvisited Fort Bragg to mark the end--in his view, the end of the Iraq \nwar--I said:\n\n       Over 4,000 brave young Americans gave their lives in this \n     conflict. I pray that their sacrifice is not in vain. . . . \n     Unfortunately, it is clear that this decision of a complete \n     pullout of United States troops from Iraq was dictated by \n     politics, and not our national security interests. I believe \n     that history will judge this President's leadership with the \n     scorn and disdain it deserves.\n\n  Of course, we know the United States rebuffed, according to the New \nYork Times today, in an article by Michael Gordon and Eric Schmitt, the \nUnited States refused Maliki's request to strike against the militants' \nstrategic disaster, assisted by withdrawal from Iraq.\n  Iraq's terrorists are becoming a full-blown army.\n  One of the smartest guys I have encountered, a man named Dexter \nFilkins, has great experience. He has an article in the New Yorker, \n``In Extremists' Iraq Rise, America's Legacy.''\n\n       When the Americans invaded, in March, 2003, they destroyed \n     the Iraqi state.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       The negotiations between Obama and Maliki fell apart, in no \n     small measure because of a lack of engagement by the White \n     House. Today, many Iraqis, including some close to Maliki, \n     say that a small force of American soldiers--working in non-\n     combat roles--would have provided a crucial stabilizing \n     factor that is now missing from Iraq. Sami al-Askari, a \n     Maliki confidant, told me for my article this spring, ``If \n     you had a few hundred here, not even a few thousand, they \n     would be cooperating with you, and they would become your \n     partners.'' President Obama wanted the Americans to come \n     home, and Maliki didn't particularly want them the to stay.\n       The trouble is, as the events of this week show, what the \n     Americans left behind was an Iraqi state that was not able to \n     stand on its own. What we built is now coming apart. This is \n     the real legacy of America's war in Iraq.\n\n  If I sound angry, it is because I am angry, because during this whole \nperiod of time, for example, the Washington Post, in an editorial this \nmorning called ``The Iraq success.''\n\n       Denis McDonough, then deputy national security adviser and \n     now White House chief of staff, told reporters in 2011 that \n     Mr. Obama ``said what we are looking for is an Iraq that's \n     secure, stable and self-reliant, and that's exactly what we \n     got here. So there's no question this is a success.''\n\n  Sometime we are going to hold people responsible for their policies \nas well as their words. To declare that a conflict is over does not \nmean it necessarily is over.\n  There is a great piece by Daniel Henninger this morning in the Wall \nStreet Journal entitled, ``While Obama Fiddles.''\n\n       Meanwhile, Iraq may be transforming into (a) a second Syria \n     or (b) a restored caliphate. Past some point, the world's \n     wildfires are going to consume the Obama legacy. And leave \n     his successor a nightmare.\n\n  What needs to be done now? Every hour the options become fewer and \nfewer as ISIS, the most radical Islamist terrorist group alive, sweeps \nacross Iraq and now, according to the latest reports, is even \nthreatening Baghdad, that there are signs of further deterioration of \nthe Iraqi military.\n  What do we need to do now?\n  Obviously, the first thing I think we need to do is call together the \npeople who succeeded in Iraq, those who have been retired, and get \ntogether that group and place them in positions of responsibility so \nthey can develop a policy to reverse this tide of radical Islamist \nextremism, which directly threatens the security of the United States \nof America, and it is time the President got a new national security \nteam.\n  It is time he got a group of people together who know what it is to \nsucceed in conflict. I would say the leader of that would be General \nPetraeus. I would say General Mattis is one. I would say General Keane \nis another one. I would say Bob Kagan is another one.\n\n[[Page S3629]]\n\n  There is a group of people, along with myself and the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, who predicted every single one of these events because \nof an American lack of reliability and American weakness--and the \nPresident of the United States declaring that conflicts are at an end \nwhen they are not--an exit from Iraq and now an exit from Afghanistan \nwithout a strategy and without victory.\n\n  So drastic measures need to be taken. The Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff is one who has gone along with this policy for a long \ntime. We need a new Chairman. We need a new National Security Adviser. \nWe need a new team. We need a new team that knows what America's \nnational security interests are and are more interested in national \nsecurity than they are in politics.\n  I come to this floor with great sadness because all of this could \nhave been avoided. There is no inevitability about what is taking place \nin Iraq.\n  Iraq is a faraway place, but ask any intelligence leader in this \ncountry and that leader will tell you this poses--a takeover of Iraq in \nthe Iraq-Syria area--which is now the largest concentration of Al Qaeda \nin history--is a direct threat to the United States of America.\n  Our Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, has said in \nopen testimony that this concentration of Al Qaeda-oriented and Al \nQaeda-affiliated groups will be planning attacks on the United States \nof America.\n  The saddest part about all of this to me is the fact that 4,400 young \nAmericans lost their lives, thousands lost their limbs. Thousands are \nscarred for life because of the experience they had serving in Iraq. \nThey had it won. In the words of General Petraeus: We won the war and \nlost the peace.\n  That is a direct responsibility of the President of the United \nStates, who is the Commander in Chief. But I grieve for those families \nwho lost their loved ones, who fought so bravely, and made such \nsacrifices.\n  To see all of that, all of that success, where the surge succeeded, \nthanks to one of the finest generals in history, GEN David Petraeus, we \nsee this all now torn asunder because of a policy of withdrawal without \nvictory.\n  When those withdrawals and that policy were being orchestrated, the \nSenator from South Carolina, I, and others, stood and said: Please \ndon't do this. Please leave a small force behind in Iraq. We are \nbegging now, please leave a small force in Afghanistan.\n  The Afghans have no air capabilities. The Taliban will come back and \nall of the sacrifice in Afghanistan will be made in vain. So at least \ntake immediate action to try to break the advance of ISIS across Iraq \ntoday but also revisit the decision to completely withdraw from \nAfghanistan because the Taliban is still alive and well.\n  Because the President of the United States declares a conflict is \nover does not mean, in the eyes of the enemy, it is over. Conflicts end \nwhen the enemy is defeated. The Iraq war did not end because the forces \nwithin Iraq were still undefeated.\n  The conflict in Afghanistan will not be over 2 years from now in \n2017, when the final American is scheduled to leave Afghanistan.\n  Please learn the lessons.\n  I say to the President of the United States: Get a new national \nsecurity team in place. You have been ill-served by the national \nsecurity team and the decisions that you have in place now and the \ndecisions that you made, and have that new national security team come \nup with a strategy, a strategy to do whatever we can to prevent this \ndirect threat to the national security of this Nation, the security of \nthis Nation.\n  Of all the visits the former Senator from Connecticut, Joe Lieberman, \nLindsey Graham, and I made every Fourth of July, two or three times a \nyear, traveling the country, and having been in the company of not just \ngreat leaders such as General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker but the \nyoung men and women: the privates, the corporals, especially the \nsergeants--these brave men and women who were serving and who were \nwilling to sacrifice on behalf of somebody else's freedom they believe \nthey had won, the surge succeeded. Any military expert will tell us the \nsurge succeeded. But it was won at great sacrifice.\n\n  Among other cities, the black flags of Al Qaeda fly over the city of \nFallujah today. Ninety-six brave soldiers and marines were killed and \n600 wounded. What do we tell their families? What do we tell their \nmothers?\n  So it is not too late. America is still the most powerful nation on \nearth. We still have the finest and strongest military ever. We have \nthe finest young men and women who are serving in it ever.\n  It is not too late. But we have to have a dramatic reversal of course \nbefore the situation gets to the point where, as the Director of \nNational Intelligence has stated, this will be an area where attacks on \nthe United States of America will be orchestrated.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the referenced articles \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the New Yorker, June 11, 2014]\n\n               In Extremists' Iraq Rise, America's Legacy\n\n                          (By Dexter Filkins)\n\n       First Falluja, then Mosul, and now the oil-refinery town of \n     Bayji. The rapid advance of Al Qaeda-inspired militants \n     across the Sunni heartland of northern and western Iraq has \n     been stunning and relentless--and utterly predictable. Here's \n     a forecast: the bad news is just beginning.\n       The capture of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, by Sunni \n     extremists on Tuesday is the most dramatic example of the \n     resurgence of the country's sectarian war, which began almost \n     immediately after the withdrawal of the last American forces \n     in December, 2011. The fighters who took Mosul are attached \n     to an Al Qaeda spawn called the Islamic State of Iraq and al-\n     Sham, or ISIS, which is now poised to carve out a rump state \n     across the Sunni-dominated lands that stretch from western \n     Baghdad to the Syrian border and beyond.\n       As I detailed in a recent piece for the magazine, Iraq's \n     collapse has been driven by three things. The first is the \n     war in Syria, which has become, in its fourth bloody year, \n     almost entirely sectarian, with the country's majority-Sunni \n     opposition hijacked by extremists from groups like ISIS and \n     Jabhat al-Nusra, and by the more than seven thousand \n     foreigners, many of them from the West, who have joined their \n     ranks. The border between the two countries--three hundred \n     miles long, most of it an empty stretch of desert--has been \n     effectively erased, with ISIS and Nusra working both sides. \n     As the moderates in Syria have been pushed aside, so too have \n     their comrades in Iraq.\n       The second factor--probably the dominant one--is the \n     policies of Nuri Al-Maliki, Iraq's Prime Minister. Maliki is \n     a militant sectarian to the core, and he had been fighting on \n     behalf of Iraq's long-suppressed Shiite majority for years \n     before the Americans arrived, in 2003. Even after the \n     Americans toppled Saddam, Maliki never stopped, taking a \n     page--and aid and direction--from his ideological brethren \n     across the border in Iran. When the Americans were on the \n     ground in Iraq, they acted repeatedly to restrain Maliki, and \n     the rest of Iraq's Shiite leadership, from its most sectarian \n     impulses. At first, they failed, and the civil war began in \n     earnest in 2006. It took three years and hundreds of lives, \n     but the American military succeeded in tamping down Iraq's \n     sectarian furies, not just with violence but also by forcing \n     Maliki to accommodate Sunni demands. Time and again, American \n     commanders have told me, they stepped in front of Maliki to \n     stop him from acting brutally and arbitrarily toward Iraq's \n     Sunni minority. Then the Americans left, removing the last \n     restraints on Maliki's sectarian and authoritarian \n     tendencies.\n       In the two and a half years since the Americans' departure, \n     Maliki has centralized power within his own circle, cut the \n     Sunnis out of political power, and unleashed a wave of \n     arrests and repression. Maliki's march to authoritarian rule \n     has fueled the reeemergence of the Sunni insurgency directly. \n     With nowhere else to go, Iraq's Sunnis are turning, once \n     again, to the extremists to protect them.\n       Which brings us to the third reason. When the Americans \n     invaded, in March, 2003, they destroyed the Iraqi state its \n     military, its bureaucracy, its police force, and most \n     everything else that might hold a country together. They \n     spent the next nine years trying to build a state to replace \n     the one they crushed. By 2011, by any reasonable measure, the \n     Americans had made a lot of headway but were not finished \n     with the job. For many months, the Obama and Maliki \n     governments talked about keeping a residual force of American \n     troops in Iraq, who would act largely to train Iraq's Army \n     and to provide intelligence against Sunni insurgents. (They \n     would almost certainly have been barred from fighting.) Those \n     were important reasons to stay, but the most important went \n     largely unstated: it was to continue to act as a restraint on \n     Maliki's sectarian impulses, at least until the Iraqi \n     political system was strong enough to contain him on its own. \n     The negotiations between Obama and Maliki fell apart, in no \n     small measure because of a lack of engagement by the White \n     House. Today, many Iraqis, including some close to\n\n[[Page S3630]]\n\n     Maliki, say that a small force of American soldiers working \n     in non-combat roles--would have provided a crucial \n     stabilizing factor that is now missing from Iraq. Sami al-\n     Askari, a Maliki confidant, told me for my article this \n     spring, ``If you had a few hundred here, not even a few \n     thousand, they would be coooperating with you, and they would \n     become your partners.'' President Obama wanted the Americans \n     to come home, and Maliki didn't particularly want them to \n     stay.\n       The trouble is, as the events of this week show, what the \n     Americans left behind was an Iraqi state that was not able to \n     stand on its own. What we built is now coming apart. This is \n     the real legacy of America's war in Iraq.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n                           The Iraq `Success'\n\n\n   The Obama administration needs a strategy as dangers mount in the \n                              Middle East\n\n       For years, President Obama has been claiming credit for \n     ``ending wars,'' when, in fact, he was pulling the United \n     States out of wars that were far from over. Now the pretense \n     is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain.\n       On Monday, a loathsome offshoot of al-Qaeda, the self-\n     styled Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, captured Mosul, one \n     of Iraq's most important cities, seizing large caches of \n     modern weaponry and sending half a million civilians fleeing \n     in terror. ISIS, which can make the original al-Qaeda look \n     moderate, controls large swaths of territory stretching from \n     northern Syria into Iraq. On Tuesday, militants advanced \n     toward Baghdad, capturing Tikrit and other cities.\n       If Iraq joins Syria in full-fledged civil war, the danger \n     to U.S. allies in Israel, Turkey, Jordan and the Kurdish \n     region of Iraq is immense. These terrorist safe havens also \n     pose a direct threat to the United States, according to U.S. \n     officials. ``We know individuals from the U.S., Canada and \n     Europe are traveling to Syria to fight in the conflict,'' Jeh \n     Johnson, secretary of homeland security, said earlier this \n     year. ``At the same time, extremists are actively trying to \n     recruit Westerners, indoctrinate them, and see them return to \n     their home countries with an extremist mission.''\n       When Mr. Obama defended his foreign policy in a speech at \n     West Point two weeks ago, he triggered some interesting \n     debate about the relative merits of engagement and restraint. \n     But the question of whether Mr. Obama more closely resembles \n     Dwight D. Eisenhower or Jimmy Carter is less relevant than \n     the results of his policy, which are increasingly worrisome.\n       In Syria, where for three years Mr. Obama has assiduously \n     avoided meaningful engagement, civil war has given rise to \n     ``the most catastrophic humanitarian crisis any of us have \n     seen in a generation,'' Mr. Obama's United Nations ambassador \n     Samantha Power said in February.\n       In Libya, Mr. Obama joined in a bombing campaign to topple \n     dictator Moammar Gaddafi and then declined to provide \n     security assistance to help the nation right itself. It, too, \n     is on the verge of civil war.\n       In Iraq, Mr. Obama chose not to leave a residual force that \n     might have helped keep the nation's politics on track, even \n     as the White House insisted there was no reason to worry. \n     Denis McDonough, then deputy national security adviser and \n     now White House chief of staff, told reporters in 2011 that \n     Mr. Obama ``said what we're looking for is an Iraq that's \n     secure, stable and self-reliant, and that's exactly what we \n     got here. So there's no question this is a success.''\n       Now Mr. Obama is applying the same recipe to Afghanistan: \n     total withdrawal of U.S. troops by 2016, regardless of \n     conditions.\n       At West Point, the president stressed that ``not every \n     problem has a military solution.'' That is obviously true. In \n     fact, a goal of U.S. policy should be to help shape events so \n     that military solutions do not have to be considered. The \n     presence of U.S. troops in South Korea, for example, has \n     helped keep the peace for more than a half century.\n       Total withdrawal can instead lead to challenges like that \n     posed by Iraq today, where every option--from staying aloof \n     to more actively helping Iraqi forces--carries risks. The \n     administration needs to accept the reality of the mounting \n     danger in the Middle East and craft a strategy that goes \n     beyond the slogan of ``ending war responsibly.''\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Senator McCain was on the floor, and I am sorry I missed \nhim. I was in a briefing.\n  To the American people, the situation in Iraq is dire. Syria has \nbecome a launching pad for attacks against the Iraqi people.\n  The ISIS--we don't know who these people are, but we are going to get \nto know them--are Islamic jihadists based in Syria and Iraq. They are \nan army, and they are not a bunch of hoodlums.\n  They have a very specific game plan. They want to create an Islamic \ncaliphate and basically dominate Iraq and Syria. Some want to go to \nLebanon and want to create an Islamic state that will be ruled under \nthe most extreme version of Islamic law one could imagine--hell on \nearth for women, not good for us, the end of modern thought in that \npart of the world. The people of Iraq and Syria are not by their nature \nradical Islamists. The people who are beginning to win the day on the \nbattlefield come from all over, and they truly are radical Islamists \nwho would put the world in darkness if they could.\n  The next 9/11 is in the making as I speak. These people are using \nSyria and now Iraq as a training ground for international jihad. There \nare European jihadists and American jihadists over in the Syria as I \nspeak. Over 2 weeks ago, the largest truck bomb explosion by a suicide \nbomber in Syria was by an American citizen. And, I hate to say it, but \nthere are more over there today.\n  The question for the United States is: Does it really matter if the \nISIS dominates Syria and Iraq or any part thereof? I think it does. I \nthink it is a very bad scenario for us. I think it directly impacts our \nsecurity here at home, and it will throw the region into chaos.\n  It is clear to me, after the briefing, there is no scenario by which \nthe Iraqi Security Forces can stop the advancement of this group toward \nBaghdad. I don't think they go much beyond Baghdad, because then they \nget into the Shia areas of Iraq. That would be one hell of a fight. But \nMosul has fallen, Tikrit has fallen, Fallujah has fallen. Now they are \nmarching to Baghdad. Unless something changes, they will be successful.\n  They are sending the military equipment they are seizing into Syria \nto help their cause there. This is a very dangerous situation.\n  I urge President Obama to go on national television, explain what is \ngoing on in Iraq and Syria, and make the case to the American people \nwhy we should stay out or why we should do something.\n  I think American air power is the only hope to change the battlefield \nequation in Iraq. I know no American wants to set boots on the ground, \nand I don't feel that is a solution worthy of consideration at this \npoint. But I have been told by our military commanders the Iraqi army \nis in shambles, and without some kind of intervention, Baghdad is \ndefinitely in jeopardy, most of the Sunni areas of Iraq will be run by \nISIS, and they will join forces with their colleagues over in Syria.\n  I worry about the King of Jordan. I worry about Lebanon being next. \nGod knows, if we lose the King of Jordan, the last moderate force in \nthe Middle East surrounding Israel, what a calamity that would be.\n  I end with this thought. I remember discussing Iraq with President \nBush as if it was yesterday. I went over on numerous occasions with \nSenator McCain early on after the fall of Baghdad and every trip it was \nworse.\n  I remember the Bush administration telling us: These are just a few \ndead-enders. Everything is fine. The media is hyping all the problems \nbecause they don't like President Bush.\n  The soldiers on the ground were telling us: I am driving around every \nday. I don't know why I am driving around, but I am getting my ass shot \noff--pardon my French here--without purpose.\n  I remember sitting down with President Bush, his administration and \nhis team, and Senator McCain, and we candidly told President Bush: If \nyou don't adjust your strategy, if you don't reinforce Iraq, we are \ngoing to lose.\n  To his credit, he did, and the surge actually worked. We left Iraq in \na very good spot. The security forces had won the day. We had driven \nout Al Qaeda. Politics was beginning to take over. Violence had been \nreduced tremendously. The surge worked. Our military did their job, \nfighting alongside their Iraqi counterparts.\n\n[[Page S3631]]\n\n  But the decision to withdraw from Iraq created a crisis of \nconfidence, a capability crisis. When there is a vacuum in the Middle \nEast, people go back to their corners--and that is exactly what has \nhappened in Iraq with the lack of an American presence.\n  Here is what is so heartbreaking. Some 10,000 or 15,000 U.S. soldiers \nstrategically placed would have held this together and politics would \nhave taken over. But it is hard to do political agreements when you are \nsubject to being killed by people on the other side. You need a certain \nlevel of security to advance society.\n  That security has completely been lost in Iraq, and Syria is a \ncontagion for the entire region.\n  Our indecision and indecisive action in Syria--it was bipartisan, by \nthe way. Plenty of Republicans said: Stay out of Syria; it is none of \nour concern. What Senator McCain and I have been worried about in Syria \nfor about 3 or 4 years is that Iran and Russia were behind Assad. It is \nnot in our interest for Iranians to be in Syria because it is very hard \nto get them to abandon their nuclear program if they think we are weak \nin Syria, and it is in our national security interest for Syria not to \nbecome an Islamic state.\n\n  About 3 years ago there were 500 foreign fighters. Today there are \n26,000. So to those Republicans and Democrats who said stay out of \nSyria, don't use airstrikes or air power, I am sad to say that I think \nyou were wrong. I think Syria has become an absolute breeding ground \nfor radical Islamists, and the next attack against our country could \nvery well originate from the people who are fighting in Syria today. \nAnd I have never been more worried about another 9/11 than I am right \nnow.\n  So, Mr. President, if you are willing to adjust your policies, we \nwill sit down with you. If you are willing to sit down with your \ngenerals and get some good, sound military advice, we will stand with \nyou because what happens in Iraq and Syria does matter. I don't think \nwe need boots on the ground. I don't think that is an option for \nconsideration. But if our military leaders say that we need to stop \nISIS because it is in our national security interests through the use \nof our air power, count me in if that is what our generals say.\n  I will stand with you, Mr. President, if you correct your policies. \nIf you continue to be delusional about the world, I will be your worst \ncritic.\n  With that, I yield back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3631-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination as follows:\n  Nomination of Crystal Nix-Hines, of California, for the rank of \nAmbassador during her tenure of service as the United States Permanent \nRepresentative to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and \nCultural Organization.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate on the nomination equally divided in the usual form.\n  Who yields time?\n  No one having yielded time, the time will be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the nomination of Crystal \nNix-Hines to be the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Educational, \nScientific, and Cultural Organization, otherwise called UNESCO. I \nwanted to speak on this nomination and once again express my firm \nopposition to the administration's stated intention to circumvent U.S. \nlaw--the law that was passed by this body regarding funding of UNESCO--\nand an intention repeated by Ms. Nix-Hines at her hearing before the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee last year.\n  I have nothing personal against this individual. I have not met her. \nI am sure she is a woman of good character and qualified for the job. \nBut nevertheless I think it is important that we understand before we \ntake this vote what we are doing here and why we shouldn't be doing it \nand that Ms. Nix-Hines's previous statement is relevant to her \nconfirmation to this organization.\n  If confirmed, this nomination will result in the administration \nsending a representative to an organization which we do not fund and in \nwhich we have no vote. That is right. We will be sending a confirmed \nU.S. Ambassador to an organization which we do not support and in which \nwe have no vote. That contradiction can only mean the administration is \nstill attempting to change those circumstances by seeking waiver \nauthority, and that is the reason why I am speaking today and why I am \nopposing this nomination.\n  Let me provide some context. In late 2011 UNESCO offered membership \nto the Palestinian Authority. This was a consequence of a Palestinian \ncampaign to achieve recognition as a state by appealing unilaterally \nand directly to the United Nations and its agencies. UNESCO's decision \nto admit Palestine as a full member has further dimmed prospects for \nnegotiated peace in the Middle East.\n  My fear is that this step--which the Palestinians regard as a \nsuccess--will encourage them to press for membership in other U.N. \nbodies as well, achieving a legitimacy through the U.N. that they don't \ndeserve as a state and that they need to understand presents major \nobstacles to ever achieving some type of reconciliation between the \nIsraelis and the Palestinians. This will harm Israel, it will harm the \nPalestinians' own interests, harm the U.N. agencies involved, and \ndamage our own national interests.\n  To prevent this sort of unilateral maneuver by the Palestinians, U.S. \nlaw--it is the law--has long prohibited funding to any U.N. agency that \nadmits Palestine as a member. The purpose of this termination and the \nwill of Congress regarding it was to discourage such reckless behavior \nby the U.N. and by the Palestinians.\n  Let me repeat that. The harm that is done through this has caused \nus--brought us to a point where we passed a law signed by the President \nthat said we will not support any agency that acknowledges and admits \nPalestine as a recognized state. That is our policy. So funding UNESCO \nor even providing a waiver for that would be a clear violation of U.S. \nlaw.\n  We have seen the administration try to work around Congress in a \nnumber of ways, neglecting to check the law in terms of what they are \nrequired to do. We are currently in an embroiled situation here with \nthis detainee release from Guantanamo of five of the top leaders of the \nTaliban--a blatant violation of the law that exists on the books in \nterms of consultation with Congress before this is done. Nevertheless, \nthat is not what I am here for today. That is another issue.\n  Our laws require the United States to cut off budget support to \nUNESCO, and we will do the same to other agencies that also circumvent \nthe correct path to negotiated settlement. I think that is good policy.\n  When some administration officials spoke publicly soon after the \nUNESCO vote about finding a ``work-around'' or seeking a waiver, I \nintroduced legislation not to tolerate such alternatives and said I \nwould not support the waiver. I repeated those efforts in subsequent \nState and Foreign Operations appropriations bills when the \nadministration included appropriations for UNESCO in its budget request \nand Secretary Kerry said in his testimony that they would be \n``seeking to change or repeal the law.''\n\n  In his comments on the subject, Secretary Kerry spoke about the value \nhe saw in this U.N. agency but said nothing about the value of \ndiscouraging Palestinian efforts to circumvent negotiations and change \nits status at the\n\n[[Page S3632]]\n\nU.N. before there is an agreed settlement.\n  Similarly, in Ms. Nix-Hines statement for the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, she spoke forcefully about her views on UNESCO and its \nimportance to U.S. interests. Maybe it is true, maybe it is not true, \nbut nevertheless she said nothing about how the Palestinian end run at \nthe United Nations has harmed our quest for a Middle East settlement. \nShe repeated the administration's intention to seek a waiver of \nexisting law to resume contributions to UNESCO, declaring, ``We are not \na country that turns tail when decisions do not go our way. We are not \na people who shrink from challenge.''\n  Well, that is true, we are not. But in stating that, she has equated \na principled stance on an important issue--a stance she does not agree \nwith--as an act of cowardice. It is an act of law. It is an act that \nwas passed by this body with support from the House of Representatives \nand signed by the President of the United States. So her statement \nmakes no sense unless you come to the conclusion that she was handed \ntalking points--as other members of the administration have been--and \ntold: Go ahead and go down and say this if this question comes up. \nDon't worry about the facts.\n  I can understand why a nominee to UNESCO would want to restore U.S. \nfunding to the organization and thus restore the U.S. vote there, but \nto purposely ignore or misconstrue the opposing view--one stated in \nU.S. law and supported by this Congress for 20 years--and then to go on \nand imply that such a view is cowardly--that is offensive. That is \noffensive to those Members who have supported this law, who enacted \nthis law. It is offensive to the President who signed this law. It is \noffensive to the American people who sent us here to pass laws and to \nenforce those laws as passed. To call that action cowardly is something \nthat is offensive as well.\n  The laws that are designed to discourage U.N. bodies from admitting \nPalestinian authority before a comprehensive settlement are essential \nif negotiations are to have any chance at all. Far from being \nanachronistic, as some connected with UNESCO are claiming, they are \nmore current and important now than ever. It is now that the \nPalestinians are trying to change their status at the U.N. \nunilaterally, and it is now that we must use the available tools to \nprevent it.\n  If we were to grant waiver authority to the administration as they \nhave requested, the floodgates would open. The existence of waiver \nauthority--not to mention the actual exercise of a waiver--would \nembolden the Palestinians to make even greater unilateral efforts to \nachieve membership in U.N. bodies, and the result would present \nrepeated funding dilemmas for us and would make a true negotiated peace \nthat much more difficult to achieve.\n  The nomination of a candidate for the UNESCO position at least gives \nme this opportunity to restate clearly and unambiguously once again \nthat I remain firmly opposed to providing funds to UNESCO or any other \nU.N. agency that repeats this serious error, and I hope my colleagues \nwould understand this and support it also. Thus, I cannot support \nfunding UNESCO while Palestine is a member, nor will I support a waiver \nof existing restrictions, and I don't think anyone else should either \nbecause it violates U.S. law.\n  To repeat, this nomination means the administration wants to send a \nrepresentative to an organization which we do not fund and in which we \nhave no vote. That contradiction can only mean the administration still \nwants to change those circumstances by seeking waiver authority, and \ntherefore I will oppose this nomination and hope my colleagues will \nsupport the same.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I wish to urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting Dr. Stanley Fischer to be Vice \nChair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. I also \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting Mr. Jerome Powell and Dr. \nLael Brainard to be members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.\n  Each of these individuals has a unique set of skills and experiences \nto provide the Board of Governors a diverse perspective on how to \ncontinue to help the economy recover and promote a more stable \nfinancial system.\n  Dr. Fischer's background is impressive. In May, he was confirmed by \nthe Senate to be a member of the Federal Reserve. Between 2005 and \n2013, he was the head of the Bank of Israel. Prior to his service at \nthe Bank of Israel, Dr. Fischer held positions as the vice chairman of \nCitigroup and the First Deputy Managing Director of the International \nMonetary Fund. Before the IMF, Dr. Fischer was the Killian professor \nand Head of the Department of Economics at MIT, where he taught some of \nthe most preeminent economists of our time, including former Fed \nChairman Ben Bernanke, former Council of Economic Advisers Chair Greg \nMankiw, and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi. Former Fed \nChairman Bernanke said of Dr. Fischer: ``Stan was my teacher in \ngraduate school, and he has been both a role model and a frequent \nadviser ever since. An expert on financial crises, Stan has written \nprolifically on the subject and has also served on the front lines.''\n  Mr. Powell became a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors \nin 2012. He has served during a period in which the Fed tackled a \nnumber of important issues, including implementing the Wall Street \nReform Act and maintaining strong monetary policy that promotes job \ncreation and economic recovery. Prior to his appointment, Mr. Powell \nwas a visiting scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center, where he \nfocused on Federal and State fiscal issues. Mr. Powell also served as \nan Assistant Secretary and as Undersecretary of the Treasury under \nPresident George H.W. Bush.\n  Dr. Brainard previously served as Under Secretary for International \nAffairs at the Treasury from 2010 to 2013. She also served as Deputy \nDirector of the National Economic Council and as the U.S. Sherpa to the \nG8. She was vice president of the Brookings Institution and an \nAssociate Professor of Applied Economics at MIT Sloan School of \nManagement.\n  The Federal Reserve Board has many important tasks at hand including \neffective monetary policy that promotes full employment, continued \nimplementation of Wall Street Reform, and taking steps that will \nimprove financial stability, reduce systemic risk and end ``too big to \nfail.'' I am confident these three nominees will be extremely valuable \nin these endeavors and I hope we can confirm them without delay. I urge \nmy colleagues to support Dr. Brainard, Mr. Powell, and Dr. Fischer.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in \nsupport of the nomination of Dr. Stanley Fischer to be Vice Chairman of \nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. I know Dr. \nFischer personally and have worked with him over the years, and I am \nfully confident that he is well qualified to succeed Janet Yellen as \nVice Chairman of the Fed, as she begins her tenure as Chair.\n  Dr. Fischer has had an extraordinarily impressive and well-rounded \ncareer thus far. After receiving his bachelor's and master's degrees \nfrom the London School of Economics and his Ph.D. at MIT, Fischer \nserved in high-level positions in academia, the private sector, as well \nas at multiple international financial institutions. His knowledge and \nexpertise of economic policy is world-renowned--in fact some of the \nmost influential economic policy makers today, including former Federal \nReserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and the head of the European Central \nBank, studied under the guidance and influence of Dr. Fischer.\n  Most recently, Stanley Fischer served as governor of the Bank of \nIsrael. Appointed in 2005 by then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon \nand Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Dr. Fischer led Israel's \ncentral bank and steered its economy through the global financial \ncrisis. When the global crisis first hit in 2008, Fischer took decisive \naction to protect the Israeli economy. His decision to lower interest \nrates actually came a day before the Fed, the Bank of England or the \nEuropean Central Bank took similar action.\n  It is largely due to his leadership that while other countries, \nincluding the United States, were still struggling in the depths of \nrecession in 2009, Israel emerged more or less unscathed. In fact, by \n2009 the Israeli economy had recovered to the point where central bank \nassistance was no longer needed, and Fischer actually made the decision \nto raise interest rates. Furthermore, as\n\n[[Page S3633]]\n\nthe recession spread across the United States and Europe, foreign \ncapital began to flow into Israel, raising the value of its currency, \nthe shekel--which became a big problem for Israeli exports. To offset \nthis inflation, prop up Israeli exporters, and boost the economy, \nFischer again had to act quickly to depreciate Israel's currency, \nbuying up $100 million each day in foreign currency. In less than 1 \nyear, he had reduced the value of the currency by 25 percent and given \nIsrael a trade surplus of $5 billion.\n  His quick and intelligent actions in the face of crisis helped \nmaintain financial and price stability and improve employment. These \nactions shielded the Israeli economy from the recession and produced \nstrong growth. As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated in \n2013, ``Fischer was a key contributor to Israel's economic growth. His \nexperience and wisdom have helped the Israeli market reach many \nachievements, even in a time of global crisis.''\n  Prior to his tenure at the Bank of Israel, Dr. Fischer served as the \nhead of the Economics Department at MIT, chief economist at the World \nBank, and as the number two official at the International Monetary \nFund, IMF. He also spent time in the private sector as vice president \nof Citigroup from 2002 to 2005.\n  Throughout his impressive career, Dr. Fischer has undoubtedly learned \nvaluable lessons in responding to global financial and economic crises. \nHis extensive policymaking experience and expertise make him uniquely \nqualified to serve in the Fed's number two position and navigate the \nchallenges we face as our economy continues to recover from the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression. Most importantly, I am sure we \nwill see soon, Dr. Fischer is a collaborative leader, a visionary, and \nan absolute joy to work with. We are truly lucky to have a leader of \nsuch courage and character up for this position, and I urge my \ncolleagues to swiftly approve his nomination.\n  Mr. COATS. With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin).

Jane Chu, of Missouri, \nto be Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Arts; and Todd A. \nBatta, of Iowa, to be an Assistant Secretary of Agriculture.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate Todd A. Batta of Iowa on his confirmation as Assistant \nSecretary of Agriculture for Congressional Relations. I can personally \nattest that he is very well qualified and will undoubtedly do an \noutstanding job in his new position.\n  It has been a pleasure for me to know Todd and his family for many \nyears. He grew up in Lanesboro, IA, where his parents, Rick and Wanda, \ncurrently reside. His aunt, Bev Schroeder, was a member of my staff for \nover 20 years, both in Iowa and here in Washington, working on \neducation policy and other matters. In fact, Todd's first political \nwork was to help hand out Harkin information at parades when he was \njust three or 4 years old.\n  Todd began serving on my staff as an intern in the summer of 2001, \nafter receiving his B.A. from Winona State University, and later worked \nfor me as a researcher, deputy scheduler, and scheduler. In 2005, he \nmoved from my personal office to work as a professional staff member on \nthe Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, during \nthe time I served as either ranking member or chairman.\n  It is Todd's good fortune to be married to Adrianna Logalbo. They \nbegan dating when Todd was on my staff. So, as I say, Todd and his \nfamily have been good friends to me for a very long time\n\n[[Page S3634]]\n\n  From 2009 to 2011, Todd was a legislative assistant on the staff of \nSenator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, handling agriculture and agriculture \nappropriations for Senator Kohl. He then served as special assistant in \nthe Office of Congressional Relations at the Department of Agriculture, \nand since 2012, Todd has been senior advisor to the Secretary of \nAgriculture. In this role, he provides strategic advice and guidance to \nthe Secretary regarding USDA's budget, legislative, and regulatory \nagenda.\n  Given Todd's strong personal qualities, experience, and proven \nabilities, I could not have been happier when I learned that President \nObama had chosen him to serve as Assistant Secretary of Agriculture. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with Todd and know that he will do a \ntremendous job in this new role.\n\n\n                       Vote on McCord Nomination\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the unanimous consent proposal that I \njust made a few moments ago that was objected to by the Senator from \nKentucky related to the need of the Senate to take up the ratification \nof five tax treaties that were approved by the Committee on Foreign \nRelations on a unanimous voice vote, including a revised U.S.-\nSwitzerland tax treaty that was amended in 2009, with a protocol \nenabling the United States to obtain more information--more information \nfrom Switzerland about U.S. taxpayers with hidden Swiss bank accounts.\n  We have been trying to close down these offshore tax havens and the \nway in which they aid and abet American tax avoidance for years. Here \nwe have a tax treaty which will help us get more information about the \nAmerican taxpayers who are trying to avoid paying their taxes to Uncle \nSam, and we get an objection to the ratification, even to taking up the \nratification of this treaty.\n  American taxpayers have had it. I would say have had it up to here, \nexcept that will not come across on the record. They have had it with \nprofitable corporations and wealthy individuals avoiding taxes through \nthe use of tax havens, shell companies, and tax avoidance schemes. The \nAmerican people want us to end it. We ought to legislate an end to it.\n  By the way, it is long overdue. We ought to close the tax loopholes \nwhich are used so the most profitable corporations in this country \navoid paying taxes by shifting their intellectual property to shell \ncorporations that they create in tax havens or by other kinds of tax \ndodging.\n  We can put an end to it. We can close those tax loopholes. We ought \nto do it but that is not what should be before us today. What should be \nbefore us today but for that objection we had from the Senator from \nKentucky, are the tax treaties which have been approved by our Foreign \nRelations Committee, one of which was signed 4 years ago.\n  We have all heard about Swiss bank accounts that are used to hide \nmoney from Uncle Sam. Back in 2008, in a bipartisan report I issued \nwith then the ranking Republican on the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, Norman Coleman, with bipartisan support, we disclosed \nthat UBS, the largest bank in Switzerland, had opened as many as 52,000 \nbank accounts, with about $20 billion in assets, for U.S. citizens who \nhad hidden their accounts from our Treasury.\n  UBS later signed a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. \nTreasury and the Department of Justice in which they admitted helping; \nthat is, aiding and abetting, U.S. clients evade U.S. taxes. We are \ntalking about UBS now. They paid a $750 million fine. They turned over \nthe names of about 4,700 U.S. clients who had hidden accounts in that \nbank.\n  UBS was not alone. Earlier this year in a bipartisan report--this is \nnot a partisan issue--in another bipartisan report that I issued with \nmy current ranking member, Senator McCain, the Subcommittee showed that \nCredit Suisse, Switzerland's second largest bank, had been engaged in \nthe same type of aiding and abetting. Credit Suisse had opened about \n22,000 Swiss bank accounts for U.S. account holders, with up to $12 \nbillion in assets, that were undisclosed to U.S. tax authorities. After \nits wrongdoing was exposed, Credit Suisse pled guilty to facilitating \nU.S. tax evasion and paid a fine of about $2.6 billion.\n  In both those cases, the Swiss banks had quietly sent Swiss bankers \nto do business on U.S. soil, opening accounts, sometimes in the name of \noffshore shell corporations, arranging all of that; bringing in cash, \nby the way, from Switzerland; and slipping account statements between \nmagazine pages to their U.S. clients. In order that there not be \nanything visible at an airport or wherever, they put the statement of \ntheir U.S. account holder in a Sports Illustrated magazine and would \nhand the magazine to their clients. How surreptitious can you get?\n  We also heard about how U.S. clients who visited Credit Suisse in \nSwitzerland rode in a secret, remotely controlled elevator to a room \nwith no windows and reviewed documents that were then shredded. Why? \nWhy all of that secrecy and surreptitiousness? They wanted to show \nthose U.S. clients, to dramatize, just how secretly the Swiss banks \noperate and how those Swiss bank accounts would be hidden from U.S. \nauthorities.\n  But after years and years of effort, we found out what was going on, \nand we made it public. Even Switzerland could not defend what its banks \nwere doing.\n  So in 2009, Switzerland agreed to strengthen the U.S.-Swiss tax \ntreaty to enable us to obtain more information about secret Swiss bank \naccounts opened by U.S. taxpayers.\n  It is still not voluminous information which we are going to get \nunder that tax treaty, but it is more information. It would give us a \nbetter chance of finding the tax dodgers, those U.S. citizens who try \nto avoid paying their share of taxes and dumping the tax load on all of \ntheir fellow citizens, by the way, who have to pick up the added \nburden.\n  So with the existing U.S. treaty--we already have a tax treaty with \nSwitzerland, the one that we want to amend--it requires us to establish \nsomething which is very difficult to prove; that is, tax fraud, before \nSwitzerland would hand over the information on U.S. account holders \nwith Swiss bank accounts.\n  We have treaties with all kinds of countries. No other treaty we have \nhas that standard; that we have to show tax fraud before we can get \ninformation from a foreign bank. So the revised tax treaty, approved by \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, again unanimously, would enable the \nUnited States to obtain information from Switzerland that ``may be \nrelevant'' to\n\n[[Page S3635]]\n\nthe ``administration or enforcement'' of U.S. tax laws.\n  That is the same standard, ``may be relevant,'' that has been in \neffect for decades in the United States when the Treasury seeks to \nobtain information in a tax inquiry about American citizens from their \nown banks. That standard has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I am not going to go through all of the cases that have upheld this \nstandard but there are two direct Supreme Court opinions on the subject \nthat say it is proper for Congress to legislate a standard of Treasury \ngetting information from banks about our people that ``may be \nrelevant'' to the requirement that taxes be paid.\n  The standard comes from a 1954 Federal statute that authorizes the \nIRS, for the purpose of examining a tax return or determining a \nperson's tax liability, ``to examine any books, papers, records, or \nother data which may be relevant or material to such inquiry.'' The \nstatute is 26 U.S.C. Section 7602(a)(1).\n  Thirty years ago, the Supreme Court upheld that standard in a 1984 \ncase called United States v. Arthur Young & Co., 465 U.S. 805. The \nSupreme Court wrote:\n\n       In seeking access to [a corporation's] tax accrual \n     workpapers, the IRS exercised the summons power conferred by \n     Code Sec.  7602, which authorizes the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to summon and `examine any books, papers, records, \n     or other data which may be relevant or material' to a \n     particular tax inquiry. . . .\n       The language `may be' reflects Congress' express intention \n     to allow the IRS to obtain items of even potential relevance \n     to an ongoing investigation, without reference to its \n     admissibility. The purpose of Congress is obvious: the \n     Service can hardly be expected to know whether such data will \n     in fact be relevant until it is procured and scrutinized. As \n     a tool of discovery, the Sec.  7602 summons is critical to \n     the investigative and enforcement functions of the IRS. . . .\n\n  In short, the Supreme Court upheld the authority of the IRS to \nrequest information that ``may be relevant'' to a tax inquiry, and \ndescribed the ability to examine that information as ``critical to the \ninvestigative and enforcement functions of the IRS.''\n  Last week Senator Paul indicated on the floor that the IRS can obtain \ninformation from a U.S. bank only when it establishes ``probable \ncause'' that the accountholder was cheating on their taxes. In fact, \nthe U.S. Supreme Court rejected that approach over 50 years ago in a \n1964 case called United States v. Powell, 379 U.S. 48, in which the \nCourt wrote: ``[T]he [IRS] Commissioner need not meet any standard of \nprobable cause to obtain enforcement of his summons.''\n  The revised U.S.-Swiss tax treaty would instead apply the same \nstatutory standard to Americans with bank accounts in Switzerland as \nalready applies to Americans with bank accounts in the United States. \nUsing the same standard makes perfect sense. Otherwise Americans with \nSwiss bank accounts would have a greater right to stymie IRS \ninformation requests than Americans with U.S. bank accounts.\n  In addition, the Senate has already approved other U.S. tax treaties \nusing the relevance standard. They include a 1999 tax treaty with \nDenmark, a 2007 tax treaty with Belgium, and a 2008 tax treaty with \nCanada, among others. Those tax treaties already treat Americans abroad \nin the same way as Americans at home.\n  In contrast, Switzerland has long been an exception in need of \ncorrection. Back in the 1950s, the Swiss somehow managed to get the \nUnited States to agree to make it harder for the IRS to scrutinize \nAmericans with Swiss bank accounts than Americans with U.S. bank \naccounts, which helps explain why so many hidden bank accounts ended up \nin Switzerland.\n  The UBS and Credit Suisse bank scandals show it is long past time to \nend the Swiss exception.\n  So if we just keep this current treaty, without modifying it, we are \nactually giving a standard to the Swiss that would allow them to keep \ninformation away from our Treasury that is not permitted in our own \nbanks or to banks in any other country that we have a tax treaty with.\n  Why would we want to preserve a treaty standard that the Swiss \nthemselves have already agreed to replace with a better standard in \nterms of tax collection? I mean, if the Swiss agree to a standard which \ngives us better information, why would we want to keep in place a \ntreaty which denies us that information, denies revenue to the \nTreasury, creates a double standard? If you want to avoid paying taxes, \ngo to Switzerland and you will have a better chance of evading your \ntaxes than if you stay in the United States. Why would we want to give \nan incentive like that?\n  That is what we are doing. As long as we have the current treaty in \nplace and do not ratify the proposed treaty, that is exactly what we \nare doing.\n  It is so unfair to give special treatment to Americans who send their \nmoney to Switzerland, compared to Americans who keep their money right \nhere at home. It is one thing to advocate lower taxes--that is one \nthing--but it is quite another to advocate policies that would help \nU.S. taxpayers use Swiss bank accounts to hide their assets and to \noffload their tax burdens onto the U.S. taxpayers who are not trying to \ndodge paying taxes.\n  It has been now 3 years, as Senator Menendez has pointed out, since \nthe U.S. Senate has ratified a tax treaty. Ratifying this treaty would \nfinally bring the Swiss into alignment with U.S. policy and U.S. tax \ntreaties with other countries. Once ratified, it will take effect from \nthe date it was signed in order to help stop tax dodging from 2009 \nforward. It is long overdue that we ratify this.\n  I am very disappointed there has been another objection by Senator \nPaul to proceeding to ratify--or to at least consider the ratification \nof this treaty. I believe Senator McCain will try to come later, if he \ncan, to also speak in support of bringing up these treaties for debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3635-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3635-S3636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SWISS TAX PROTOCOL\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I am pleased to join Senator Levin today \nin calling on the Senate to take up and pass by unanimous consent the \nSwiss tax protocol and other tax treaties pending before the Senate. \nThe importance of these treaties cannot be overstated. They would aid \nU.S. companies by allowing for certainty in tax treatment when those \ncompanies engage in international commerce and trade by preventing \ndouble taxation and ensuring they have the backing of the Treasury \nDepartment in the case of conflicts with foreign tax authorities. \nFurthermore, they would allow our government to be on stronger footing \nin holding tax cheats accountable, an issue Senator Levin and I are \nparticularly familiar with given our recent investigation, as chairman \nand ranking member on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, \ninto offshore tax schemes carried out by Credit Suisse. On the heels of \nthat investigation, Credit Suisse recently paid a $2.6 billion fine and \npled guilty to criminal charges, admitting to facilitating tax evasion \nfor their U.S. clients.\n  Taking advantage of Switzerland's opaque banking practices, Credit \nSuisse became a safe haven for tax evasion. The clients seeking these \nservices and the bank itself believed that they were, and would remain, \noutside the reach of U.S. tax authorities. The recent guilty plea \nproves that this belief was at least partly mistaken. This criminal \npenalty was a welcome development, but it was also lacking in several \nways, including that, as part of the agreement, the U.S. government did \nnot require the bank to turn over the names of the U.S. clients holding \nsecret bank accounts with Credit Suisse. With more than 20,000 \nunidentified Americans having held accounts at Credit Suisse in \nSwitzerland during the relevant period (most of whom never disclosed \ntheir accounts as required by U.S. law) this agreement provided no \ndirect accountability for those taxes owed.\n  We need to ensure this does not happen again. The Swiss tax protocol \nwe are discussing today would make it easier to get those names and \naccount information. Working under the assumption that the United \nStates would be unable to pierce the veil of Swiss bank secrecy, U.S. \npersons have secreted their money away in countries such as Switzerland \nfor far too long. Passing this treaty is necessary to prove this \nassumption wrong and to deter future attempts at tax evasion. It will \nsend a strong message to those\n\n[[Page S3636]]\n\nwho would consider violating U.S. tax laws that we enforce our laws, \nfairly and uniformly, and we have the tools at our disposal to do so.\n  At the Credit Suisse hearing, the bank's CEO, Brady Dougan, said, \n``Credit Suisse is ready, at this moment, to provide the additional \ninformation about Swiss accounts requested by U.S. authorities but has \nbeen unable to do so because the U.S. Senate has not yet ratified the \nprotocol.'' Let's call his bluff and remove anything that may stand in \nthe way of allowing the bank to provide U.S. authorities with \ninformation about those accounts.\n  These routine and important tax treaties were reported out favorably \nby the Foreign Relations Committee on April 1. For all of these \nreasons, I urge the Senate to consider and pass these treaties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3636-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3636-S3637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          VETERANS HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania Senator Casey for his dedication in working \nwith me in a bipartisan manner to resolve the backlog of veterans' \nbenefits claims. The care of our Nation's veterans is truly a \nbipartisan issue.\n  I would also like to take this moment to commend my colleagues, the \nchairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee Senator Sanders and also \nthe senior Senator from Arizona for bringing together ideas from both \nsides of the aisle to address the problems facing appointment wait \ntimes, VA scheduling practices, accountability, and the overall quality \nof our care provided at VA medical facilities across our Nation.\n  A recent VA audit of VA facilities across the Nation found that \nappointment wait times for new patients at hospitals and clinics were \nup to several months. No veteran should have to wait that long to get \ntheir first appointment. I have talked with the Las Vegas VA Director, \nIsabel Duff, about plans to reduce their wait times. I am confident the \nproposals in the veterans bill passed yesterday will help these \nfacilities make immediate improvements in progress to provide the \nnecessary care to these Nevada veterans.\n  Addressing the serious concerns of health care at the VA is an urgent \nissue, one that needs quick action from Congress. I am pleased we were \nable to pass that bipartisan legislation, but there is another side of \nthe coin separate from the Veterans Health Administration; that is, the \nVeterans Benefits Administration. It is the responsibility of VBA to \nadminister benefits to our veterans. The VHA has undergone intense \nscrutiny in the last few weeks, but the veterans disability claims \nbacklog is another urgent issue that needs action from this Congress.\n  The legislation we passed helped get the VHA system in order, but \nthis will do no good. It will not do good unless the veterans can \nactually get their benefits and utilize these hospitals. The problems \nwith accountability, management, and efficiency with the VA health care \nnationwide are the same problems the Veterans Benefits Administration \nis facing.\n  As we speak, nearly 287,000 veterans across this country and nearly \n3,700 veterans in the State of Nevada have waited over 125 days for \ntheir claims to be processed. In fact, veterans in Nevada have the \nlongest waiting time in the Nation at 346 days. This week the VA \ninspector general released its report on the inspection of the Reno VA \nregional office, which processes claims for veterans in our State. The \ninspection found that 50 percent of the claims the IG reviewed were not \naccurately processed. Furthermore, many of these inaccuracies were the \nresult of a lack of proper management.\n  The problems at the Reno VARO are a prime example of why Congress \nneeds to act now to bring reforms and accountability to the VBA. Just \nas it is unacceptable for veterans to wait months for appointments, it \nis just as unacceptable for them to wait months for the benefits they \nhave earned.\n  To address this issue, Senator Casey and I introduced the VA backlog \nworking group report along with a bipartisan group of our colleagues, \nwhich included Senators Moran, Heinrich, Vitter, and Tester. This \nreport outlines the claims process, explains the history of the VA \nclaims backlog, and offers targeted solutions to help the VA develop an \nefficient benefit delivery system.\n  To put the report's targeted solutions into action, our working group \nintroduced the 21st Century Veterans Benefits Delivery Act. This \ncomprehensive, bipartisan piece of legislation addresses three areas of \nthe claims process: claims submission, VA regional office practices, \nand Federal agencies' responses to VA requests.\n  I am pleased 18 of our Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nhave cosponsored this legislation and that it has gained the support of \nthe veterans service organizations such as the VFW, DAV, the American \nLegion, Military Officers Association of America and the AUSN.\n  Senator Casey and I recognize that the claims process is complex. \nThere is no easy answer. There is no silver bullet that is going to \nsolve this particular problem, but the VA's current efforts will not \neliminate this backlog.\n  So just as we worked to address the issues at the VHA, I encourage \ncolleagues to work to address some of these issues at the VBA.\n  I was pleased to see the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs try to \nmove forward with examining our proposal just last week. While I \nunderstand that the committee had to cancel this hearing, I encourage \nthe chairman of the committee to reschedule it. Our proposal can no \nlonger afford to wait in the backlog of bills to be considered by this \nChamber.\n  Practical, targeted solutions are needed to address inefficiencies \nthat are keeping veterans from receiving timely decisions on their \nbenefit plans. After all our veterans have sacrificed in service to our \ncountry, we owe this to them.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to move this \ncommonsense proposal forward.\n  With that, I yield for my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Casey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. I rise to talk about the issue that my colleague from \nNevada just raised.\n  We had a vote yesterday--which, to say it was overwhelming is \nprobably an understatement--for the Veterans' Access to Care through \nChoice, Accountability, and Transparency Act. That act will create \ntransparency in the VA system, it will result in the hiring of more \ndoctors and nurses, and it will provide resources for veterans and \ntheir spouses to obtain a quality education.\n  We are grateful that happened. We are grateful for the overwhelming \nvote, and we are certainly optimistic about the results that will flow \nfrom that legislation.\n  We have more to do in addition to that. We need to continue to look \nfor ways to address the claims backlog that my colleague from Nevada \njust outlined, as well as other issues that will come before us.\n  I thank the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Chairman \nSanders, who is with us today on floor, and the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs for their work on behalf of veterans.\n  The claims backlog, which my colleague just talked about, is a \ncritically important issue for veterans and their families in \nPennsylvania, Nevada, and all the other States as well.\n  I commend the work of Senator Heller and his staff. My staff worked \nvery hard on these issues. I want to commend especially Gillian Mueller \nin addition to John Richter for their work on the issue itself and the \nworking group collaboration that resulted in this report that Senator \nHeller cited. This is a substantial report on a very difficult problem.\n  Here is what the problem is--the problem that the working group \naddressed, but also our legislation addressed, which I will talk about \nin a moment. Here is the problem in terms of days. The backlog is \nespecially high across the country. The average backlog in days is 241.\n  Unfortunately, in Pennsylvania, it is even longer. In about half of \nour State, in the western part of our State, it is 316 days, and it is \n294 days in Philadelphia in the eastern part of our State.\n  To have a veteran and his or her family wait that long for the \nprocessing\n\n[[Page S3637]]\n\nclaims, is, in a word, unacceptable and should be addressed. That is \nwhy we introduced the 21st Century Veterans Benefits Delivery Act, \nwhich was developed from the findings of the working group and the \nreport that was produced.\n  This is a commonsense approach, a bill that focuses on three areas \nthat will ensure a faster and more accurate delivery system.\n  The bill will help ensure that veterans, the VA, Congress, and all \nlevels of government are working together to bring down the backlog and \nto get veterans the benefits they deserve in a timely manner.\n  It does basically three things: one, update the claims submission \nprocess; two, improve the VA regional office practices; three, demand \nmore from other VA agencies. This backlog problem is a VA problem, but \nit is also a problem of other agencies not doing their job to help the \nVA.\n  As Senator Heller noted, we had great support in the working group, \nas well as 17 bipartisan cosponsors of the 21st Century Veterans \nBenefits Delivery Act.\n  I respectfully asked Chairman Sanders to help us schedule a hearing \non the legislation, and we are grateful for his willingness not only to \nwork with us but to help advance this very important legislation.\n  Let me conclude with one thought. I have often said that one of the \nobligations of every Member of Congress is to prove ourselves worthy of \nthe valor of our veterans, to make sure that we are keeping the promise \nto our veterans. You can't prove yourself worthy of their valor by \nthanking them for their service or patting them on the back and going \nto public ceremonies. We have to act as we did yesterday. The next \nproblem we should act upon is the claims backlog so that we can truly \nsay that we are worthy of the valor of our veterans and keep our \npromise to them, to their families, and to our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank my colleagues and friends from Nevada and \nPennsylvania.\n  Senator Heller, a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, has been \na very active member and a very constructive member. Senator Casey from \nPennsylvania has done an extraordinary job in representing the veterans \nfrom his State and on overall veterans policy. I thank them both for \nworking in a bipartisan way in addressing one of the significant \nchallenges confronting the VA; that is, the claims backlog.\n  I thank them for their support in working to advance not only \nsolutions to the claims problems, but comprehensive legislation that \nwould improve the lives of our Nation's veterans and their families. \nBoth of these Senators supported the two major pieces of legislation \nfor veterans that have come to the floor.\n  Yesterday, the Senate took a step forward in addressing a very \nsignificant crisis, and that is making sure that we provide health care \nto all of our veterans in a high quality and timely way.\n  However, as I indicated on the floor yesterday, what we did yesterday \nis only the beginning. We have a lot more work to do if we are going to \nrepresent the interests of the men and women who have put their lives \non the line to defend us.\n  I welcome my colleagues' continued support and look forward to \nworking together with them to pass legislation that would address the \nchallenges of the backlog, as well as the many, many other concerns \nthat have been presented to the committee by the veterans service \norganizations.\n  We take their concerns seriously. I applaud them both very much for \ncoming up with some concrete ideas as to how we address the backlog \nproblem, and I pledge to them that we are going to work as aggressively \nas we can to address the issue.\n  I thank them both very much for helping us on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3637-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3637-S3639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STUDENT LOAN DEBT\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, yesterday we debated and voted on the \nneed to lower interest rates for students with college debt.\n  I consider the issue of the high cost of college and student \nindebtedness to be one of the very serious problems facing our country, \nimpacting millions and millions of young people and their families.\n  What I did through my Web site is just ask people from Vermont and \naround the country to briefly write stories about the impact of college \ndebt on their lives.\n  What I would like to do very briefly is to read some of the very \npoignant stories we have received. I believe we have received now over \n700 stories from people all over America who are talking about what the \nstudent debt they have incurred is meaning to their lives.\n  Let me very briefly read some of the responses we have received.\n  Shannon Lucy, 29, is from Essex Junction, VT. She is $90,000 in debt. \nShe wrote:\n\n       I currently live in my boyfriend's parents' basement \n     because I cannot afford to pay both rent and my nearly $900 \n     per month student loan payments. Despite working two jobs and \n     living rent-free I am barely making ends meet. I can't even \n     dream of buying a house or supporting a child--I can't even \n     support myself. Getting married would mean burdening someone \n     else with my debt so that's not financially possible either. \n     I thought I did everything right. I thought getting an \n     education was an investment in my future. But now there's not \n     a single day when I don't feel like I'm drowning under this \n     massive load of debt. And the worst part is that even though \n     the president is introducing student loan relief measures \n     because my loans are mostly privately funded there's still no \n     relief for me.\n\n  I wish to read a statement that I received from Brittany Holman, 29, \nwho is from Portland, OR, and is $200,000 in debt. She writes:\n\n       I'm scared and am desperately in need of help. I'm nearly \n     $200,000 in debt from student loans all because I wanted to \n     get an education. Was that not what I was supposed to do? I \n     graduated from Syracuse University in 2006 went to Japan for \n     two years to teach English and then came back home to a \n     crashed economy and a bleak job market.\n       Despite my two B.A. degrees from a great university, I have \n     to settle for underemployment in a minimum wage retail job.\n\n  Andrew Englebrecht, 22 years of age from New Lenox, IL, $80,000 in \ndebt, writes:\n\n       It makes me depressed. I have no hope. Nothing will ever \n     get better. I'm scared. I can't go get my masters because my \n     life has already been ruined. I ruined my parents' life. The \n     bank finally was willing to work with us and not take our \n     house; that doesn't mean we can pay the loans back either. I \n     can't move out of the house. I can't propose to the girl I \n     love. I can't live because I can't dream. I'm afraid to have \n     kids because I'm scared they wouldn't have a chance.\n\n  This is one from Eric Anders, 29, of Chicago, IL, $125,000 in debt. \nHe writes:\n\n       My law school debt is astronomical. It will keep me from \n     being a homeowner for a long time. I believe serious efforts \n     need to be made to reduce the costs of attending both college \n     and graduate school.\n\n  Kelly Weiner, 27, from Brooklyn, NY, is $134,000 in debt, and says:\n\n       I went to law school because I wanted to help people and \n     communities who are underserved by the law. . . . I am \n     currently paying back my loans on an income-based repayment \n     plan with a 7.3% interest rate which means I am not even \n     making a dent in my debt. . . . According to my repayment \n     plan I will be in my fifties before I get out of debt.\n\n  Saul Barraza, 23, of Littleton, CO, $35,000 in debt, writes:\n\n       I feel like I'm sinking further and further into debt. The \n     interest rate on my loans is eating me alive. I don't believe \n     that I've ever touched the principal on my loans. I simply \n     pay interest and avoid default. . . . I feel that my debt is \n     holding me back from being able to contribute to society. It \n     is a ball and chain that follows me everywhere I go \n     preventing me from starting the rest of my life.\n\n  Lastly, let me read from Dustin Green, 28, of Yukon, OK--$50,000 in \ndebt between him and his wife:\n\n       Between my wife and myself we pay over $600 a month for our \n     student loans. I have a good job and can barely afford these \n     payments along with normal bills. After graduation dealing \n     with each loan company was a task of its own. They do not \n     care if you have enough money to eat but simply to pay them \n     back. My wife and I are wanting to buy our first home but \n     with so much of our salaries going to monthly student loan \n     payments we can't make that step yet. We have both wondered \n     if the yearly income difference with a college education is \n     worth the extra debt.\n\n  So those are just some of the 700-plus stories that we have heard \nfrom young people and their families all over this country about the \ncrushing impact that student debt is having on their lives.\n  We have to address this issue. We have to make college affordable for \nall Americans regardless of income.\n\n[[Page S3638]]\n\n  I hope that we can do that sooner rather than later.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, this has been an interesting week \nhere in the Senate.\n  When we began this week, there was a great deal of attention focused \non what was happening overseas with the release of a prisoner of war \nwho had been in captivity for some 4 to 5 years, Sergeant Bergdahl.\n  Conversation moved to education, with a measure that Senator Warren \nfrom Massachusetts had introduced. The thought was we would be \ndiscussing education issues--the high cost of college and the burden of \ncollege debt on our students.\n  Then we turned later yesterday to veterans and how we address the \nreal scandal we have seen within the VA in failing to provide that \nlevel of care in a timely manner for our veterans who have served us so \nhonorably.\n  It has been kind of a fast and furious week, and I wish to take a few \nminutes this afternoon to talk about my perspective on not only the \nlegislation that Senator Warren had put out for discussion, but, \nreally, the concerns so many in this country have when it comes to the \nissue of student loan debt.\n  I am the mom of a recent college graduate. Our number two son is \ngoing to be entering his senior year of college. So we are fully \nembroiled as parents in the understanding as to what the current costs \nof a college education are, what young students go through in order to \nachieve their dreams of going to college and their struggles as they \nthen face the reality of moving into a working world, but starting off \nsaddled with debt that can be almost breathtaking for them.\n  In addition to being a mom of kids in this generation, I am also a \nformer commissioner of the Alaska Commission on Postsecondary \nEducation. This is Alaska's State agency lender. So I am coming at the \nissue wearing a couple of different hats today.\n  I know full well people are discussing the issue of the high cost of \ncollege and student loan debt--and not just here on the floor of the \nSenate but talking about it around their kitchen tables. They are very \nconcerned about the cost of college and the burden the debt then places \non our young Americans.\n  Young people who are just starting out after college graduation have \nan average debt of about $27,000. Now, some would say $27,000 is \nmanageable; that is about in the range if you are purchasing a new car. \nBut think about it. For a young person just out of college, starting to \nmake those initial payments, $27,000 can be a staggering amount. \nWhether we talk to the young people working the phones in either a \nState office or here, the young interns that I have--who are excited \nabout the prospects of going to college or are in the midst of college \nor who have just graduated from college--some of that excitement and \nthat enthusiasm dims when they realize what it is they are taking on. \nSo this debt is daunting.\n  Keep in mind, that debt then assumes the means to pay it back. So \nmany of our young people of course cannot find a job. For the 18- to \n24-year-old age bracket, the unemployment rate is twice the national \naverage. For those graduating with a masters or a doctorate, of course, \nthe debt burden is much more.\n  Then for the parents and those who have taken out loans to help put \ntheir kids through college--many families also struggling. So, again, \nthis is something that families are talking about around their dinner \ntable. And I am hearing about this from parents, from high school and \ncollege students in Alaska, and talking with my interns here. They all \nsay the same thing. They are all concerned. They are all concerned \nabout the cost of college and job training and the debt they are going \nto incur and their ability then to move forward, whether it is to buy \nthat first car, whether it is to purchase a home, the decisions about \ngetting married or starting a family. The debt has an impact, and that \nis absolutely a given.\n\n  I do think it is important to know we in Congress have not turned a \nblind eye to this and we have been working over the years to help \naddress the cost. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act and the \nHigher Education Opportunity Act are measures that I worked to craft \nsome years ago, and they address these issues in many ways. We created \nincome-based repayment and public service loan forgiveness. There was \nActive Military loan deferment, graduate student eligibility for income \ncontingent repayment, interest rate reductions, Pell grant increases, \nTEACH grants, automatic zero expected family contribution for low-\nincome families and much more.\n  We improved student support programs like TRIO and helped ensure \nstudents and parents have access to the kind of information they need \nto ensure they really do get top dollar for their education dollars and \nalso to help students then persist in college to complete that process \nto earn the degree. We required counseling for federal loan borrowers \nprior to the students' graduation on repayment plans, debt management, \nloan forgiveness, consequences of default, tax benefits, and more. We \nalso required disclosure about the terms and conditions of the Federal \nFamily Education Loan Program. These are the FFEL loan programs before \nthe loans are disbursed, before repayment, and during repayment.\n  Recently Congress has supported pay as you earn and other programs \nand just last year enacted a new interest rate structure to protect \nboth students and taxpayers.\n  Unfortunately, we haven't seen much out of the administration to make \nAmericans aware that these opportunities actually exist, that they are \nin law. We heard a nominee for a senior policy position at the U.S. \nDepartment of Education who tried to justify this lack of action by \nsaying the provisions were just enacted recently. But 7 years ago is \nnot recent when it comes to helping Americans understand the many loan \nrepayment options. Just this week we heard the President give the \nDepartment of Education yet another 6 months to figure out how to tell \nAmericans about their loan repayment options. I think we can do better.\n  I heard just last week a young teacher who was testifying before a \nSenate committee. She said she was completely unaware of the income-\nbased repayment program which could have saved her about $4,000. \nInstead, with her unaffordably high loan payments, she basically \ndefaulted on her loans. So it is important that when we put measures in \nplace, we do make sure that education effort is there on the back end \nso people understand and can take advantage of some of these \ninitiatives that will help to make a difference.\n  Obviously we do not have the Warren legislation in front of us for \nconsideration. I am certain that it will be a matter that will be \nbrought back before the Senate. I certainly would hope we would have \nextended debate about what we as a Senate can be doing to help our \nyoung people as they deal with the burden of college debt, of job \ntraining debt, and what we can do to ensure they are well on their way \nto good strong careers. But I want to raise just a couple of issues \nthat presented themselves with the legislation that Senator Warren had \nput out on the floor, because they speak to a program in my State that \nhas considerable impact.\n  Madam President, I know that I was scheduled to speak for about 15 \nminutes this afternoon. I have another colleague that is on the floor. \nI would ask unanimous consent for about another 5 minutes, if that is \nacceptable to my colleague and to the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I thank my friend \nfrom Ohio.\n  First, I would like to bring up the issue of the Alaska State student \naid agency. The Alaska Commission on Postsecondary Education--or as we \ncall it ACPE--is funded by the Alaska Student Loan Corporation. It is a \npublic corporation in the State of Alaska and it is an agency that \noriginates Federal loans under the old Federal Family Education Loan \nProgram, FFEL, and for 40 years it has originated State loans. Now, \nbefore you dismiss ACPE\n\n[[Page S3639]]\n\nas just another private lender, let me tell you what this agency does. \nIt is the Alaska agency for authorizing and investigating institutions \nof higher education. They provide consumer protection for Alaskans. \nThey gather student data to inform policymakers so we know what \npolicies and practices are working and where improvement is necessary. \nThey manage the State's performance scholarships and education grants, \nwhich provide both merit and need-based grants to Alaskan students for \npostsecondary education. They create and manage college readiness and \njob training programs and help them figure out how to afford it. What \nACPE does is promote access to and success in high quality post-\nsecondary education and job training for thousands of Alaskans and non-\nAlaskans who are attending Alaskan schools. But they also have a \nspecial emphasis on outreach to groups that are underrepresented in \npostsecondary education.\n  They do such a great job for us in the State that when the late-\nSenator Ted Kennedy was here, he insisted on creating the College \nAccess Challenge Grant Program to expand what ACPE had been doing for \nall these years.\n  But the measure that Senator Warren has, the Bank on Students \nEmergency Loan Refinancing Act, would potentially put these programs in \nperil and potentially end them. It would incentivize borrowers who \nborrowed their FFEL loans and their State loans through ACPE to \nrefinance. But because this opportunity would only be available to \nborrowers in good standing on their State loans, it would leave ACPE \nwith only the poorest performing and lowest credit quality loans in its \nportfolio, leaving behind the borrowers who are the ones the sponsors \nof the bill say we really need to help so much.\n  The loss of the FFEL loans would be bad enough, but here is another \nproblem. State student financial aid loans were financed by the Alaska \nStudent Loan Corporation through long-term fixed rate revenue bond \nissues. These have very restrictive terms with respect to paying them \noff before their scheduled maturity dates. The impact on the State \nagencies and the Alaskans they serve and to the corporation's bond \nrating of having a large percentage of student loan volume prepaid \nthrough this refinancing bill would be severe. The money the Treasury \nwould pay ACPE for those loans could not be used to pay off the bonds \nearly, nor can it be reinvested at anywhere near the interest rate on \nthe outstanding bonds. The value of the bonds exceeds $65 million. It \nis not only the cost to the agency and its ability to function. Whether \nthe State corporation were to default or to perhaps go to the \nlegislature for a bailout, the consequences are not good. Either \nsituation would be toxic for the Alaska Student Loan Corporation in \nterms of subsequently being able to issue bonds that really would be \npalatable to any investor.\n  In addition to the risk of default or a hefty bill placed on the \nState and being labeled a toxic risk to bond issuers, the combined loss \nof income across both old FFEL loans and State loans could very well \nleave ACPE unable to continue to perform any of the services that it \nperforms really quite well.\n  This is not the only issue I have as it relates to what we have \nbefore us this week. We don't want our students, our young people to be \nstruggling when it comes to debt. We have to work together to try to \nfind the solutions that truly are helpful across the spectrum. One of \nthe problems that we noted, though, was that the bill would prohibit \nAmericans who have private loans from banks or State agencies, and who \nare having trouble paying as agreed, to refinance to a lower rate--a \nprohibition that does not extend to those who are having trouble paying \ntheir Direct and FFEL loans. I cannot understand why we would treat \nAmericans differently based on the kind of debt they have. The sponsors \nof the bill I think genuinely want to help struggling borrowers, but \nwith this provision they leave a lot of folks out in the cold. So that \nis something that needs to be addressed.\n\n  According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the cost of \ncollege is going up, but State funding for higher education, which went \ndown during the recession, is not rebounding. We are seeing exceptions \nin Alaska and North Dakota. But according to the CBPP, Louisiana is at \nthe top of the list and contributes a little over $5,000 less per \nstudent to higher education than they did prior to fiscal year 2008. \nHawaii, New Mexico, and Alabama are seeing $4,000 per student less. \nIdaho, South Carolina, Massachusetts, Nevada, Connecticut, and Arizona \nare in the $3,000 less per student range. The list goes on.\n  So when the States are unable to contribute to their public \nuniversities and postsecondary education in general, the cost burden \nthen for our students too often goes up. Even when our colleges tighten \ntheir belts and cut their internal costs, we see the costs rise.\n  So obviously there is a great deal to do. I know that so many of my \ncolleagues are committed to working to find that good solution which \nworks not only for students in my State but around the entire country.\n  We have our work cut out for us. I appreciate the efforts that many \nhave made. I think the discussion will continue, and I look forward to \nthat.\n  With that I yield to my colleague from Ohio, and I thank the Senator \nfor his indulgence of an additional 5 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3639-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3639-S3640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I hear the remarks from my colleagues from Alaska and \nappreciate her leadership on the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, where I have the privilege to serve, and she makes a lot of \ngreat points with regard to some of the student loan issues that affect \nour State of Ohio as well as Alaska. But today I am here to talk about \nsomething else, and that is the 90th birthday of a mentor of mine, a \nformer boss of mine, and the 41st President of the United States, \nGeorge H.W. Bush.\n  In addition to honoring him by wearing some colorful socks today, I \nalso want to make a statement in the Congressional Record, so this \nstatement can go down in the ages and some of the young folks who are \nin the Chamber today and their kids and grandkids will have this as \npart of the Congressional Record, talking about truly one of our great \nAmerican patriots and public servants in the history of our country.\n  Like so many in his generation, President George H.W. Bush, when he \nheard of the attack on Pearl Harbor, answered the call to serve his \ncountry. He was 18 years old. So his service started long before he was \nsworn in as President of the United States.\n  At 18 years old he became the youngest naval aviator in the U.S. \nNavy. He served greatly in the Pacific, famously completing one bombing \nafter his aircraft was fired upon. In fact, his aircraft was on fire. \nYet he completed that mission.\n  For that and many other examples of heroism he earned the \nDistinguished Flying Cross, one of the highest honors any aviator could \nreceive. But he went home, went out to Texas, had a successful business \ncareer, raised a growing family, and started to engage in politics.\n  He became a successful politician and was an accomplished Congressman \nfrom Texas and then became a very respected international figure as \nAmbassador to the United Nations, and as envoy to China. He also headed \nup the Central Intelligence Agency at a very difficult time and helped \nto improve the morale and effectiveness of that agency. He then, of \ncourse, became Vice President of the United States. Then on January 20, \n1989, he was sworn in as the 41st President.\n  President Reagan, 27 years ago today, in fact, made the famous \nstatement that Mikhail Gorbachev should tear down the Berlin Wall. It \nwas Reagan's successor, George H.W. Bush who actually saw it done and \nbrought an end to the Cold War. He removed a brutal dictator in Panama \nand gathered the whole world with the United States in the lead to \nremove Saddam Hussein and turn back the invasion of Kuwait.\n  At home in a time of divided government, when at the time one party \nwas in control of the Congress and one party in control of the \nExecutive Branch--as we have now to a certain extent--a divided \ngovernment--he showed how we could work together, how to reach across \nthe aisle and get things done and he did so.\n\n[[Page S3640]]\n\n  But of all the things he has accomplished, there is probably nothing \nhe is prouder of than his call to volunteerism. He championed and \nestablished the Points of Light Foundation, which has been enormously \nsuccessful in getting Americans in all walks of life more engaged in \nhelping their fellow citizens. He inspired the Nation when he spoke of \na thousand points of light to promote volunteerism and community action \nby all of us. It turns out that a thousand points of light was not as \nambitious as he could have been because he underestimated what he would \naccomplish. It hasn't been a thousand; it has been a million. The \nlatest year I was able to find information was in 2012. In that year \nalone, the Points of Light Foundation engaged millions of volunteers. \nIt has supported thousands of nonprofits and volunteer organizations \nacross 250 cities in America, providing volunteer services that have \nbeen estimated to be valued at over $635 million.\n\n  That sort of generosity reflects the heart of the man I have come to \nknow since I first had the honor of meeting him over 30 years ago. That \ngenerosity is what I experienced when President Bush took a chance on \nme--a young, inexperienced lawyer from Cincinnati, OH--when he made me \nAssociate Counsel to the President. The experience I gained in that job \nwas invaluable, and I continue to draw on it today. But even more \nvaluable was what I learned from President Bush. I learned about being \na father, being a husband, being a public servant, and serving--serving \nthe folks we are honored to represent in the U.S. Senate.\n  Today we honor a true American hero, selfless public servant, and a \nperson I consider to be the most honorable and decent person in \npolitics in my lifetime. I wish him the best for a truly happy birthday \nand blessings on him and his entire family as they celebrate an amazing \nyear.\n  He is apparently jumping out of an airplane again today on his 90th \nbirthday, and he has received numerous awards this year. It has been a \nterrific 90th year.\n  I hope he understands the American response to him, which is one of \ngreat appreciation, gratitude, and respect. I hope he has a very happy \nbirthday, and I hope God continues to bless him and his family for \nyears to come.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3640-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3640-S3641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STUDENT LOAN DEBT\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, 40 million people in this country--40 \nmillion--are dealing with more than $1 trillion in student loan debt. \nIt is crushing our young people and dragging down our economy. It is a \nnational economic emergency.\n  Yesterday Senators had a chance to do the right thing. We had a \nchance to allow young people with high-interest loans to refinance \nthose loans down to a lower rate, a chance to move forward on the Bank \non Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act, and a chance to stand for \nour young people who are just starting their economic lives.\n  A majority of Senators voted to seize that chance. Every Democratic \nSenator, every Independent Senator, and three Republican Senators voted \nto seize that chance. But despite the majority support, despite this \nbipartisan support, the bill failed. Why? Because Republicans pulled \nout their favorite tool--the filibuster. They blocked the Senate from \neven debating this bill.\n  Over the past few days we have heard a lot of excuses, but yesterday \nthe Republicans said we should not even consider this legislation until \nwe voted on the Sanders-McCain legislation to address the situation at \nthe VA. The VA legislation is a very good bill. It is a very important \nbill, and the Senate voted on it yesterday afternoon. So now that the \nSenate has passed it, where are the Republicans? The veterans vote is \nover, so where are the Republicans who are now ready to debate the \nstudent loan refinancing?\n  Veterans have spoken out on the student loan bill as well. The \nspokesperson for Student Veterans of America praised the student loan \nrefinancing bill. He said this bill could provide real relief for his \nmembers--veterans who have served our country and who have worked hard \nto get an education. If the Republicans will let us vote, we can give \nour veterans that relief.\n  The Senate can come back to the student loan bill at any point. We \ncan come back today, we can come back tonight, and we can come back \ntomorrow. We just need the Republicans to let us get back on the \nimportant legislation. Democrats are happy to offer a time agreement \nwhich would allow for a short debate, would allow for amendments, and \nwould get us to a vote.\n  Let's be honest. Most of the Senate Republicans made the wrong choice \nyesterday when they voted to protect billionaires who have already made \nit instead of the young people who are fighting for a fair shot at a \nbetter future. I am still hopeful because despite the rhetoric, despite \nthe excuses, despite the hemming and hawing, a large bipartisan \nmajority of Senators stood for students yesterday. I am hopeful because \nI know that the minute the Republicans drop their filibuster, this bill \nwill pass the Senate, and I am hopeful because we are just two votes \nshort of breaking that filibuster. Now that we have had a vote on the \nveterans legislation, let's go back to the student loan bill.\n  This is not over. We are not done fighting for students. No one is \ngiving up. We just need two more votes to go forward. We are going to \npush harder than ever for the student loan bill, and we are going to \nget it passed.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask, through the Chair, if the Senator from \nMassachusetts will yield for a question.\n  Ms. WARREN. Certainly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. First, through the Chair, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for her leadership and her effort to refinance student \nloans.\n  Is it true that what was at stake yesterday was an opportunity for 25 \nmillion student loan borrowers--out of roughly 40 million nationwide--\nto refinance their student loans at a lower interest rate?\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for \nhis leadership on this issue, and the answer is yes. This would have \npermitted 25 million Americans to refinance their student loans down to \nlower interest rates, thereby putting hundreds, even thousands of \ndollars back in their pockets.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Through the Chair, I also ask the Senator from \nMassachusetts if it is true that the way we paid for this--this loss of \ninterest by the Federal Government--was to impose the Buffett rule, \nwhich meant that those who are multimillionaires, for example, would \nhave a higher income tax rate--at least as high as the secretaries who \nwork for them--and that would have meant a tax increase on roughly \n22,000 millionaires.\n  Ms. WARREN. That is exactly right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Through the Chair again, the choice yesterday was between \nhelping 25 million student borrowers get a lower interest rate, saving \non average $2,000 a year, and asking 22,000 multimillionaires to pay \nslightly more in income tax, and sadly only three Republicans would \njoin the Democrats in saying: Let's help the student borrowers. Is that \nwhat happened?\n  Ms. WARREN. That is right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say through the Chair to the Senator from Massachusetts \nthat I have been traveling the State of Illinois, the city of Chicago, \nand every campus I stop on there are students who come forward and tell \nme their stories of the debt they have incurred because of their \ndegrees and the impact it has had on their lives. There are student \nteachers who sadly cannot take jobs teaching because they owe too much \nmoney from college.\n  Is the Senator from Massachusetts hearing that in her State and \naround the country?\n  Ms. WARREN. Yes, I am hearing that in my State and around the \ncountry.\n  What really strikes me about this bill--there are a lot of things \nthat happen that we can't fix here in Congress, but this is something \nwe can fix. Right\n\n[[Page S3641]]\n\nnow the Federal Government is charging people who try to get an \neducation 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent, 12 percent, and even higher \non student loans. We have a very straightforward bill that would bring \nthe interest rate down, put money back in people's pockets, and give \npeople who are just trying to get a fair shot a real opportunity to \nbuild an economic future.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will ask the last question through the Chair. So \nyesterday--so everybody can understand what happened--there was a \nthreatened Republican filibuster to stop us from even debating this \nbill, and in order to stop the filibuster and begin debating the bill \nso 25 million students could get a lower interest rate on the student \nloans, we needed 60 votes on the floor. We had all the Democrats and \nonly three Republicans--Senator Collins of Maine, Senator Corker of \nTennessee, and Senator Murkowski of Alaska--prepared to vote. No other \nRepublican Senator would join us in starting the debate on lowering the \ninterest rate on student loans.\n  We need two more Republican Senators to join those three Republicans \nso we can start bringing relief to student borrowers all across the \nUnited States.\n  Is that where we stand today?\n  Ms. WARREN. That is exactly where we stand today. We are just two \nvotes shy. What we know now is how the Republicans have voted. So now \nit is up to all of us to get two more Republicans to agree to just let \nus bring this bill to the floor. Just let us have the debate. Just let \nus have the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for her leadership \non this important issue.\n  Madam President, what is the order of business on the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes remaining prior to the \nSenate proceeding to executive session.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I will follow up on the dialogue I just \nhad with Senator Warren.\n  These are issues that really hit home for families. We have had four \nissues on the floor of the Senate in the last several months which \nreally define the difference between the political parties.\n  The Democrats have argued and urged that we extend unemployment \nbenefits for the long-term unemployed in America so they can find work, \nsave their homes, pay their utility bills, and have a cell phone to go \nlook for work. Unfortunately, we didn't have enough support on the \nother side of the aisle when it came to extending unemployment \nbenefits.\n  The next issue was to raise the minimum wage--which we have not done \nfor a long time--so that those who are struggling--primarily women--\nwill have a basic minimum wage so they can get by from paycheck to \npaycheck. Many of us believe that if you are willing to get up and go \nto work every morning, you should not live in poverty in America.\n  The third issue was gender equality. If my daughter and my son work \nthe same job, they should get the same paycheck. There should not be \ndiscrimination against women. Republicans opposed us on that.\n  Now comes the fourth issue: renegotiating college student loans so \nthat some 40 million student loan borrowers across America have a \nchance to pay less interest on their student loans, their monthly \npayments would go down, and they would be able to pay off their loans \nsooner so they could get on with their lives. We could only get 3 \nRepublicans out of 45 to join us in an effort to start the debate on \nthe bill yesterday, so we fell short. We needed two Republican Senators \nto join Senator Warren, myself, and others--Senator Franken of \nMinnesota and Senator Reed of Rhode Island--to join us in initiating \nthis conversation.\n  I say to my Republican colleagues, when you go home this weekend, try \nto find some college students and their families and engage them in \nthis conversation. You will find what we found out on the Democratic \nside. If you listen to working families who are struggling to put their \nkids through school, they will tell you they need help. We offered help \nyesterday, but we fell short by two Republican votes.\n  I hope the Republican filibuster will be overturned next week when we \nreturn.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3641-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Tribute to Senator Jim Bunning\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to a great \nfriend of mine and a friend of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, former \nSenator Jim Bunning. Jim has been an inspiration to Kentuckians for \ndecades in many different roles--as a public servant, a man of \nintegrity, a devoted father of 9 children, grandfather of 35, and a \ngreat-grandfather of 12, with 1 more on the way. But few public \nservants or family men can also claim to be in the Baseball Hall of \nFame. Jim Bunning can, for his extraordinary Major League pitching \ncareer with the Detroit Tigers and with the Philadelphia Phillies.\n  With Father's Day approaching this weekend, I thought it appropriate \nto remember what Jim Bunning accomplished on Father's Day 1964. The \ndate was June 21, and in front of his wife Mary, his eldest daughter \nBarbara, and more than 32,000 cheering fans, Jim Bunning delivered the \nperfect Father's Day gift by pitching a perfect game.\n  Let me take a moment to explain, for those who do not spend their \nyouth playing baseball and collecting baseball cards as some of us did, \nwhat pitching a perfect game means and why it is such a legendary feat. \nTo pitch a perfect game, a pitcher must pitch a full nine innings \nwithout allowing a batter to get on base for any reason--no hits, no \nwalks, no hits by a pitch, and no errors. Twenty-seven batters must \nstep to the plate and all 27 must sit down. It is an achievement that \nhas been accomplished only 23 times in more than 135 years of Major \nLeague Baseball history--23 times in the history of Major League \nBaseball.\n  At the time Jimmy's pitching perfection was only the seventh perfect \ngame in Major League Baseball history. It was the first perfect game in \nregular season play in more than 42 years and the first in the National \nLeague since 1880. As the Philadelphia Phillies were the visitors \nagainst the New York Mets, it was also the first-ever perfect game \npitched in Shea Stadium.\n  Jimmy's day started as did any other Sunday. He went to 9 a.m. Mass \nand\n\n[[Page S3643]]\n\nhad a breakfast of eggs and sausage. He was worried about getting \ntickets for his wife and daughter to attend the game. He showed up at \nShea Stadium to warm up for the first game of a doubleheader. ``I felt \ngood and loose,'' Jim recalls. ``I realized right away that I had \nexceptional stuff.''\n  With a combination of fastballs, curveballs, and sliders, Jim began \nto make short work of the Mets' batting order. By the sixth inning, he \nbegan to consider that he was on the cusp of history.\n  ``Everyone is supposed to do perfect work, but perfection in the game \nof baseball is a rarity I never expected to accomplish.'' That is what \nthe big right-hander had to say about that.\n  The final Met at bat was John Stephenson, a lefty. Here is how the \nPhiladelphia Inquirer described the game's dramatic conclusion:\n\n       The rookie swung at a low-breaking ball and missed, took a \n     pitch for a second strike, then took two balls, one low \n     outside and the other high and away. Bunning came back with a \n     curve at the knees on the outside part of the plate. \n     Stephenson swung and missed and the Phillies made a bee-line \n     for the mound. They came running from their positions and \n     streamed out of the dugout to pound the former American \n     Leaguer on the back and escort him to the dugout.\n\n  The story continues:\n\n       A few minutes later, [Bunning] went on television for an \n     interview during which his wife and daughter rushed up to \n     kiss him. It was the thrill of a lifetime for the pitcher, \n     who richly deserved it.\n\n  That he did.\n  For baseball fans, the statistics on Jim's perfect game are truly \nnumbers to behold. He threw only 90 pitches in the Phillies' 6-to-0 \nvictory--an average of only 10 per inning. He struck out 10. He did not \nmiss the strike zone more than four times in any inning. And he went to \na three-ball count on only two batters. Statistically, it may be the \nmost perfect of perfect games ever pitched.\n  Acclaim was instant. Jim appeared on ``The Ed Sullivan Show'' that \nnight. This man, who was always a fierce competitor both on the \npitching mound and in the Halls of Congress, had reached the pinnacle \nof his profession. But it won't surprise any of my colleagues who know \nand worked with Jim that he did not let this sudden rush of fame go to \nhis head. ``Fame is fleeting as far as the next hitter at the plate is \nconcerned,'' says Jim. I admire my friend and former colleague's \nability to keep such a momentous event in perspective.\n  It is fitting that his perfect game occurred on Father's Day because \nfamily is really what Jim Bunning is all about. The Bunning family \ncelebrated their dad's perfect game not at a fancy Manhattan restaurant \nbut at the Howard Johnson's on the New Jersey Turnpike. And I know his \nlovely wife Mary has been his rock and his foundation for his entire \ncareer in both baseball and politics.\n  Jim Bunning was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996. But \nfor any baseball fan, including this Senator, the thrill of Jimmy's \nperfect game is as fresh as if it happened yesterday, not 50 years ago.\n  Jim Bunning always stood tall, firm, and unafraid, whether in sports, \npolitics, or life. That is how he became one of Kentucky's favorite \nsons. That is how he became an inspiration to his family and his \nfriends and his colleagues. And that is how he threw that perfect game \non Father's Day 1964. It is his strength of spirit that has enabled Jim \nto succeed. Kentucky is honored to have had Jim Bunning pitching for \nour home team for so many years.\n  I am sure that every Father's Day brings back special memories for \nthe Bunning family. I am proud to wish my friend and former colleague \nwell on the eve of this Father's Day and to extend my best wishes to \nhim and to his family.\n  Thank you, Jim. Thank you for the example you have set for how to \ncompete, how to win, and how to live a good and full life.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           U.S. Manufacturing\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, American manufacturing has taken quite a \nhit in the last 15 years in this country. Some 30 years ago, U.S. \nmanufacturing made up some 25 percent of gross domestic product. Today \nthat number has declined to somewhere in the vicinity of 10 or 11 \npercent of gross domestic product. That has meant literally millions of \njobs paying good wages in cities and suburbs and rural America that \nhave simply disappeared. Some have been lost to technology. Far too \nmany have been lost to unfair trade practices, as jobs are moved \noverseas. Some of that responsibility lies with this Congress, which \nhas written laws or refused to change laws that encourage companies \nthrough trade agreements and through tax laws to shut down production \nin Worcester, MA, or Wooster, OH, and move to Wuhan, China.\n  But we have seen some good news. From 2000 to 2010, we lost about 5 \nmillion manufacturing jobs; 60,000 plants closed in this country. The \ngood news we have begun to see is that since the auto rescue in 2008 \nand 2009 and since this President has been relatively aggressive--\nbetter than his predecessors--in enforcing trade laws, we have seen \ngrowth in manufacturing. Since 2009--again, because of trade \nenforcement, because of the auto rescue--about 500,000 manufacturing \njobs have been created.\n  We see new investments in advanced manufacturing. We see new \ninvestments in clean energy. Natural gas production is providing \ndomestic manufacturers with an affordable energy source. Natural gas \nprices have remained pretty constant at $4 or $5, with a likely \npredictable, stable price for the next several years--maybe for a \ndecade.\n  This production in natural gas has also increased demand for world-\nclass tubular steel. Nearly 8,000 workers across the United States make \nwhat we call oil country tubular goods. That is the steel pipes that \nare some of the strongest steel ever invented, ever developed, because \nthat steel needs to be able to absorb high-speed, high-rotation deep \ndrilling into water and into stone. Only the best kind of hardened \nsteel can withstand that kind of pressure. These jobs--these 8,000 jobs \nmaking oil country tubular goods--support another 7 jobs in the supply \nchain.\n  We have an opportunity to grow the economy by investing in \nmanufacturing to create more good-paying jobs. But here is the problem: \nWhen foreign steel is dumped into our country, American workers pay the \nprice. What that means simply is that when South Korea--which literally \nhas no domestic market. South Korea has begun to produce oil country \ntubular goods. They do not use this kind of steel in their domestic \neconomy. So they began this production, they started up, they ramped up \nthis industry all for export, which they are free to do. But global \noversupply is a major challenge facing our domestic steel industry. It \nthreatens thousands of steel jobs.\n  OCTG--oil country tubular goods--imports have doubled since 2008. \nImports account for more than 50 percent of the pipes being used by \ncompanies drilling for gas and oil. If that were done through fair \ncompetition, it would be one thing, but here are some things we know:\n  We know that in South Korea they need to go to mostly Australia and \nBrazil to get the iron ore and the coal and the limestone for their \nsteel production. Plants in Ohio, in the Midwest, go to Minnesota to \nget iron ore or they go to Indiana for their coke, which is made from \ncoal. Their coal is processed into coke. They may go to Ohio to get \ntheir limestone. So the Koreans, obviously, to get their raw \nmaterials--their raw materials have to travel much longer distances for \ntheir Korean steel industry than the U.S. steel industry, No. 1.\n  No. 2, American workers are paid only slightly more than Korean \nworkers, so there is not much difference in the cost of labor.\n  No. 3, the U.S. steel manufacturers have upgraded and invested many \nbillions of dollars in their production. There is a 2-year-old steel \nmill in Youngstown, OH. There are major investments in Lorain and \nCleveland to make oil country tubular steel--major investments. I was \nat the Wheatland steel plant north of Youngstown in Warren, OH. There \nis a $20 million new\n\n[[Page S3644]]\n\ninvestment there. So our mills are just as modern--maybe more modern--\nthan the Korean mills.\n  Lastly, after this oil country tubular steel is produced in Ohio or \nin Pennsylvania, it is transported maybe 50 miles to use in the oil and \ngas fields at the Marcellus or Utica shale in Ohio or in the region. \nKorean steel tubes, on the other hand, are transported maybe 10,000 \nmiles to the fields in this country to use in oil and gas drilling.\n  So clearly we know that the Koreans simply are subsidizing their \nsteel. We call it steel dumping. Call it whatever technical or \nnontechnical term you want, it is clear that the Koreans are not \nplaying fair.\n  If they can design an industry--think about this--if Korea can \ndecide: Well, there is a market in the United States for this kind of \nsteel; we will just design an industry, we will subsidize that steel, \nwe will sell into that market, and we may put some of them out of \nbusiness--if we as a government accept this kind of behavior from \nKorea, it will show the rest of the world a blueprint on how you take \njobs from the United States of America, how you start a business, how \nyou invest in this business, how you illegally subsidize this business, \nhow you export from your country into the United States, throwing \nAmerican workers out of work, undercutting American companies, and in \nthe end making our manufacturing in the United States of America \nexperience even more decline than we have seen over the last 30 years.\n  We are asking the Department of Commerce to reconsider its \npreliminary decision to make sure they look at what, in fact, has \nhappened in this industry. There is no question that the deeper you \nlook--or there is no question on the surface--that Korea is subsidizing \nits steel, that it is breaking trade rules.\n  There is clear evidence that our workers and manufacturers are being \ncheated in another way; that is, by currency. My bipartisan \nlegislation--I have worked with Senator Sessions and Senator Graham and \nothers, Senator Stabenow on the Democratic side--our bipartisan \nlegislation would crack down on China's currency manipulation. It would \ntreat currency manipulation as an unfair trade subsidy and require the \nCommerce Department to investigate that currency manipulation.\n  If you cheat on currency, if you devalue in playing this game with \ncurrency at the rate of 30 percent, what that means is when China \nexports a product to the United States, it is 30 percent cheaper, \nmaking it very hard for U.S. companies to compete--another way of \nsubsidizing is through currency--or if U.S. companies try to sell into \nthe Chinese market, our goods cost 30 percent more than the Chinese \ngoods. So, again, we simply cannot play on a level playing field.\n  A report released earlier this year said that 254,000 Ohio jobs would \nbe created if currency manipulation were eliminated by 2015.\n  When foreign steel is dumped into our country, American workers pay \nthe price. When foreign steel is dumped into our country, American \nbusinesses pay the price. When foreign steel is dumped into our \ncountry, the communities where these mills are, these communities that \nsupply, feed into, and sell items and sell goods into the supply chain, \npay the price too. So it means fewer teachers, fewer police officers, \nfewer people working, less income, less prosperity in those \ncommunities.\n\n  Again, when foreign steel is dumped into our country, workers pay the \nprice over and over.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to talk \nabout an emerging issue of the highest order for our country's national \nsecurity. I say that because I believe the coverage in the news over \nthe last few days about Iraq has missed the greater point about the \nimportance of the issue we are now facing.\n  Much of the attention--and I understand why--has been paid to the \nfact that the United States invested a tremendous amount of money and \nunfortunately lost many, many lives in the efforts to liberate Iraq \nfrom Saddam Hussein. These views we now see of Al Qaeda-linked groups \ntaking over cities in Iraq rightfully trouble us. We hear the question \nbeing asked of why did we do all of this. This is without a doubt a \nlegitimate concern and one I will touch upon in a moment, but the issue \nof what is happening in Iraq at this moment is much deeper and more \nserious than simply just that.\n  Let me begin by describing the emerging situation. There is a radical \nIslamic group by the name of ISIL, as it is called, or ISIS according \nto some. It has different terminologies. But it is a group linked to Al \nQaeda that emerged in Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein in western \nIraq. They were involved in efforts against Americans after we \nliberated Iraq. They killed and maimed countless Americans. However, \nthanks to the assistance we provided, the Iraqis were able to put that \ngroup on a defensive posture.\n  After the United States left Iraq, however, many of this group were \nable to reorganize. They did so increasingly with new leadership, and \nthey were able to do it in parts of Syria that became largely \nungoverned after the Assad regime began to lose control over large \nswaths of land in Syria, and they grew stronger. They grew stronger \nstill when foreign fighters from all over the world, who sympathized \nwith their Islamic jihadist cause, began flowing into Syria, providing \nthem new fighters.\n  Over the last few months, as I warned, by the way, in a hearing that \nwe had late last year when we debated the issue of the use of force in \nSyria, this group, based largely now in Syria, began to conduct \noperations in Iraq, initially to limited success, and then limited \noperations that had some success. But now, over the last 72 hours, they \nhave begun to make dramatic gains in Iraq. In fact, they have overrun \nthe second largest city, and there are expectations that they are on \nthe way toward Baghdad.\n  The goal of this group is pretty straight forward: to establish what \nwould be known as an Islamic caliphate, basically an Islamic \nfundamentalist area, country--a terrorist government. By the way, this \ngroup does not necessarily respect any borders. They are looking to \ncarve out pieces of land that they can use to train terrorists and to \nplan operations.\n  If we look at the situation in Iraq over the last 72 hours, we have \nlegitimate concerns that, in fact, that is what they are on the verge \nof doing, if they have not done so already. When you add up the land \nthey now control in Syria and the land they now control in Iraq--by the \nway, in many parts of the towns they are now taking over in Syria, they \nhave already began imposing Sharia law. They have banned music; they \nhave forced women to wear full veils. This is a radical Islamic group. \nIt has shown what it is capable of in its conflict in Iraq when \nAmericans were there and thereafter. This is a brutal and murderous \ngroup that has shown what they are capable of doing to those who oppose \nthem. Unfortunately, this is a military-capable group that has made \ndramatic gains over the last few years in Iraq.\n  Most startling of all, by the way, has been what has happened with \nthe Iraqi military, which we spent money to train and equip. In many \ninstances the reports are they just abandoned their posts. They took \noff their uniforms, they put on civilian clothes and just walked away. \nOur fear should be that even as I speak to you now, emerging in the \ncenter of the Middle East, emerging in this area of the world is an \nIslamic caliphate controlled by the most radical group in that area of \nthe world today. That is saying a lot.\n  Why should this matter? Well, first, as was pointed out earlier, \nAmericans sacrificed greatly so that Iraq could be freed from tyranny. \nNow those gains seem to have evaporated almost overnight. But the most \nconcerning long-term aspect of this is that in this part of the world, \nusing territory in what was Syria and now Iraq, is the emergence of a \nsafe haven. A safe haven is what made 9/11 possible. Al Qaeda was able \nto go into Afghanistan, then controlled by the Taliban, another radical \nIslamic group, and use it as a place to\n\n[[Page S3645]]\n\ntrain and plan 9/11 and other terrorist acts against the United States.\n  Perhaps one of the greatest successes in the post-9/11 efforts has \nbeen the denial of safe havens where terrorists could do this. But \nsuddenly, rapidly a new safe haven is emerging where radical jihadist \nfighters from all over the planet are able to go and be trained. They \nwill not simply be satisfied with conducting efforts in that part of \nthe world. Rest assured that their targets and ambitions include us, \nincluding right here in the homeland, right here in the United States.\n  If, in fact, they are able to hold on to this territory, Jordan, an \nextraordinary ally of the United States in the region and an ally of \nIsrael, is directly threatened. They are the next country--right next \ndoor. Already Jordan is facing tremendous challenges because of the \nconflict in Syria. Beyond Jordan, you can foresee where Israel could be \nthreatened by the existence of the safe haven for a terrorist \norganization right next door--but ultimately us here in the United \nStates.\n  The goal of these groups is to carry out Western operations. The goal \nof these groups is to attack Americans here, to terrorize. They believe \nand know that perhaps the most effective way to terrorize Americans is \nto not strike us in remote areas of the world, although they will do \nthat as well, but to strike us right here in the United States. If they \nhave an area where they are able to do this, a piece of land where \nthere is no government to drive them out, where in fact they are the \ngovernment, where they can attract the most radical people on the \nplanet to come, to train, and to prepare to carry out these attacks, it \nputs in grave danger the security of every American living here in the \nUnited States.\n  This is the risk before us now emerging in Iraq. It is not simply the \nfact that we have lost the gains that were once made. That is important \nand worthy of outrage, but what is most startling and concerning of all \nis the emergence of this safe haven and what it can mean to the long-\nterm security of every single one of us.\n  What can we do about it is the next question? I must say that while \nnational security issues should never be of a partisan nature, I am \nconcerned that despite this emergence, we have yet to hear a cohesive \npolicy pronouncement from the White House. In fact, a number of my \ncolleagues on the other side of aisle--Democrats--have shared the same \nfrustration.\n  I want to make a couple of brief points with regard to the sorts of \nmeasures we should be thinking about in outlining a response to prevent \nthe creation of a safe haven. The first good news is that this group is \nnot invulnerable. This group is vulnerable. No. 1, they have not proven \nto be very good at controlling territory for long periods of time. This \ncreates a vulnerability. Here is the other point. This is a Sunni \nMuslim group. But they are not popular among the Sunni population in \nIraq. Sunnis feel terrorized by them, and they certainly do not like \nthe Maliki government. But this is not a group that is popular among \nthem.\n  Beyond that, I would say the first action we need to take is to make \nsure our personnel are protected, particularly in Baghdad and in the \nGreen Zone in Baghdad, the international area, which is vulnerable to \nsuicide attacks. We must ensure that our personnel there are protected. \nI understand that steps have been taken and continue to be taken to do \nthat. I am encouraged by that. We need to make sure that happens, that \nthe men and women who are representing us and are working on our behalf \nin Baghdad are protected.\n  One of the reasons why this is happening is because the Maliki \ngovernment has been so terrible. It is not just corruption. It is the \nway this government has created no space for Sunnis living in Iraq that \nhas created the possibility of this occurring. This Maliki government \nmust be worth saving. Right now the Maliki government is a \ndysfunctional government as evidenced by the collapse of their military \nforces, but also as evidenced by the way they treated their Sunni \npopulation, giving them no space or voice in their government. That \nmust change. That must change.\n  The third step is that if in fact that begins to change and \nconditioned upon that change, the United States must continue to \nprovide lethal assistance, to the extent possible, to help these Iraqi \nforces, particularly those concentrated in Baghdad, to repel and push \nback against this group. Right now it is my opinion, based on \neverything I know that they are not capable of doing that and in many \ninstances are not willing to do that. Without our assistance, they will \nhave no chance of doing that.\n  Ultimately, while the use of force is never popular around here, I \nwant to be blunt and clear about something. We are going to have to \ntake some sort of action against this radical group. That is not the \nchoice before us. The choice before us will be whether we take action \nnow or we take action later, because what we can never allow is for \nanother safe haven like pre-9/11 Afghanistan to emerge anywhere in the \nworld, where terrorists can plan, practice, and ultimately conduct \nattacks against us here in the homeland or on our interests around the \nworld.\n  Therefore, I believe that we should not rule out and, in fact, \nconduct, to the extent they are effective, military actions from the \nair against this group wherever they are located.\n  I do not take that lightly. I am not one to come to this floor and \ncall for military engagement as a response to every conflict. I have \nopposed them in the past when they have made no sense or there was no \nclear plan moving forward. But this issue rises to that level of \nurgency. We must never forget the lessons of September 11, 2001, where \na group of radical jihadist terrorists used a safe haven in Afghanistan \nto murder innocent Americans and carry out the most devastating attack \nin the history of our Nation.\n\n  It was not that long ago that this happened. There are groups around \nthe world that aspire to that now. What they need is a place to do that \nfrom. We cannot allow that place to emerge. There is no greater \nresponsibility on the Federal Government than to provide for the \nsecurity of our people. The choice before us will be whether we prevent \nit now or whether we deal with the consequences of it later. I urge the \nWhite House to take this matter with the importance that it deserves \nand to come to this Congress as soon as possible with a clear and \nconcrete plan on how we are going to deal with it and engage in this \nemerging emergency situation that we now face and that threatens the \nnational security of the United States and places a grave threat to the \nnational security of our country in the years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                          Veterans Health Care\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I appreciate an opportunity to speak on a \nbill we passed here yesterday, the veterans access reform bill. We \npassed it 93 to 3, which is amazing when you think about it--in this \nbody--as we struggle to get issues in front of us and work on them. \nWhat we saw was an incredible bipartisan piece of legislation basically \nsaying: We are for vets. We want to make sure that veterans have the \nbest care they deserve and they earned fighting wars--not only the \nrecent ones but in the past.\n  I want to talk a little bit about the piece of legislation, and then \nI am going to talk about some pieces that are important to Alaska. I \nwill show some examples here in a second. But I ultimately want to talk \nabout what is left still ahead of us. As a member of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, it is not just about passing one bill and saying: We \nare done; we have done our chore; we have done our job. No, there is a \nlot more work ahead of us.\n  This bill we passed is a bipartisan bill, with Democrats and \nRepublicans coming together because veterans are not a partisan issue; \nit is an American issue. In my State it is an American-Alaskan issue; \nin the Presiding Officer's State, a Massachusetts issue. It is \nimportant for all of us to step to the plate and make sure we do the \nright thing.\n  This now provides the VA Secretary the authority to dismiss those \nsenior executives who are not performing, are not doing the jobs. But \nalso it ensures that if there are situations, as we have heard and seen \nand then had shown to us, where there are people who falsified data, \nthen they are going to be held accountable. As we know, recently we \nhave heard the FBI is now reviewing some of those situations.\n\n[[Page S3646]]\n\n  Whoever is at fault and has done anything to falsify needs to be held \naccountable and brought to justice. But it also brings out an issue \nthat we have been dealing with in Alaska for several years--an issue \nthat when I ran for office I remember I called the ``Heroes Health \nCard'' because I thought it was important, no matter where you were as \na veteran, you should be able to go and access health care all \nthroughout Alaska. My State is a very rural State, very vast in its \nsize, and where people are and where they live. It is not easy to \ndescribe until you see it or are there.\n  Just for example, here in Anchorage, flying up here to Barrow is 700 \nmiles, a long distance. But if you lived in Barrow, and you were a \nveteran, you could not get health care there. A VA facility does not \nexist. You would have to come down here to Anchorage, and that is just \nfor a clinic, because we do not have a VA hospital in Alaska. So then \nif you need hospital services, you would have to go to Seattle--long \ndistances.\n  So for several years we have worked on this issue. I continue to \npush. I brought General Shinseki out to Alaska, to rural Alaska, to \nshow him the impact on veterans who live in rural Alaska. But yet \nacross the street medical services provided by Indian Health Services \nthrough our Native health clinics were being delivered by our tribes--\nincredible health care. But veterans could not utilize it.\n  So I tried to show him that the care there is incredible, high \nquality. We need to be able to access this. It is all paid with Federal \ndollars so why not figure out how to access it. Why not figure out how \nto maximize our public resources for the betterment of not only our \nAlaska Natives but also our veterans in Alaska? So we worked on an idea \nwhere today we have now agreements with 26-plus tribes. All of these \nblack dots on this map show all the new areas that veterans can access \nhealth care if they want.\n  This is another choice. It is not a requirement, but if they want to \nstay in their region, stay close to their homes, be part of their own \nhealth care system there, they can and the VA will reimburse them, \nreimburse the clinic so it is no money out-of-pocket for the Indian \nHealth Service or tribes that deliver health care.\n  For example, in Nome I was very proud when we debated a big issue a \nfew years ago, trying to figure out how to deal with the stimulus bill \nand how to bring economic revival to our economy. One of those in that \nbill I voted for brought a new hospital to Nome, AK, run by a tribe--a \n$170 million hospital, but again 800 veterans in Nome, AK, could not \naccess that hospital. They still had to fly to Anchorage or Seattle.\n  But now those 800 veterans, Native or non-Native, can access that \nhospital, get care, and end up staying closer to home. All throughout \nAlaska now people can access Indian Health Services run by our tribes \nand delivering incredible services.\n  Along with that, in Anchorage, we have a federally qualified health \ncenter that now also allows access for our veterans. Again, the bill we \npassed, the veterans access reform bill, took some of these examples we \nhave been doing in Alaska and showing great success--not perfect but \nimproving.\n  To give an example of this next item--and these numbers fluctuate a \nlittle bit, but I want to give a general understanding of where we were \nand where we are. Before we had all of this integrated within the \nIndian tribal system--the Alaska tribal system delivering health care--\nit used to be 1,000 people, almost 1,000 people on the waiting list; \ntoday, a few dozen. This changes, this fluctuates, don't get me wrong. \nSo when people call me and say it is not 10, it is 50 or 5, it does \nfluctuate, but it is no longer the 1,000.\n  In the waiting period, in the audit that was just done, as we all \nknow in the 140 facilities they audited throughout the country, we, \nAlaska, our VA, was tied for first in the best response in regard to \nappointments on the waiting list. Because that was the big debate, how \nto improve the number of people who are on the waiting list because it \nis appalling--appalling--what has been happening in Arizona and other \nplaces. I have seen the list now through this audit, in some cases \n2,000, in some cases 3,000 on the waiting list, waiting for care.\n  The bill we passed yesterday will help improve that, and the numbers \nfor Alaska show we have an example, not perfect but yet improving \nsignificantly the care for our veterans.\n  No. 1, appointments, appointments scheduled within 30 days or less.\n  When we look at a couple of other pieces, for example, mental health, \nwhich is a new issue, growing significantly, new patient mental health \naverage wait time in Alaska is in the top 6 percent. Again, it is a \ngreat record for us, but we would love to be No. 1 in that category, to \nbe frank, and we are going to continue to strive to do that, but the \nway we have improved the system was to make sure we had more \nopportunities to access.\n  The bill we passed yesterday, again, takes some of the great things \nwe are doing in Alaska to show access. I think this will enhance the \ncapacity for veterans all around the State.\n  This is something that, again, when I campaigned on the Heroes Health \nCard, I believed we had this resource we could maximize, that we could \nmove forward on, that we could make a difference for our veterans, and \nwe are seeing it. When we look at this issue 1 year from now, we hope \nthe model we have laid out in Alaska is not only in Alaska but across \nthe country.\n  I will say we need to also keep track, because when you deliver \nhealth care through our Indian Health Service Program--in our case the \ntribes of Alaska or through our federally qualified clinics--they can \nprovide the health care per patient at a cheaper rate, and no \ndisrespect to the private doctors who are out there whom we do contract \nwith, the VA does. They are more expensive because they work in a \ndifferent model, a different business model. That is understandable. \nBut this is a more cost-effective way.\n  Hopefully, by passing the bill we don't just say we passed the bill \nand we are done, but 6 months from now or 1 year from now we review the \ncost of delivering this health care to make sure we are getting the \nmost cost benefit but also delivering quality care to our veterans, no \nmatter where they live.\n  As a matter of fact, 25 percent of veterans live in rural America. \nThat means we have to make sure our federally qualified clinics have \nthe right resources they need so that when a veteran walks in that \ndoor, they can get the care.\n  I will say in the Anchorage ones--again, for people who don't know \nAlaska--the Federal clinics there, the one Anchorage neighborhood \nhealth center--when someone is enrolled as a veteran to utilize that \nfacility for their primary care appointment, it is almost same day, in \nmost cases almost same-day service--incredible. It is the same thing \nwith our Southcentral facility health services. These are incredible \nclinics run by Alaska Native tribes in the Southcentral region. Again, \nsame thing--same-day service if you are on the list. We want to make \nsure it is clear that once someone is on the list, they can get pretty \ngood service, very direct service.\n  Let me put that aside a minute and give a general comment about \nveterans and veterans services we need. Again, I am going to leave this \nup so people see it, but the veterans access reform bill was just \nanother step for us to improve the services to veterans. This is just \none of many things.\n  One thing we did do on health care, the President and other Members \nremember when we had the shutdown, government services all stopped \nexcept VA health care, because when I first got here, there was a bill \nI cosponsored that gave advance appropriations.\n  Why were advance appropriations important? So when government \nshutdowns occur, health care still gets delivered for our veterans. \nThey shouldn't be subject to the politics of this place, and we made \nsure of that.\n  But to be frank, we still have more work to do. I hear Members come \ndown and start talking about disability claims, which still is a \nchallenge for us. We still have a lot of work in this area to make sure \nwe increase the capacity.\n  I know as an appropriator we put more money into this system so we \ncan have more capacity to shorten the time of disability claims and \nmake sure we get these done in a fast manner.\n  But we have to keep in mind, if we don't have advanced appropriations \non that side of the equation, the benefits\n\n[[Page S3647]]\n\nside of the VA, and there is a government shutdown, guess what happens: \nGI benefits stop, disability payment claims may not be processed in a \ntimely manner, other benefits that individuals receive as a veteran get \nstopped.\n  There is a bill pending, which I am very proud to be one of the prime \nsponsors of with the Republicans, both the House and the Senate, is a \nbipartisan bill. Every single veterans group supports it. It is \nimportant to improve the delivery system of the benefits side.\n  The health care side, we did some work yesterday. We have been doing \nwork in Alaska for the last few years. Now we need to work on the \nbenefits side.\n  There are many different bills out there, and a long list, working on \nhomelessness that we need to keep focused on and making sure our \nbenefits for our GI bill continue to move forward, helping our \nveterans. But I give you examples of a couple of people, and I want to \nspeak about these case stories and then I will end. It is important to \nremind people of the work we did yesterday, the work we have been doing \nfor years in Alaska, the results we are getting.\n  This example is now woven into the veterans access reform bill we \npassed yesterday--and Alaska is a great example--but here are a couple \nof cases in Anchorage I received recently.\n  One Anchorage veteran was in touch with my office and had been trying \nto get help from the VA since 1995 for an undiagnosed condition related \nto jet fuel exposure. Last week my office was able to get him an \nappointment immediately in order to get him service and have this \nlooked at. He called to thank us. He is getting care and the \nappointments he needs and he appreciates this.\n  I will say it is the job for our offices--all of our offices as \nMembers--to do everything we can for veterans. But we want to make sure \nthis veteran--when he walks into that clinic or facility, doesn't have \nto wait this long or be in these situations.\n  Another veteran in Soldotna, with a back condition, about 150 miles \naway from Anchorage, which again is where we had the clinic for the \nVA--about a 3-hour drive in the mountains--needed to be seen closer to \nhome. Again our office helped arrange it so he could get service right \nthere, so he can get service closer to home.\n  It is important we look at these, and I see these examples all the \ntime that we are working on every single day. I run into veterans all \nacross Alaska who thank us for the work we do to make sure they have \nthe access and capacity to get their benefits or their health care.\n  I am going to end by saying that there is no better job here than \nworking with the veterans. It is something I enjoy--77,000 veterans in \nAlaska, the highest per capita in the Nation. Every day I run into a \nveteran who may have an issue or is just thanking us for the work or \nthanking this country for the service--what they get and the benefits \nthey receive.\n  Yesterday was an example of what the Senate can do with veterans, \ncome together unified, negotiate but never forget our principal job is \nto take care of the American people the best we can in the services we \nshould render, and in this case it is for our veterans.\n  Again, Alaska is an incredible example--not perfect, let me be clear \nabout that, and the numbers fluctuate, but at the end of the day the \ntrend lines are the right trend lines. They are moving in the right \nway.\n  The bill we passed yesterday had some aspects of what we are doing in \nAlaska. It makes me proud to say Alaskan veterans should be proud that \nwe are doing not only the best we can, but we are using our examples to \nhelp veterans all across this country, and I think that is a great \nstatement.\n  We have more work to do. It is an honor to be here and explain once \nagain what we are doing in Alaska and also yesterday being able to vote \non that piece of legislation.\n  I know the House bill is very close to ours and we will have a \ncompromise bill and veterans will get better care tomorrow than they \nare getting today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                    Appropriations Committee Markup\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am on the Senate floor, but I should \nhave had the opportunity today to be at an Appropriations Committee \nmeeting.\n  We were scheduled this morning to mark up--that means to consider and \nvote on--the labor, health and human services bill for the next fiscal \nyear. The labor, health and human services bill is one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation we have.\n  It is the bill that spells out the priorities of the American people \nas worked out by their elected officials on everything from National \nInstitutes of Health to Pell Grants for college students.\n  Passing an appropriations bill is an appropriate and important check \non executive spending. It is one of our most important constitutional \nresponsibilities. It is one we haven't been exercising very well over \nthe last 4 years. Even though the Appropriations Committee has approved \nmost of the bills to go to the floor, the majority leader has not \nbrought most of the bills to the floor for our consideration.\n  In 2 of the last 4 years we considered zero appropriations bills on \nthe floor. One of those years we considered one and another year we \nconsidered five.\n  I wasn't at the committee meeting this morning because our markup was \nindefinitely postponed. I asked why, and I couldn't get a clear answer, \nbut apparently it was because some Senators don't want to vote on \ndifficult or tough amendments.\n  I have repeated a certain line a lot in the past couple of years. I \nam from Tennessee, so I have said that being in the Senate and not \nbeing allowed to vote on amendments is like being asked to join the \nGrand Ole Opry and not being allowed to sing. That is what we do. I \nmean, this body, described as the one authentic piece of genius in the \nconstitutional system of the United States, was created to have 100 men \nand women who come to the Senate and who have the opportunity to have \nextended debate on important issues until we come to a consensus. \nSometimes we do that in a terrific way.\n  Even recently we have done that in important ways; for example, on \nthe student loan agreement that we reached last year which cut nearly \nin half interest rates on all undergraduate loans, which are 85 percent \nof student loans. That was the result of an extended debate, working \nwith the Republican House and a Democratic President. The government \nworked the way it was supposed to.\n  Coming to the Senate floor and having a say, offering a bill, \noffering amendments, and having a vote is the job of Senators. It is \nnot so important that it is my say or my vote, it is the fact that this \nis what I was hired to do by my constituents, each one of us was. So we \nhave a right to have our say on the issues--whether it is Iran, student \nloans, Ukraine, or health care. It is what we are expected to do. So I \nhave objected to the fact that we have fallen into a pattern in this \nbody of not having amendments. Senator Barrasso of Wyoming has actually \ncounted the number of rollcall votes on amendments since last July. He \nhas discovered that Republicans offered only nine amendments that \nactually had a rollcall vote in that entire period of time. Then he \ncounted what the Democrats have offered. Our friends on the other side \nof the aisle have offered more than 600 amendments, and they have only \nhad 7 rollcall votes.\n\n  But today we have reached a new level of obstruction because it seems \nthat our friends in the Democratic majority are moving the gag rule--\nwhich has existed on the floor of the Senate--from the Senate floor to \nthe committee room. They have said we are going to indefinitely \npostpone a markup of a bill from one of the most important \nsubcommittees in the Senate to decide how to spend more than a hundred \nbillion dollars, apparently, because some Senators don't want to vote \non tough amendments.\n  These aren't extraneous amendments. These aren't political exercises. \nThese are relevant amendments critical to the process of setting \nspending priorities, and well within the scope of the bill.\n  So I have no alternative but to bring my tough amendments--the \namendments that I planned to offer this morning at the markup--to the \nSenate floor, at least to talk about them in the hope that soon I will \nhave a chance to offer them in the committee.\n\n[[Page S3648]]\n\n  I am going to talk about four amendments I had planned to offer this \nmorning--important, relevant amendments, part of what we are supposed \nto do. Senators shouldn't be afraid to vote on them. If so, we \nshouldn't be here, because that is what we do.\n  Amendment No. 1. My first amendment would reverse the trend toward a \nnational school board for elementary and secondary education by \nprotecting a State's control over its academic standards and tests.\n  My amendment does this by prohibiting the U.S. Department of \nEducation--where I used to be the Secretary--from exercising any \ninfluence over the academic standards States use to define what \nstudents should know and be able to do, as well as the test States use \nto determine whether students have met those standards.\n  It also prohibits the Department from requiring or incentivizing \nStates to adopt common standards and tests as a condition of an award \nof a Federal grant or a contract, or by providing additional points or \na preference in a competitive grant program, or as a condition of \napproval for waivers of requirements under No Child Left Behind or any \nFederal law.\n  In other words, this amendment directs the Federal Government to keep \nits sticky fingers off State standards and not to interfere with the \nhard work States are doing to raise expectations for our students.\n  This is not a new issue. In 1992, 22 years ago, I was the U.S. \nSecretary of Education for President George H.W. Bush--who celebrated \nhis 90th birthday today by jumping out of an airplane once again--a \nremarkable event. Happy birthday, President Bush. Democrats in Congress \nwrote an education bill in 1992 that would have set Federal standards \nnot only for academic content but also for how that content should be \ndelivered to students.\n  As Education Secretary, I wrote a memo to the President. I advised \nhim to veto the bill if it came to his desk, because, I said then, it:\n\n       . . . creates at least the beginnings of a national school \n     board that could make day-to-day school decisions on \n     curriculum, discipline, teacher training, textbooks, and \n     classroom materials. . . . A federal recipe dictating how to \n     operate a local school board does not make schools better.\n\n  I wrote this to President Bush in 1992. The President told the \nCongress he would veto the bill if it reached his desk. Fortunately, it \nnever did.\n  The amendment that I would like to have offered this morning should \nnot be necessary because Federal law already includes a number of \nspecific limitations on the Federal Government's involvement in \neducation standards and curriculum.\n  For example, section 9527 of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct prohibits any employee of the Federal Government from mandating, \ndirecting or controlling a State, local school district or school's \ncurriculum, program of instruction or allocation of State and local \nresources.\n  The Department of Education is prohibited from using any funding, \nsays the law, to endorse, approve or sanction any curriculum of \ninstruction used in the elementary or secondary school. That is the law \ntoday.\n  Furthermore, the law today prohibits requiring any State to have \nacademic content or student academic achievement standards approved by \nthe Federal Government in order to receive funding under the law, with \nthe exception of the requirement that States must demonstrate that they \nhave adopted challenging standards in their title I plan.\n  By including these prohibitions Congress has made it clear that it \ndoes not want a national school board--that primary responsibility for \ndecisions relating to educating students rest with States and local \ncommunities, teachers, and parents.\n  But this administration has used the combination of No Child Left \nBehind, Race to the Top, and waivers from No Child Left Behind to in \neffect convert itself into a national school board, making decisions \nthat States and local communities ought to make for themselves--\nparticularly decisions about standards and tests.\n  Under Race to the Top, the Department gave additional points to \nStates which participated in the development of and adopted the Common \nCore standards, using the prospect of receiving Federal funds to coerce \nStates into joining the Common Core.\n  Now, the Department might say it didn't write the words ``Common \nCore'' into their grant application, but Common Core then was the only \ngame in town that could meet the requirements for those points.\n  More recently, the administration has used its waiver authority under \nNo Child Left Behind to impose on States new requirements about \nstandards that are not contemplated in and, I believe, prohibited by \nFederal law. So this amendment would strictly prohibit that overreach.\n  My second amendment would avoid the creation of a taxpayer-funded \npopularity contest by preventing the Department of Education from \ndeveloping a rating system for our Nation's 6,000 colleges and \nuniversities.\n  So my first amendment would prevent the Secretary from becoming \nchairman of a national school board, and my second amendment would \nprevent the Secretary from claiming the role of national czar of higher \neducation. It is a simple amendment to end what I see as a misguided \nerrand initiated by the President and underway at the Department of \nEducation. That is the rating of our colleges and universities by the \nFederal Government.\n\n  This amendment would prohibit the Department of Education from using \nany Federal funding to develop, refine, publish or implement a college \nrating system. In August of 2013, President Obama directed the \nDepartment of Education to rate each of our Nation's more than 6,000 \ncolleges and universities based on their affordability and outcomes \nsuch as graduation rates and earnings. I am all for ensuring that \nparents and students have the information they need to make good \ncollege choices, but picking winners and losers with a rating system is \nnot an appropriate role for the Federal Government in Washington, DC. \nHere is what an expert in education policy at the Brookings \nInstitution--not exactly a hotbed of rightwing propaganda--had to say:\n\n       There is a clear case to be made for the federal government \n     using its authority to gather data like these for \n     postsecondary institutions that receive taxpayer funding, but \n     little precedent for the government producing ratings.\n\n  The Brookings scholar goes on to say:\n\n       The Securities and Exchange Commission regulates stocks and \n     bonds, but leaves it to private organizations to rate them. \n     The Department of Transportation sets standards for the \n     calculation of cars' gas mileage, but it doesn't opine on \n     whether a Ford is better than a Toyota. The Food and Drug \n     Administration decides which pharmaceuticals can be sold in \n     the U.S., but it does not say whether Advil is better for a \n     headache than Tylenol.\n\n  In other words, this is not the job of the Federal Government.\n  We don't need the Federal Government making these judgments for 22 \nmillion college students. What we need is the information so Americans \ncan make these judgments for ourselves.\n  I also have serious practical concerns about the Department's ability \neven to begin this effort. I believe it will fall on its face when they \ntry to write it. We already know the Department is struggling. They \nhave had to delay the release of the draft ratings system from the \nspring to sometime in the fall. If they ever do move forward, I have \nlittle confidence in their ability to get it right.\n  The Federal Government simply can't develop ratings that account for \nthe diversity of our higher education system. We have 6,000 \ninstitutions of higher education of all kinds Nashville's auto diesel \ncollege, Notre Dame, Randolph-Macon, Yeshiva, Berea College, Dyersburg \nCommunity College, Harvard. All of these are different. We need \ninformation. We don't need the government issuing ratings.\n  My third amendment would rein in the Obama administration's out-of-\ncontrol National Labor Relations Board by stopping it from requiring \nemployers to give labor unions their employees' personal email \naddresses and cell phone numbers and from forcing employers to let \nemployees use employer-owned and operated email systems to campaign for \na union.\n  Since 1966 the NLRB has required employers to provide a union with a \nlist of names and home addresses of employees eligible to vote in a \nunion representation election. This is called an Excelsior List.\n\n[[Page S3649]]\n\n  In February of this year, the NLRB reproposed expanding the Excelsior \nList in its ambush elections proposed rule. Now, ambush elections are \nanother Obama administration initiative which would shorten the time \nfrom the union's request to call an election to when the election is \nheld to as little as 10 days.\n  But here is the NLRB's Excelsior List proposal: It would require \nemployers to include voter-eligible employees' personal telephone \nnumbers, email addresses, work locations, shift times, and job \nclassifications on the Excelsior List. They rejected a suggestion I \nmade that at least an employee ought to be able to opt out of sharing \nthis information.\n  We have had many examples of unions violating people's privacy and \neven harassing them.\n  For example, in 2010, agents of Communications Workers of America \nLocal 1103 in Connecticut used personal information they obtained about \none woman who did not support the union to sign her up for hundreds of \nunsolicited and unwanted magazines and consumer products.\n  This NLRB-proposed rule has a lot of opposition. Senator Graham was \nintending this morning to offer in our markup a similar amendment that \nwould prevent funds from going to implement any of the so-called ambush \nelection rule which this is a part of.\n  As I have said before, the NLRB has become far too politicized under \nrecent administrations. It didn't start with the Obama administration, \nbut it has gotten worse with this administration, as it has moved \ntoward the side of union advocacy with such things as ambush elections \nand micro-unions and undermining State right-to-work laws.\n  The National Labor Relations Board should be an umpire rather than an \nadvocate.\n  The fourth amendment I would have offered this morning--had our \nsubcommittee markup proceeded as it had been scheduled, and had it not \nbeen postponed apparently because some Senators didn't want to take \n``tough votes''--would simply require the Obama administration to be \nstraightforward with the public about the Affordable Care Act by \nreporting basic facts on the Federally-run insurance exchange, which is \nrunning the exchange for 36 States--facts such as the number of people \nsigned up and making premium payments.\n  I introduced similar legislation last year. The House of \nRepresentatives passed that legislation in January by a bipartisan vote \nof 259 to 154. A total of 33 House Democrats voted for it. It is very \nsimple, noncontroversial, and shouldn't be considered tough.\n  It would simply require the Obama administration to provide weekly \nreports during open enrollment--which now runs from November to \nFebruary--reports to Congress, to States, and to the public about the \nFederal exchange, including such easily tracked data as the number of \nindividuals who have visited the site, the number who have successfully \nenrolled, their zip codes, the level of coverage they have obtained, \nand also at least monthly a list of the navigators and the brokers \noperating in each State. This is important especially to serve \ndisadvantaged Americans.\n  This isn't complicated. This is the Internet age. Even before the \nInternet age, McDonald's could tell us how many hamburgers it made each \nday, and RCA could tell us how many Elvis Presley albums it had left on \ntheir shelves.\n  In May Politico reported the administration stopped releasing the \nbarebones reports it had been providing the public every month. This is \ntroubling.\n  Many Americans can continue to sign up for coverage through special \nenrollment periods, but we won't know how many Americans have continued \npaying their premiums after the first month of coverage. We will have \nno way of knowing the final number of confirmed enrollments.\n  So these are the four amendments I had expected I would be offering \nand debating today in the Senate Appropriations Committee. Instead, I \nam here late in the afternoon on the Senate floor because some Senators \nmust be more worried about their reelection campaigns than about the \nprocess of governing and setting priorities.\n  If we are not willing to do what we are elected to do--no one is \nmaking any of us be here.\n  I hope the markup we had planned today will be rescheduled. I plan to \noffer these amendments then. I hope they will be voted on by the \ncommittee, and I hope I will have the opportunity to represent the \npeople of Tennessee who have sent me here to represent their views.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Student Loan Debt\n\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, for the first time in our Nation's \nhistory the total amount of student loan debt has exceeded the total \namount of credit card debt. This very real problem weighs heavily on \nfamilies in my home State of New Mexico.\n  Last year Congress narrowly stopped the student loan interest rate \nhike from going into effect--a rate hike that would have doubled \nstudent loan interest rates. As a result, undergraduate students \nborrowing this year are able to take advantage of reasonable student \nloan rates. But students who borrowed before this agreement could be \npaying rates as high as 9 percent. Those who pursued an education to \nget ahead are literally starting out from behind.\n  Student loan debt is proving to be a debilitating impediment to \nachieving the American dream.\n  Recently, I met a working mother in southern New Mexico who told me \nabout her family's struggle to raise their children while paying her \nhusband's student loans from a degree he had earned more than two \ndecades ago.\n  Another woman shared her story of going back to school to become a \nteacher. She is a single mom who wanted to make a better life for \nherself and her daughter. She got a degree but not without acquiring \nmore than $40,000 in student loan debt. She worries that she will be \npaying her loans off well into retirement. As a parent, she worries for \nher daughter who will be entering college and fears that she has no \nchoice but to take out loans to pay for her education.\n  Unfortunately, these stories are all too common today. Outstanding \nstudent loan debt in America totals more than $1.2 trillion--trillion \nwith a ``t.'' In New Mexico, students are graduating with an average of \nnearly $18,000 in debt.\n  Outstanding balances not only affect families working to pay those \nloans, it affects the entire American economy as well. Because of this \ndebt, many are unable to buy a home, to start a business, to save for \nretirement or even start a family. In today's economy we should be \neliminating the obstacles that keep Americans from earning the \neducation they need to get ahead. College should not be a luxury; it \nshould be an opportunity all Americans can at least afford to pursue.\n  The student loan refinancing legislation that was on the floor this \nweek would have helped address this problem of skyrocketing student \nloan debt by allowing graduates to refinance and put more money into \nproductive use and strengthen our economy as a whole. However, our \ncolleagues across the aisle decided to filibuster this legislation. \nThey don't seem to understand that crushing student loan debt is a \nserious issue that forces many Americans to put their American dreams \non hold.\n  Higher education is one of the most important investments any person \ncan make in their own future. From my perspective, making college \naffordable is an investment in America's future. Republicans should \nknow this and even recently helped to do something about it. Just last \nyear Democrats and Republicans came together in Congress to prevent a \nstudent loan interest rate hike that would have doubled student loan \nrates. This was a great money-saving piece of news for students taking \nout new loans. However, there are still approximately 134,000 New \nMexicans--just in my small State of 2 million people, there are 134,000 \nNew Mexicans who would benefit from passing this newest legislation \nwhich would allow them to access those same student loan rates.\n  We had an opportunity to come together to address skyrocketing \nstudent loan debt, and instead our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle chose to leave families, students, and really the American \neconomy behind.\n\n[[Page S3650]]\n\n  A college education opens the doors of opportunity. It provides an \navenue into the middle class for families. College graduates are nearly \ntwice as likely to find work as those with only a high school diploma, \nand they will earn nearly $1 million more over the course of a \nlifetime.\n  We should be willing to give our aspiring college students a fair \nshot. Senate Republicans should reconsider their priorities and allow \nus to at least debate this student loan refinancing legislation, to end \ntheir filibuster so that we can move forward, so that we can provide \nimmediate relief to student loan borrowers and put that money to work \nin growing the American economy.\n  I would yield back the rest of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                             Tax Extenders\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Just last week the majority leader gave his view that \ntax extenders as an issue is dead in the Senate until the lameduck \nsession. I presume that means we will have a lameduck session. The \nmajority leader blames this on Republicans, the minority in the Senate, \nbut as you all know, the majority leader is uniquely situated under our \nSenate rules to determine what legislation will be considered on the \nSenate floor.\n  The majority leader's excuse that was given for not proceeding to \nextenders before a lameduck session is that we Republicans are seeking \nto offer amendments unrelated to tax extenders. Of course, this excuse \nsimply does not fly. Even an introductory report on Senate procedure \nfrom the Congressional Research Service will tell all Senators that \nthere is no ``standing rule or general requirement that the amendments \noffered by Senators on the floor must be germane or relevant to the \nbill being considered.''\n  The CRS report states:\n\n       The right to offer non-germane amendments is \n     extraordinarily important because it permits Senators to \n     present issues to the Senate for debate and decision without \n     regard to the judgments of the Senate's committees or the \n     scheduling decisions and preferences of its majority leader.\n\n  The majority leader has sought to circumvent the open amendment \nprocess by blocking amendments by filling the amendment tree. This \nallows the majority leader to effectively decide what, if any, \namendments ought to receive consideration here on the Senate floor. \nEssentially, this allows the majority leader to impose his own will at \nthe expense of the will of the Senate as a whole. Another way to say \nit: The majority leader decides what 99 other Senators can offer as \namendments.\n  The real reason the majority leader does not want to bring extenders \nback is that he is concerned that Members of his party might have to \ntake tough votes in an election year. Of course, in a parliamentary \nsystem, this is a poor excuse for putting off considering legislation \nthat has broad bipartisan support, and this extenders bill does have \nbroad bipartisan support. This approach puts politics before \nconstituents.\n  Delaying tax extenders legislation until the lameduck session has \nreal consequences for our constituents. We know from previous years \nwhat has happened when tax legislation is not passed in a satisfactory \namount of time. Late action on tax extenders poses significant tax \nadministration burdens that cause headaches and hardships for millions \nof taxpayers. When we fail to act in a timely manner, tax forms are not \nready and refunds are delayed. We owe it to our constituents to see to \nit that these added complications are not a factor this year. Tax \nseason is already unpleasant enough without our adding to it by failing \nto do our job in a timely fashion.\n  While many view tax extenders as benefiting businesses, the truth is \nthe delay of widely used individual tax provisions will impact millions \nof taxpayers. I will give a few examples.\n  Three of the most widely used tax provisions are the State and local \nsales tax deduction, claimed by over 11 million returns in the latest \nyear for which we have statistics--2011; the above-the-line deduction \nfor teachers' expenses, claimed on over 3.8 million tax returns in that \nyear, 2011; and the college tuition deduction, which was claimed on \nabout 2 million tax returns. These 3 provisions alone give us over 16 \nmillion reasons--because of 16 million taxpayers being affected--to act \nnow to ensure that we don't subject these taxpayers to needless delays \nand complications this coming filing season.\n  These 16 million tax filers should provide more than enough reason \nfor not putting off tax extender legislation until the lameduck, but if \nyou are in need of another reason, think of the small businesses that \nare anxiously looking on and wondering what we are going to do about \nthe expiration of the enhanced expensing rules under section 179. I am \nsure I am not the only one hearing from small business owners and from \nfarmers who are putting off purchasing that new truck or tractor \nbecause they do not know the fate of this provision. This is bad for \neconomic growth, bad for jobs.\n  Then there is the lapse in the renewable energy incentives that \nsupport millions of jobs not only in my State of Iowa but in many other \nStates across our country. The expiration of these provisions has \nalready hampered the strides made toward a viable, self-sustainable \nrenewable energy and fuel sector. Delaying extension of these important \nprovisions is hurting the economy and costing jobs.\n  A biofuels organization found that nearly 80 percent of the U.S. \nbiodiesel producers have scaled back production this year. Sixty-six \npercent of the biodiesel producers have reduced their workforce and \nanticipate cutting jobs. This is a direct result of the policy \nuncertainties here in Washington, DC, including the expiration of the \nbiodiesel tax incentive.\n  The only thing standing in the way of passing the extenders package \nhere in the Senate is decisions made by the majority leader and getting \nan agreement on a handful of reasonable amendments.\n  The delay in passing the extenders package is harming a whole range \nof renewable energy efforts. A letter delivered to every Senator from \nabout 200 clean energy businesses urged quick passage of the bill.\n  The letter stated:\n\n       The lack of timely action to extend these provisions \n     injects instability and uncertainty into the economy and \n     weakens confidence in the employment marketplace. Moreover, \n     the extension of the expired provisions should not be delayed \n     until the end of the year since companies are making \n     decisions right now related to taxes that will have an \n     immediate impact on the economy.\n\n  I would encourage all of those who support this bill to urge the \nmajority leader to bring it back and allow for a fair amendment \nprocess. Could the Senate majority leader possibly argue that it is \nmore important to protect Senators from tough votes than to move \nforward on clean energy and job creation? For such an important piece \nof legislation, there is no legitimate reason for the majority leader \nto refuse to bring extenders to the floor for an open and honest \ndebate.\n  It has been quite a while since we have had a relatively open \namendment process on major tax legislation. Because of this, many \nSenators view this bill as their one shot at getting tax priorities \nthey have considered on the floor. There is no reason that an agreement \ncannot be reached that will provide opportunities to Members on both \nsides of the aisle to offer those amendments. As a former chairman and \nranking member of the Finance Committee, this Senator knows this can be \ndifficult, but it is more than doable.\n\n  I remember when Senator Baucus and I regularly worked out an \namendment process on tax bills. Usually this would consist of \nalternating votes on a block of 10 or so Democratic and Republican \namendments so each side was treated fairly. A tax bill that comes to my \nmind as an illustration of this process is a bill entitled Jumpstart \nOur Business Strength Act or, as we use the acronym, JOBS.\n  Like the extenders package, the JOBS Act had broad bipartisan support \nand ultimately passed the Senate 92 to 5. Though it had bipartisan \nsupport, there was no shortage of Members from the other side seeking \nto offer their amendments. Many of these amendments were in no way \nrelated to tax, although the JOBS Act was a tax bill.\n  As the bill's chief sponsor and floor manager, I had hoped to keep \namendments somewhat relevant--at least related to tax. However, the \nthen Democratic minority pushed for votes on everything from overtime \nlaws to trade\n\n[[Page S3651]]\n\nadjustment assistance to unemployment insurance.\n  All of these amendments were political in nature. They were intended \nto make Republicans take tough votes. At the time, then minority \nleader--now Majority Leader--Reid vigorously defended the right of the \nminority to get votes on these and other amendments that were entirely \nnonrelevant and nongermane. We Republicans took those votes because we \nwanted to get things done. We wanted to get a very important tax bill \npassed. That is what the American people need right now--new leaders \nwho want to get things done.\n  Yet today we were told Republicans are unreasonable for even seeking \ntax amendments to tax legislation. But it is not just Members of the \nminority who would like to offer amendments. Members on the other side \nfiled nearly as many amendments as Members of the minority, but under \nthe procedure set by the majority leader, even Members of his own party \nwere not able to offer amendments. We could have been debating \namendments to an extender bill this week. Instead, we wasted time on \nother pieces of legislation that were designed to fail, so the other \nside could score political points.\n  We were all sent here by our constituents to represent them in the \nlegislative process. So let's legislate, which means debating and \noffering amendments. A bipartisan bill, such as the tax extenders bill, \nwould be a perfect opportunity to show our constituents our ability to \nwork together and get things done.\n  I call upon the leadership of the Senate to bring the tax extenders \nbill back to the floor and to allow for reasonable amendments that \npermit individual Senators of both parties to have a say in crafting \nthis legislation.\n\n\n                           Kadzik Nomination\n\n  Madam President, I wish to speak about an issue I spoke to earlier \nthis week that I feel is so important I want to remind colleagues of \nits importance to me and what I think is an important issue for the \noversight work of the Senate.\n  On Monday I explained my opposition to the nomination of Peter Kadzik \nto be the Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs at the \nJustice Department.\n  In my view, the nominee's record demonstrates contempt for \ncongressional oversight. He has made a habit of providing evasive, \nnonresponsive, and plainly insufficient answers to congressional \ninquiries over the years. That practice alone disqualifies him from \nheading up the Legislative Affairs Office. That office has had a \nchronic problem with credibility in recent years--going back and forth \nwith Mr. Kadzik as well.\n  Specifically, I am referring to the false denials regarding Operation \nFast and Furious, which Mr. Kadzik's predecessor made and eventually \nhad to retract. So it is pretty evident to me that this administration \nis sending a message to all of us in the Senate by nominating an \nindividual with a track record as abysmal as Mr. Kadzik. That message \nis this: Expect more of the same. That is quite a message from the \nself-professed most transparent administration in history which, quite \nfrankly, has not turned out to be so transparent.\n  But there is a lot more at stake regarding Mr. Kadzik's nomination \nthan restoring credibility to the Legislative Affairs Office--a lot \nmore. As we all know, at the beginning of this year the President \nboasted that he had ``a pen and a phone'' and that he intended to use \nit. What he meant, of course, was that he would bypass the legislative \nprocess and proceed with aggressive and unilateral executive action.\n  So in January I called on the Attorney General to disclose the \nopinions and memoranda from the Justice Department's Office of Legal \nCounsel, providing the legal justification for this President's \nunilateral executive action.\n  Four months later, Mr. Kadzik replied to me in a 1-page response. He \nsaid, in short, he would not disclose those legal opinions. But he said \nif I had additional questions regarding the legality of the President's \nactions, I should let him know. That was May 20. Well, 11 days later, \non Saturday, March 31, we learned that the President had flouted the \ncongressional notification provisions of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  This latest example of the administration's flagrant disregard for \nits legal obligations to submit to congressional oversight has \ndominated the headlines. I am referring, of course, to the \nadministration's failure to notify Congress of its plan to release the \nso-called ``Taliban Dream Team'' from Guantanamo last week.\n  As every Senator knows, the National Defense Authorization Act--a law \nthis President has signed--required the administration to notify key \ncongressional committees at least 30 days before arranging the release \nof a prisoner from Guantanamo. The law enumerates exactly what that \nnotification needs to address.\n  Specifically, the administration was legally required to explain to \nCongress why the release is in the national security interest of our \ncountry. The administration was legally required to explain to Congress \nwhat action it had undertaken to mitigate the risk of reengagement of \nsuch terrorists by re-releasing the detainees.\n  The law requires these explanations and other disclosures because the \nMembers of this body have an independent responsibility to ensure the \nnational security of the United States. And, of course, we take this \nresponsibility seriously. Each one of us swore an oath to protect and \ndefend the Constitution--the same oath that the President took. \nUnfortunately, this administration has locked us out of the process \nthat the National Defense Authorization Act requires. I know I need to \nbe more clear for most of you.\n\n  The history of section 1035 and the negotiations surrounding it make \nit plain that Congress included those provisions because it wanted to \navoid release of prisoners like this one. So congressional opposition \nshould not exactly come as a surprise to this administration.\n  This administration broke not only the law but also the promise it \nmade in 2013 when White House Press Secretary Jay Carney promised that \nthe administration ``would not make any decisions about the transfer of \nany detainees without consulting with Congress and without doing so in \naccordance with U.S. law.'' The administration knows it broke the law. \nCertain Senators on our Select Committee on Intelligence have even \nreportedly received apologies from the administration officials for not \nnotifying them.\n  I don't think apologies are enough, and I don't think this \nadministration takes seriously its legal obligation to consult with us \nbefore acting. Take the recent statement made by the Deputy White House \nPress Secretary on June 9. He said that ``this administration continues \nto be committed to coordinating with our partners in Congress.'' But \nthe law doesn't require mere ``coordination.'' Coordination under the \nlaw is not good enough.\n  The President is required by law to meet certain obligations, and he \nrecklessly ignores those obligations. The President is required by the \nConstitution--a document the President claims to know a lot about \nbecause he was a constitutional law professor--to ``take care that the \nlaws be faithfully executed.'' Yet we all know by now that this \nPresident picks and chooses which laws to enforce.\n  This is not how our constitutional system is designed. The President \nis not in power to ignore the law. So ``coordination,'' as the Deputy \nPress Secretary said, is not good enough. We need compliance with the \nlaw. This administration needs to commit--on the record--that going \nforward it intends to comply with the National Defense Authorization \nAct so that another one of these stealth detainee releases never \nhappens again.\n  With the exception of the majority leader, this administration has \nkept every Member of the Senate and the House in the dark about \nreleasing five of the most dangerous terrorists we were holding at \nGuantanamo. Even the majority leader was not given the 30-day notice \nthe law requires. So it is clear that not a single Senator was notified \nin compliance with the law prior to the release of the Taliban Five. It \nis likewise clear that not a single Senator received an explanation \nregarding national security and risk mitigation that the law requires \nin advance of releases.\n  But the failure to notify us in Congress in accordance with the law \ndoes\n\n[[Page S3652]]\n\nnot relieve this administration of its responsibility to justify the \nreleases. There is a lot about this ordeal that is extremely \nconcerning. Part of what is so troublesome is that this administration \ncan't even seem to get its story straight regarding why it ignored the \nlaw. The justifications the administration has offered publicly thus \nfar have shifted dramatically from one day to the next day.\n  I will show how the shift has taken place and the justifications that \nhave been presented to the public.\n  Shortly, after the release of the Taliban Five on June 1, the \nadministration sent--of all people--National Security Advisor Susan \nRice back to the Sunday talk shows--in Benghazi fashion--to explain the \nadministration's rationale.\n  Adviser Rice told CNN that the ``acute urgency'' of an unspecified \n``health condition'' that Sergeant Bergdahl was suffering from had \nforced the President to act without notifying Congress. We haven't \nheard much publicly about the acute medical emergency since then. In \nfact, a number of my colleagues have expressed skepticism at what \nlittle information the Pentagon has provided publicly regarding \nSergeant Bergdahl's physical condition. But since the administration \nhas said it was an emergency because the terrorists had threatened \nBergdahl's life, apparently that was the medical emergency.\n  But now the story has changed. First, on Monday, following the \nreleases, according to press reports, the White House called the chair \nof the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to apologize for its so-\ncalled oversight in failing to consult with Congress. So they meant to \ninform Congress about the releases but didn't because it was an \n``oversight.''\n  Is that the story now? No. It didn't take long for the story to \nchange. The White House then offered a new explanation.\n  On Tuesday, the Deputy White House Press Secretary said that the \nrelease was ``a secret military mission in which disclosures of the \nmission could put into jeopardy not just the life of Sergeant Bergdahl \nbut also the lives of the American servicemen who were involved in the \nmission, so discretion on this matter was important.''\n  Let's think about the new justification--this one I just quoted--\nlet's think about it for a moment. The White House is saying \nessentially that disclosure of the operational details concerning the \nphysical transfer of Sergeant Bergdahl could have jeopardized the \nmission. But the White House's justification is totally beside the \npoint. To my knowledge, no Senator has claimed that the administration \nhad a legal obligation under section 1035 to disclose the specific \noperational details of the transfer to our relevant committees. Section \n1035 doesn't even require that. On the contrary, the law requires the \nadministration to explain its rationale for the release in terms of \nnational security and risk mitigation, not operational details.\n  So this particular justification is, of course, a colossal red \nherring, and it wasn't the last of the shifting justifications this \nadministration has offered. Listen to the next one.\n  The administration claimed it simply ran out of time to notify us. On \nTuesday the administration reportedly claimed that it knew only 1 day \nin advance that the transfer would take place and only an hour in \nadvance about where it would happen. And then on Wednesday Defense \nSecretary Hagel told the House Armed Services Committee that the \nadministration had only 96 hours from the time the deal was made to \nactually release Sergeant Bergdahl.\n  Again, both of these justifications miss the point. It is clear that \nthe negotiations preceding the deal were in motion for months. \nAccording to the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the \nadministration reported that it had been engaged in negotiations with \nthe Taliban since January 2014. So the administration had weeks--maybe \neven months--to communicate to Congress that it was in active \nnegotiations that might result in the exchange deal in the near future. \nThat, of course, never happened.\n  But even that wasn't the last of the shifting justifications. On \nWednesday Defense Secretary Hagel told the House Armed Services \nCommittee that the administration couldn't notify Congress because of \nthe risk of a leak. Secretary Hagel said that the Qatari Government--\nwhich apparently was acting as a middleman in these negotiations with \nthe Taliban--threatened to end all negotiations if details of the deal \nleaked.\n  It is pretty obvious that this justification doesn't wash either. \nPress reports indicate that the administration told Congress that \nanywhere between 80 to 90 members of the executive branch knew about \nthe release of the Taliban five before it happened. That number \nincludes officials in the State Department, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the White House, and the Department of Defense. If that many \nindividuals--80 or 90 people in this town--are in the loop, the \nadministration's stated concern about a leak just doesn't make any \nsense. The White House could keep all of those officials in the loop, \nbut somehow it couldn't pick up the phone and call the chair and vice \nchair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  Frankly, as we have seen over the last few years, when information is \nleaked to the press, the leak usually originates in the executive \nbranch and more often than not from the White House itself. So it seems \npretty clear that the administration is not being candid with us or \nwith the American people about why it broke the law and locked the \nrepresentatives of the people of the United States out of the process, \ncontrary to what the law says.\n  So the bottom line is this: The White House ignored a Federal law \nthat the President signed and that the White House Press Secretary \npromised it would follow. Yet the White House can't even get its story \nstraight regarding why the law was ignored.\n  It is for these reasons--getting back to the point about the Office \nof Legal Counsel and Mr. Kadzik's nomination to be head of the Office \nof Legislative Affairs--it is for these reasons that I wrote to the \nAttorney General last week and called on the Office of Legal Counsel to \nrelease any and all materials concerning the legal justification for \nthe detainees' release that the Department of Justice provided to the \nadministration. It is the Office of Legal Counsel's job to look at \nevery Presidential action and Executive order and decision to see if it \ncomplies with the law. And then it is my approach that if some lawyers \nare telling the President what he can legally do or not do, \nconstitutionally do or not do, according to the Constitution, why \nshouldn't the American people know about it?\n  So this all becomes more important with each passing day, as the \nWhite House keeps offering new explanations for why it broke the law.\n  We know the Justice Department provides legal advice on this question \nto the Defense Department because that is one of the very first things \nthe administration said publicly about the deal. On June 1 Susan Rice \ntold CNN that the Defense Department consulted with the Justice \nDepartment before the decision to move forward was made. We need to \nknow about the nature of that consultation. We need to know what legal \njustification the Department of Justice provided that would permit the \nadministration to ignore its legal duties to notify Congress and to \ninform us of the reasons for the release. And, importantly, we need to \nknow what specific facts on which the Justice Department based its \nlegal analysis.\n  In other words, with all of these shifting explanations we have been \nhearing about the factual basis for the decision, which one of those \nmany was provided to the Justice Department? Did they tell the Justice \nDepartment: We don't have time to tell Congress. If so, did they tell \nthem that these negotiations had been ongoing for months, as they \nappear to have been? Did these executive branch people tell the Justice \nDepartment that Sergeant Bergdahl was, as Susan Rice claims, suffering \nfrom an acute condition that required the administration to take \nimmediate action? Did the Justice Department take the view that the \nadministration did not have to comply with the law because of the \nPresident's powers under article II of the Constitution, \nnotwithstanding the fact that the White House had already promised it \nwould comply or was none of this even considered? Was all of this just \nan\n\n[[Page S3653]]\n\n``oversight,'' as the White House apparently told the chair of the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence or was it that they didn't have \nto comply because they didn't trust the members of the select committee \nto keep a secret or should we expect that yet another justification \nwill be forthcoming?\n\n  The bottom line is that Susan Rice went on CNN and said the Justice \nDepartment was consulted. But we don't know whether there was a written \nopinion provided by the Office of Legal Counsel and, if there was, what \nit concluded and what facts that conclusion was based on.\n  The General Counsel of the Defense Department testified yesterday \nthat the administration had received legal advice from the Office of \nLegal Counsel in the form of an email chain. The administration needs \nto provide us with whatever written advice it received before it \ndecided to contravene Federal law.\n  Given their failure to respond to my previous requests and \nconsidering Mr. Kadzik's track record in this regard, I am not \noptimistic. As I have stated previously, Mr. Kadzik's nomination \nembodies this administration's philosophy that it is OK to ignore its \nobligations with respect to congressional oversight--a constitutional \nresponsibility of the legislative branch of government, by the way.\n  Let me conclude by saying that this nominee's record is emblematic of \nthe administration's sorry record in complying with congressional \noversight. And, of course, both have been abysmal.\n  If this administration is serious about honoring its legal \nobligations, the Attorney General would direct Mr. Kadzik to disclose \nthe Office of Legal Counsel's legal reason for why the administration \nwas entitled to ignore the law's requirement to notify Congress. No \nSenator should cast a vote on this nomination before Mr. Kadzik \nprovides that legal reasoning to us.\n  If not now, when are all Senators--Republican and Democrat alike--\ngoing to take a stand against this President's unilateral decision to \nignore the Congress and his obligations under law? If not now, when \nwill Members of this body stand together in defense of our legislative \nprerogatives and assert our rights as part of a coequal branch of \ngovernment under the Constitution?\n  In this Senator's view, a vote for this nominee is a vote endorsing \nthis administration's contempt for our oversight authority and will \nlend support to the deal that released the Taliban five without \nadhering to the law. As my colleagues know, I will vote against this \nnominee. I encourage my colleagues to vote against this nominee as \nwell.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, of the many global challenges we face, \nprotecting the environment should find support in all corners of the \nworld. Similarly, we should support those who work on behalf of the \nenvironment.\n  Unfortunately, in some countries, environmental activists are \nthreatened and imprisoned. Such is the case in Russia, where, in the \nshadow of the Olympic Games in Sochi this past winter, Suren Gazaryan \nand Evgeny Vitishko were ruthlessly harassed by government officials \nfor their investigative work on the large-scale construction of Olympic \nfacilities that caused significant environmental damage to protected \nlands. Both were convicted in 2012 of damaging a fence in a forest near \nthe city of Krasnodar, a charge they both deny, and sentenced to 3 \nyears in a labor camp, suspended.\n  Mr. Gazaryan, a recipient of the prestigious 2014 Goldman Prize for \ngrassroots efforts to protect and enhance the environment, has sought \npolitical asylum in neighboring Estonia. Evgeny Vitishko, however, was \nnot fortunate enough to escape and is still paying the price for his \nwork. On February 12, a Russian judge, upholding a decision that Mr. \nVitishko violated a curfew clause in his parole agreement, ordered him \nto serve his 3-year prison sentence. Perhaps not coincidentally, this \ncame as he and his organization, Environmental Watch of the North \nCaucasus, were preparing to release a report on the damaging effects of \nconstruction in Sochi.\n\n[[Page S3655]]\n\n  I want other Senators to know of Mr. Gazaryan and Mr. Vitishko, and \nhope that calling attention to them and their work might cause the \nRussian authorities to recognize that their responsibility is to uphold \nthe law and protect the environment on behalf of the Russian people, \nnot to persecute Russian citizens who have the courage to do so \nthemselves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3655-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     LOVING v. VIRGINIA ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, on June 12, 1967, during a period of \nsignificant political and racial tension in our Nation, the Supreme \nCourt issued a unanimous landmark decision in Loving v. Virginia that \noverturned laws banning interracial marriage. This decision ushered in \na transformative moment in American history. As we approach the first \nanniversary of another landmark Supreme Court decision in the Windsor \ncase, we should remember the foundational work that was laid when the \nSupreme Court came together nearly 50 years ago to uphold the civil \nrights of all Americans to marry the person they love.\n  In writing for the majority in Loving, Chief Justice Earl Warren \ndeclared ``the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race \nresides with the individual, and cannot be infringed by the State.'' My \nwife Marcelle and I had been married just 5 years at the time, and on \nthat June day, we were overwhelmed with pride and joy for the many \ncouples affected by this historic decision. Now married for over 50 \nyears, I cannot bear to imagine a world where I would have been \nprohibited from marrying the person I love because of something beyond \nmy control.\n  As I reflect on the landmark Loving decision, I am filled with pride \nfor my home State. Throughout history, Vermont has taken a leadership \nrole in America's journey to build a more just society. Vermont was the \nfirst State in the Union to outlaw slavery, and Vermonters offered \nshelter to runaway slaves seeking refuge while in transit to Canada--\nserving as one of the last stops on the Underground Railroad. Vermont \nwas also the first to adopt universal manhood suffrage, regardless of \nproperty ownership.\n  It is because of this history that it is not surprising that Vermont \nhas been at the forefront of our Nation's march toward marriage \nequality: Vermont was the first State to provide civil unions back in \n2000, and on April 7, 2009, Vermont once again led the Nation by \ngranting marriage equality for the first time through democratically \nelected officials on a bipartisan basis instead of through the courts.\n  This is not to say that it was easy. The initial move toward civil \nunions fomented heated debate among Vermonters and throughout the \nNation. But several courageous leaders, such as the late Republican \nU.S. Senator from Vermont Bob Stafford, showed us the way, and their \nadvocacy for equality was powerfully moving. Like many Vermonters, I \nlistened to advocates, friends, and neighbors who reminded me that love \nand commitment are values to encourage and not to fear. I continue to \nbe inspired by the inclusive example set by Vermont.\n  Five years ago Vermont's State Legislature passed the Marriage \nEquality Act, which provided marriage equality for all Vermonters. \nSince then, more than 3,700 same-sex couples have married in the State \nof Vermont, 19 States and the District of Columbia have marriage \nequality, and the Supreme Court has decided a landmark case on the \nissue of same-sex marriage.\n  One year ago this month, the Supreme Court struck down section 3 of \nthe Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage for purposes of \nFederal law as ``only a legal union between one man and one woman.'' \nThe Court concluded that the law deprived couples of equal liberty as \nprotected by our fifth amendment. All Americans deserve equal justice \nunder the law, and Marcelle and I celebrated this important decision, \nwhich honored the Loving decision and pushed the Nation farther on its \npath toward equality.\n  In 2007, on the 40th anniversary of the Loving decision, Mildred \nLoving reflected on her life and weighed in on the issue of marriage \nequality. She said:\n\n       Surrounded as I am now by wonderful children and \n     grandchildren, not a day goes by that I don't think of \n     Richard and our love, our right to marry, and how much it \n     meant to me to have that freedom to marry the person precious \n     to me, even if others thought he was the `wrong kind of \n     person' for me to marry. I believe all Americans, no matter \n     their race, no matter their sex, no matter their sexual \n     orientation, should have that same freedom to marry. \n     Government has no business imposing some people's religious \n     beliefs over others. Especially if it denies people's civil \n     rights.\n       I am still not a political person, but I am proud that \n     Richard's and my name is on a court case that can help \n     reinforce the love, the commitment, the fairness, and the \n     family that so many people, black or white, young or old, gay \n     or straight seek in life. I support the freedom to marry for \n     all. That's what Loving, and loving, are all about.\n\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have made civil \nrights a priority of our Committee's agenda and a priority in the \nSenate. I often hear from those who think that the struggle for civil \nrights is over--that this issue is one for the history books. If only \nthat were true. If only every American could marry the love of their \nlife and have that union recognized. If only hate groups stopped \ntargeting communities based on their sexual orientation, race, \nreligion, or national origin. If only racial discrimination in voting \nwas a thing of the past, but it is not. We must keep up the fight on \nour path toward a more perfect union.\n  This month we celebrate and honor the real love behind both the \nLoving and Windsor decisions. Their fight to be with the one they loved \nspans decades, but their lessons stand the test of time. They are the \nkinds of Supreme Court rulings that future generations will point to \nwhen they consider the Supreme Court's most notable decisions. The \nmarch toward equality must and will continue until all individuals--\nregardless of sexual orientation, gender or gender identity, race, \nethnicity, religion, or disability--are protected and respected, \nequally, under our laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3655-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3655-S3656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ROBERT L. WILLIAMS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, for several years now I have had the \ndistinct pleasure of knowing Robert L. ``Bob'' Williams. Bob hails from \nIndependence, KY, and is a member of our Nation's Greatest Generation. \nLike so many in that generation, he answered the call of duty and \nfought valiantly in the Second World War. I rise today to honor his \nservice to this country.\n  Early on the morning of June 6, 1941, Bob was among the first Allied \nparatroopers dropped into Normandy as a part of Operation Overlord, on \nthe historic day of D-day. Several hours later, the largest amphibious \nassault in the history of war would commence. For the time being, \nhowever, Bob and his fellow paratroopers fought behind enemy lines, \nsecuring the roads and bridges that were vital to the operation's \nsuccess. You could say that these men constituted the tip of the \nsharpest sword this Nation has ever thrust into battle.\n  The airborne soldiers' mission that day was extremely dangerous--\nsimply making it to the battlefield through the barrage of German anti-\naircraft fire was a feat in itself--yet Bob displayed remarkable \ncourage under fire. Upon landing, an enemy machine-gunner placed 12 \nbullet holes in his baggy pants pockets. Undeterred, Bob continued to \nfight that day, and for 10 more days until he was seriously wounded on \nJune 16.\n  Since the war's conclusion, Bob has done his part to keep alive the \nmemory of those who served. On the 50th anniversary of the D-day \ninvasion, he joined 18 fellow veterans in re-creating their parachute \njump into Normandy. He has also written a book containing his, and \nother veterans' stories from the war. Most recently, Bob was honored to \nbe inducted into the Kentucky Veterans Hall of Fame in March of this \nyear.\n  As the Second World War drifts further and further into the past, it \nbecomes increasingly important that we remember the sacrifices made to \nsecure victory. So today, I ask that my U.S. Senate colleagues join me \nin honoring Robert L. Williams and his service to his country during \nthe great battle to make the world safe for democracy that was World \nWar II.\n  Mr. President, the Lexington Herald-Leader recently published an \narticle detailing Bob Williams' and other Kentucky World War II \nveterans' stories\n\n[[Page S3656]]\n\nfrom the war. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, June 5, 2014]\n\n Veterans from Lexington, Louisville Areas Mark D-day Anniversary This \n                                Weekend\n\n                            (By Jim Warren)\n\n       On D-day morning, 70 years ago Friday, Winchester's Jonah \n     Thomas was an Army combat engineer in one of the first \n     landing craft to hit Omaha Beach.\n       German shells obliterated the boat almost the instant it \n     touched the sand.\n       ``I didn't see anybody else there when we hit the beach, so \n     maybe they didn't have anybody else to shoot at,'' Thomas \n     recalled. ``They blew that boat to smithereens.''\n       A soldier in front of Thomas was struck in the face. Thomas \n     was covered with his blood.\n       ``I would have been hit if he hadn't been there,'' Thomas \n     said. ``There were 44 men crammed in that boat, and hardly \n     anybody survived.''\n       Thomas, now 89, was one of the few who did.\n       He'll be among about 80 veterans from the Lexington and \n     Louisville areas who are flying to Washington early Friday, \n     the 70th anniversary of D-day. They'll visit the Korean War \n     Veterans Memorial, the Iwo Jima Monument, and the National \n     World War II Memorial before returning Friday evening. A \n     public welcome is planned at Blue Grass Airport when they \n     return.\n       D-day, June 6, 1944, was when roughly 160,000 American, \n     British and other Allied troops stormed into Nazi-held France \n     along a 50-mile stretch of beaches in Normandy.\n       It was one of history's biggest military operations. More \n     than 5,000 ships and 11,000 planes supported the landings, \n     which launched the final campaigns that ended World War II in \n     Europe in May 1945.\n       Within five days after D-day, more than 300,000 soldiers, \n     54,000 vehicles and 104,000 tons of supplies had come ashore.\n       But for the first few hours, the D-day invaders struggled \n     just to survive a wave of bullets and shells from German \n     guns. About 12,000 Allied soldiers were killed, wounded or \n     captured, including roughly 6,000 Americans.\n       London's Owen Edwards, then 18, was a Navy coxswain, \n     steering one of the landing boats headed for Omaha. His job--\n     delivering a 20-man medical team to the beach--looked \n     impossible.\n       ``Eighty-eight millimeter shells were hitting so close they \n     were throwing water into the boat,'' Edwards remembers. ``It \n     was so intense, that I finally turned the boat toward another \n     part of the beach where the shelling wasn't as heavy. I \n     probably wouldn't have made it if I hadn't done that.''\n       Edwards, now 88, is another veteran who'll be making the \n     trip to Washington Friday. He eventually landed the medical \n     team safely on Omaha, one of two runs he made to the beach \n     that day.\n       ``It was complete chaos,'' Thomas said. ``There were bodies \n     everywhere, wrecked equipment, tanks that never made it, \n     soldiers that drowned going in. It's a miracle that we took \n     that beach.''\n       Thomas visited Omaha Beach in 1993, and stood on the spot \n     where he landed his boat.\n       ``The beach was so quiet and peaceful then, but I could \n     visualize what it was like on June 6, 1944,'' he said. ``It \n     was pretty emotional.''\n       The French invited Robert L. Williams to visit Normandy for \n     the 70th D-day anniversary. But Williams, 91, decided to stay \n     home in Kenton County.\n       ``I'm getting too old for nine hours on an airplane,'' he \n     said. ``Besides, I've been there and done that.''\n       Williams, a 101st Airborne Division paratrooper, had one of \n     D-day's most dangerous jobs. He was among about 13,000 Allied \n     paratroopers who parachuted into Normandy to seize and hold \n     strategic roads and bridges before the invasion.\n       Williams survived days of heavy fighting in Normandy, but \n     was seriously wounded on June 16, 1944.\n       Fifty years later, he helped organize a re-creation of the \n     original parachute jump for the 50th D-day anniversary on \n     June 6, 1994. Williams and 18 other original D-day \n     paratroopers parachuted into Normandy from a World War II era \n     C-47.\n       ``The government said, `There's no way we're going to let \n     you do that, you're all too old,' '' Williams recalls. ``We \n     did it anyway.''\n       He says the 1994 jump was one of the most satisfying things \n     he's ever done.\n       ``People were beginning to forget about World War II back \n     then,'' Williams said. ``I think that jump kind of brought it \n     all back. To me, it was more exciting than D-day.''\n       The boat carrying Lexington infantryman John A. Palumbo was \n     blown out of the water 100 yards off Omaha Beach on D-day. It \n     was his first taste of combat.\n       Palumbo splashed shore. But a bullet destroyed his BAR \n     light machine gun and left shrapnel in his right arm.\n       Eventually, he hooked up with some more experienced \n     soldiers, helped them get through a minefield, and found \n     cover on a bluff behind the beach. He never fired a shot on \n     D-day, but saw much heavy fighting later.\n       Palumbo, now 93, landed on a sector of Omaha Beach code-\n     named ``Easy Red.''\n       ``There was nothing easy about what we went through \n     there,'' he recalls. ``No one on that beach was rear-echelon. \n     Everybody was a front-line soldier on D-day. Period.''\n       Palumbo often says that every day of his life since D-day \n     has been a bonus, because he didn't expect to survive.\n       ``I'm glad I went through it,'' he said, ``rather than \n     having any of my heirs go through it.''\n       Ray Swafford, now 88, of Manchester, was a sailor on the \n     minesweeper YMS-247, destroying underwater mines to clear a \n     safe path for ships taking troops to Normandy.\n       It was dangerous work. The night before D-day, another \n     minesweeper hit a mine and exploded.\n       ``We had to leave the survivors in the water, and that hurt \n     real bad,'' Swafford remembers.\n       After clearing mines, Swafford's ship spent D-day guiding \n     landing craft toward shore, picking up survivors, even trying \n     to draw German gunfire away from soldiers on the beach. They \n     also went to assist the destroyer USS Corry, which was \n     sinking.\n       But Swafford was most unnerved by German ``E-boats,'' small \n     fast craft that fired torpedoes.\n       ``We couldn't shoot back at them because we might hit our \n     own ships,'' he said. ``Those torpedoes still bother me \n     today. I really don't like to think about it.''\n       Swafford isn't going on Friday's Washington trip, but he \n     said he might mark the 70th anniversary by cooking out with \n     some friends.\n       ``The captain of my ship stopped here to visit me once \n     about 20 years ago,'' Swafford said. ``He asked what I \n     thought about D-day, and I said, `It seems like a bad dream.' \n     ''\n       ``He said, `That's the way it seems to me too.'''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3656-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3656-S3658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FY14 INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I am pleased to speak today on the \nSenate's passage last night of the Intelligence Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2014. I would like to speak briefly on the bill itself, as \nwell as the process for its passage.\n  As Members know, the intelligence committee produces an authorization \nbill every year that both authorizes funds for the intelligence \ncommunity and sets out legislation that authorizes and limits \nintelligence activities. This is the primary vehicle for legislation on \nintelligence matters and serves as one of the most important tools by \nwhich the intelligence committee, and indeed the Congress, is able to \ncarry out its oversight duties.\n  From the committee's formation in 1976 through 2004, the Congress \npassed intelligence authorization legislation every year. \nUnfortunately, that streak came to an end during the last decade, and \nthere was no Intelligence bill signed into law from 2005 to 2009. It is \nno coincidence that during this period the congressional oversight was \nalso at a low point.\n  When I became chairman of the committee in January 2009, one of my \ntop priorities was to reinstitute the annual authorization bill \nprocess. Fortunately, I was joined in that goal by then-vice chairman \nof the committee Kit Bond and by the chairman of the House Intelligence \nCommittee, Silvestre Reyes. We also, importantly, had the support of \nthe majority and Republican leaders in the Senate and the leaders of \nthe two committees with the greatest shared interest in the bill, the \nArmed Services Committee and the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nDefense.\n  I am proud that the Congress has passed and the President has signed \nIntelligence authorization bills each of the past 4 years. With the \nSenate's action yesterday, we stand ready to pass a fifth.\n  The committee's preparation of the Fiscal Year 2014 Intelligence \nAuthorization Act last summer was disrupted by the leaks, beginning in \nJune 2013, of materials taken from the NSA by former contractor Edward \nSnowden. The committee held roughly a dozen hearings in the following \nmonths on NSA programs like the bulk phone metadata program conducted \npursuant to title V of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, \nSection 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, and the targeted collection of \nelectronic communications of non-U.S. persons outside the United States \nunder section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. These \nwere programs that had already been the subject of considerable \ncommittee oversight and discussion over the past several years.\n  The committee also received briefings on the extent of damage caused \nby the leaks and on the shortcomings of the internal security measures \nto prevent someone from accessing,\n\n[[Page S3657]]\n\ndownloading, and leaving NSA with classified information.\n  We marked up a separate bill, the FISA Improvements Act, last October \nand then marked up the Intelligence authorization bill last November.\n  After approving the authorization bill, we worked with the House \nIntelligence Committee to produce the legislation that the Senate \npassed yesterday. We have preconferenced these bills over the past \ncouple of years in order to move them through the process, with good \nresults.\n  Let me describe a few of the provisions in the bill, as well as one \nthat was not included.\n  First, the classified annex to the bill authorizes sufficient funding \nfor the intelligence community to collect and analyze intelligence for \nour national security. Among other intelligence activities, the bill \nfunds counterterrorism, counterproliferation, counterintelligence, and \ncovert action programs.\n  While classification prevents me from getting into specifics, the \nbill also continues the committee's practice of adding funding for \nintelligence agencies to implement a better insider threat detection \nsystem. We have been pushing the intelligence agencies to shore up \ntheir safeguards before Mr. Snowden and continue to do so afterwards.\n  The bill recognizes that the intelligence community's funding has \nbeen reduced significantly due to budget cuts and sequestration. \nDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper has testified that \nwhile the challenges facing the intelligence community have grown, its \nresources have declined. He has made clear that the community can not \ndo ``more with less''--it is going to have to do less, and that means \naccepting additional risk.\n  On the legislative side, the bill contains numerous provisions to \nstrengthen intelligence oversight, protect whistleblowers, and enhance \nauthorities for intelligence operations. Let me describe just a few of \nthem here.\n  Two provisions in the bill are intended to enhance congressional \noversight of significant legal interpretations affecting intelligence \nactivities, particularly when such interpretations result from opinions \nof the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.\n  Section 321 amends the National Security Act to require that the \ngeneral counsel of each intelligence agency notify the congressional \nintelligence committees, in writing, of any significant legal \ninterpretation of the U.S. Constitution or Federal law affecting \nintelligence activities conducted by that agency.\n  While the committee generally is kept apprised of the legal basis for \nintelligence activities of the U.S. Government, as required by sections \n502 and 503 of the National Security Act, there have been times when we \nhave not gotten enough information in this regard for us to provide \noversight. This provision is intended to ensure that, in the future, \nthe committee receives a detailed, written notification of significant \nlegal interpretations from these general counsels in a timely manner, \nto include significant interpretations resulting from opinions of the \nJustice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, OLC.\n  Section 322 requires the Attorney General to establish a process for \nthe regular review for official publication of significant OLC opinions \nthat have been provided to any part of the Intelligence Community.\n  Section 322 also requires that if any OLC opinion would have been \nselected for official publication but for the fact that the publication \nwould reveal classified or other sensitive information relating to \nnational security, the opinion shall be provided or made available to \nthe appropriate committees of Congress.\n  The committee regularly conducts oversight of intelligence activities \nthat are the subject of one or more OLC opinions. These opinions often \nrepresent the best and most comprehensive legal analysis of \nintelligence activities. Further, the opinions are sometimes cited by \nintelligence community officials as the basis for executive branch \npolicy. The committee regards access to these legal opinions as \nnecessary to the performance of its oversight functions and often \nrequests access to such opinions, or the legal analysis contained in \nsuch opinions, when the committee is made aware of their existence.\n  Unfortunately, the Department of Justice and the intelligence \ncommunity routinely decline to provide the committee with access to OLC \nopinions that are relevant to the committee's oversight functions, even \nwhen access is specifically requested by the committee. At times, the \nDepartment and intelligence agencies will not even advise the committee \nthat relevant OLC opinions exist. Generally, when refusing to provide \naccess to OLC opinions, the executive branch asserts that the \ninformation sought by the committee is subject to privilege.\n  The committee recognizes that, in certain limited cases, OLC opinions \nor information concerning OLC opinions may be entitled to executive \nprivilege and withheld from Congress on that basis. Nonetheless, the \nSupreme Court has found in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 1974, \nthat executive privilege is a narrow and qualified privilege that may \nbe overcome by an adequate showing of need.\n  Section 322 is intended to codify an agreement between the executive \nbranch and the legislative branch with respect to access to OLC \nopinions provided to an intelligence agency. Specifically, section 322 \nis intended to ensure the committee is, at a minimum, granted access to \nall OLC opinions provided to an element of the intelligence community, \nor information concerning such OLC opinions, that would have been made \navailable to the public had it been unclassified. Section 322 does not \nalter and is not intended to alter the responsibilities of the \nexecutive branch under the National Security Act, the Freedom of \nInformation Act, or any other statute establishing a requirement for \nthe disclosure of information to Congress or to the public, and there \nremain areas of disagreement between the branches with respect to the \nscope of the executive branch's responsibilities under such statutes. \nIn particular, the rule of construction set forth in section 322(d) is \nintended to apply only to official publication under this section and \nshould not be interpreted as congressional affirmation of a \n``deliberative process'' privilege or any other privilege as the basis \nfor withholding information from Congress or the public under any other \nstatute.\n  Title VI of the intelligence authorization legislation includes a \nnumber of provisions to enhance whistleblower protections for \nintelligence community employees. These provisions prohibit taking a \npersonnel action against an intelligence community employee as a \nreprisal for making a protected whistleblower disclosure to the DNI or \nhis designee, the inspector general of the intelligence community, the \nhead of the employing agency or his designee, the appropriate inspector \ngeneral of the employing agency, a congressional intelligence \ncommittee, or a member of a congressional intelligence committee. In \naddition, title VI prohibits agency personnel with authority over \npersonnel security clearance or access determinations from taking or \nfailing to take or threatening to take or failing to take any action \nwith respect to any employee's security clearance or access \ndetermination in retaliation for a protected whistleblower disclosure. \nFinally, the title directs the DNI to create procedures to allow \nappeals of adverse security clearance and access determinations.\n  These provisions strengthen and reaffirm the mechanisms already in \nexistence for legitimate whistleblowers to bring information regarding \nviolations of law or other concerns to one of several inspectors \ngeneral throughout the government or to Congress. Importantly, these \nchannels exist because it is not for any one person to decide on his \nown which intelligence methods are wise or effective.\n  I would like to note my appreciation for Senator Collins for her work \non this portion of the bill and for Senator Chambliss and Congressman \nMike Rogers for engaging in lengthy negotiations to find the workable \ncompromise included in this bill.\n  Title IV of the bill requires Senate confirmation for the directors \nand inspectors general of the National Security Agency, NSA, and the \nNational Reconnaissance Office, NRO. The individuals appointed to fill \nthese positions perform critical roles in managing and/or overseeing \ntechnically complex,\n\n[[Page S3658]]\n\nhighly expensive programs, with significant implications for national \nsecurity. These individuals also play a vital role in ensuring that \nintelligence activities carried out by the NSA and NRO are conducted in \nfull compliance with the law and in a manner that protects the privacy \nand civil liberties of Americans. By requiring Presidential appointment \nand Senate confirmation of these four positions, Congress will be \nbetter able to fulfill its responsibility for providing oversight of \nthe activities of these intelligence agencies.\n  A separate Senate resolution will govern the process for handling the \nconfirmation of individuals nominated to these four positions. I am \ncognizant that the confirmation process in the Senate is time \nconsuming, and it is my intention to continue the intelligence \ncommittee's practice of considering nominees quickly and moving them \nthrough the Senate on a swift and bipartisan basis.\n  Title V of the bill includes a number of provisions that are intended \nto improve the process for investigating persons who are proposed for \naccess to classified information and adjudicating whether such persons \nsatisfy the criteria for obtaining and retaining access to such \ninformation. Recent events, including the Snowden disclosures and the \nnavy yard shooting, have highlighted the shortcomings of existing \nsecurity clearance processes. The provisions in title V continue the \ncommittee's practice of seeking improvements to these processes. In \nparticular, section 501 requires the DNI to ensure that the background \nof each employee or officer of the intelligence community, each \nintelligence community contractor, and each individual employee of such \na contractor who has been determined to be eligible for access to \nclassified information is monitored on a continual basis under \nstandards developed by the Director.\n  Finally, section 309 continues Congress's push for financial \nauditability within the intelligence community by requiring key \nagencies to undergo full financial audits, beginning with their fiscal \nyear 2014 financial statements and to take all reasonable steps to \nachieve an unqualified opinion on financial statements by fiscal year \n2016.\n  With the budget reductions of the past couple of years, we simply \ncannot afford to mismanage Federal funds. Achieving financial \nauditability is a key tool to identify and eliminate wasted funding, \nand I am pleased to say that intelligence agencies are making progress \nin this regard--though they still have work to do.\n  In addition, I want to note one provision that does not appear in the \nbill as passed by the Senate. During the intelligence committee's \nconsideration of this legislation, I moved an amendment, which was \nadopted by the committee, regarding U.S. counterterrorism operations. \nSpecifically, the provision would have required that the President \nissue an annual public report that sets forth the total number of \ncombatants and noncombatant civilians killed or injured during the \npreceding year through the use of targeted lethal force outside the \nUnited States by remotely piloted aircraft.\n  While the amendment was approved in committee, there was sufficient \nopposition to its inclusion in both the Senate and the House that the \nbill would not have passed with the provision included. I agreed to \nremove the provision from the bill but have engaged with the executive \nbranch on the issue. I received a letter from Director of National \nIntelligence Clapper, dated April 18, 2014, that says the executive \nbranch is ``currently exploring ways in which it can provide the \nAmerican people more information about the United States' use of force \noutside areas of active hostilities'' and is ``committed to . . . \nsharing as much information as possible with the American people and \nthe Congress.''\n  I continue to believe that it is important to release these figures \nconcerning the number of people killed or injured by the use of \ntargeted lethal force outside the United States by remotely piloted \naircraft, as the public estimates of the number of casualties are so \ndifferent from the official figures we have received. This will \ncontinue to be of interest, and I will continue to address the issue in \nthe Senate and with the administration.\n  Today, though, I am very pleased that the Fiscal Year 2014 \nIntelligence Authorization Act has been approved by the Senate and is \non its way to the House of Representatives. I believe that the bill \nincludes a number of important measures and that by continuing to enact \nlegislation, the intelligence committee will further strengthen its \noversight role of U.S. intelligence activities.\n  Finally, I would like to thank, as always, the vice chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Saxby Chambliss. We have worked together on this \nbill, and both of us support the package. We have also had to work both \nsides of the aisle to achieve unanimous support for the measure, and I \nthank him for his work and partnership.\n  I would also like to thank the staff who put the bill together. On \nthe Democratic side, that is principally Eric Losick, SSCI counsel, Jon \nRosenwasser, SSCI budget director, deputy staff director Lorenzo Goco, \nand counsel Mike Buchwald.\n  On the Republican side, I thank Jack Livingston and Kathleen Rice, \nour minority counsels, and Hayden Milberg, minority budget director.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3658-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING WILLIAM MACK WATKINS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, the world lost an amazing man last week. \nWilliam Mack Watkins was a wonderful husband, father, brother, \ngrandfather and friend. After a lengthy battle with progressive \nsupranuclear palsy, PSP, Mack passed away peacefully on Thursday, June \n5, 2014, with his beloved wife Julia and other family by his side.\n  Mack was born in Tremonton, UT, on May 30, 1936, to Clifford Charles \nand Lois Oswald Watkins. Rising from humble beginnings, Mack was proud \nof his rural Northern Utah roots, often saying he was ``just a poor \npeach picker from Brigham City.'' Those who had the privilege of \nknowing Mack knew that he was so much more.\n  Mack was a stern believer in the power of education, evidenced by his \nown studies at Box Elder High School and his degree in history from the \nUniversity of Utah, where he was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.\n  A proud and loyal member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day \nSaints, Mack served in a variety of capacities including a proselyting \nmission in the Swiss-Austrian Mission from 1956-1959. Later, he was \ncalled to serve as president alongside his wife over the Czech-Prague \nmission from 1998-2001. He undoubtedly left a lasting legacy at both \nmissions.\n  Mack had a unique ability to bring people together, and he connected \nwith people of all walks of life. He continued and valued continuing \nrelationships. He created lifelong friendships with missionaries he \nserved with, the Austrian people, business partners and members of the \nLDS church and community. Mack's keen insight in finances led to his \nprofessional success in the finance industry. After working for two \nrenowned Utah companies, Mack formed his own financial services \nbusiness, WMW Management Inc.\n  But for all his professional success, Mack's proudest achievements \ncame as a loving husband and proud father of nine children whom he \nloved dearly.\n  Mack's love for music and fine arts was evident through the 10 years \nhe sang in the Mormon Tabernacle Choir as well as his talents with the \ntrumpet and guitar. He served as president of the Utah Opera Company \nand enjoyed his season tickets to the Utah Symphony and The Pioneer \nTheater Company. And his patience and perseverance was displayed in his \nlove for one of the most humbling hobbies any person can enjoy--golf.\n  While Mack was taken from us, his legacy will live on. It is my honor \nto stand with the Watkins family this week and pay tribute to this \nremarkable Utahn we are so proud of, and who we all loved. He will \nnever be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3658-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3658-S3659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CELEBRATING THE ARMY'S 239TH BIRTHDAY AND FLAG DAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, this Saturday--June 14--marks the Army's \n239th birthday. For 239 years, the Nation has entrusted the Army with \npreserving freedom and defending our\n\n[[Page S3659]]\n\ndemocratic values. Commencing on June 14, 1775, the Continental Army \nled our historic revolution and has continuously served America at home \nand abroad defending the cause of liberty. As the greatest land force \nthis world has ever known, I firmly believe that the U.S. Army will \nmaintain this proud duty.\n  The Continental Army had humble beginnings. It was originally \ncomprised of rebellious colonists who had little to no experience in \nsoldiering. Under the leadership of GEN George Washington, the soldiers \nof the Continental Army overcame overwhelming odds against them to \ndefeat the more seasoned and well-equipped British military and \nmercenary forces. Since then, our Army has become the standard that all \nother nations use to measure their forces.\n  The Army's birthday coincides with Flag Day, a holiday that \ncommemorates our Nation's adoption of the U.S. flag. This is a fitting \nmarriage, as our Nation's flag would not exist were it not for the \nbravery and sacrifice of our Army; and since the adoption of our flag \nin 1777, the Army has always carried the flag, the symbol of our most \nsacred values, into battle. I am reminded of Francis Scott Key's \nhallowed words after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by \nBritish ships in the Chesapeake Bay during the War of 1812. In \ndescribing the sight of Old Glory still flying after the bombardment, \nKey wrote, ``Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the \nland of the free and the home of the brave.''\n  In celebrating the Army's birthday, I would like to highlight a \nparticular Army unit that served our Nation with distinction under the \nmost challenging of circumstances. The unit that I am referring to is \nthe segregated 726th Transportation Truck Company, a part of the \nMaryland National Guard. The 726th existed as a segregated unit within \nthe Guard well after President Truman integrated the U.S. armed \nservices in 1948 because Maryland, like many other States at the time, \nhad not yet integrated its National Guard units. The 726th was the only \nMaryland National Guard unit that served in Korea during the Korean \nwar. While in Korea, the 726th Transportation Truck Company was \nattached to the 70th Transportation Truck Battalion as an integrated \nunit and served with distinction.\n  Upon returning to Maryland, the members of the 726th Truck Battalion \nlearned that their unit would be reverted back to its original \nsegregated status. Unwilling to return to segregation, the officers and \nenlisted personnel of the 726th Truck Battalion resisted, and worked to \nend segregation within the Maryland National Guard. In November of \n1955, the men of the 726th achieved their goal when Maryland's then-\nGov. Theodore McKeldin issued an order to end racial segregation in the \nMaryland National Guard. This order made Maryland the first State below \nthe Mason-Dixon line to integrate its National Guard. The united \nefforts of the men of the 726th Transportation Truck Company marked an \nimportant step towards realizing equal rights in our military and in \nour society.\n  With the withdrawal of our military forces in Iraq and the departure \nof those forces in Afghanistan by the end of 2016, I am concerned that \nour heroes who have recently entered or who are about to enter--\ncivilian life will not be provided with the tools they need to adapt to \nlife here at home. My concerns have been exacerbated by the recent \ndiscoveries of substandard care in the Department of Veteran Affairs \n(VA). Millions are helped each year by the VA health care system, but \nmore than a decade of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has overwhelmed a \nsystem already bursting at the seams. Veteran unemployment, post-\ntraumatic stress, and suicides continue to be serious issues that \nrequire immediate action. Maryland is home to over 30,000 military \nmembers and 460,000 veterans. The Army gives our soldiers the focus and \ndiligence to excel in any and every field they choose, but we have to \nprovide our servicemen and women with the tools they require to recover \nand adapt to civilian life. Doing so is not just a good idea, but \nrather our solemn obligation that strengthens our great Nation. As \nthese heroes serve and defend our citizens, rights and values, it is \nour duty to return the service, as it is the least we can do. \nUltimately, we have to continue to give these men and women a stake in \ntheir own country, the country they are so willing to dedicate their \nlives to serving.\n  I am eternally thankful for our brave men and women, both active and \nretired, for their willingness to serve domestically and \ninternationally. For 239 years these patriots have been the strength of \nthe Nation. Their steadfast dedication to duty, to our country, and to \nall Americans is embodied in the Army motto, ``This We'll Defend.'' For \n239 years, our Army has lived by these words, protecting our most \nrevered values: freedom, equality, independence, and democracy. Let us \nremember and celebrate our Army soldiers for this achievement today, \nand wish them a happy 239th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3659-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         REMEMBERING LEWIS KATZ\n\n Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I wish to remember and honor Lewis \nKatz, a business and civic leader, who passed away tragically on May \n29, 2014. Mr. Katz was a man of great integrity and ambition, and his \ncontributions to the City of Philadelphia, the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania, and the entire Nation leave a lasting legacy. I was \nhonored to join his family, friends, colleagues, and admirers in \ncelebrating his extraordinary life last week at his memorial service.\n  Throughout his remarkable career, Lewis Katz ventured in to the \nfields of law, business, sports, education and media. After graduating \nfrom Temple University and the Dickinson School of Law, Mr. Katz \nestablished the New Jersey based law firm Katz, Ettin, and Levine. He \nfound further success by investing in and leading a number of \nenterprises, including Kinney Parking Systems, the YES Network, the New \nJersey Nets, the New Jersey Devils, and most recently Interstate \nGeneral Media, which owns the Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia \nDaily News. In pursuing these endeavors, his ingenuity and proficiency \nwas without equal.\n  Yet this professional career was only a segment of the larger work \nLewis Katz embarked on in his life. A dedicated family man and a deeply \ncharitable patron, Mr. Katz's most important contributions came through \nhis boundless interest in helping others. He gave generously to a \nnumber of causes and institutions, notably Temple University and the \nBoys and Girls Clubs of America. He also directed the Katz Foundation, \nwhich continues to support a number of charitable, educational, and \nmedical causes. To these efforts, Lewis offered not only money, but a \ngreat portion of his energy and spirit.\n  Mr. Katz came from humble roots, yet he was grateful for all that he \nhad been given. He honored his own life and the life of those around \nhim by living with passion and purpose. Although we mourn his passing, \nI find solace in knowing that Lewis leaves behind a substantial legacy \nthat will allow us to honor him back for many years to come. My \nthoughts and prayers are with his son Drew, and his daughter Melissa \nduring this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3659-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3659-S3660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JEFFERSON COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State, and it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills, but I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n\n[[Page S3660]]\n\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Jefferson County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Jefferson County worth over $5 \nmillion and successfully acquire financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $11 million \nto the local economy.\n  Of course, one of my favorite memories of working together is the \ncommunity's success in obtaining over $10 million for airport \nimprovements since 2001. As a strong supporter of small community \nairports, I have long fought for funding from programs that support \nservice to small communities and infrastructure support to keep these \nairports modern.\n  Among the highlights:\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Jefferson County has received $171,231 in Harkin grants. \nSimilarly, schools in Jefferson County have received funds that I \ndesignated for Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling $227,000.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Jefferson County has received more than $2 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Jefferson \nCounty has recognized this important issue by securing $358,847 for \ncommunity wellness activities.\n  Disability Rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf, but I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the ADA \nAmendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow citizens \nwith disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, independent \nliving and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly one-quarter century since \npassage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in communities everywhere \nI go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed captioned television, but \nin the full participation of people with disabilities in our society \nand economy, folks who at long last have the opportunity to contribute \ntheir talents and to be fully included. These changes have increased \neconomic opportunities for all citizens of Jefferson County, both those \nwith and without disabilities, and they make us proud to be a part of a \ncommunity and country that respects the worth and civil rights of all \nof our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Jefferson County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Jefferson \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives, and, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3660-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3660-S3661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WASHINGTON COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

This isn't just about economics. It \nis also about maintaining our identity as Iowans. Main Street Iowa \nhelps preserve Iowa's heart and soul by providing funds to revitalize \ndowntown business districts. This program has allowed towns like \nWashington to use that money to leverage other investments to jump-\nstart change and renewal. I am so pleased that Washington County has \nearned $70,500 through this program. These grants build much more than \nbuildings. They build up the spirit and morale of people in our small \ntowns and local communities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern.

Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Washington County has received more than $3 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Washington \nCounty's fire departments have received over $776,144 for firefighter \nsafety and operations equipment and over $335,967 in assistance to law \nenforcement.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces.

Mr. President, today I rise in remembrance of my \nfriend, mentor, and coach, Marv Teixeira, a true Nevada statesman and \ndedicated public servant.\n  Mayor Teixeira's legacy as the longest running mayor in Carson City \nexemplifies his commitment and dedication to the betterment of his \ncommunity. Marv served three terms as mayor and was always willing to \nlisten to the voice of the people and base his decisions on what \ncitizens wanted. His leadership and exemplary contributions to the \nState of Nevada are, and continue to remain, unmatched.\n  There was no disguising Marv's love of Carson City, often referring \nto it as ``Nevada's best kept secret'' and he was right. Carson City is \na wonderful place to live and raise a family, and Marv's mayorship has \ncontributed greatly. There is a long list of accomplishments that he \nachieved for Carson: the Pony Express Pavilion, the V Railway \nReconstruction Project, and the Carson freeway. As mayor, he brought \nnew companies and jobs to the area. He was an outstanding public \nservant. He always supported me, and we were able to work together on a \nbipartisan basis for the good of Nevada.\n  Born in 1935, Marv led a long life dedicated to selflessly serving \nhis country and the community. He was a U.S. Air Force veteran of the \nKorean war, who bravely served in South Korea. As one of our Nation's \nservicemembers, he made exceptional sacrifices for our country and \ndeserves our deepest gratitude. After his time in the Air Force, Marv \nattended college and eventually settled in Carson City. He had a long \ncareer of 30 years as an IBM Corporation Representative in Carson and \nafter retirement, focused on giving back to the community by becoming \nmayor. Marv spent much of his free time coaching Pop Warner football \nand Little League and was active in the development of the Boys and \nGirls Clubs of Western Nevada. His service to his country, as well as \nhis bravery and dedication to his family and community, earn him a \nplace in history among the many outstanding men and women who have \ncontributed to our Nation and to the great Silver State.\n  His motivation and selflessness embodies the Battle Born State. With \nhis passing, Nevada lost a great man who is immortalized for his \nservice to our Nation and to the Carson City community.\n  My entire family extends our thoughts and condolences to Marv's wife \nElizabeth and his loved ones, and we thank them for their service as \nwell.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering Mayor Teixeira for his \nunwavering loyalty and dedication to Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3661-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3661-S3662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING NIA SANCHEZ\n\n Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I wish to congratulate Nevada's \nown, Nia Sanchez from Las Vegas, on being crowned Miss USA 2014. Nia is \nthe first beauty queen in the competition's history to ever win from \nthe great State of Nevada, and I am truly honored to congratulate her \non this great achievement.\n  The Miss USA pageant had its start in 1952 as a local ``bathing \nbeauty'' competition that transformed into an international and annual \ntradition that has been a part of American history for the past 62 \nyears. The women who are awarded the crown and named Miss USA are goal-\noriented, knowledgeable and aware of what is going on at home and \nabroad. These characteristics are exemplified in Nia's everyday life, \nas a woman who is constantly seeking to improve the lives of others and \nher local community.\n  Nia truly is an example of a person who overcame great obstacles to \nachieve her dreams. When she was 8 years old, she and her mother were \nforced to live in a women's shelter, and that is one of the driving \nforces behind her choice to dedicate her life to serving others. As a \nfourth-degree black belt and instructor, Nia spends her time teaching \nmartial arts to women and ``Stranger Danger'' classes to children in \nthe community. She also volunteers her time teaching Sunday school\n\n[[Page S3662]]\n\nat the Shade Tree shelter in Las Vegas, which serves the needs of \nwomen, children, and their pets in Southern Nevada. Her volunteerism \nwithin the community is just one part of how she serves others. Her \nservice extends far beyond our Nation's borders through her travels to \nwork on mission trips to Mexico, Thailand, and the Great Wall of China. \nShe is an exemplary Nevadan, and we are honored that she calls the \nSilver State home.\n  I know the citizens of the Silver State are proud to see a fellow \nNevadan succeed in making their dream of winning Miss USA come true. \nToday, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Nia Sanchez on \nthis incredible honor and wish her the best of luck as she pursues the \ncrown for Miss Universe and serves as a global ambassador.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3662-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO REAR ADMIRAL THOMAS P. OSTEBO\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I wish to thank RADM Thomas P. \nOstebo for his leadership as commander of the U.S. Coast Guard's 17th \nDistrict. In this role Rear Admiral Ostebo was responsible for all \nCoast Guard assets and operations in Alaska--operations that were \nsafely executed in some of the country's harshest and most demanding \nconditions. From May 2011 to June 2014, Rear Admiral Ostebo was the \nhead Coast Guard official in Alaska, leading 2,500 Active Duty, \nReserve, civilian, and auxiliary personnel, all charged to keep the \nlargest State, with over 44,000 miles of coastline, safe, secure, and \nprosperous. Under his leadership, Rear Admiral Ostebo's crews \nsuccessfully executed this mission by conducting over 1,600 search and \nrescue cases, saving 519 lives and assisting more than 2,200 \nindividuals.\n  In addition to commanding this courageous cadre of Coast Guard men \nand women, Rear Admiral Ostebo remained a consistent champion for the \nState of Alaska. He was a leader on Arctic issues on many different \nlevels. He recognized the importance of the Arctic trade routes and \nlaunched operation Arctic Shield, the Coast Guard's seasonal Arctic \noperation, to ensure the safe transit of commercial shipping routes, \nmaintain Alaska's wild and sustainably managed fisheries, and sustain a \nready response to any rescue mission at a moment's notice. Further, \nRear Admiral Ostebo fostered many important partnerships with Alaska \nNatives and leadership that shared best practices and traditional \nknowledge of those that rely on the Arctic for subsistence.\n  On behalf of all Alaskans I want to personally thank Rear Admiral \nOstebo for the great work he has performed during his command in \nAlaska. I wish him the best of luck as he transitions to the next phase \nof his career. He will be greatly missed in Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3662-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONNECTICUT'S AWARD-WINNING TALENT\n\n Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, we have a lot to be proud of in \nmy home State of Connecticut, and that includes our thriving arts \ncommunity. Our small but vibrant theatrical arts industry is often \novershadowed by that of its more renowned next-door neighbor, New York \nCity. But this week, a homegrown production--``A Gentleman's Guide to \nLove and Murder''--took home the top honors at the 2014 Tony Awards, \ndemonstrating the incredible talent and artistic skill that comes from \nour State's theaters and schools. I could not be prouder of these \nindividuals' historic achievements.\n  Not only did ``A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder'' win ``Best \nMusical'' of the year, but director Darko Tresnjak of Connecticut's \nHartford Stage took home ``Best Direction of a Musical;'' Yale Drama \nSchool graduate Robert L. Freedman won ``Best Book of a Musical;'' and \nLinda Cho, also a graduate of the Yale Drama School, won ``Best Costume \nDesign of a Musical.''\n  The musical originally premiered under Mr. Tresnjak's direction in \n2012 at the Hartford Stage in Hartford, CT. The musical follows the \nstory of a British commoner, Monty Navarro, who discovers he is ninth \nin line to inherit an earldom and great wealth, and decides to \neliminate the other eight heirs who stand in his way. The musical stars \nonly three actors, all with Connecticut ties. The talented lead actor \nJefferson Mays of Clinton, CT plays an incredible total of eight \ncharacters throughout the course of the musical. He is supported by \nBryce Pinkham and Lauren Worsham, both graduates of the Yale Drama \nSchool.\n  In 2013, the musical and its Connecticut cast moved to Broadway, \nwhere it became the most Tony Award-nominated musical of the 2013-2014 \nseason and ultimately took home the night's top honors. Their victories \nare not only wins for their careers and productions, but also for the \nState of Connecticut.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating these incredible \nartists on their Tony Award-winning performances, and I wish the \ncompany of ``A Gentleman's Guide'' all of the continued success in the \nworld as it goes on to enrich the lives of many more audiences for \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3662-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING TOMAS VILLANUEVA\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I would like to pay tribute to \nan incredible advocate for farmworker rights from the State of \nWashington, Tomas Villanueva.\n  Tomas's family immigrated to the United States from Mexico when he \nwas 14 years old. They settled in Toppenish in 1958, where Tomas was \nable to earn his GED, allowing him the opportunity to enroll in Yakima \nValley College. After being inspired by Ceesar Chavez's United \nFarmworkers moment, Tomas and classmate Lupe Gamboa traveled to \nCalifornia in 1967 to learn more about organizing. Upon their return to \nthe Yakima Valley, Tomas and Lupe formed the United Farm Worker \nCooperative, one of the first activist Chicano organizations in \nWashington State. Out of Tomas's activism came the Yakima Valley \nFarmworker's Clinic and the United Farmworkers Service Center.\n  After a brief break to focus on a family business, Tomas became the \nfirst president of the United Farmworkers of Washington State.\n  Tomas dedicated his life to improving working conditions and health \ncare standards for farmworkers, and I could always rely on Tomas's \nwisdom, guidance, and advocacy on the important issues of justice, \nhuman rights, and comprehensive immigration reform.\n  Tomas was gifted in his ability to translate the challenging issues \nfarmworkers face to community leaders and politicians, inspiring their \nsupport and work on behalf of farmworker rights.\n  While Tomas was informed and passionate, he was also pragmatic about \nhow we as a State--and as a nation-- can do a better job of caring and \nadvocating for farmworkers and their families.\n  He will be so missed, but his legacy will live on.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of Tomas Villanueva. During this difficult time my \nthoughts are with his friends, family, and all whom he \ninspired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3662-4", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ADRIANA ALVAREZ\n\n Mr. RUBIO.

Madam President, today I wish to honor of Ray \nGrossman, a World War II veteran from Missoula, MT.\n  It is my honor to share the story of Ray Grossman's service as we \nremember the fateful events of June 6, 1944.\n  On that day, which forever changed the course of our history, \nGrossman and his fellow paratroopers were waiting in the air above \nNazi-occupied France. Grossman was 1 of over 20,000 paratroopers who \njumped that day.\n  Then a 24-year-old first lieutenant in the newly formed 82nd Airborne \nDivision, Grossman and his unit fought to protect a small town in \nFrance to stop the enemy from attacking the Allies arriving on the \nbeach.\n  The 82nd Airborne maneuvered to avoid antiaircraft fire, and \nGrossman's unit finally jumped, landing at approximately 2 a.m. and \nreaching their rendezvous point 6 hours later.\n  In the days that followed, Grossman encountered heavy German attacks \nwhile fighting to protect a small town and fellow Allied service \nmembers.\n  After serving in France, Grossman's unit freed prisoners from a \nconcentration camp where only half of the prisoners were alive upon his \nunit's arrival.\n  Grossman returned to Montana, choosing to continue his life of \nservice as an educator at the University of Montana in Missoula.\n  For his bravery during World War II, Grossman was awarded the Silver \nStar, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart.\n  To Ray Grossman, and each of the 160,000 Allied troops that invaded \nthat 50-mile stretch of coastline, you truly are the ``greatest \ngeneration.''\n  Ray, we thank you for your dedication to our country and the ideals \nwe hold dear. May the memory of all who have served our country and who \ncurrently serve, and the events of that momentous day never be \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3663-9", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3663-S3664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BELGRADE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS\n\n Mr. WALSH. Madam President, I wish to recognize the efforts of \na remarkable group of high school students from my State of Montana.\n  The students volunteered at the Gallatin Valley Food Bank and then \ncame up with a plan to raise money for the organization. Together, \nthese students raised $2,000 for the food bank.\n  Hunger is something that affects far too many members of our \ncommunity. It is a testament to the initiative and commitment to \ncommunity that these young adults saw a need and then came up with a \nplan to raise money.\n  First, the students wrote and illustrated a children's book, ``One \nGarden at a Time,'' depicting people growing foods in their gardens to \nhelp ease the hunger of their neighbors. The book was printed and sent \nto every elementary school in the Belgrade School District.\n  Next, the students bought wheelbarrows that they dubbed \n``mealbarrows,'' had them decorated by local artists, and then used \nthem to\n\n[[Page S3664]]\n\ncollect food items. The subsequent auction of the wheelbarrows raised \nadditional money for the Gallatin Valley Food Bank.\n  Thanks to the efforts of the high school sophomores and juniors from \nBelgrade High School, they raised awareness and funds for the Gallatin \nValley Food Bank. These students also won $25,000 for the food bank \nthrough the Lead2Feed World Hunger Leadership Challenge.\n  I commend the students--John Burkenpas, Krista Callantine, Karlissa \nDagel, Kaitlin Haglun, Raquelle David, Albert Koenig, Ashley Koenig, \nCassie Meccage, Naomi Peterson, John Tatarka, and ag teacher Ashley \nNewell for their work.\n  It is because of exemplary young people like this group that we can \nhave faith in a bright future for Montana and for the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/12/senate-section/article/S3664-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:05 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4745.

A Senate concurrent resolution adopted by the \n     Legislature of the State of Missouri urging the United States \n     Congress and the President of the United States to \n     reauthorize the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program; to the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 31\n\n       Whereas, insurance protects the United States economy from \n     the adverse effects of the risks inherent in economic growth \n     and development while also providing the resources necessary \n     to rebuild physical and economic infrastructure, offer \n     indemnification for business disruption, and provide coverage \n     for medical and liability costs from injuries and loss of \n     life in the event of catastrophic losses to persons or \n     property; and\n       Whereas, the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, \n     produced injured losses larger than any natural or man-made \n     event in history, with claims paid by insurers to their \n     policyholders eventually totaling some $32.5 billion, making \n     this the second most costly insurance event in United States \n     history; and\n       Whereas, the sheer enormity of the terrorist induced loss, \n     combined with the possibility of future attacks, produced \n     financial shockwaves that shook insurance markets causing \n     insurers and reinsurers to exclude coverage arising from acts \n     of terrorism from virtually all commercial property and \n     liability policies; and\n       Whereas, the lack of terrorism risk insurance contributed \n     to a paralysis in the economy, especially in construction, \n     tourism, business travel, and real estate finance; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress originally passed the \n     Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107-297 (TRIA), \n     in which the federal government agreed to provide terrorism \n     reinsurance to insurers and reauthorized this arrangement via \n     the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005, Pub. L. \n     109-144, and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program \n     Reauthorization Act of 2007, Pub. L. 110-160 (TRIPRA); and\n       Whereas, under TRIPRA the federal government provides such \n     reinsurance after industry-wide losses attributable to annual \n     certified terrorism events exceed one hundred million \n     dollars; and\n       Whereas, coverage under TRIPRA is provided to an individual \n     insurer after the insurer has incurred losses related to \n     terrorism equal to twenty percent of the insurer's previous \n     year earned premium for property-casualty lines; and\n       Whereas, after an individual insurer has reached such a \n     threshold, the insurer pays fifteen percent of residual \n     losses and the federal government pays the remaining eighty-\n     five percent; and\n       Whereas, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program has an annual \n     cap of one hundred billion dollars of aggregate insured \n     losses, beyond which the federal program does not provide \n     coverage; and\n       Whereas, TRIPRA requires the federal government to recoup \n     one hundred percent of the benefits provided under the \n     program via policy holder surcharges to the extent the \n     aggregate insured losses are less than twenty-seven billion \n     five hundred million dollars and enables the government to \n     recoup expenditures beyond that mandatory recoupment amount; \n     and\n       Whereas, without question, TRIA and its successors are the \n     principal reason for the continued stability in the insurance \n     and reinsurance market for terrorism insurance to the benefit \n     of our overall economy; and\n       Whereas, the presence of a robust private/public \n     partnership has provided stability and predictability and has \n     allowed insurers to actively participate in the market in a \n     meaningful way; and\n       Whereas, without a program such as TRIPRA, many of our \n     citizens who want and need terrorism coverage to operate \n     their businesses all across the nation would be either unable \n     to get insurance or unable to afford the limited coverage \n     that would be available; and\n       Whereas, without federally provided reinsurance, property \n     and casualty insurers will face less availability of \n     terrorism reinsurance and will therefore be severely \n     restricted in their ability to provide sufficient coverage \n     for acts of terrorism to support our economy; and\n       Whereas, unfortunately, despite the hard work and \n     dedication of this nation's counter terrorism agencies and \n     the bravery of the men and women in uniform who fought and \n     continue to fight battles abroad to keep us safe here at \n     home, the threat from terrorist attacks in the United States \n     is both real and substantial and will remain as such for the \n     foreseeable future: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the members of the Missouri Senate, Ninety-\n     seventh General Assembly, Second Regular Session, the House \n     of Representatives concurring therein, hereby urge the United \n     States Congress and the President of the United States to \n     reauthorize the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Missouri Senate be \n     instructed to prepare properly inscribed copies of this \n     resolution for the President of United States, the President \n     Pro tempore of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and each member of \n     the Missouri Congressional delegation.\n       POM-251. A Senate joint resolution adopted by the \n     Legislature of the State of Alabama urging the Congress of \n     the United States to propose a federal balanced budget \n     amendment to the United States Constitution and applying to \n     the Congress, pursuant to Article V of the United States \n     Constitution, to call a convention for proposing a balanced \n     budget amendment; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                    Senate Joint Resolution No. 100\n\n       Whereas, the reluctance of the federal government to incur \n     debt and other obligations was established early in American \n     history, with deficits occurring only in relation to \n     extraordinary circumstances such as war; yet for much of the \n     20th century and into the 21st, the United States has \n     operated on a budget deficit, including the 2010 budget year, \n     which surpassed an astounding $1,300,000,000,000, an annual \n     deficit that exceeded the entire gross state product of many \n     of the states; and\n       Whereas, an exception to this pattern was at the turn of \n     the 21st century; in FY 2001, America enjoyed a $128 billion \n     budget surplus; and\n       Whereas, since FY 2001, America has been burdened with 10 \n     consecutive years of deficits, to-wit:\n       FY 2002: $158 billion deficit\n       FY 2003: $377 billion deficit\n       FY 2004: $413 billion deficit\n       FY 2005: $318 billion deficit\n       FY 2006: $248 billion deficit\n       FY 2007: $161 billion deficit\n       FY 2008: $459 billion deficit\n       FY 2009: $1.4 trillion deficit\n       FY 2010: $1.3 trillion deficit\n       FY 2011: $1.5 trillion deficit (estimated); and\n       Whereas, as of January 2011, America's accumulated national \n     debt exceeded $12 trillion now estimated at over $13 \n     trillion; and\n       Whereas, the Congressional Budget Office projects that, if \n     current trends continue under the White House's proposed \n     budget, each of the next 10 years has a projected deficit \n     exceeding $600 billion; and\n       Whereas, the budget deficits of the United States of \n     America are unsustainable and constitute a substantial threat \n     to the solvency of the federal government as evidenced by the \n     comments of Standard and Poor's on April 18, 2011, regarding \n     the longer term credit outlook for the United States; and\n       Whereas, Congress has been unwilling or unable to address \n     the persistent problem of overspending and has recently \n     increased the statutory limit on the public debt and enacted \n     a variety of legislation that will ultimately cause the \n     federal government to incur additional debt; and\n       Whereas, the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility \n     and Reform in its report The Moment of Truth includes \n     recommendations to reduce the federal deficit that have not \n     been considered by the United States Congress; and\n       Whereas, the consequences of current spending policies are \n     far-reaching; United States indebtedness to governments of \n     foreign nations continues to rise; costly federal programs \n     that are essentially unfunded or underfunded; mandates to \n     states threaten the ability of state and local governments to \n     continue to balance their budgets; moreover, future \n     generations of Americans inevitably face increased taxation \n     and a weakened economy as a direct result of the bloated \n     debt; and\n       Whereas, many states have previously requested that \n     Congress propose a constitutional amendment requiring a \n     balanced budget, but Congress has proven to be unresponsive; \n     anticipating situations in which Congress at times could fail \n     to act, the drafters of the United States Constitution had \n     the foresight to adopt the language in Article V that \n     establishes that on application of the Legislatures of two-\n     thirds of the several states, Congress shall call a \n     convention for proposing amendments; and\n       Whereas, in prior years the Alabama Legislature has called \n     on Congress to pass a Balanced Budget Constitutional \n     Amendment, many other states have done the same, all to no \n     avail; and\n       Whereas, a balanced budget amendment would require the \n     government not to spend more than it receives in revenue and \n     compel\n\n[[Page S3667]]\n\n     lawmakers to carefully consider choices about spending and \n     taxes; by encouraging spending control and discouraging \n     deficit spending, a balanced budget amendment will help put \n     the nation on the path to lasting prosperity: Now therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of Alabama, both Houses thereof \n     Concurring, That the Legislature of the State of Alabama \n     hereby respectfully urges the Congress of the United States \n     to propose and submit to the states for ratification a \n     federal balanced budget amendment to the United States \n     Constitution, and be it\n       Resolved, That, in the event that Congress does not submit \n     a balanced budget amendment to the states for ratification on \n     or before December 31, 2011, the Alabama Legislature hereby \n     makes application to the United States Congress to call a \n     convention under Article V of the United States Constitution \n     for the specific and exclusive purpose of proposing an \n     amendment to that Constitution requiring that, in the absence \n     of a national emergency (as determined by the positive vote \n     of such members of each house of Congress as the amendment \n     shall require), the total of all federal appropriations made \n     by Congress for any fiscal year not exceed the total of all \n     federal revenue for that fiscal year, and be it further\n       Resolved, That, unless rescinded by a succeeding \n     Legislature, this application by the Alabama Legislature \n     constitutes a continuing application in accordance with \n     Article V of the United States Constitution until at least \n     two-thirds of the Legislatures of the several states have \n     made application for a convention to provide for a balanced \n     budget, and be it further\n       Resolved, That, in the event that Congress does not submit \n     a balanced budget amendment to the states for ratification on \n     or before December 31, 2011, the Alabama Legislature hereby \n     requests that the legislatures of each of the several states \n     that compose the United States apply to Congress requesting \n     Congress to call a convention to propose such an amendment to \n     the United States Constitution, and be it further\n       Resolved, That this application is rescinded in the event \n     that a convention to propose amendments to the United States \n     Constitution includes purposes other than providing for a \n     balanced federal budget, and be it further\n       Resolved, That the copies of this resolution be provided to \n     the following officials:\n       1.

Burger, former Chief Justice of the \n     United States Supreme Court, Arthur J. Goldberg, former \n     Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and other leading \n     constitutional scholars agree that such a convention may \n     propose sweeping changes to the Constitution, any limitations \n     or restrictions to the contrary imposed by the states in \n     applying for such a convention notwithstanding, thereby \n     creating an imminent peril to the well-established rights of \n     the citizens and the duties of various levels of government; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States of America \n     has been amended many times in the history of this nation and \n     may be amended many more times, without the need to resort to \n     a constitutional convention, and has been interpreted for \n     more than 200 years and has been found to be a sound document \n     which protects the lives and liberties of the citizens; and\n       Whereas, there is no need for, and in fact, there is great \n     danger in, a new constitution or in opening the Constitution \n     to sweeping changes, the adoption of which would only create \n     legal chaos in this nation and only begin the process of \n     another two centuries of litigation over its meaning and \n     interpretation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the 1st Session of the 52nd Oklahoma Legislature:\n       Section 1. The Legislature does hereby rescind, repeal, \n     cancel, nullify and supersede to the same effect as if they \n     had never been passed, any and all extant applications by the \n     Legislature to the Congress of the United States of America \n     to call a convention to propose amendments to the \n     Constitution of the United States of America pursuant to the \n     terms of Article V thereof, regardless of when or by which \n     session or sessions of the Legislature such applications were \n     made and regardless of whether such applications were for a \n     limited convention to propose one or more amendments \n     regarding one or more specific subjects and purposes or for a \n     general convention to propose an unlimited number of \n     amendments upon an unlimited number of subjects.\n       Section 2. The Legislature urges the legislatures of each \n     and every state which has applied to Congress to call a \n     convention for either a general or a limited constitutional \n     convention to repeal and withdraw such applications.\n       Section 3. A copy of this resolution shall be distributed \n     to the Secretary of State, to the presiding officers of both \n     houses of the legislatures of each state in the Union, to the \n     President of the United States Senate, to the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, to all members of the \n     Oklahoma Congressional Delegation and to the Administrator of \n     the United States General Services Administration.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-254.
