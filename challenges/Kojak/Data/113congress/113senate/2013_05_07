Mr. President, I am sure my colleagues are familiar with \nthe old adage: Be careful what you wish for; you just might get it.\n  For 2 years my Republican colleagues have said they wish for a return \nto regular order. They asked for amendments, and they got amendments. \nThey asked for consideration of bills out of committees, and they have \ngotten that. They asked and then asked again for the Senate to pass a \nbudget resolution, even though we already had a budget law signed by \nPresident Obama. Well, they got what they wished; the dog finally \ncaught the car. But it turns out Republicans were more interested in \ndemagogy by calling for regular order than actually operating under \nregular order.\n  Although the Senate passed a budget resolution under regular order \nafter scores of amendments, scores of votes, the Republicans now refuse \nto allow us to go to conference with our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives. This is a new concept.\n  For centuries we have had regular order where if the House passes a \nbill and the Senate passes a bill, if they are different, we sit down, \ntalk and work out the differences. Not with this tea party-driven House \nand Senate. No, they talk about regular order, they talk a good game, \nbut when it comes to regular order they don't want it. They shy away \nfrom it. They say: No, we don't want regular order. We don't want \nsomething that has been done in this country for centuries.\n\n[[Page S3100]]\n\n  Why are they so afraid? Why are the Republicans so afraid?\n  We all know finding common ground isn't easy. They have a program \nwhere they are asking for $92 billion more in cuts in discretionary \nprograms than we are, such as the Head Start Program which allows tens \nof thousands of little boys and girls to get a head start; Meals on \nWheels, where millions of people have been eliminated from that \nprogram; medical research--a Senator I had a conversation with this \nmorning has a friend with a rare form of breast cancer. A program to \nhelp this woman cure this terrible disease has been eliminated where \nshe lives.\n\n  We know finding common ground will not be easy, but it should be \ndone. We should find common ground. We are not afraid to work a little \nharder to get this done. We are not afraid of transparency. Let's sit \ndown together and find out where each stands. We have done our work \nover here. Let's find out what the Republicans want to do.\n  We need to let the American people know where we stand. That is why \ntransparency is so important. Democrats and Republicans will never, \never find common ground if we never get to the negotiating table. So \nwhy don't my Republican colleagues want to go to conference? Last \nnight, a junior Senator from Texas said Republicans would agree to go \nto conference only if Democrats first would give in to their demands.\n  What were those demands? Well, they want more job-killing budget \ncuts. They want to make sure no millionaire is ever asked to contribute \nto the deficit reduction. That is what he asked: Before we go to \nconference, we want to make sure that happens.\n  He also said he wanted to make sure--remember this, we have been \nthere before. Maybe the junior Senator from Texas doesn't remember, but \nwe remember. We remember the government being on the verge of losing \nits ability to be part of the world community by not paying its debts.\n  Rightfully or wrongfully, this country accumulates debts. Raising the \ndebt ceiling doesn't do away with those debts; they are still there. We \nhave an obligation to pay the debts that are incurred by this country.\n  My friend, the junior Senator from Texas, said he wanted a guarantee, \nas a bargaining pawn, we would make sure the debt ceiling would not be \nraised--or words to that effect. We have been through that before. The \nPresident made it very clear: He will not negotiate on this country \npaying its bills.\n  Republicans refuse to go to conference unless Democrats give in to \npositions that were soundly rejected by the American people last \nNovember, soundly rejected on the Senate floor with the budget \nresolution we passed. In other words, Republicans refuse to play the \ngame unless we let them win.\n  The rules are set. We know what the rules are, so let's get down and \ngo forward with the rules. But they are not willing to do that. Like \nschoolyard bullies, if Republicans can't win, they will take the ball \nand go home. That is what we were told last night. This is a stunt, but \nit is a nonstarter.\n  What is the real reason Republicans are shying away from their \nconference? Speaker Boehner has said he would rather not subject his \nMembers to politically tough votes. Now, that is probably very \ntruthful. House Republicans are afraid of a backlash from a radical tea \nparty that controls what they do over there and has such significant \nsway in what happens over here. They are afraid of the backlash from \nthe radical tea party if they even discuss a compromise with us. Even \nif they agree to go to conference with us, they are afraid that will \nhurt them.\n  Partisan politics is no reason to shy away from bipartisan \nnegotiations. Republicans got what they asked for. They wanted regular \norder, and they have regular order.\n  Now it is time to embrace the regular order they said they wanted. It \nhas been going on here for centuries. That is what they want. They \nshould complete what they asked for. It is time to get away from a \nlast-minute fix and short-term solutions. It is time to engage in \nmeaningful negotiations and a responsible budget process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/07/senate-section/article/S3100-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

According to data just released by the Labor \nDepartment, retailers are going to be cutting hours at a rate unseen in \nmore than 30 years. Investor's Business Daily had this to say of the \ndecline:\n\n       [It] doesn't appear related to the economy, which has been \n     consistently mediocre. Instead, all evidence points to the \n     coming launch of ObamaCare, which the retail industry has \n     warned could cause just such a result.\n\n  So this is just the latest in a string of bad news related to the \nrollout of ObamaCare, just the latest reason the law needs to be \nrepealed. What is more, businesses are being forced to cut workers' \nhours at a time when so many Americans, nearly 8 million last month \naccording to Labor, have already been squeezed into part-time positions \nin which they would prefer not to be in the first place. Many of these \nare Americans who would probably much rather be working full time. Yet \nthanks to ObamaCare, many of them may be forced to work even less.\n  Actually, it gets worse. Labor also reported that total benefits for \nemployees in service operations actually declined last quarter. That is \nthe first such deterioration in more than a decade. Some speculate this \npiece of bad news could be attributed to ObamaCare as well.\n  All of this, bear in mind, is for a law, the full brunt of which \nhasn't even begun to come online yet. We are still many months away. \nYet stories like this seem to be piling up.\n  When it comes to the implementation of ObamaCare, I fear some of the \nworst hit are likely to be the small businesses and the Americans who \nwork for them. These are the hometown companies that struggled so \nmightily just to keep their doors open throughout the Obama economy, \nwhose owners sacrificed so much in order to keep their families fed and \ntheir employees on the payroll. These businesses struggled against \nfierce economic headwinds, and they actually survived.\n  Will they be able to survive the next assault headed their way, to \nabsorb the blows of ObamaCare, blows thrown at them by their own \ngovernment at a time when they are already so vulnerable? Well, if \nthings keep going as they are, it is hard to see how they will.\n  Just listen to this: Last week, a small business owner in the \nbarbecue restaurant business testified at a field hearing of the House \nEducation and the Workforce Committee. The owner of that company said \nit will cost his business up to $200,000 to implement the ObamaCare \nmandate, a $200,000 hit. What is that company's projected profit for \n2013? It is $240,000. Incredible, absolutely incredible.\n  It is not hard to see why the Democratic chairman of the Finance \nCommittee called this law a ``train wreck.'' It is not hard to see why \nso many Democrats are now airing their concerns about the law in \npublic. Frankly, I wish they had considered these consequences before, \nnot after passing a law. It is not like Republicans weren't warning \nabout all of this. It is not like independent experts across the \ncountry weren't saying almost the same thing we were saying, and it is \nnot like common sense wouldn't simply dictate much of these outcomes \neither.\n  I see that the President has decided to pivot once again to jobs. I \ncan't even count how many times he has done one of these pivots at this \npoint, so I will not try. But I presume he will jet off throughout the \ncountry to campaign-style rallies in order to bash Congress and claim \nthat none of this is his fault. In the same vein, we hear he is going \nto have an ObamaCare event this Friday. I would be willing to bet he is \nnot going to take responsibility there for ObamaCare's negative effects \non our economy either or on so many families and small businesses.\n\n  It is about time he did. He should use that event to do so because he \nneeds to be straight with the American people. He needs to prepare them \nfor everything that is coming their way--the wage cuts, the lost jobs, \nthe higher premiums, everything our country can expect as a result of \nObamaCare.\n  That small business owner I mentioned earlier also had this to say:\n\n       Major companies I am sure have legal advisors that will . . \n     . guide them through this\n\n[[Page S3101]]\n\n     legislation. Small businesses such as ours must obtain as \n     much available information as possible and do their best to \n     live by the letter of the law. Then because this act is \n     [complicated], hope and pray to not get penalized.\n\n  The law-abiding citizens of this country shouldn't have to pray for \nleniency from their own government. Last I checked, the government \nexisted to help the public, not to antagonize it.\n  After ramming the law through Congress the way he did, ignoring the \nwarnings all these things would happen, ignoring the will of the \nAmerican people, honesty and transparency is the very least President \nObama owes the American public at this point. What he needs to do, \nactually, is join with Republicans in agreeing to repeal this job-\nkilling law. He needs to acknowledge the need to scrap it and replace \nit with the types of commonsense reforms that will lower cost, because \nthis law is not working. I think he already knows that. Republicans \ncertainly know it. And more and more Democrats are coming around to \nthat realization too. So let's skip the scripted campaign events and \nactually work together to get something positive done for jobs, health \ncare, and our economy. If President Obama is willing to work with us, \nwe are here and ready to get to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/07/senate-section/article/S3101-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, following the leader's comments about \nthe health care law, I found it interesting this morning to pick up the \nNew York Times and see the headline above the fold, on the front page: \n``New Worries for Democrats on Health Law.'' In the very first \nsentence, it says:\n\n       Democrats are worried that major snags will be exploited by \n     Republicans in next year's mid term elections.\n\n  I would say Democrats ought to be worried about the fact there are \ngoing to be major problems with this health care law--a health care law \nthat was forced through the Senate, forced through the House, without \nlistening to the American people. That is the concern Democrats ought \nto have, because the American people's health is being jeopardized as a \nresult of the law we are now facing.\n  So I come to the floor today to talk a little about what we have \nlearned about the President's health care law over the last week--the \nweek we have been away traveling our States, visiting with people at \nhome. It has been all over the headlines and it is also on the minds of \nthe American people. It certainly was in Wyoming. As I talk to \ncolleagues from around the country, they have heard a lot about this as \nthey traveled their home States.\n  When we go back home to our States, a lot of Senators hear from their \nconstituents about how worried they are about how this specific law is \ngoing to affect their care, their jobs, and their paychecks. It is what \nI heard this last week, and it is no different than what I have heard \nweek after week after week.\n  I practiced medicine for 25 years, and I hear from patients who are \nworried about a new layer of Washington bureaucrats who are going to be \nsitting now between them and their doctor. I hear from families who are \nworried they won't be able to keep the insurance they have now, even \nthough the President promised them they would be able to keep the \ninsurance they have if they like it. I hear from employers who are \nworried they won't be able to afford all of the law's new requirements. \nThat is what people are telling me when I travel the State of Wyoming.\n  This is interesting. According to the newspaper ``The Hill,'' which \ncame out last week, Wednesday, May 1, I am not the only one. Here is \nthe headline on the front page of the paper recently: ``Botched \nObamaCare Tops Dem Fears for '14.''\n  Of course, that is a reference to the 2014 elections. The article \ntalks about how anxious a lot of Washington Democrats are about the law \nthey voted for. It talks about how, if the rest of the law's \nimplementation doesn't go well, voters are going to know exactly who to \nblame.\n  Democratic candidates across the country know about it. That is why \nwe see a Democratic candidate running today in this special \ncongressional election in South Carolina trying to distance herself \nfrom the health care law. How did she do it? Let's turn the tape back \nto last week's debate in a congressional race: Special election, South \nCarolina. Here is what she had to say.\n\n       Obamacare is extremely problematic, it is expensive, it is \n     a $500 billion higher cost than we originally anticipated, \n     it's cutting into Medicare benefits, and it's having \n     companies lay off their employees because they are worried \n     about the cost of it. That is extremely problematic.\n\n  That is a Democrat, running for Congress, who said that last week. \nThe election is today.\n  Another Democrat, the chairman of the Energy Committee, had this to \nsay.\n\n       There is a reason to be very concerned about what's going \n     to happen with young people. If their premiums shoot up, I \n     can tell you, that is going to wash into the United States \n     Senate in a hurry.\n\n  Well, I agree with the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee. So \nwhat are the prospects for implementation? Well, one of the key \narchitects of the law, another Democrat, says he sees ``a huge train \nwreck coming down.'' That is what Senator Baucus said, and I think he \nis right; we are headed for a train wreck. That is what concerns the \npeople I talk to--all those patients, the employers, the families I \nmentioned.\n  So what does the President have to say about this? Well, he was asked \nabout it the other day at a press conference. The President's answer \nwent on for more than 1,000 words, but it came down to one thing. He \nsaid:\n\n       For the 85 to 90 percent of Americans who already have \n     health insurance, this thing has already happened. They do \n     not have to worry about anything else.\n\n  Can that really be what the President thinks? He even repeated the \nidea a couple of times. He said 90 percent of Americans don't have to \nworry. I would say, with all due respect to the President, people are \nworried, and they have every right to worry. There are many parts of \nthis law that still have not ``already happened,'' in spite of what the \nPresident says. Those things are going to give the American people a \nlot more to worry about.\n  In fact, the Washington Post Fact Checker looked into what the \nPresident said--what the President claimed during his news conference. \nThe Fact Checker found the President ignored the fact--completely \nignored the fact--that 10 million people face the prospect of losing \ntheir current health care. The Fact Checker went on to cite a report \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office that said millions of people are \ngoing to be priced out of the insurance they have now--insurance that \nworks for them. That is because of all the expensive extras the new \ngovernment-approved insurance is going to have to cover, and which is \nalso government mandated.\n  The Post pointed out:\n\n       . . . even unions, which were big supporters of the law, \n     have grown wary because it may drive up costs for their \n     health-care plans.\n\n  Twenty million people are covered by those plans the unions are \nworried about. The Washington Post Fact Checker also cited $1 trillion \nin tax increases in the law, which is going to hurt a lot more people.\n  The Medicare Actuary predicts 15 percent of hospitals, skilled \nnursing facilities, and home health agencies could leave the Medicare \nProgram by 2019. These are our seniors. These are people who have \ncontinued to pay into the program. Yet we see these other groups saying \nwe have had enough. Why? Because of the cuts to the programs and the \npayments the President\n\n[[Page S3102]]\n\nis counting on under his health care plan. Health insurance costs are \ncontinuing to go up, and that affects a lot of people, even though \nPresident Obama says they have nothing to worry about.\n  A leading Democratic Member of the Senate was interviewed the other \nday on New York television--his home State--and he conceded the health \ncare law is contributing to those cost increases. But the President \nthinks it is nothing to worry about.\n  Here is how the New York Times last week summed up the President's \nattitude, under the headline: ``Health Care Law Is `Working Fine,' \nObama Says in Addressing Criticism.''\n  Working fine? Mr. President, tell that to the 22 million Americans \nwho can't find a job or who can't get the full-time work they want. \nTell that to the businesses that have to cut back their workers' hours. \nWhy? Because of the health care law. They have to do that because the \nlaw says companies with more than 50 full-time employees have to \nprovide this expensive one-size-fits-all health insurance. So we see \nsmall businesses have stopped hiring so they can stay below that number \nof employees. Other businesses are cutting full-time workers back to \npart-time status, and cutting their shifts to less than 30 hours a \nweek.\n  Look at the latest jobs report that came out last Friday. In April, \nthe number of people working part time because their hours have been \ncut back or because they can't find a full-time job across the country \nincreased by 278,000. The shift to more part-time workers also means \nthe average workweek is getting shorter. In April it dropped again. \nThat is not good for our economy and it is not good for the workers. \nThe statistics show we are going in the wrong direction.\n  The anecdotal evidence is even worse. Recently, the Regal movie \ntheater chain sent a memo to all its employees saying it would roll \nback shifts to keep nonsalaried workers below that 30-hour cutoff. The \ncompany explained it was forced to take this step ``to comply with the \nAffordable Care Act.''\n  We are going to see more and more of this as employers start to \nfigure out exactly how hard they are going to be hit by the expensive \nand burdensome health care law. Hiring during the past 4 years under \nPresident Obama has been weak, and it has also been concentrated in \nnonsalary fields such as retail.\n  We saw more of this in the latest jobs report. Nearly 1 out of every \n13 jobs is now in ``food services and drinking places.'' These are the \nkinds of places saying they are going to have to limit hiring and cut \nback shifts to less than 30 hours. Why? Because of the health care law; \notherwise, they could go bankrupt trying to pay for expensive \nWashington-mandated insurance--insurance much more than is actually \nneeded by their workers but insurance that is mandated by the law.\n  It is not just bars and restaurants. Let's look at the city of Long \nBeach in California. The Los Angeles Times reports the city of Long \nBeach is limiting most of its 1,600 part-time employees to less than 27 \nhours a week, on average. The city says if it doesn't cut the hours, \nthe new health benefits would cost up to $2 million more next year. The \nextra expense would trigger layoffs and cutbacks in city services.\n  It may be, in the end, that not every one of those 1,600 people will \nhave his or her hours cut. Some of the city employees are probably \nalready under the 30-hour limit. But for everyone else there is the \nuncertainty of whether their hours are going to be cut and when. The \nuncertainty is part of what is causing employers to hesitate or to cut \nnow because nobody knows how bad this train wreck will actually be.\n  That is just one of the negative side effects of the President's \nhealth care law, but it is having ripple effects throughout our entire \neconomy. We have seen wages continue to stagnate. We have seen awful \neconomic growth. The new numbers for the first quarter GDP growth came \nout a few days ago. They show the economy grew at an annual rate of \njust 2\\1/2\\ percent. It has been nearly 4 years since the recession \nended. We should have seen a much more robust economic recovery by now. \nThe economy can't grow until we can get Americans back to work. People \ncannot get back to work if there are not more jobs, and employers \ncannot create enough jobs because of the health care law.\n\n  Here is a third thing the President said. He said: ``Even if you do \neverything perfectly, there will still be glitches and bumps.''\n  These are not glitches. These are people's jobs. These are people's \nlives. This is the health care of the American people. For a lot of \nAmerican families, the President's health care law is not headed for a \ntrain wreck, it has already gone off the rails. They are not worried \nabout what the health care law is going to do to them, they are busy \nworrying about what the health care law has already done. They know \nthis law and the uncertainty it has created is an anchor on our \neconomy. Here is how the Chicago Tribune put it in an editorial the \nother day. They asked the question:\n\n       Glitches or a train wreck?\n\n  Then they said:\n\n       Bet on the wreck. We're hurtling toward this massive \n     restructuring of the health care insurance market, and no one \n     has confidence about what will happen. There will be massive \n     consequences, intended and unintended.\n\n  That is what the Chicago Tribune said.\n  The President says 90 percent of the American people have nothing to \nworry about from the health care law. He just doesn't get it. When I \nask groups that I meet with back in Wyoming, I hear nearly 100 percent \nof the people say they expect to pay more under the President's health \ncare law, and the care they get--they expect lower quality and less \navailable health care as a result of the law.\n  People are very concerned about what is going to happen, and they do \nnot think it is going to be good for them or for their families.\n  A new poll just came out from the Kaiser Family Foundation. It found \nthat only 35 percent of Americans have a favorable view of the \nPresident's health care law. It is less popular now than it was when it \nfirst passed. It has gone down, actually, 8 percentage points since \njust last November's election. More and more people are realizing what \nis in this law and how it will hurt them personally and they are not \nhappy about it. For the President to say otherwise is absurd. He is \neither not paying attention to what the American people are trying to \ntell him or he is intentionally misrepresenting the facts.\n  The health care law is headed for a train wreck. Saying it is going \nfine is just the President's Washington spin. The American people \ndeserve better than that. They deserve for the President to tell them \nthe truth. They deserve to hear from the President, to have him come \nclean on how much his health care law is costing and how much damage it \nis doing to our economy.\n  The American people deserve a vote in Congress to repeal this \ndisastrous law. Until this law is repealed, we are going to continue to \nsee weak economic growth and the American people are going to continue \nto pay the price.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/07/senate-section/article/S3102-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3102-S3104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE SEQUESTER\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, on March 19 of this year, the Minneapolis \nStar Tribune reported that Minnesota's tribal school districts were \nmaking plans to cut the school year short, increase class sizes, and \nlet staff vacancies go unfilled. The White Earth Reservation is \nplanning to consolidate its sixth, seventh, and eighth grades into a \nsingle class starting in the fall. This is happening because of the \nsequester.\n  On April 11, WDAZ, Channel 8 in Grand Forks, reported that special \neducation programs in my State of Minnesota were going to be hit by a \n$90 million cut. This is particularly painful in the Crookston, MN, \nschool district, where 20 percent of students benefit from special \neducation programming. This is happening because of the sequester.\n\n[[Page S3103]]\n\n  On April 17, Minnesota Public Radio reported that budget cuts were \naffecting our court system. Across the country, access to public \ndefenders, a constitutionally guaranteed right, is becoming more \ndifficult. This is happening because of the sequester.\n  It is not just happening in Minnesota, it is happening around the \ncountry. To take just two examples from the many I could cite from \nevery State in the Nation, on March 13, the AP reported that an Indiana \nHead Start program was forced to use a random drawing to determine \nwhich 36 children would be cut from their program. On March 31, the \nPortland Press Herald in Maine reported that a local Meals on Wheels \nprogram, which had never before turned away a senior in need, was now \nusing a waiting list and reducing the number of meals delivered to \nexisting participants.\n  Then, on April 25, the Senate passed a bill to allow the Department \nof Transportation to shift funds from one account to another, therefore \nexempting DOT from the strict across-the-board cuts mandated by the \nsequester. The funding shift was needed to prevent the furlough of air \ntraffic controllers, which was beginning to cause a significant \ninconvenience to American travelers and could have had harmful effects \non our economy. The House passed the bill the next day and it has now \nbeen enacted into law.\n  I am pleased American travelers were spared this inconvenience, but \nas the reports I just cited from Minnesota and from elsewhere would \nsuggest, there are a lot of people suffering needlessly because of the \nsequester.\n  A case-by-case approach is not the right way to handle the impacts of \nthe sequester. The sequester, in fact, was designed to affect every \ngovernment function equally, with just a few exceptions, and the \nextreme across-the-board nature of these cuts is the very definition of \na thoughtless approach to deficit reduction. The sequester was designed \nto be replaced and that is what we must do. Just as the sequester \naffects every government function equally, our response to the \nsequester should be complete and inclusive, not piecemeal. We must \nreplace the entire sequester with a mix of new revenues and smarter \ntargeted cuts that do not inflict needless pain on those who can least \nbear it and that do not harm our ongoing fragile economic recovery.\n  There are both moral and economic consequences of allowing the \nsequester to continue. As Hubert Humphrey said:\n\n       The moral test of government is how that Government treats \n     those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who \n     are in the twilight of life, the elderly; those who are in \n     the shadow of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped.\n\n  If we ignore the effects of sequester cuts on the voiceless and \naddress only the sequester cuts that are the most visible--in the form \nof longer lines at the airport, for example--we will have failed that \nmoral test.\n  In April I received a letter from a family service worker with Head \nStart from Onamia, MN. She wrote:\n\n       The families I work with have no idea what it means to have \n     trillions of dollars cut from the budget. They are trying \n     hard to keep $10 in their pockets or checkbook. . . . These \n     cuts would be particularly catastrophic to the poor children \n     and families we serve. . . . Congress and the Administration \n     need to act quickly to restore fiscal stability and maintain \n     funding for our at-risk children. Our nation's budget simply \n     cannot be balanced on the backs of poor children.\n\n  Here is a letter I received from a mother in Hoffman, a rural \ncommunity in West Central Minnesota. She wrote:\n\n       My heart was saddened today when I learned that due to a \n     sequester, my 4 year old daughter's Head Start program was to \n     end 2 weeks ahead of schedule, that 2 of her amazing teachers \n     will be looking for work come May 30th and her head teacher \n     will be having to take on a 2nd job to compensate for a pay \n     cut she took to continue with the program. Our Head Start \n     program is an amazing program. My daughter has benefited from \n     this program in ways a mother can only dream of and only a \n     classroom environment can provide. The fear that it maybe not \n     be there for her next year sickens me. We may not have the \n     numbers that are looked at when these kinds of decisions are \n     made, but our program is one of a kind with teachers that are \n     so special they deserve awards. My daughter wants them to \n     come to her birthday party. The people making these decisions \n     need to actually go to the class rooms, see what goes on. \n     Visit again and see the difference this program and these \n     women are making in these kids' lives. The decision makers \n     need to see what it is they are choosing to take away from \n     these young people. I will be writing a letter to all of my \n     local reps, and I'm committed to send them letters once a \n     week until my pleas are heard and our government stops taking \n     money and the education that comes with that from our rural \n     school!\n\n  That is a story from a mother based on her experience with her \ndaughter.\n  Economists agree and studies have demonstrated that high-quality \nearly education programs can produce anywhere from $7 to $16 in \nbenefits for every dollar of Federal investment. The return on \ninvestment comes from the long-term savings associated with a quality \nearly childhood education.\n  A child who has a quality early childhood education is less likely to \nbe in special education, less likely to be left back a grade, has \nbetter health outcomes, and girls are less likely to get pregnant \nbefore they graduate high school. They are more likely to graduate from \nhigh school, more likely to graduate from college, more likely to have \na better paying job, pay taxes on that job, and much less likely to go \nto prison.\n  If we care about the long-term sustainability of our debt, we should \nbe putting more money into quality early childhood education, not less, \nas we are doing because of the sequester.\n  Here is a letter from Columbia Heights, MN:\n\n       As someone who has worked with seniors my entire career and \n     now volunteers to deliver meals on wheels, I would encourage \n     your support of this program and discourage cuts. This \n     program is one that allows seniors and disabled adults to \n     remain in their home and still receive proper nutrition. For \n     many it is also the only contact they may have with someone \n     during any given day. While providing a service it is also a \n     means to check in on these individuals' well-being. By \n     eliminating or making significant cuts to this program we \n     would be turning our backs on many of our citizens.\n\n  I am sure every Member of the Senate has received similar letters--\nletters begging us to protect funding that assists poor children and \nthe elderly in their communities. It is not just Head Start and Meals \non Wheels which suffer as a result of the sequester, it affects so many \nother critical programs.\n  HUD estimates that sequester cuts could result in 100,000 formerly \nhomeless people, including veterans, being removed from their housing \nand shelter programs and putting them back at risk for homelessness. \nThe USDA estimated that it will result in 600,000 fewer participants in \nWIC, the nutrition program for mothers and their children.\n  Replacing the sequester is the right thing to do. The sequester is a \nperfect example of the moral test of government Hubert Humphrey talked \nabout, and replacing it is the only conceivable response to it we can \nhave as Americans. But apart from failing to protect our most \nvulnerable, the sequester cuts also do direct harm to our economy and \nprevent us from making the critical investments in education, \ninfrastructure, and innovation that have always been what has made \nAmerica great and prosperous.\n  As Secretary Arne Duncan wrote in a letter to Chairwoman Barbara \nMikulski about the effects of the sequester:\n\n       Education is the last place to be reducing our investment \n     as the nation continues to climb out of the recent recession \n     and to prepare all of its citizens to meet the challenges \n     created by global economic competitors in the 21st century. \n     Indeed, I can assure you that our economic competitors are \n     increasing, not decreasing, their investments in education, \n     and we can ill afford to fall behind as a consequence of \n     indiscriminate, across-the-board cuts that would be required \n     by sequestration.\n\n  Secretary Duncan goes on to explain that the sequester will create \nparticular hardships for recipients of Impact Aid, which includes \nschools that serve the Native American students and children of \nmilitary families.\n  In addition to investing in education, we should be building up and \nrepairing our Nation's infrastructure. Cuts to the Economic Development \nAdministration will hinder the ability to leverage private sector \nresources to support infrastructure projects that spur local job \ncreation--likely resulting in 1,000 fewer jobs created nationwide. The \nDepartment of Interior has warned that the sequester will delay high \npriority dam safety modifications.\n  Finally, America has always been at the cutting edge of global \ntechnologies, but the sequester may change that. Cuts to the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology will force\n\n[[Page S3104]]\n\nNIST to end its work on the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, which \nhelps small manufacturers innovate in their business practices and \ndevelop market growth at home and abroad.\n  The Department of Education is the operator of 10 world-class \nnational laboratories that specialize in developing advanced commercial \ntechnologies. DOE's Advanced Research Projects Agency, ARPA, has \nachieved several remarkable breakthroughs in recent years, such as \ndoubling the energy density of lithium batteries, increasing the \ncapacity of high-power transistors, engineering microbes that can turn \nhydrogen and carbon dioxide into transportation fuel. Sequester cuts \nare going to slow and curb our Nation's progress toward a 21st century \nenergy sector.\n  Not only does the sequester fail to invest in things that make \nAmerica great and make America grow, the sequester is also costing the \ngovernment more money for the same product in the long run. There are \ncertain weapon systems that DOD knows it needs and will purchase in the \nfuture; however, because of sequestration, they have canceled the \ncontract order for the time being. As a result, the manufacturer has \nshut down that production line and possibly terminated jobs. Restarting \nthat process is expensive, and those costs are ultimately passed on to \nus, the government--the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues to rethink the current strategy of addressing \nthe sequester crisis by crisis and whatever is on the front page of the \nnews. It ultimately is not equitable. It disadvantages our Nation's \nmost vulnerable and it is harming our economy.\n  In February, CBO's Doug Elmendorf testified that the effects of \nsequestration would reduce employment by 750,000 jobs this year. That \nis the opposite direction we need our job numbers to go during our \neconomic recovery. I have not even been able to touch on the risk the \ndefense sequester poses to our military readiness in my remarks here \ntoday.\n  The bottom line is we need to address every facet of the sequester \ntogether with a mix of new revenues and smarter targeted cuts. We \nshould meet every new, high-visible consequence of the sequester with \nthe same response. It is more evidence that we need to replace the \nentire sequester.\n  Democrats have put forward a plan to address the most immediate \nconsequences of the sequester with a mix of new revenues and targeted \ncuts to replace the first year of sequestration, and it garnered a \nmajority in the Senate. But because a majority is not enough to pass \nlegislation in today's Senate when the minority chooses to obstruct, \nthat plan failed to pass.\n  What we have passed in the Senate is a budget that proposes to \nreplace the entire sequester in a balanced way that would also spare \nthe most vulnerable pain and protect our economic recovery and our \neconomic future. That is the kind of approach we need to take.\n  I hope in the days ahead we can begin a dialogue about fixing this \nproblem so kids in Minnesota, Indiana, and in the Presiding Officer's \nState of Hawaii--kids all around the country--can return to Head Start. \nWe need to help the senior citizens in Maine so they can get off the \nMeals on Wheels waiting list. We address this issue so that Minnesota's \ntribal school districts can finish out the school year as scheduled.\n  When we hear about the next highly visible problem the sequester has \ncaused, we should think about all the problems the sequester has \ncaused, and that is what I will be doing. We need to fix the problem in \na comprehensive and balanced way.\n  I stand ready to work with my colleagues and achieve that \ncomprehensive and balanced fix for the sequester.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of David Medine, of Maryland, to \nbe Chairman and Member of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight \nBoard.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 1 hour for debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I oppose the nomination of David Medine \nto be the Chairman of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, \nwhich is commonly referred to as the PCLOB.\n  Mr. Medine was nominated for this position during last Congress and \nthe Judiciary Committee, where I serve as the ranking member, held a \nhearing on his nomination in April 2012.\n  At the hearing, I asked a number of questions about the various \nnational security statutes that the Board is tasked with overseeing. \nThis included questions about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nand the PATRIOT Act.\n  Specifically, I asked for his views on these laws. Unfortunately, the \nresponses I received failed to provide his views. He simply stated that \nhe would balance the views of the government against the Board's \nmandate to review privacy.\n  I also asked Mr. Medine about his views on the use of law enforcement \nversus military authorities for combatting terrorism.\n  I was disappointed that he failed to answer a basic yes-or-no \nquestion about national security law: ``Do you believe that we are \nengaged in a war on terrorism?''\n  Instead, of a simple yes or no, he opted for a more limited answer \nthat military power is permissible in appropriate cases.\n  This technical answer gives me pause especially in light of the \ncontinued threat we face from international terrorist organizations.\n  Perhaps the most concerning response he provided was to another \nsimple constitutional law question. I asked all the Board nominees an \nimportant question about the use of profiling based upon country of \norigin for immigration purposes.\n  The Constitution provides broad discretion to the government for \npurposes of immigration. Each year the government places quotas or caps \non how many and what types of visas are allowed for each particular \ncountry.\n  For example, if we face a threat from an unfriendly nation, it is \nimportant that we have the ability to limit immigration from that \ncountry. At the least, immigration and customs agents and consular \nofficers should be able to make decisions of admissibility solely on \ncountry of origin.\n  I asked this same question to the other four current members of the \nBoard--two Democrats and two Republicans. They all answered the same \nway, that foreign nationals do not have the same constitutional or \nstatutory rights as citizens and therefore U.S. officials should be \nable to use this as a factor in admissibility determinations.\n  In contrast to the other four nominees, Mr. Medine argued that use of \ncountry of origin as the sole purpose was ``inappropriate.''\n  Specifically, Mr. Medine noted that it would be ``inappropriate'' for \nthe Federal Government to profile foreign nationals from high-risk \ncountries based solely upon the country of origin. This is troubling.\n  As the other four nominees noted, foreign nationals do not have the \nsame constitutional or statutory rights as U.S. persons and the \ngovernment may, lawfully and appropriately, use country of origin as a \nlimiting factor for purposes of admission to the United States.\n  I think this is especially concerning given the recent attacks in \nBoston and the concerns surrounding potential holes in our immigration \nsystem related to student visa overstays.\n\n[[Page S3105]]\n\n  What if our government learns of a terrorist plot undertaken by \nindividuals from a specific country. Under the view advocated by Mr. \nMedine, excluding all individuals from that nation, even for a defined \nperiod of time, would be ``inappropriate.''\n  Instead, under his view, even faced with this threat, it would only \njustify ``heightened scrutiny of visitors from that country'' when the \nindividual was ``linked to other information about the plot.'' This is \na dangerous view of our government's authority to control admission \ninto the country.\n  Terrorism is fresh on everyone's mind following the recent attacks in \nBoston, but the need to remain vigilant against a terrorist threat \nshould not rise and fall based upon our proximity to an attack.\n  The terrorist attacks on 9/11 changed the way the government viewed \nterrorism and those who want to kill Americans.\n  We are now nearly 12 years released from 9/11. Some may believe that \nwe now have the means in place for restricting admission based only \nupon specific intelligence of a plot. But that view is the type of \nthinking that allows us to let down our guard.\n  Those who seek to kill Americans are not letting down their guard and \nare always looking for ways to attack Americans and our way of life.\n  We can see this with the new tactics that they use, such as the \nfailed underwear bombing, the attempted Times Square bombing, and the \nrecent attacks in Boston.\n  It is through this lens that I view Mr. Medine's answer and why I \noppose his nomination to a board overseeing critical national security \nlaws.\n  While I agree we should always work to ensure that intelligence \ninformation is utilized in a manner most likely to achieve the desired \nresult, there are scenarios where we may need to block entry to all \nmembers of a certain country.\n  For example, would Mr. Medine's view apply to wartime situations?\n  Would we have to admit those whose country was at war with the U.S.?\n  I think his answers point to a dangerous worldview that is out of \ntouch with the threat we face from global terrorist organizations that \nseek to kill Americans.\n  It is thinking that deviates from basic constitutional principles our \ngovernment was founded on; namely, the ability to protect our citizens \nby limiting entry into the country.\n  This is a very serious matter given the Board's oversight of national \nsecurity law.\n  Given these concerns, I joined my colleagues in opposing Mr. Medine's \nnomination when the Judiciary Committee voted on him in February. That \nparty-line vote mirrored the same party-line vote from the previous \nCongress--even though the committee now has different members.\n  Above all, I fear that a nomination that is as polarizing as this \ncould cloud the legitimate work of the Board.\n  This Board is tasked with reviewing some of the most sensitive \nnational security matters we face.\n  If the Board issues a partisan decision, led by Mr. Medine, it will \nbe discredited because of these controversial fundamental beliefs Mr. \nMedine holds.\n  These national security issues are already polarizing--just look to \nany debate in Congress on FISA or the PATRIOT Act. Adding partisan \nfueled reports to the fire would only exacerbate these difficult \nmatters.\n  Given these concerns, I oppose Mr. Medine's nomination and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same. A vote against this nominee is a vote to \npreserve the legitimate tools to help keep America safe.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Prevention and Public Health Fund\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I was deeply disturbed several weeks ago \nto learn of the White House's plan to strip $332 million in critical \nfunding from the Prevention and Public Health Fund and to redirect that \nmoney to educating the public about the new health insurance \nmarketplaces and other aspects of implementing the Affordable Care Act.\n  No one is more interested in ensuring the successful implementation \nof the health insurance exchanges than I am. I chair that committee. I \nwas working with both Senator Kennedy and Senator Dodd in formulating \nthese aspects of the Affordable Care Act. But it is ill-advised and \nshortsighted to raid the prevention fund, which is making absolutely \ncritical investments in preventing disease, saving lives, and keeping \nwomen and their families healthy.\n  Last year they took $5 billion from the prevention fund. I will get \nto that in a moment. So, again, in their raiding of this prevention \nfund, not only is it a case of misplaced priorities, it is frankly an \noutrageous attack on an investment fund that is saving lives by \nadvancing wellness and prevention initiatives in communities all across \nAmerica.\n  A major purpose of the Affordable Care Act is to begin to transform \nour current sick care system into a genuine health care system, one \nthat is focused on saving lives through a greater emphasis on wellness, \nprevention, and public health. I have been saying for 20 years or more \nthat we do not have a health care system in America, we have a sick \ncare system.\n  When you think about it, if you get sick, you can get pretty good \ncare in America. We have the best surgeons and best cancer clinics. If \nyou are sick, there is probably no better place in the world to be than \nin America to get cured. But what we are lousy at is keeping you \nhealthy in the first place and preventing illness, preventing diseases, \npreventing chronic conditions.\n  Every expert acknowledges that we will never reduce health care costs \nor have a healthier and more productive society until we have a major \nfocus on prevention. However, I have no choice but to conclude that \nwhen it comes to prevention and wellness, some people in this \nadministration just do not get it.\n  The prevention fund already has been a giant step forward for public \nhealth in our Nation. Typically, prevention and public health \ninitiatives have in the past always been an afterthought. This means \nthat important community-based interventions often go unsupported. The \nprevention fund, as part of the Affordable Care Act, is making it \npossible for us to make national investments in evidence-based programs \nthat promote physical activity, improve nutrition, and reduce tobacco \nuse.\n  This is not the time to mention all of the many ways this fund is \nalready making Americans healthier. I want to mention several \nrepresentative investments that are happening right now.\n  The prevention fund is already investing $226 million to reduce \nchronic diseases, including diabetes and heart disease. Heart disease \ndisproportionately affects women. In fact, it is the No. 1 cause of \ndeath for women in this country. Some 42 million women in America are \ncurrently living with some form of heart disease.\n  The World Health Organization estimates that a staggering 80 percent \nof heart disease, diabetes, and stroke could be prevented as a result \nof changes in smoking, nutrition, and physical activity alone.\n  Moreover, this investment by the prevention fund is not only saving \nlives, it is also saving money. Right now, heart disease costs our \nNation about $440 billion a year--$440 billion a year in health care \ncosts from heart disease alone.\n  Cigarette smoking kills an estimated 173,000 women a year. If current \nsmoking rates persist, more than 6 million kids living in the United \nStates today will ultimately die from smoking.\n  This year the fund is supporting a second round of the highly \nsuccessful media campaign called ``Tips From a Former Smoker.'' It is \nestimated that last year's campaign will save $70 million annually \nbased on just the smokers who successfully quit in reaction to this 12-\nweek ad campaign. These ads are extremely powerful and effective. \nWithin 2 days of the first ad appearing last year, the number of calls \nto our quit lines tripled. So mark my words, these ads are going to \nsave lives. In fact, the second phase of this ad campaign is expected \nto inspire half a million quit attempts and to help at least 50,000 \nAmericans quit smoking forever.\n\n[[Page S3106]]\n\nNow, that is the $93 million for the anti-tobacco education and support \ncampaign. As I pointed out, over 6 million kids--if we do not do \nsomething about it, 6 million kids today in America will die from \nsmoking.\n  Let's talk about the immunization program. The prevention fund is \ninvesting in immunization programs that protect kids and save billions \nof dollars in downstream costs. For every dollar spent on childhood \nimmunizations, Americans save $16 by avoiding the costs of treating \npreventable diseases. Furthermore, by ensuring that all adults get \nrecommended routine vaccines, we can prevent 40,000 to 50,000 deaths \nannually. So the $82 million that was cut for immunizations in the \nprevention fund by the action by the White House could have saved our \nNation up to $1.3 billion in unnecessary health care costs. Again, this \nis the very definition of penny wise and pound foolish budgeting.\n  Investments from the prevention fund are not just at the national \nlevel, they are also at the community level. The fund is helping \nStates, cities, and towns to implement evidence-based programs that \nmeet their particular local needs.\n  For example, the State of Illinois has made improvements to its \nsidewalks and has marked crossings in order to increase levels of \nstudent physical activity for students going to school. Because of \nthese improvements, the number of students who are walking to school \nhas doubled. Not only is this good for their health, it is expected to \nsave the school system about $67,000 a year on bus costs.\n  In Florida, the school board of Miami Dade County will soon implement \nthe Play, Eat, Succeed project in order to reduce the prevalence of \nchildhood obesity among students with disabilities and children in the \nHead Start Program. The project will focus on improving nutritional \nhabits, increasing physical activity levels, and achieving a healthy \nweight.\n  In California, the Los Angeles County Department of Health has worked \nwith more than 100 clinical teams to provide accessible clinical \npreventive services to control high blood pressure and cholesterol, \nreaching approximately 200,000 adults just in Los Angeles County alone.\n  In my State of Iowa, the Black Hawk County Board of Health is working \nwith the local agency on aging to implement the Better Choices, Better \nHealth Program. This initiative is designed to help individuals who are \nliving with chronic conditions to find practical ways to self-manage \npain, fatigue, and to make healthier nutrition and exercise choices, to \nset realistic goals, to understand treatment options and communicate \nwith family and health care providers about their condition.\n  I mention all of these to show that the prevention fund is not just \ntop-down from Washington; we are trying to encourage communities, \ncities, towns, counties, and, yes, some States to do work on their own, \nto come up with innovative ideas on how to encourage people to live \nhealthier lives, to prevent smoking, to, for instance, get more kids to \nwalk to school. And this is a big problem. A lot of kids in America can \nwalk to school, but they do not have sidewalks, they do not have safe \npassages to school, so they take a bus. Simple things like that are \ndone at the local level with the prevention fund, and when local levels \nexperiment and do things like this and they find that they work, then \nother people adopt it. To me, this is one of the key elements of the \nprevention fund. It is sort of letting a thousand flowers bloom, \ngetting more ideas out there from people at the local level on what \nthey can do, how they can buy into this.\n  What can they do, and how can they buy into this to have a good \nprevention and wellness program on the local level?\n  Let's look at the return on investment. We always wonder about the \nreturn on investment for the kind of money we spend in government. The \nprevention fund all across America is investing in proven locally \ndeveloped programs, as I mentioned, that promote health and wellness, \nand they save lives. Not only is this improving our health outcomes but \nit will save us money.\n  According to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, the National Diabetes Prevention Program to prevent or \ndelay nearly 885,000 cases of type 2 diabetes would save our health \nsystem about $5.7 billion over the next 25 years. The National Diabetes \nPrevention Program is a public-private partnership of health \norganizations that work together to prevent type 2 diabetes to life \nstyle change programs right in our home communities. Given that in 2007 \ndiabetes alone accounted for about $116 billion in direct medical \ncosts, it is all the more critical that we continue to invest in proven \nprograms such as this.\n  I want to point out that for these investments, for every dollar we \nput in a childhood immunization series, it has been proven we saved \n$16.50. Yet if I am not mistaken, the White House is taking about $85 \nmillion out of this fund--penny wise and pound foolish.\n  Tobacco control programs: For every $1 we invest, we are saving $5. \nChronic disease prevention: For every $1 we spend, we save $5.60. For \nworkplace wellness programs: $3.27 for every $1 we spend. Any way you \nlook at it, in all of these programs, just the return alone--not \nmentioning the productivity of people who are healthier, who don't \nsmoke, who don't have chronic illnesses--their productivity is much \nhigher than those who have chronic illnesses.\n  The list goes on and on. The Trust for America's Health released a \nstudy showing that a 5-percent reduction in the obesity rate could \nyield more than $600 billion in savings on health care costs over 20 \nyears. Again, this is from the Trust for America's Health. A 5-percent \nreduction in the obesity rate, 5 percent only, could yield more than \n$600 billion in savings on health care costs over 20 years.\n  Studies such as this confirm what common sense tells us. Your mother \nwas right; prevention is the best medicine for our bodies and for our \nbudgets alike. That is why nearly 800 organizations have spoken against \nmisguided efforts to slash or eliminate the prevention fund.\n  Despite ill-advised efforts to cut or eliminate the prevention fund, \nmost Americans understand what is at stake. Prior to creation of the \nprevention fund, for every dollar spent on health care, 75 cents went \nto treating patients with chronic diseases, while only 4 cents was \nspent on efforts to prevent those diseases. Again, before the \nAffordable Care Act, 75 cents of every health care dollar was spent on \ntreating you after you got sick. Only 4 cents was spent on preventing \nthose diseases.\n  This chronic underinvestment has had devastating consequences. Nearly \nhalf of American adults have at least one chronic condition. Two-thirds \nof the increase in health care spending between 1987 and 2000 was due \nto increased prevalence of chronic diseases.\n  We had a briefing from three highly acclaimed medical practitioners 2 \nor 3 weeks ago, and they pointed out that two-thirds of the money we \nspend in Medicare goes for treating chronic illnesses--two-thirds.\n  When we talk about the money we are spending on Medicare and how do \nwe control Medicare costs, some people say we have got to make it \ntougher for people to get Medicare or you have got to cut down on \nMedicare, when the answer is staring us right straight in the face: \nprevention and wellness programs. For elderly people who do have a \nchronic condition, there are interventions that will save us money and \nmake their lives better through prevention and wellness programs. We \nknow that. There are evidence-based programs which are proven to work.\n  The prevention fund gives us an unprecedented opportunity to bend the \ncost curve by jumpstarting the transformation of America into a true \nwellness society, a society that focuses on preventing disease, saving \nlives and saving money.\n  As I said, the fund is doing both; it is saving lives and saving \nmoney. To slash this fund as the White House intends to do is bad \npublic policy and bad priorities. To take money from the prevention \nfund is to cannibalize the Affordable Care Act in ways that will both \ncost us money and lives. I think it is a violation of both the letter \nand the spirit of this landmark law. Again, one more time, we know \nprevention saves lives.\n  Cancer deaths: About 567,000 people die from cancer annually in the \nUnited\n\n[[Page S3107]]\n\nStates. Fifty percent of those are preventable and much cheaper than \nall the long-term care costs, not to mention the devastation that \nhappens in families' lives when a parent is lost to cancer.\n  Preventable diseases, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke: About \n796,000 people die from heart disease, diabetes, and stroke annually in \nthe United States. Eighty percent of those are preventable. Yet we are \ngoing to cut money from the prevention fund? It doesn't make sense.\n  Prior to the Senate adjourning for this last recess, I put a hold on \nMs. Marilyn Tavenner's nomination to serve as the Administrator for the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Ms. Tavenner, in her role \nas Acting Administrator, signed a directive in March that channeled \ncritical funds away from prevention. I must say, as the chairman of the \ncommittee, and as the author of the prevention fund in the Affordable \nCare Act, I was never notified until the decision had been made. I was \nnot consulted. No one was. It was just sort of signed away.\n  Again, I want to make it very clear the hold I put on Ms. Tavenner \nwas not a secret hold. In fact, I don't believe in secret holds. Too \noften people put on secret holds and you don't know who is doing it. I \nwould never do that. I issued my hold publicly. Why? In order to \nheighten public awareness of this administration's ill-advised policy \ndecision to cut prevention money and hopefully to get the White House \nto start to reconsider. I wanted to give people in the White House the \nchance to understand that their assault on the prevention fund is \nshortsighted, destructive, and perhaps suggests other sources of \nfunding for implementing and overseeing the marketplace.\n  Last year the administration, as I said, approved a $5 billion--and I \nam correct here--a $5 billion cut to the fund as part of the middle-\nclass tax bill. That was last year. I thought after that we had an \nagreement that was not going to happen again, the clearer cut \nagreement.\n  Now the administration has made it clear they intend to move forward \nwith even more cuts--$332 million this year--to the prevention fund. \nWhat we are seeing from the administration is, at best, mixed signals \nand, at worst, a betrayal of the letter and spirit of the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  I repeat, these are bad policy choices. This choice to take money out \nof the prevention fund will have negative serious consequences for the \nfuture health of the American people.\n  Again, I don't know and I am unsure as to who is giving advice to the \nPresident, but I want to say to President Obama, I think you are \ngetting bad advice, bad advice on where the money is coming from and \nhow it is affecting the prevention fund, and there are other sources of \nfunding for the marketplace other than the prevention fund.\n  I want to make it clear I don't want to interfere with the important \nwork of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. I also happen \nto believe Ms. Tavenner is very well qualified and strongly qualified \nto be the next Administrator. I believe it is urgent to have an \neffective leader at the helm of CMS as we enter a critical stage in \nimplementing the Affordable Care Act.\n  Accordingly, I am removing my hold on her nomination. However, as I \ndo so, I repeat, it is deeply disappointing and disturbing that the \nWhite House once again is raiding the Prevention and Public Health \nFund.\n  I would hope Ms. Tavenner, in her future role as the head of the CMS, \nwill understand that while she works for the President, advice and \nconsent of the U.S. Senate might be something worth considering in her \nfuture actions. I hope and expect again that the White House will \nrespect the intent of Congress in creating the prevention fund, not as \nan afterthought but as a critical feature of the Affordable Care Act--\nevery bit as critical as the exchanges, the marketplace, and everything \nelse.\n  I hope the administration will join us in fighting for the prevention \nfund and in making smart, evidence-based investments in prevention and \nwellness. This is what real health reform is about. It is not about how \nyou pay the bills. If all we are going to do in the Affordable Care Act \nis jiggle around on how we pay the bills, we are sunk. Real health \nreform is about changing our society away from a sick-care system to a \ntrue health care system, keeping people healthy, promoting wellness, \nhaving prevention programs at every level of society, in our schools, \nin our workplaces, and in our communities from the earliest moments of \nlife, immunization programs. This is for those who are elderly, who may \nhave a chronic condition but who can control that, at less cost and \nwith healthier lives through good prevention and wellness programs. \nThat is what true health reform is about, and it is our best bet for \ncreating a healthier and more prosperous Nation. To that important end, \nthe Congress and the White House should not be working at cross \npurposes. We should be working together. I say we must rededicate \nourselves to the great goal of creating a reformed health care system \nthat has a major focus on prevention and wellness, not just for a few \nbut for all Americans. That is what the intention was of the Prevention \nand Public Health Fund.\n  As I say again, and I say very clearly, I don't know who is advising \nthe President, but I think the President is getting bad advice. I \nunderstand the President has a lot on his plate, everything from Syria \nto Afghanistan--a lot. I understand that.\n  I hope that those in the White House who are advising the President \nwould take a closer look and find some way of replenishing that $332 \nmillion and hopefully making some ironclad agreements that they are not \ngoing to raid the fund again next year.\n  I thought we had an agreement that last year was it, that $5 billion \nwas it. I thought we had that agreement. I was operating under that \nassumption. Will we take more money out of the prevention fund again \nnext year too to meet some exigency that may come up? That is what has \nbeen wrong with our sick-care system in the past. We are so focused on \npaying today's bills we don't focus on the future and how to keep \npeople healthy. We just pay today's bills, keep paying the bills and \npaying the bills. Like clueless dodos, we wonder why health care costs \nare skyrocketing. It is because we don't focus on keeping people \nhealthy in the first place.\n\n  So I will remove my hold on Ms. Tavenner, but I hope the \nadministration will find a way to replenish that $332 million this year \nand make a firm commitment to not raiding this fund in the future.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad the Senate is finally confirming \nDavid Medine as Chairman of the bipartisan Privacy and Civil Liberties \nOversight Board, PCLOB. The confirmation of this nominee is a \nsignificant victory for all Americans who care about safeguarding our \nprivacy rights and civil liberties. The American people now have a \nPrivacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board that is at full strength. \nThis Board should help ensure that we honor our fundamental values as \nwe implement a strategy to keep our Nation safe. Today's victory is \nalso a reminder of the challenges we face, and the commitment we must \nkeep, to protect personal privacy as new technologies emerge. Last \nmonth, the Judiciary Committee unanimously reported bipartisan \nlegislation that Senator Lee and I authored to update the Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act. I hope that the Senate will promptly \nconsider and pass this good privacy bill, as well.\n  The Judiciary Committee favorably reported this nomination last May \nalong with a bipartisan group of nominees to serve as members of the \nBoard. This nomination should not have taken a year to be considered \nand confirmed by the Senate. The Senate finally confirmed all of the \nother individuals, those nominated to serve as members of the Board, \nlast August. Republican Senators refused to vote on the chairman's \nnomination. This was a needless delay and prevented the Board from \nfunctioning at full strength. This is reminiscent of how they have \nobstructed this President's nominees to the National Labor Relations \nBoard and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as so many \nof his judicial nominees. Now, after a year of obstruction, the Senate \nwill finally vote on the nomination, and the Privacy and Civil \nLiberties Oversight Board we in Congress worked so hard to establish \nwill finally be able to begin to carry out its important work on behalf \nof the American people.\n  The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board is a guardian of \nAmericans'\n\n[[Page S3108]]\n\nprivacy rights and civil liberties as well as an essential part of our \nnational security strategy. When we worked to create this Board in the \nwake of the Nation's response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, \n2001, we did so to ensure that our fundamental rights and liberties \nwould be preserved as government takes steps to better secure our \nNation. In the digital age, we must do more to protect our Nation from \ncyber attacks. But we must do so in a way that protects privacy and \nrespects our fundamental freedoms.\n  Protecting national security and protecting Americans' fundamental \nrights are not in conflict. We can--and must--do both. The Privacy and \nCivil Liberties Oversight Board should help ensure that we do now that \nthe Senate has finally been allowed to act on the nomination of \nChairman Medine.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof David Medine, of Maryland, to be Chairman and Member of the Privacy \nand Civil Liberties Oversight Board?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

CON. RES. 25\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I just wish to talk for a moment. I \nhave heard a lot from my constituents that they are very tired of the \ndysfunction in Washington, DC. They are tired of political gridlock \nthat impacts their businesses, their children's schools, and their \npaychecks. After spending last week with families and businesses that \nare impacted by sequestration in my home State of Washington, I know \nthis is especially true right now.\n  When I became chair of the Senate Budget Committee, I said I hoped \nDemocrats and Republicans would be able to work together to end the \ncycle of governing from crisis to crisis and the attempts to negotiate \nbudget policy through brinkmanship, which we have seen far too much of \nin recent years.\n  I believe this goal is just as important today--and is, in fact, more \nattainable--but we need Republicans to meet us at the table and proceed \nto conference under regular order.\n\n  We are at a unique moment in our debate about the country's fiscal \nand economic challenges. Following the 2 years that the bipartisan \nBudget Control Act took the place of a congressional budget, the Senate \nreturned to regular order this year and we passed a budget resolution. \nThe House has also passed their budget, and the President weighed in \nwith a proposal for his path going forward.\n  We now have an opportunity to move through regular order to try to \nget a bipartisan budget agreement, and we should seize it.\n  Democrats and Republicans have different perspectives on a wide \nvariety of issues. But just a few months ago, it seemed that Democrats \nand Republicans did agree on at least one thing: the budget debate \nshould proceed through regular order.\n  Democrats chose to move forward with a budget resolution through \ncommittee and said that an open process through regular order was the \nbest way to reach a bipartisan agreement. And Republicans agreed. They \nsaid once the Senate and the House passed budgets ``the work of \nconferencing must begin.'' They said a conference was--and I quote--the \n``best vehicle'' for the budget debate ``because we're doing it in \nplain sight.'' They said we needed the open public debate that regular \norder requires.\n  In fact, Senator McConnell said Senate Democrats should ``return to \nregular order and transparency in the legislative process.'' The Obama \nadministration has also said regular order is the way to proceed. But \nSenate Republicans have now blocked our efforts to move to conference, \nnot once but twice.\n  Some Republicans said they want to negotiate a ``framework'' behind \nclosed doors before going to conference. But that is what a budget is; \nit is a framework that lays out our values and our priorities and helps \nus plan for the country's future. I think that framework is exactly \nwhat we ought to be debating in a formal and public conference, and \nthere is no reason to wait.\n  Now, I know this is not going to be easy. There are vast differences \nbetween the Senate and House budgets and the visions we each present. \nBut I believe we will be most effective at resolving these differences \nif we have time for open debate and discussion and opportunities to \nidentify common ground.\n  Waiting until the last minute is not a good option. The uncertainty \nthat is caused in the lead-up to every manufactured crisis over the \npast 2 years has hurt our businesses, it has hurt our economy, and it \nis threatening our fragile economic recovery. It keeps us from planning \nand investing in our future, and it makes Americans question whether \ntheir government is capable of solving any problems that confront us.\n  I know--and we all know--there are extreme elements in our political \nsystem that think ``compromise'' is a dirty word. I know some \nRepublicans think they do not have the political space to make a \nbipartisan deal until the very last minute of a crisis. But I believe \nmany of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle want to return to \nregular order and move us away from the constant crises.\n  I am hoping the voices of reason win because American families and \nour businesses expect us to do better than running down the clock.\n  So I urge my Republican colleagues to join us now in proceeding to \nconference through regular order, as they have said we should. That is \nthe best way to reach a deal that is the best and most responsible path \nfor our country to move forward on.\n\n[[Page S3109]]\n\n  So, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed \nto the consideration of Calendar No. 33, H. Con. Res. 25; that the \namendment which is at the desk, the text of S. Con. Res. 8, the budget \nresolution passed by the Senate, be inserted in lieu thereof; that H. \nCon. Res. 25, as amended, be agreed to; the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table; that the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on \nthe part of the Senate, all with no intervening action or debate.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, would the Senator yield for a \nquestion? Is a question in order?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. There is a UC before the Senate. If no one objects, I \nwould be happy to answer a question.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object--which I am not going to \ndo, but I just want to clarify the Senator's motion--the Senator is \nsimply asking us to move the budget which she passed after a heroic \neffort on the part of many to pass a budget so we could move to regular \norder. The Senator's consent is only asking us to move with all due \nspeed to a conference to resolve the differences between the House \nbudget and the Senate budget. Is that the Senator's understanding?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Louisiana is correct. The UC I am \nrequesting simply takes us to conference so the House and the Senate \nMembers can agree--Republicans and Democrats alike--to work toward a \nbipartisan solution.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. One more question: Are not there Republicans \nrepresented on that committee? In fact, would the Republicans have the \nmajority representation from the House?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Parliamentary inquiry: Are we making a speech?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. No. I am asking a question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Or are we considering objecting to a consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, I would ask consent \nthat the Senator modify her request so that it not be in order for the \nSenate to consider a conference report that includes tax increases or \nreconciliation instructions to increase taxes or raise the debt \nceiling.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill in a moment, we considered over 100 amendments on the Senate \nfloor. All of those kinds of amendments were brought up, debated, and \nconsidered as part of the resolution, as we do on any debate. So there \nis no need to go back and redo all of our amendments again. So I object \nand ask simply again our UC to move forward to conference so we can \ndiscuss all of these issues in regular order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is noted.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, can I be heard for 3 minutes on this \nsubject?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, this is very disturbing that the \nminority leader has objected to taking the budget to conference because \nthe only way to get a compromise on the budget is to take it to \nconference, as the chair of the Budget Committee has asked us to do, to \nwork out the differences between the Republican version of the budget \nand the Democratic version of the budget.\n  Right now, President Obama has some ideas about what his budget would \nlook like. The Democrats and Republicans passed a budget here. The \nRepublicans have passed a budget on the House side. The only way to \nwork that out is following the leadership of the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, who is a senior Member now of this body, who understands \nregular order, understands the art of compromise, understands that \nthere is a Democratic-controlled Senate, a Republican-controlled House, \nand a Democratic President--all who have legitimate but varying views \nabout how the budget should be worked out may I say, a very important \nsubject for the people of the United States because we are running \ndeficits as far as the eye can see. While we have made some progress in \ncutting substantially--and we have raised some revenues--it is \nimportant to get our budget better in balance so we can grow this \neconomy, keep this recovery going, stop throwing cold water on the \nrecovery that is underway, and help Americans get jobs and create \nbusiness.\n  I am flabbergasted to hear that the minority leader has just said no \nto that plan--said no, we are not going to conference. We object unless \nyou do X, Y, and Z.\n  It is always an objection, a ``but.'' Democrats could come to this \nfloor and say the same thing: I do not want to go to conference unless \nwe decide we cannot, under any circumstance, even talk about Medicaid \nor Social Security or cutting education or health care; we will not go \nto conference unless we put that on the table.\n  We will never get to conference if both sides dig in before the \ndiscussions can even begin. That is where we are. I can understand the \nmajority leader's frustration, and I most certainly appreciate the \nleadership of the Budget Committee chair. I am just so sorry to see \nthat the chairman of the Budget Committee cannot even get the budget to \nconference to begin the debate on compromise because of this nonregular \norder status, because of the Republican minority, led by the Senator \nfrom Texas, of course, but reiterated by the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana. I \njust have to say I am frustrated and shocked at the reaction of our \nRepublican counterparts who have repeatedly--repeatedly--said to the \nSenate: You need to pass a budget. We did so under regular order. \nEveryone will remember the night we spent here until 5 a.m. going \nthrough hundreds of amendments--the ones the minority leader just \nobjected to that he wanted guarantees on before we went to conference. \nWe voted on all those amendments. That is what this process is all \nabout.\n  How can I, as Budget chairman, now do what the country is asking us \nto do, which is to compromise, move forward, and solve our problems \nrather than managing by crisis? If we cannot go to conference, how are \nwe going to get a budget agreement moving forward? Everyone in this \ncountry knows this debate. It has gone on for several years. It went \nthrough the supercommittee. It went through an election where people's \nvoices were heard. Now, after just berating us for not having a budget, \nthe Senate Republicans are saying: Well, that did not matter. We do not \ncare if you have a budget. We are just going to sit here.\n  That kind of chaos is exactly what this country does not need when it \ncomes to our fragile economy today and people are trying to get back on \ntheir feet. I am ready to go to work. I am ready to sit down with the \nRepublican leadership from the Budget Committee in the House and their \nconferees, to put our ideas on the table, and to make some tough \nchoices. But I cannot do it until the Senate Republicans quit objecting \nto us moving to conference to get that done.\n  So this is the third time we have asked, the third time we have been \nturned down. We are going to keep trying to get this done. I am \ncommitted to solving one of the biggest problems facing our country--\ngive us certainty, get us back on track--but I cannot do it when the \nRepublicans are objecting to allowing us to go to conference. So I am \nvery disappointed.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/07/senate-section/article/S3109-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3109-S3110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would like to speak for a few \nminutes\n\n[[Page S3139]]\n\ntoday about the importance of getting a budget done today, all the way \nthrough the process. Senator Reid, our majority leader, last evening \nspoke again about the fact that we have had 15 days now of trying to \njust come together to create a conference committee to work out \ndifferences between the House and the Senate on a budget. For some \nreason, after talk for the last 3 years that I can remember from \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle saying that we need regular \norder, we need regular order, we need to get a budget done, they now \nare objecting to getting a budget done, which is extraordinary. The \nfact is that we cannot get a budget done if the House and the Senate do \nnot appoint conferees and sit down and negotiate differences.\n  There are huge differences, I might add, between the House and the \nSenate. It is true that we will not accept, in the Senate, eliminating \nMedicare as an insurance plan for seniors and the disabled in this \ncountry, which the House does in their plan, turning it into a \ngovernment voucher, putting seniors back into the private sector to try \nto find insurance. We certainly will not accept that, it is true. There \nare other areas of that budget we absolutely will not accept, but we \nknow the first step in coming together to find something we can accept \nis to sit down and talk. I mean, I am very proud of what we were able \nto do in March. We had 110 amendments. We all remember. We were here \nuntil the wee hours of the morning. We got a budget done in regular \norder.\n  We have been hearing from colleagues across the aisle that we need to \nhave regular order. I support that. In fact, I was proud of the fact \nthat last year we did a farm bill in regular order and plowed through \n73 amendments and worked together and passed a bipartisan bill. We hope \nwe are going to be bringing a bill to the floor very soon as well to do \nit again.\n  I am a huge supporter of giving people an opportunity to state their \ndifferences, to be able to work out amendments, and to be able to get a \nbill done. We did that with 50 hours of debate on the budget, 110 \namendments that we took up. We got it done. Now, all of a sudden, \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle do not want regular order \nanymore. They have decided somehow that actively blocking us from \nactually getting a budget for the Nation is more advantageous to them \nfor some reason or something that appeals to them more than actually \ngetting the budget done.\n  I urge our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to take another \nlook at this, to look at their own words over the last number of years. \nOur colleague from Texas who objected to the majority leader's motion \nto actually do the next step and get a budget done said back in January \non national television: We have a crisis. Well, what was the crisis he \nwas talking about?\n\n       There is no doubt the Senate has not done its job. The \n     Senate should pass a budget.\n\n  Well, we did. We passed a budget. It may not be something my \ncolleague from Texas supported. That is the democratic process. The \nmajority of people agreed in this body, and we passed a budget. He may \nbe more inclined to support the House budget, which eliminates Medicare \nas an insurance plan and does a number of other things that I think go \nright to the heart of middle-class families and so on. That is his \nright. That is a right we all have, to have a position as to which \nbudget we support. But we also know that in the democratic process \nunder our Constitution--and we all talk about the Constitution and the \ndemocratic process--the way we actually get to a final budget is to get \nfolks in a room to talk, to negotiate, and to see if there is some way \nto work issues out. We are now being blocked from being able to get in \nthe room to talk to each other.\n  The American people want us to talk, want us to negotiate, want us to \nwork things out. That is what we ought to be doing. So I would strongly \nurge that we move to conference. I do not know why in the world anyone \nwould be objecting to putting together a group of people, Democrats and \nRepublicans in the Senate, Democrats and Republicans in the House, to \nsit down and work out the priorities for our country.\n  Will we have different perspectives on Medicare, whether we should \nhave Medicare? Yes, we will. Will we have different perspectives on \nwhere the brunt of the cutbacks should be and whether middle-class \nfamilies have been hit enough, which I believe they have? Yes, we will \nhave a disagreement on how to balance the budget. But we all know that \nwe need to get the job done. We have done our part in passing a Senate \nbudget. The House passed a House budget. It is a very different vision \nof the world, different vision of what should happen in terms of \ninnovation, education, and investing in the future of our country--very \ndifferent views. But those views deserve to be aired sitting around a \nconference table to try to work out some way to come together to pass a \nbudget.\n  I urge colleagues to stop obstructing, stop stalling, allow us to \nmove forward in a balanced way, and give us the opportunity to do what \neveryone in the country wants us to do, which is to come up with a \nbipartisan, balanced, fair budget for the country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Now I call up the Boxer-Vitter substitute amendment No. \n799 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself and \n     Mr. Vitter, proposes an amendment numbered 799.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I will make an opening statement and \nthen turn it over to my colleague, Senator Vitter, for his opening \nstatement.\n  I want to just say this is a good day for the Senate to get on a bill \nthat is a bipartisan bill, where we have had unanimous support in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. This is a bill that will create \nor save half a million jobs for our Nation, and it has been a long time \nin coming. The last WRDA bill--the Water Resources Development Act--was \nin 2007. It took a lot of work to get here. The reason for that is we \nhad to deal with changing the culture of the Senate away from earmarks \nin a bill like this where projects were named and figure out a way we \ncould move forward with these projects without earmarks. It was \ndifficult.\n  Senator Vitter and I and our staffs have worked hard to get to this \npoint. I particularly want to say to both staffs that we couldn't have \ndone it without your amazing focus. We are so appreciative.\n  Our bill did make it through EPW without a single ``no'' vote. Since \nthen we have been working with almost every Senator to hear their \nideas, to get their reactions, and to see if there were ways we could \nchange the bill. This substitute Senator Vitter and I have put forward \nincorporates the\n\n[[Page S3140]]\n\nviews of a whole array of Senators, and they know who they are. There \nare many of them, and we are very happy we were able to work with them. \nOf course, we will continue to work with them if there are ways we can \nimprove this bill even more.\n  So this is long past time. As I said, it was 2007 when the last WRDA \nbill became law, so we have an infrastructure that is critical, and \npart of it is the water infrastructure. That is what we deal with.\n  Now, what does this bill do? We focus on flood control. We focus on \nports and environmental restoration projects where the corps has \ncompleted a comprehensive study. Then we also incorporate \nauthorizations for projects that need modifications, and the \nmodifications don't add to the overall cost of the project. For the \nfuture, we have developed a system that allows local sponsors to make \ntheir case directly to the corps because we are fearful that as new \nneeds come up, there is no path forward. So we do all that in this \nbill.\n  I am proud of a lot of provisions in this bill, but one of them is \nwhat we call WIFIA--the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation \nAct. It is a way to assist localities in need of loans for flood \ncontrol or wastewater and drinking water infrastructure to receive \nthese loans upfront.\n  Let me explain that. We expanded a program called TIFIA in the \nTransportation bill dealing with transportation infrastructure. We said \nwhere a local government or a region came forward with, say, a sales \ntax or bond for a series of transportation projects, and they wanted to \nmove quickly and build them in a shorter timeframe, as long as they had \nthat steady stream of funding, the Federal Government, with virtually \nno risk, could advance these funds and let them build these projects \nquicker, creating jobs and improving the infrastructure quicker.\n  So we did this same thing with water. It is a small project, and it \nis not a replacement for our existing funding through the corps and \nEPA, but it is a supplement. It is a supplement that would help \nexisting programs leverage more investment in our infrastructure. So \nWIFIA will allow localities an opportunity to move forward with water \ninfrastructure projects in the same way TIFIA works.\n  This bill is critical. I mean, let's just say what it is. I know \nthere are people who will offer amendments on subjects ranging--well, \nlet's just say broad-ranging subjects. And it is their right to do it. \nSenator Vitter and I know that, and it is what it is. It is the Senate \nand people will come forward. But we hope we will not get bogged down \non these nongermane amendments because so much is at stake.\n  I think this would be a good time for me to mention some of the \nsupporters of our bill: the American Association of Port Authorities, \nthe American Concrete Pressure Pipe Association, the American Council \nof Engineering Companies, the American Farm Bureau, the American \nFoundry Society, the American Public Works Association, the American \nRoad and Transportation Builders Association. This list goes on and on.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the list of \nthese supporting organizations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                National Organizations Supporting S. 601\n\n       American Association of Port Authorities, American Concrete \n     Pressure Pipe Association, American Council of Engineering \n     Companies, American Farm Bureau Federation, American Foundry \n     Society, American Public Works Association, American Road and \n     Transportation Builders Association, American Society of \n     Civil Engineers, American Soybean Association, Associated \n     General Contractors of America, Association of Equipment \n     Manufacturers, Clean Water Construction Coalition, Concrete \n     Reinforcing Steel Institute, Construction Management \n     Association of America, International Liquid Terminals \n     Association, International Propeller Club of the United \n     States.\n       International Union of Operating Engineers, Laborers \n     International Union of North America, Management Association \n     for Private Photogrammetric Surveyors (MAPPS), NAIOP, the \n     Commercial Real Estate Development Association, National \n     Grain and Feed Association, National Ready Mixed Concrete \n     Association, National Retail Federation, National Society of \n     Professional Surveyors (NSPS), National Stone, Sand & Gravel \n     Association, National Waterways Conference, Inc., Plumbing \n     Manufacturers International, Portland Cement Association, The \n     American Institute of Architects, The Fertilizer Institute, \n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce, United Brotherhood of Carpenters \n     and Joiners of America, Waterways Council Inc.\n       Letter signed by 160 organizations to Members of the United \n     States Senate (April 29, 2013).\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will say that we are looking at the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce supporting this bill, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and \nJoiners of America, the Waterways Council, Inc., and the Plumbing \nManufacturers, International. Wherever we look, whether it is business \nor labor, whether it is governmental entities--even the American Farm \nBureau Federation, as I said, and Laborers International Union of North \nAmerica--it is a really important bill. Even the Commercial Real Estate \nDevelopment Association. Why? Because they know if you are going to \nsell a house in an area that gets flooded, you need to address the \nflooding problems. So we do address flooding problems.\n  We do address port deepening. Believe me, without these port \ndeepenings in a lot of our ports--not all our ports need to do it--\ncommerce could come to a halt, and I would say almost a screeching \nhalt. There may be better terminology, but you have to dredge those \nports to a certain depth so those vessels can move in and out.\n  Let me talk about just one area in my home State. Senator Vitter and \nI often say we see the world a little differently--or a lot differently \nwhen it comes to a lot of issues, but when it comes to infrastructure, \nwe have a lot in common. He had to face the horrific catastrophic \nsituation during and after Katrina, and I look at that issue and say: \nOh, my Lord, if we had something like that happen in Sacramento, what \nwould happen? We have so many more people than they have in his State. \nWe have more commerce there. We have the seat of the State government \nin the Natomas Basin. So we have to strengthen the levees, and we are \ntalking about $7 billion in property. So we are talking about a need to \nprevent terrible flooding.\n  Now, that is just one area of my State--and I want to thank \nCongresswoman Doris Matsui for all the work she has done over on the \nHouse side, and the many others who have helped her over there. I just \nmention her name because she has been so involved in representing \nSacramento.\n  Our bill provides lifesaving flood protection for more than 200,000 \nresidents of Fargo, ND, and Moorhead, MN, who have been fighting rising \nwaters in recent weeks, just as they do most years after the spring \nthaw. The bill will restore the viability of the levee system that \nprotects Topeka, KS. These levees protect thousands of homes and \nbusinesses, and this project will return over $13 in benefits for every \ndollar invested.\n  I know our current Presiding Officer is a fiscal conservative. We are \ntalking about a bill that invests $1 and gets $13 back. So flood \ncontrol and flood protection are critical. All we have to do is look at \nSandy to see what happened and look at the cost--one event, $60 \nbillion. So if we were to invest a portion of that into trying to \nmitigate these problems before they start, that is what the WRDA bill \nis all about and why it is so important and essential. So I hope it \ndoesn't get bogged down in extraneous amendments.\n  I talked about the ports. One of those projects is in Texas, to widen \nand deepen the Sabine-Neches Waterway, which will have over $115 \nmillion in annual benefits. It transports 100,000 tons of goods every \nyear. It is the top port for the movement of commercial military goods.\n  Whether you are in a red State, whether you are in a blue State, \nwhether you are in a purple State or, frankly, any other State if there \nare any, you are protected in this bill. You are covered in this bill.\n  Look at Florida, the Port of Jacksonville, with safety concerns there \nfor ships entering and exiting this port because of dangerous cross \ncurrents. This bill will make it possible to protect that port.\n  Critical ecosystem restoration: The Florida Everglades. If you have \nnever been to the Everglades, you should go to the Everglades. It is a \nmiraculous place, a God-given treasure. We have to restore it. It needs \nour attention. We definitely have four new Everglades restoration \nprojects that will move forward in this bill.\n\n[[Page S3141]]\n\n  For the Chesapeake Bay and the Columbia River Basin, we enable the \nCorps to work with States along the North Atlantic coast to restore \nvital coastal habitats from Virginia to Maine, and allow the Corps to \nimplement projects to better prepare for extreme weather in the \nnorthern Rocky Mountain States of Montana and Idaho.\n  In addition--this is important. I talked a little bit about \nSuperstorm Sandy--we have a new extreme weather title I am very proud \nof. This will enable the Corps to help communities better prepare for \nand reduce the risks of extreme weather-related disasters. How does it \ndo it? For the first time, the Boxer-Vitter bill allows the Corps to \nconduct immediate assessments of affected watersheds following extreme \nweather events. For example, if this had been operational right after \nKatrina, the Corps would have gone right in there. They would not have \nhad to wait for an authorization. They would not have had to wait for \nan emergency supplemental. They would have identified and constructed \nsmall flood control projects immediately, such as building levees, \nflood walls, restoring wetlands, and would not have to go through the \nfull study process and receive authorization.\n  After an extreme weather event--Senator Vitter and our whole \ncommittee believe it is an extraordinary circumstance--if you can move \nin there and mitigate the damage right away, you should do that with \nthese smaller type projects. In this extreme weather title we also \nrequire the Corps and the National Academy of Sciences to jointly \nevaluate all of the options for reducing risks, including flooding and \ndroughts, including those related to future extreme weather events \nbecause as far as we can tell, there is no specific study that looks at \nthe future.\n  The cost of this bill comes in well below the last WRDA bill and we \nmove toward a better use of the harbor maintenance trust fund. Let me \nbe clear. Senator Vitter and I both believe it is a critical issue to \nuse the harbor maintenance trust fund for harbor maintenance. It seems \nto me to be fair and it seems to him to be fair. But what has happened \nover the years, because we have these budgetary problems, is the harbor \nmaintenance trust fund is used for other uses. We wanted to totally \ntake that fund away and save it for harbors. It was not going to \nhappen. There was too much controversy around it.\n  What we were able to do, though, is to make sure the appropriators \nknew our concerns. Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby worked with us \non a letter and it commits to helping us move toward the new \nauthorization levels in this bill which ratchet up spending on the \nports.\n  We also make sure that some of our ports that are donor ports--let's \nsay the one in LA and Long Beach, that do not have issues of deepening \nof the channel, that need to use those funds for other uses--get a \nchance, when those moneys come in, to get it back. Some of my people \nare paying in pennies on the dollar. It is not fair.\n  We do try to address the issue of the larger ports, even the smaller \nports, Great Lakes, the seaports that are large donors to the fund. We \nmake important reforms of the inland waterways system, which is \ncritical for transporting goods throughout the country. Expediting \nproject delivery is something we do.\n  I want to take a moment here. I want to be unequivocal on this \nproject delivery piece. I stand here with credentials going back \nforever. In my case it is a long time. I can say very proudly that \nevery single environmental law stays in place in this bill. As a matter \nof fact, we have a savings clause which specifically says all these \nlaws stay in place.\n  Senator Vitter and I have a little disagreement over environmental \nlaws. We have to work together. He stepped up and said: Look, some of \nthese agencies are holding up projects for years and we are not getting \nour projects done. I thought he had a point. So together we worked on a \ncompromise. It is not everything he wanted; it is not everything I \nwanted. But we are moving forward while saving all the environmental \nlaws by making sure that when the Corps has a project and they complete \ntheir work, they issue something called a ROD, a record of decision. We \nmake sure all the agencies now are involved in setting the timetable \nfor that ROD. Then the agencies have an additional 6 months after the \ndate they approved of to get their comments in. If they do not, yes, \nthey will get a penalty.\n  Frankly, I think that is important. We do cap those penalties, but \nthe fact is we are here to do the people's business. As long as we \nprotect everyone's rights, which we do, and we bend over backward to \nmake sure all the agencies are involved, making sure the timeframes \naround a ROD are fair and they are involved, we say, yes, you have to \nstep to the plate.\n  I have examples in my State where the agencies have taken such a long \ntime--whether, frankly, it is an environmental project or a \nconstruction project, flood control--where agencies are not talking to \neach other. Senator Vitter and I believed it was important to send a \nmessage.\n  Look, the administration doesn't love this and we understand it. But \nthat is why we have separation of powers here. We say it is only right \nto work together. Our bill is not perfect, we know that, but I will \ntell you we support 500,000 jobs, we protect people from flooding, we \nenable commerce to move through our ports, we encourage innovative \nfinancing and leveraging of funds, and we begin the hard work of \npreparing for and responding to extreme weather. I defy anyone to tell \nus another bill that does those things--protects jobs, protects people \nfrom flooding, enables commerce to move through our ports, encourages \ninnovative financing, even more jobs, and preparing for and responding \nto extreme weather.\n  I want to talk about a couple of people by name here. I will do more \npeople later. I want to mention, of course, first and foremost Senator \nVitter, who has been a pleasure to work with. We have had our moments \nwhere we have not agreed. Our staffs had their moments when they did \nnot agree. We never got up in anger. We never walked away from the \ntable. We stayed at the table. To me that is so important. We did it on \nthis bill. I wish we could do it on others, but that is another day. \nBut we are certainly doing it on this bill. First and foremost, I thank \nhim.\n\n  Next, I thank Senators Mikulski and Shelby for writing a letter to \nus. It is not all we want but it is a show of good faith and I think it \nis precedent setting, that we have this letter saying they are going to \ndo everything in their power to help.\n  I thank Senator Vitter's colleague, Senator Landrieu. She has worked \nbehind the scenes with me since Katrina, and I know the two of them \nhave worked together. I think her efforts matched with Senator Vitter's \nare very important for Louisiana.\n  I have been to Louisiana many times. I have warm relationships there. \nI certainly helped when it came to the RESTORE Act, and I certainly \nintend to remember everything the people there went through and to \nfollow through on my commitments to them.\n  In this bill we are fair to Louisiana, we are fair to California, we \nare fair to the Great Lakes, we are fair to the small port States, we \nare fair to the medium port States. We have done everything. We are \nfair to the States that have ports that now have competition from \ninternational ports. I do believe if we can get through some of the \nsticky wicket of some amendments that don't have anything to do with \nthis, if we can get through with that, we will have a very good, \nstrong, bipartisan bill. I honestly also believe Chairman Shuster in \nthe House will move forward as well. He is a terrific person to work \nwith and I enjoy working with him as well. If we produce this work \nproduct and we can get it done this week--which I hope we can--it will \nmake a big difference.\n  Before I turn it over to Senator Vitter, let me say for the interests \nof all Members, we are working on an agreement that will allow us to go \nto a couple of amendments a side. One of them will be the Whitehouse \namendment. A couple will be by Senator Coburn. We are looking at other \namendments. We hope we can have votes this afternoon. We don't know at \nthis point. That is certainly the hope of Senator Vitter and myself. We \nwould very much like to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n[[Page S3142]]\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I join my colleague in rising in support \nof this strong, bipartisan, reform-oriented Water Resources Development \nAct bill. In doing so, I thank and salute Senator Boxer for her \nleadership. More than anyone else, she got us to the floor today with a \nstrong, solid bill.\n  As Senator Boxer mentioned, very early on in our discussions about \nthe work of the EPW Committee in this Congress, we set a good, solid, \nbipartisan, reform-oriented WRDA bill as our top immediate goal in \nterms of something the committee could produce and actually pass into \nlaw. In fact, those discussions even started between her and myself, in \nparticular, before the start of this Congress. Of course they continued \nand they ramped up in a meaningful and substantive way. Through that \ngive-and-take and through that real commitment to work in a bipartisan \nfashion on infrastructure, on jobs, on issues on which we can agree, \nthis bill resulted.\n  Again, as she mentioned, we do not agree on everything. We do not \nagree on everything in the committee, and that committee is often very \ncontentious and divided along ideological lines. But this is a subject \nwhere we can agree and work productively together because this bill is \nabout infrastructure and jobs. Certainly we can come together around \nthat. That is what it is fundamentally about--water infrastructure, \ncommerce, and jobs. That is why the Alliance for Manufacturing said \nalmost 24,000 jobs will be created for every $1 billion invested in \nlevees, inland waterways, and dams. This bill does several billion \ndollars of that. That produces jobs because it is building the \nnecessary infrastructure we need for waterborne commerce. Ultimately \nthat core, that theme, that common goal is what brought us effectively \ntogether.\n  The proof of that is seen in the committee consideration of this \nbill. As you may know, the EPW Committee is a divided committee. On \nmany key issues before us we are very divided between Republicans and \nDemocrats. Yet because of this focus in the bill on maritime commerce, \njobs, infrastructure, we won an 18-to-0 committee vote to report the \nbill out favorably and bring it to the floor.\n  Let me talk for a few minutes about exactly what is in the bill. I \nwant to go through the highlights. I think they can best be summarized \nby focusing on 10 specific points, what is in the bill, what the bill \ndoes, sometimes, just as importantly, what is not in the bill and what \nthe bill does not do.\n  First of all, the bill does not increase deficit and debt in any way. \nThere is no negative impact on deficit and debt. Related to that, No. \n2, there are no earmarks in the bill. The current rules of both \nconferences are not to support and sponsor earmarks. There are no \nearmarks in the bill.\n  What does the bill affirmatively do? No. 3, it authorizes 19 \nsignificant projects for flood protection, navigation, and ecosystem \nrestoration. Yet at the same time, even on the authorization side, we \ncreate a mechanism--I thank Senator Barrasso for contributing this \nimportant element to the bill--we create a BRAC-like commission to \ndeauthorize some old projects which are not being acted upon, which are \nnot getting built. Because of that new BRAC-like deauthorization \ncommission, even on the authorization side, we should have a net-\nneutral impact on authorizations. The way we have structured it, we \nshould not be increasing overall net authorizations.\n\n  No. 4, we have made substantial progress and reforms to the Harbor \nMaintenance Trust Fund and spending on dredging and other Harbor \nMaintenance Trust Fund projects.\n  As Senator Boxer mentioned, it has been an enormous frustration to \nmany of us that this so-called trust fund is raided every year so that \neven in a good year, half of the supposedly dedicated revenue from the \nindustry in those trust funds is used for other purposes. Again, this \nis revenue from the maritime industry. It is supposed to be protected \nand dedicated for dredging and other delineated purposes, but even in a \ngood year, half is used for other things, with deficit spending.\n  We have negotiated with all Members of the Senate, including the \nleaders of the Appropriations Committee, and I think we have made \nsubstantial progress. I think we have made a big move in the right \ndirection so we ramp up harbor maintenance trust fund spending for \ndredging and other delineated purposes.\n  In a few years--between now and roughly 2019, 2020--we have a steady \nramp-up. We spend more of that trust fund on the agreed-upon delineated \npurposes every year. We are building toward full spend-out of the trust \nfund. Again, this is a product of a lot of discussion and goodwill \nnegotiation with other Members of the Senate, including leaders of the \nAppropriations Committee, which is a major and positive element of this \nbill.\n  No. 5, we also made important reforms and changes to the Inland \nWaterways Trust Fund. Again, there has been real frustration that those \ninland waterways trust fund projects have been languishing and have not \nproperly received the resources they need to be completed and get off \nthe books. We have made real reforms on the Inland Waterway Trust Fund \nside that will have important and positive impacts to get those \nimportant projects built.\n  No. 6, we provide non-Federal sponsors of many of these projects more \nproject management control in both the feasibility study and the \nconstruction phases of projects. This has been an idea in a stand-alone \nbill of Senator Bill Nelson of Florida and myself. We incorporated that \nreform--that pilot project--into this WRDA bill.\n  In several significant cases, on a sort of experimental basis, we are \ngoing to ask the non-Federal sponsors to take over project management \ncontrol. We think that is going to allow these projects to get built \nquicker and more efficiently for less money.\n  No. 7, we require more accountability of the Corps of Engineers on \nproject schedules. We increased public disclosure of internal Corps \ndecisions, and we actually penalized the Corps for the first time ever \nwhen they missed significant deadlines. Again, Senator Boxer mentioned \nthis.\n  We had discussions right out of the box and came to the agreement \nthat we are not going to lower the bar about environmental review; we \nare not going to substantively change any environmental or other \nrequirements. What we are going to do is make sure that agencies which \nare involved do their work in a timely and expeditious way, and that \nhas to start with the Corps of Engineers in terms of these projects. We \ndo that with much heightened Corps accountability.\n  No. 8, in a similar vein, we accelerate the NEPA and project delivery \nprocess to ensure that projects are not endlessly held up by government \nbureaucracy, tangles, and redtape. Again, it is exactly the same \napproach and agreement I mentioned with regard to point No. 7. We are \nnot changing standards or lessening our requirements. We are \nappropriately streamlining the process and saying: Everybody works on \ndeadlines, and the Federal agencies involved have to work on and \nrespect those deadlines as well. If they miss them over and over and \nover, there will be negative consequences, and that is an important \nreform element to this bill.\n  No. 9, as Senator Boxer mentioned, we provide an innovative financing \nmechanism for water resource projects as well as water and wastewater \ninfrastructure projects. It is called WIFIA because it is modeled on \nthe TIFIA Program on the transportation side, and it is very much the \nsame basic idea. TIFIA has long been a model to build public-private \npartnerships and has helped to finance important transportation \ninfrastructure projects.\n  On the last highway bill last year that I helped work on and Senator \nBoxer led on, we expanded the TIFIA Program. Here we are using the same \npositive model for a WIFIA program.\n  Finally, No. 10, we provide more credit opportunities for non-Federal \nsponsors either in lieu of financial reimbursement or cross-crediting \namong projects so they can more reasonably meet their wetlands \nmitigation and other needs.\n  Wetlands mitigation requirements have grown much more onerous and \nexpensive over time in a lot of places of the country, including \nLouisiana. This is simply intended to give people, local government, \nprivate industry, and others, more options. It is not to lower the \nstandard for that mitigation, but it allows for more options to meet \nthe standard and goals in a more efficient\n\n[[Page S3143]]\n\nand less costly way. So we do that through these credit opportunities.\n  Those are the important and 10 key highlights of the bill. Again, I \nthink it is a genuine bipartisan reform-oriented effort that is, at its \ncore, about water infrastructure, waterborne commerce, jobs, and \nhurricane and flood protection.\n  As I mentioned at the beginning, the clearest proof of that is \ncommittee consideration and committee vote. There are not many things \nthat ever get an 18-0 vote in the Senate EPW Committee, but this did. \nStrong conservatives and strong liberals voted with a result of 18-0. I \nam very proud of that, and I think that gives us a very productive path \nforward.\n  Speaking of the path forward, let me underscore and emphasize what \nSenator Boxer has laid out. We want to have votes; we want to process \namendments. There is no goal here to frustrate that in any way by me or \nSenator Boxer or anyone. In my opinion, to get that ball rolling, the \nbest way to get there is to start taking up amendments and having votes \nso we can build on that momentum. What we are going to propose in the \nvery near future is that our substitute amendment be adopted by \nunanimous consent to be the underlying bill. It is noncontroversial. It \nincorporates the ideas and suggestions of dozens of Senators. There is \nnothing controversial in it. In fact, the only thing it does is remove \nsome potential controversy in the bill. So we are going to ask the full \nSenate allow us, by UC, to adopt that as the underlying bill.\n\n  We are also going to immediately ask to have debate and votes on \nthree or four beginning amendments. I believe those, in fact, are going \nto be nongermane amendments. I think that underscores and illustrates \nour goodwill about processing amendments, getting it going, taking \namendments, having votes, and getting through this process.\n  I would suggest, as Senator Boxer did, that we try to continue to \nfocus on the important subject matter of the bill and not endlessly or \nneedlessly go far afield. But I do think that proposing these amendment \nvotes straight out is an important gesture of goodwill to set the right \nprecedent and tone for a full and open debate on the floor, and so that \nis what we are going to do.\n  As soon as that UC request is drafted and ready, I will come to the \nfull Senate with that. If we can gain consent for that, I think it will \nstart us on a very productive path, both to consider the bill and to \nprocess amendments and have votes.\n  Clearly those amendments would not be the end of it, by far. We are \nalready keying up some amendments to come forward right after that so \nwe can debate those maybe tonight. If we do that, we can vote on those \nas soon as possible, perhaps in the morning, and go from there. That is \nmy goal and expectation in terms of the near future, which Senator \nBoxer shares. Hopefully we will return to the full Senate quickly with \nthat request.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana for his hard work, along with Chairman Boxer, to get us \nto this point, which I think is a very auspicious point with a very \nbipartisan bill on the floor and with the Senate on the cusp of an \nagreement that will allow us to implement the managers' amendment and \ncall up the first tranche of Senate amendments.\n  I thank him and the Chairman for agreeing that an amendment of mine \nwill be one of that first tranche of amendments. I am not going to call \nit up now because the agreement is not finalized, but I will discuss it \nso we can save time later on once the bill is pending.\n  My amendment would establish a national endowment for the oceans, \ncoasts, and Great Lakes. Our oceans and our coasts face unprecedented \nchallenges. Our coastal States, including our Great Lakes States, badly \nneed this endowment. Water temperatures are increasing, the sea level \nis rising, and ocean water is growing more acidic.\n  Right now, we as a country and we as States and local communities are \nill prepared to engage in the research, restoration, and in the \nconservation work that is necessary to protect our coastal communities \nand our coastal economies.\n  The noted ocean explorer Bob Ballard, who famously discovered the \nwreckage of the Titanic at the bottom of the Atlantic, has said:\n\n     a major problem . . . is the disconnect between the \n     importance of our oceans and the meager funds we as a nation \n     invest not only to understand their complexity, but to become \n     responsible stewards of the bounty they represent.\n\n  Just how large is that bounty our Nation reaps from our oceans? Well, \nin 2010, marine activities such as fishing, energy development, and \ntourism contributed $258 billion to our U.S. gross domestic product and \nsupported 2.8 million jobs. Along our coasts, shoreline counties, which \nactually include many of our biggest cities, generated 41 percent of \nour GDP, which is $6 trillion.\n  Coastal communities are the engines of our economy, and changes in \nthe oceans put that economy at risk. We must find ways of using these \nvital resources without abusing them.\n  Last month the Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee heard from \nscientists and industry leaders from across the country who are deeply \nworried about threats to our oceans. On the Pacific Coast, ocean \nacidification is killing off the oyster harvest--a major cash crop for \nthat region. They are being killed off by sea water too acidic for the \nlarval oysters to form their shells.\n  Live coral in some Caribbean reefs is down to less than 10 percent, \nwhich is bad news for Florida, which usually sees over 15 million \nrecreational dives every year. Think of what those 15 million dives \nmean for Florida's economy. This not only affects the dive boats and \ntrainers who take people out for scuba diving, but for hotels, \nrestaurants, and retailers.\n  Evan Matthews, the port director for the Port of Quonset in my home \nState of Rhode Island, spoke on behalf of America's port administrators \nto tell us that rising sea levels make port infrastructure more \nvulnerable to damage from waves and storms.\n  Virtually all of our economy is touched by what goes through our \nnetwork of coastal ports, and damage to any of them--since they work as \na network--could disrupt the delivery of vital goods not only to \ncoastal States but to inland States as well. So it affects all of us.\n\n  But for the coastal States, this is very big. We have work to do \npreparing for changes in our oceans and preventing storm damage such as \nwe saw in Superstorm Sandy. We need to reinforce natural coastal \nbarriers such as dunes and estuaries that help bear the brunt of storm \nsurges as well as acting as nurseries for our bounty of fish. We will \nneed to relocate critical infrastructure such as water treatment plants \nand bridges, which are increasingly at risk of being washed away. We \nneed to understand how ocean acidification and warming waters will \naffect the food chain and our fishing economies. We need to know where \nthe high-risk areas are so coastline investors can understand the \ngeographical risks.\n  These are coastal concerns, but they have implications for all 50 of \nour States. If you eat seafood or take a beach vacation in the summer, \nthis concerns you. If you have purchased anything produced outside the \nUnited States and imported through our network of coastal ports, this \nconcerns you. According to 2011 data from the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, 75 percent of U.S. imports arrived on our \nshores through our ports, so they probably should concern you.\n  The National Endowment for the Oceans, Coasts, and Great Lakes can \nhelp coastal States and communities protect more habitat and \ninfrastructure, conduct more research, and clean more waters and \nbeaches. The need is great and we must respond.\n  This amendment will just authorize the National Endowment for the \nOceans, Coasts, and Great Lakes. We will have to figure out how to fund \nit later. When we have figured out how to fund it, the endowment would \nmake grants to coastal and Great Lakes States, to local governments, to \nplanning bodies, to academic institutions, and to nonprofit \norganizations to learn more about and do a better job of protecting our \ncoasts and oceans.\n\n[[Page S3144]]\n\n  It would allow researchers to hire technicians, mechanics, computer \nscientists, and students. It would put people to work strengthening or \nrelocating endangered public infrastructure. It would help scientists, \nbusinesses, and local communities work together to protect our working \noceans, and it would protect jobs by restoring commercial fisheries and \npromoting sustainable and profitable fishing.\n  How great is the need for these projects? We know because a few years \nago NOAA received $167 million for coastal restoration projects through \nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. When they asked for \nproposals, more than 800 proposals for shovel-ready construction and \nengineering projects came in--projects totaling $3 billion, seeking \nthat $167 million in funding--projects from Alaska to Florida to the \nCarolinas to Maine. But NOAA could only fund 50 of the 800. The \nNational Endowment for the Oceans will help us move forward with more \nof these key projects to help protect our oceans and drive our economy.\n  We will continue to take advantage of the oceans' bounty, as we \nshould. We will trade, we will fish, and we will sail. We will dispose \nof waste. We will extract fuel and harness the wind. We will work our \nworking oceans. Navies and cruise ships, sailboats and supertankers \nwill plow their surface. We cannot--we will not--undo this part of our \nrelationship with the sea. But what we can change is what we do in \nreturn.\n  We can, for the first time, give a little back. We can become \nstewards of our oceans--not just takers but caretakers--and we must do \nthis sooner rather than later, as changes to our oceans pose a mounting \nand nationwide threat.\n  Let me quote Dr. Jeremy Mathis of the University of Alaska, who said \nthis recently:\n\n       This is going to be a shared threat. . . . [I]t's not \n     unique to any one place or any one part of the country. And \n     so we're going to have to tackle it as a nation, all of us \n     working together. . . . Whether you live along the coast of \n     Washington or Rhode Island, or whether you live in the \n     heartland in Iowa, this is going to be something that touches \n     everybody's lives.\n\n  So today I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment \nto authorize the National Endowment for the Oceans, Coasts, and Great \nLakes. It will not obligate any funding. We will figure out later an \nappropriate way to fund it. But at least help our Nation take this \nimportant step protecting our oceans and coasts; protecting the jobs \nthey support through fishing, research, and tourism; protecting the \nstability of our national economy, which depends on ports and maritime \nactivity; and, of course, protecting the property and the lives of the \nmillions of Americans who live and work near the sea.\n  Colleagues, you can help us become, as Dr. Ballard said, \n``responsible stewards of the bounty [the oceans provide].''\n  For those who are not sure, let me add one further consideration for \nmy colleagues, a Senate consideration. This endowment, together with \nfunding--indeed, permanent and directed funding--was part of a \nnegotiated package with billions of dollars in benefits to America's \ngulf States. For reasons that are not worth discussing and are no one \nside's fault, that agreement was broken and this part of that deal fell \nout. If you believe people should keep their word around here, if you \nbelieve agreements forged in the Senate should stick, then I would ask \nmy colleagues, just on those grounds, to support this partial repair of \nthat broken agreement.\n  I look forward, for that and other reasons, to having bipartisan \nsupport for this amendment, and I hope we can make a strong showing in \nthis body to carry it forward as part of this important water resources \ndevelopment legislation.\n  With that, I will take this opportunity to yield the floor. Seeing no \none seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Boxer.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I would like to talk about an amendment \nto this bill that could be offered later. I am not offering it at this \ntime. I am being joined in this amendment by my good friend from \nFlorida, Senator Nelson.\n  This amendment would be a suggestion about what we can do to be sure \nthe things we build have a better chance of lasting, construction that \nmeets real stress.\n  In both of our States, in Missouri and Florida, we have some \nsignificant experience with weather conditions that are damaging to \npeople and property. On May 22, 2 years ago, 2011, in Joplin, MO, right \non the Arkansas and the Oklahoma border, we had an EF5 tornado hit that \ncommunity. It killed 61 people. It destroyed 7,000 homes, 500 \nbusinesses, and damaged others. This was a huge impact on people and \nthe homes they had, the businesses they had. As they rebuilt, the \ncities tried to focus on rebuilding in a way that would protect lives \nand save money if something like that happens again by creating \nstructures that can withstand the most severe storms there and in other \nplaces in our State.\n  We have had many stories over the years. There are people who \nliterally got in the freezer in the garage or in the utility room or \npeople who got in the bathtub and then pulled a mattress on top of \nthemselves and tried to ride out the storm, and they would just as soon \nnot do that.\n  I think the term that is used that we are going to be talking about \nis ``resilient construction''--construction that has the potential to \nsubstantially reduce property damage and loss of life resulting from \nnatural disasters, homes and businesses that can withstand disasters, \nthat can protect people during storms. As more disaster resilient \nbuilding is done, there is less to clean up, there is less property \ndamage, and the insurance rates are impacted in not as big a way \nbecause not so much has to be rebuilt because not so much was \ndestroyed.\n  Those techniques, those resilient building techniques, can be as \nsimple as just using longer nails or strapping down the roof so it has \nthat one added level of security to the roof before the shingles go on. \nThere are many simple and easy steps builders can take to ensure that a \nhome or a business has the best chance to withstand these disasters.\n  This amendment that we would hope would be offered at the appropriate \ntime later would simply add resilient construction to the list of \ncriteria the National Academy of Sciences and the Government \nAccountability Office are directed to study. This adds this one thing \nto it from a commonsense perspective. It is obvious why knowing what \nbuilding techniques work and what building techniques do not work makes \na difference--the ones that minimize damage, that prevent the loss of \nlife, that reduce the government disaster aid that has to be expended \nin these disasters, that are too big for families and communities and \nStates to handle on their own.\n  While we are unable to predict when and why a storm might occur next, \nwe do know there will be other problems that need to be dealt with. So \nstudying the impact of construction techniques in storm situations is \nsomething I believe we should do. I think this would be an added \nbenefit to this bill. At the appropriate time, I look forward to \ncalling the actual amendment up or asking someone else to see that this \namendment is called up so that my colleagues have a chance to vote on \nit.\n  I know my cosponsor, Senator Nelson, is here on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, indeed I want to talk about this \namendment and why it is a good thing, but I first want to compliment \nthe chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, who is not \nseated at her desk in the Chamber, but she is seated as the Presiding \nOfficer.\n  I want the chairman of that committee to know that she must be Merlin \nthe Magician because in rapid fashion she brings the bill out of her \ncommittee and to the floor, along with her ranking member, the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, Mr. Vitter. This water bill is so important to the \nfuture of this country, and it is so important to infrastructure in \nthis country. I commend the chairman and the ranking\n\n[[Page S3145]]\n\nmember for the rapidity with which they have worn out the leadership in \norder to get the leadership's attention to bring it to the floor.\n  What Senator Blunt and I are sponsoring is common sense. Anybody who \nhas been through a hurricane, tornado, or any other kind of natural \ndisaster knows what new building codes have done. There is a fancy new \nterm now called ``resilient construction,'' and the resilient \nconstruction is making it more resilient in withstanding a natural \ndisaster.\n  I will never forget flying in a National Guard helicopter after a \nmonster hurricane in 1982--Hurricane Andrew--that hit a relatively \nunpopulated part of Miami-Dade County, the southern end, and it ended \nup being a $20 billion-insurance-loss storm. Had it turned 1 degree to \nthe north and drawn a line on northern Dade County-Southern Broward \nCounty--in other words, north Miami and south Fort Lauderdale--it would \nhave been, in 1992 dollars, a $50 billion-insurance-loss storm. That \nwould have taken down every insurance company that was doing business \nin the path of the storm.\n  We had that warning, and we saw the results of the lack of attention \nto resilient construction--in other words, the building codes.\n  As I flew over that area of Homestead, FL, in the National Guard \nhelicopter, everything was wiped out in homeowner areas, completely \nwiped out. They were gone. They were a bunch of sticks. As a matter of \nfact, the trees were sticks. There were no leaves and limbs left. In \ndowntown Homestead, there were two things that were left standing: one \nwas the bank, and the other one was an old Florida cracker house built \nback in the old days when they built to withstand hurricanes.\n  I will never forget going through and meeting the head of Habitat for \nHumanity. He told us stories about how he had a ``Habitat for \nHumanity'' sign on his briefcase, and when he walked through the \nairport, people would come up and say: Oh, you are with Habitat. I want \nyou to know that all of your homes survived.\n  They would ask him: How did your homes survive?\n  He would answer and say: Inexperience.\n  They would say: Inexperience? What do you mean?\n  He would say: Well, since our homes are built by volunteers, instead \nof driving 2 nails, they would drive 10 nails.\n  This is resilient construction--extra straps on the rafters, building \nto the codes that will withstand the wind.\n  Senator Blunt was talking about some of his constituents in Missouri \nand this tornado. Well, my wife Grace and I were in our condominium in \nOrlando, and all of a sudden--did you know that the new smartphones \nbeep when there is a national weather warning, and you pick up--I mean, \nI haven't turned it on, and it will beep anyway. It says: Severe \nweather warning. A tornado is en route. Take cover. And I look at our \ncondo, and it has all these glass windows, and I am thinking, what \ninner room can I go in? Since we have a two-story, what I decided to do \nwas go into the elevator and put it down to the bottom floor as a place \nfor taking cover. In Missouri, there are plenty of basements that are \nspecifically built for the purpose of taking cover. This is what we \nwant the construction industry to do.\n  What the Senator from Missouri and I are doing is saying to the \nNational Academy of Sciences: We want you to come up with additional \nstudies on how our people can save lives and save property with \nresilient construction. That is simply what this amendment does.\n  I would conclude by saying, my goodness, do we need another reminder \nof Katrina? Remember, the Katrina problem was not the wind; the Katrina \nproblem was the wind on the back side coming across Lake Pontchartrain \nthat caused the water to rise. The levees weren't there, and it \nbreached the levees, and that became a multiple hundreds of billions of \ndollars storm. We should have learned our lessons there. Sometimes \nresilient construction is not only about people's homes, but it is \nabout dikes and levees as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I thank my colleagues from Missouri and \nFlorida for this very worthwhile amendment. I will certainly be \nsupporting it. The plan is to have this in the second set of amendments \nfor votes, absolutely, as soon as we can proceed to votes. That is the \nplan, which I fully expect to be executed. I thank them for their work \nand for their contribution.\n  In the same vein, we are expecting Senator Inhofe to join us on the \nfloor to also present without formally calling up his germane \namendment. That way, we will have that discussion ahead of time, and \nthat also will be all teed up for the second set of amendments we hope \nto have on this bill.\n  I hope what this underscores is that we have a pretty good plan to \nmove forward quickly, to start having votes. Sometimes around here we \nwant to settle every possible discussion about every possible amendment \nvote out there. In my opinion, it is more productive to start because \nyou can't finish unless you start. I think we want to start having \nimportant votes, including nongermane votes, and get to absolutely \nevery amendment we can. I think we are on that path. Hopefully we will \nbe doing that today and then formally presenting and voting on the \nBlunt-Nelson amendment as well as the Inhofe amendment and other \namendments tomorrow.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent there be a period \nfor debate only until 5:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I want to mention a couple of things. \nFirst of all, the Senator from Arkansas and I have a very significant \namendment, and one we will want to talk about. In fact, it is an \namendment we had during the discussion on the amendments for the budget \nbill at something like 4 o'clock in the morning. At that time we were \nable to get it passed without a dissenting vote, so it is one we should \nbe able to get through.\n  I will yield to the Senator from Arkansas in a moment, but before \ndoing that I want to mention we have a set-aside amendment I am very \nconcerned with. I certainly think the Senator in the Chair, as well as \nthe Senator from Arkansas will both be very appreciative of this and \nsupportive of it since they have a lot of small communities in their \nStates, as I do in my State of Oklahoma. It uses the threshold of \n25,000 people--any community that has 25,000 people or less--in order \nto take advantage of this set-aside money that would come within the \nWRDA bill.\n  Now, here is the problem we have. A lot of the small communities in \nmy State of Oklahoma--and I would suggest the States of West Virginia \nand Arkansas are in the same situation--are not large enough to have an \nengineer or someone who is going to be able to put grants together. So \nwe take 10 percent of the total amount and put it in there as a set-\naside for these small communities.\n  This is a formula we have used before. We used the 25,000 benchmark \nbefore in the Transportation bill, in the WRDA bill, and in the farm \nbill, so it is one that is fairly well-accepted, and it provides a pot \nof money--it doesn't cost us; it is not scored--from the overall money \nto be reserved for the small communities, such as my communities in the \nState of Oklahoma.\n  I understand we are not to call up amendments right now, and that is \nfine with me, but that is one we will be offering. As I said, in just a \nmoment I will be yielding to the Senator from Arkansas. In the \nmeantime, I would call on the memories of those in this body back to \nwhen we had our all-night session about a month ago and the amendments \nthat were there on the budget bill.\n  One of the amendments we passed was an amendment that would allow the \nSPCC to have farms exempt from the SPCC--the Spill Prevention \nContainment Control Act--so that the\n\n[[Page S3146]]\n\nfarms in my State of Oklahoma and throughout America would not be \ntreated as refiners.\n  Spill prevention is a very expensive process. It is one that would \nrequire double containers for farms. This is a good example.\n  This happens to be a container on one of the farms in my State of \nOklahoma, where you have a total amount of gallons of fuel from gas or \noil or other fuels. If they are less than 10,000 gallons, they would be \nexempt. If they are less than 42,000 gallons, they would allow them to \nnot do it through a professional engineer but do it just within their \nown resources--in other words, set their own standards.\n  This is my State of Oklahoma. This happens to be the well-discussed \npipeline that goes through Cushing, OK. This is one of the central \npoints where oil comes in and then goes out. It comes from the north \nand goes back down to Texas. But these are containers that should be \nsubject to the jurisdiction that is prescribed for refiners for the \ncontainment of oil and gas. That is what that is about. This is not \nwhat that is about. This is just a typical farmer.\n  I have talked to farmers, and after that amendment passed--and the \noccupier of the Chair will remember this because he was a very strong \nsupporter of this particular amendment--we had phones ringing off the \nhook from the American Farm Bureau and all the others saying this is \nsomething that is reasonable. But here is the problem. That would have \nexpired on May 30, and all we did with that amendment was extend that \nexemption to the end of the fiscal year.\n  So if that passed without one dissenting vote, and if it is that \npopular, why not go ahead and have the same type of exemption put \npermanently in our statutes. That is what our plan is--to do that with \nthe Pryor-Inhofe amendment.\n  Our amendment is supported by the American Farm Bureau, the National \nCattlemen's Beef Association, the National Council of Farmer \nCooperatives, the National Wheat Growers Association, the National \nCotton Council, the American Soybean Association, the National Corn \nGrowers, and USA Rice. So almost everyone having to do with agriculture \nis very supportive.\n  It doesn't totally exempt all farmers because it establishes three \ncategories: one with farms where, if you add the aggregate and it is \nless than 10,000 gallons, they would be exempt; if they are in the next \nlevel up, between 10,000 and 42,000 gallons, they would be required to \nmaintain a self-certified spill plan; and anything greater than 42,000 \nwould have the total requirement, which means they would have to hire \nan engineer and go through all this expense.\n  I see the prime sponsor of this amendment is on the Senate floor, so \nI yield to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from \nOklahoma. He was doing such a good job of explaining the amendment, I \ndidn't want to interrupt him. But I thank him so much for yielding.\n  Later this week, all farms in the United States will have to comply \nwith the EPA's spill prevention, control and countermeasures rule known \nas SPCC. That takes effect on May 10. But farms are not like other \nregulated entities in the SPCC realm. Farms are unlike other SPCC \nentities the agency has dealt with since 1973. They do not have, by and \nlarge, environmental manager personnel ready to follow through on these \nregs and to make sure they are in compliance with all the EPA stuff; \nwhereas, other businesses with larger financial resources tend to have \nmore resources and more people devoted to making sure they comply with \nall the EPA regulations.\n  Agriculture actually has a very good track record on fuel spills. Row \ncrop farms, ranches, livestock operations, farmer cooperatives and \nother agribusinesses pose a very low risk for spills when we look at \nthe statistics. Many of these tanks are seasonal, and they stay empty \nfor large parts of the year. But they allow farmers to manage the high \nfuel costs they have to endure. In my State, it is mostly diesel--and \nprobably mostly diesel in most parts of the country. In fact, when we \nlook at the data, spills on farms are almost nonexistent.\n  This is a commonsense amendment, and I want to thank Senators Inhofe, \nFisher, and Landrieu for joining me in this effort and taking this \nburden off of farmers and ranchers in implementing the SPCC rule.\n  Let me cite specifically what the amendment will do. It will provide \nrealistic threshold sizes for tank regulation at the farm level and \nallow more farms to self-certify, thus saving time and money that would \notherwise be spent in hiring professional engineers to develop and sign \nSPCC plans.\n  EPA's unusual 1,320 gallon regulatory threshold under the SPCC rule \nis not a normal tank size for agriculture. That may be normal in other \ncontexts but not in agriculture. A 1,000-gallon size is much more \ncommon, and raising the threshold to 10,000 gallons in aggregate is a \nmuch more reasonable level for farmers and ranchers all over the \ncountry. So my amendment would allow most Arkansas farms--most farms in \nOklahoma, and, in fact, most farms throughout the country--to use the \naggregate storage capacity between 10,000 and 42,000 gallons to self-\ncertify rather than going through the expense and time of hiring a \nprofessional engineer.\n  I look forward to working with the bill managers on this amendment.\n  I also have another amendment. I know these amendments would be \nobjected to right now if we brought up the amendments--this is \namendment No. 801--but at the appropriate time I would like to ask that \nit be made pending.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I think some people might have an objection to this \namendment if they thought there were some bad actors out there who, in \nthe past, have violated or done something, in which case they would \nstill have to comply as if they had over 42,000 in storage. This was \ncalled to my attention, and I think in the drafting of this amendment \nthe Senator took care of that problem, I do believe.\n  We discussed this, I remember, the last time at 4 o'clock in the \nmorning when we had the amendment for the budget bill, and at that time \nwe made it very clear. The SPCC was designed for refiners. It was \ndesigned for the big operations, such as that big operation we had a \npicture of from Oklahoma. It doesn't affect them. They still should be \nand do have to comply. But the literally thousands of farms that are \nout there that are just trying and barely getting by, they are the ones \nwe are speaking of.\n  I know the Senator from Arkansas has them as well as we do in \nOklahoma, and before the Senator moves to another amendment I just \nwanted to be sure that part of the amendment was included in this \ndiscussion because that would offset some of the opposition that might \nbe there to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for pointing that out. I \nthink he is exactly right. I am unaware of any real opposition to this \namendment. There may be a little bit of opposition, but I am not aware \nof it. But I know we do have at least one Senator--maybe more--who is, \ntemporarily at least, objecting to all amendments until his or a group \nof them can be agreed to or made pending.\n  I don't think any objection right now would be specific to this \namendment. I also have another technical amendment that I want to call \nup at the appropriate time. It is not the right time now, but at the \nappropriate time I do have another technical amendment.\n  I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for his leadership and thank him \nfor his effort, along with Senators Fischer and Landrieu. This has been \na team effort. It was bipartisan. We want to help American farmers. \nAgain, the risk of spill on farms and ranches is just minuscule, almost \nnonexistent. If we look at the track record, there is a very good track \nrecord.\n  This is a good amendment, something we have been working on for a \nlong time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I again thank my colleagues from Arkansas \nand Oklahoma. I support their measure. I thank them for coming down and\n\n[[Page S3147]]\n\nlaying out the argument explaining their measure even before it is \nformally presented because that will help expedite the process. We are \nabsolutely working on that formal consideration and vote as soon as \npossible, just as we are on the amendment we talked about a few minutes \nago, the Blunt-Nelson amendment.\n  I thank them for their work. I thank them for coming to the floor to \nexpedite debate. We are absolutely working on proceeding to get to \nformal consideration of their amendment and a vote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise in praise of Majority Leader Harry \nReid. He said the following:\n\n       My friend from Texas . . . is like the schoolyard bully. He \n     pushes everyone around and is losing, and instead of playing \n     the game according to the rules, he not only takes the ball \n     home with him but he changes the rules.\n\n  Today Leader Reid continued his demonstration of civility by \nreferring to me as the ``very junior Senator from Texas.''\n  As I noted yesterday, the Senate is not a schoolyard. Setting aside \nthe irony of calling someone a bully and then shouting them down when \nthey attempt to respond, today I simply wish to commend my friend from \nNevada for his candor.\n  Yesterday I expressed my concern that sending the budget to \nconference could be used to pass tax increases or a debt ceiling \nincrease through reconciliation--a backdoor path that would circumvent \nthe longstanding protections of the minority in the Senate. And I \nobserved that I would readily consent to the leader's request if he \nwould simply agree that no such procedural tricks would be employed. It \nis perhaps rare for a so-called bully to offer to waive all objections \nif the other side will simply agree to abide by the rules, but I \ncommend the majority leader for his response.\n\n  He did not disagree that he hoped to use reconciliation to try to \nforce through tax increases or a debt ceiling increase on a straight \nparty-line vote. He did not pretend that his intentions were otherwise. \nWhen the economy is struggling so mightily, as it is now--for the past \n4 years our economy has grown at just 0.9 percent a year--it would be \nprofoundly damaging to millions of Americans to raise taxes yet again, \non top of the $1.7 trillion in new taxes that have already been enacted \nin the last 4 years. And with our national debt approaching $17 \ntrillion--larger than the size of our entire economy--it would be \ndeeply irresponsible to raise the debt ceiling yet again without taking \nreal steps to address our fiscal and economic crisis.\n  If done through reconciliation, the majority could increase taxes or \nthe debt ceiling with a 50-vote threshold rather than needing 60 votes. \nThe American people already saw ObamaCare pass through backroom deals \nand procedural tricks. It should not happen again.\n  The majority leader could have claimed that he had no intention of \ntrying to undermine the protections of the minority or of forcing \nthrough tax increases or yet another increase in the debt ceiling. But, \nin a refreshing display of candor, he did not do so, and I commend him \nfor his honesty, so that our substantive policy disagreement can be \nmade clear to the American people.\n  Let me be explicit. We have no objection to proceeding to conference \nif the leader is willing to agree not to use it as a backdoor tool to \nraise the debt ceiling. If not, he is certainly being candid, but the \nAmerican people are rightly tired of backroom secret deals to raise the \ndebt ceiling even further. And we should not be complicit in digging \nthis Nation even further into debt on merely a 50-vote threshold.\n  Finally, I would note that the leader made a plea to regular order, \nand yet he was seeking unanimous consent to set aside regular order, \ngranting that concept could open the door to even more tax increases \nand crushing national debt, and in my judgment the Senate should not \nemploy a procedural backdoor to do so.\n  For reasons unknown, the majority leader deemed my saying so out loud \nas somehow ``bullying.'' Speaking the truth, shining light on \nsubstantive disagreements of our elected representatives, is not \nbullying; it is the responsibility of each of us. It is what we were \nelected to do. All of us should speak the truth and do so in candor. \nAll of us should work together to solve the crushing economic and \nfiscal challenges in this country. All of us should exercise candor, \nand I commend the majority leader and thank him for his willingness to \ndo so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, just for the interest of all Senators, \nwe are looking at some amendments which hopefully we can vote on \ntonight or early in the morning. It is one of those surprises to the \nAmerican people that we are on a water infrastructure bill that deals \nwith building absolutely necessary flood control projects and making \nsure our commerce can move through our ports--and we have money to \ndeepen the channels and make sure our ports are working; they take \nthose imports, they get those exports; it all works; critical \ninfrastructure--and the first two Republican amendments are about guns.\n  Let me say it again. We are working on a critical infrastructure \nbill, and the first two Republican amendments are not about jobs, not \nabout business, not about commerce--about guns. So we will deal with \nthat. We will deal with those amendments.\n  But I think the American people have to listen. When our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle get up and talk about the economy, \nstraight from the heart: This economy is not creating enough jobs, oh, \nmy goodness, the first two amendments they offer on a critical \ninfrastructure bill--that is so critical to business that the chamber \nof commerce has endorsed it, that every business that is involved in \nconstruction has endorsed it, that every worker organization has \nendorsed it, the National Governors Association has endorsed it--the \nfirst two amendments are not about jobs, they are not about commerce; \nthey are about guns. So let's understand what we are dealing with.\n\n\n                           Budget Conference\n\n  Now, I want to say to my friend from Texas--and I welcome him to the \nSenate--for 3 years his party has been following Democrats all over the \ncountry, yelling at us: Where is your budget? Get your budget done. For \nshame on you; no budget.\n  And what has he done, starting from yesterday? Objected to this \ncountry having a budget because he thinks maybe--he does not know this; \nhe is guessing--that in a conference, where we try to negotiate the \ndifferences between the sides, something might happen that he does not \nlike. Maybe we will wind up saying: Yes, there ought to be a penalty on \ncompanies that ship jobs overseas. Maybe we will tighten some tax \nloopholes that allow the most successful companies to pay nothing in \ntaxes while the middle class pays through the nose. Maybe he does not \nlike the fact that Warren Buffett--one of the most successful \nentrepreneurs in our Nation--got up and said: You know what, I am \nembarrassed. I pay a lower effective tax rate than my secretary. Maybe \nhe thinks that is good. Fine. But do not stop us from getting a budget.\n  Anyone who knows how a bill becomes a law--whether they are here 15 \nminutes or more than 20 years, as I have been--everyone knows that the \nway we operate here is that the House does a budget, the Senate does a \nbudget.\n  We did a budget. Republicans demanded it, and we did it for sure. And \nwe took care of 100 amendments. We remember being in until 5 in the \nmorning. I certainly remember that. Now the next step is that you go to \nconference.\n  So I am saying here that I will be on my feet. Every time the good \nSenator from Texas comes, I will come and I will say: Senator, let the \nprocess work, do not be fearful of the process, because, you know what, \nwhen you have power--as the Senator does and as I do--do not be afraid \nof the process. If you want to make the point that the\n\n[[Page S3148]]\n\nBuffett rule does not make sense, make your point, but do not stop us \nfrom getting a budget.\n  I do not understand how any conservative could stop us from getting a \nbudget, but yet that is what we have.\n  So I would urge my friend to work with his colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle. Let's get to the conference. Let's make sure the chairman \nof the House Budget Committee, Mr. Ryan, who I am sure is very \ncompetent, and our chairman, Senator Murray, who I know is very \ncompetent--get them in the room with their conferees, and let's let \ndemocracy work. This is the way a bill becomes a law.\n\n  They have stopped us from appointing conferees for a budget \nconference. I could tell you, having been here for a while, it is \nessential that we get to conference--whether it is the WRDA bill that \nwe are so anxious to do because it is so important for jobs or whether \nit is the budget or whether it is an appropriations bill. Do not be \nafraid of the process. This is a democracy. We take our differences \ninto a conference room, and we work together. If you do not like the \noutcome, that is fair enough. I could truly say I have not liked the \noutcome of a number of conferences, but I do not stop people from going \nto the conference because that is stopping democracy. That is a \ndictatorship. I decide something is going to happen in conference that \nI do not like. Now, what if I say that what could well happen in the \nconference is they make the sequester permanent. That could happen in \nthe conference. I think that is devastating, to make the sequester \npermanent. I want to stop the sequester. I do not like the fact that \n70,000 kids cannot get Head Start. I do not like the fact that people \ncannot get their chemotherapy. I do not like the fact that Meals on \nWheels is being cut back and senior citizens who cannot afford meals \nare not getting them. I do not like the fact that people are not \ngetting HIV screenings or breast cancer screenings. That is what is \nhappening. So I do fear, frankly, that if there is a conference, the \nRepublicans will prevail and they may come out of this with a permanent \nsequester. So I could stand here and say: I object to the process \nbecause I am fearful that they will get in there and they will make the \nsequester permanent, and that would hurt my people in California. But \nyou know what, I have more faith in us. I have more faith in the \nAmerican people. I have more faith in the process.\n  So I would urge my friend to stand down on this--and his allies. I \nknow he is sincere, but I am saying that it is against progress. We do \nnot know if there will be a tax increase or a tax decrease. Frankly, I \nhave some really great ideas for tax decreases that I would like to \nsee--decreases for the middle class, decreases for the working poor. I \nwould like to see that in a conference. But I do not know what our \ncolleagues will come back with.\n  But I use this time as the manager of the water infrastructure bill \nto tell colleagues that we should come together, not only on this bill. \nInstead of offering controversial amendments on guns to a water \ninfrastructure bill, why cannot we just focus on what is before us? \nFinishing this WRDA bill--getting it done for the 500,000 jobs that \nrely on this, getting it done for the thousands of businesses that rely \non it, getting it done for organized labor and the chamber of commerce \ncoming together here. Get it done. And on the budget front, get it \ndone.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent that there be a period of debate \nonly until 6:30 p.m. and that at that time the majority leader or his \ndesignee be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is this objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Budget Conference\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, what the majority leader requested \nyesterday was not regular order. What would be consistent with regular \norder would be to send the Senate-passed budget over to the House of \nRepresentatives. And what the majority leader requested unanimous \nconsent to do yesterday did not involve sending the American people to \nconference; it involved sending a small number of people to conference. \nAnd what the majority leader requested unanimous consent to do \nyesterday did not involve simply getting to a budget on which both \nHouses could agree. I do not think there is anyone here who would \nobject to that--not one of us whom I am aware of.\n  What we do object to--what I strongly object to--is any procedural \ntrick that could be used to negotiate, behind closed doors in a \nbackroom deal, an agreement to raise the debt limit or to raise taxes. \nThe American people do not want that. They will not accept it, and \nfrankly they deserve better.\n  I have to admit I stood in a state of disbelief for a moment \nyesterday as I heard the majority leader say something to my friend, my \ncolleague, the junior Senator from Texas. I at first assumed I must \nhave misunderstood him because I thought I heard him utter words \nconsistent with the suggestion that my friend, the junior Senator from \nTexas, was a schoolyard bully. I was certain the majority leader could \nnot have meant that. He probably did not say that.\n  Unfortunately, as I reviewed news accounts later on yesterday, I \ndiscovered that is exactly what he had said. Only the majority leader \ncan tell us exactly what the majority leader meant by that. It is not \nmy place to malign his motives. If I were do so, it would run me up \nagainst Senate rule XIX. Part 2 of Senate rule XIX says that no Senator \nin debate shall directly or indirectly by any form of words impute to \nanother Senator, or to other Senators, any conduct or motive unworthy \nor unbecoming a Senator.\n  Certainly that would have been in violation of rule XIX, part 2, had \nthe majority leader actually said that and intended to do that, because \nwhen you accuse a colleague of being a schoolyard bully, it certainly \nis not a compliment. It is, in fact, accusing them of doing something \nor being something unbecoming. I, therefore, will leave it to the \nmajority leader to tell us what exactly he meant. Things happen on this \nfloor. Things happen in the legislative process. Things happen when we \nget into heated discussions about matters of important public policy \nthat probably should not happen. Sometimes we say words we did not \nintend to say. Sometimes we say things that in the moment of weakness, \nperhaps we intended to say but should not have said.\n  If, in fact, the majority leader slipped and said something he did \nnot mean to say or recognizes now that he should not have said, then I \ninvite him to come forward. I am confident my friend, the junior \nSenator from Texas, will promptly and frankly accept his apology.\n  If, on the other hand, this was something else, then I think we need \nto examine this more closely. It is important to reiterate there \ncertainly could not have been any legitimate basis for making this \naccusation about the junior Senator from Texas. All the junior Senator \nfrom Texas was asking is that if, in fact, we are being asked to give \nour consent, our unanimous consent, that means the consent of every \nSenator present, to send this budget resolution to conference \ncommittee, that it carry one important but simple qualification; that \nis, that this conference committee not be used as a ruse, whereby we \ncreate an environment in which you could develop a secret backroom deal \nfor raising the debt limit or raising taxes without going through the \nregular order.\n  That is the furthest thing that I can think of from being a \nschoolyard bully, simply making a very reasonable request that we go by \nthe normal regular order rules of the Senate in order to do that. If \nthere is any reason why my friend, the junior Senator from Texas, could \never be accused of being a schoolyard bully, I am not aware of it. It \ncertainly was not evident in yesterday's debate and discussion on the \nfloor. We are owed an explanation, to the extent that anyone was making \nthe suggestion and, in fact, meant that.\n  At the end of the day, I do not think any of us can dispute the fact \nthat we face very difficult challenges in our country and that many of \nthose challenges weigh heavily on us as Senators.\n\n[[Page S3149]]\n\nThat is why sometimes people say things they later regret, but that is \nwhat apologies are for.\n  At the same time, we can speak with absolute certainty and \nunmistakable clarity in saying that while different Americans might \napproach this issue differently, while different Americans might take a \ndifferent approach to raising taxes or raising the debt ceiling, one \nissue on which almost all Americans are united is the fact that these \nthings ought to be debated and discussed in open and not through a \nsecret backroom deal.\n  The dignity of this process, the dignity of this body, our commitment \nto honor the constitutional oaths we have all taken as Senators demands \nnothing less.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Sequestration\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I think 2 weeks ago the American public \nunderstood one of the consequences of the sequester cuts, these across-\nthe-board, mindless cuts, when they saw what was going to happen with \nfurloughs with the air traffic controllers and the air traffic service \nin this country.\n  I never supported sequestration. These are mindless across-the-board \ncuts. I certainly did not want to see what would have happened to the \nFAA happen. That was mindless across-the-board cuts. We provided system \nflexibility to be able to avoid that circumstance. But what we need to \ndo is replace sequestration for all agencies that are affected because \nsimilar occurrences are happening in other agencies.\n  The reason is these are across-the-board mindless cuts. They are deep \ncuts. To the agencies that are affected, it is equivalent to about a \n10-percent cut. This is on top of 3 years of reduced appropriations for \nthese agencies. So it is affecting the core mission of the agencies. \nThey have no flexibility, and therefore they have to cut back on their \nmission. That is what happened at the FAA. Of course, we provided some \nflexibility so they can do some other things. But we have not done that \nas far as providing relief from these across-the-board cuts in other \nagencies.\n  So we are going to see many Federal agencies having to fundamentally \nchange what they do. Let me give a couple of examples. I was recently \nat the National Institutes of Health and saw firsthand the great work \nthey are doing. I could tell the Presiding Officer many of the missions \nthey are doing are critically important to our health.\n  I was briefed on the work they are doing for an influenza vaccine \nthat will help us deal not with every season having to deal with a \ndifferent type of influenza and not knowing whether we get it right but \nlooking at one that will work for multiple years. That is the type of \nwork that is done at the National Institutes of Health, the kind of \nwork in dealing with finding the answers to cancer. I remember when I \nwas young, if you got cancer, it was a death sentence.\n\n  Now we reduce the fatalities of cancer. The survival rates are much \nhigher. That is the work that is done at the National Institutes of \nHealth, NIH. That work is being compromised by these across-the-board \ncuts that affect the grants NIH can give to the institutes around the \ncountry, including in Massachusetts and in Maryland.\n  What is happening with Head Start is 70,000 children who could \nbenefit from Head Start will not be able to this fall. Why? Because of \nthese across-the-board cuts. Head Start is a program that works. We \nknow that. The children who have participated in Head Start do much \nbetter. We have waiting lists now. Do we want to tell 70,000 families \nthey are not going to be able to send their children to Head Start this \nfall?\n  Senior eating together programs are being cut. Do we truly want to \nreduce our commitment to seniors in this country so they can get a \nnutritional meal? The border security protections we are going to be \ndebating on the floor in a short period of time, how we can deal with \ncomprehensive immigration reform. We want to do what is right, but we \nwant to protect our borders. Do we truly want to cut back on border \nsecurity in this country?\n  Food safety. The list goes on and on and on to basic missions that \nwill be affected by these across-the-board cuts. Why? I have heard \npeople say this is not such a big deal, about 2 percent of the budget. \nThe difficulty is it applies to only a small part of the budget; that \nis, basically our discretionary spending accounts. These discretionary \nspending accounts have already gone through several years of freezes \nand cuts. They have been really stretched. So the cut is condensed into \na short period of time. There is no flexibility that is given in order \nto deal with it. It is going to have a negative impact on our economy.\n  I used the example at a forum I had 2 weeks ago with a group of \nbusiness leaders; that is, if you had trouble in your business, you \nknew you had to cut back, you would look at your budget, your money \nplanned for rent or your mortgage payment, you have some money planned \nfor your family for the food budget, maybe you had some money put aside \nfor a weekend vacation or trip with your family.\n  You do not cut every category the same. You are going to save your \nhouse and make sure there is food on the table. We have to do the same \nat the Federal level. We have to make the tough decisions as to where \nthe priorities of this country need to be. I saw the impact on our \nFederal workforce. I am honored to represent a large number of Federal \nworkers who are very dedicated people working to provide services to \nthe people of this country. Many are going to go through what is known \nas furloughs. Furloughs are nothing more than telling you you are going \nto get a pay cut.\n  Now, they have already had 3 years of a freeze. They have seen a lot \nof vacant positions go unfilled so they are being asked to do more with \nless. Now they are being told they have to go through furloughs. That \nis not right. We can do better than that. This country can do better \nthan that. What we need to do is replace sequestration and we need to \ndo it now.\n  The majority leader made a unanimous consent request. I am sorry it \nwas not agreed to. What it said, very basically, is we can find other \nways to get the budget savings, but let's not do this meat-ax, across-\nthe-board approach that compromises the missions of this country. \nUnfortunately, that was objected to. I have spoken on the floor before \nabout areas we can reduce spending.\n  I hear my friends on the other side of the aisle talking about \nmandatory spending. I agree. We can save money in health care. As the \nPresiding Officer knows, the work being done in Massachusetts, and I \ncan tell you the work being done in Maryland, we see how we can reduce \nhospital readmissions, how we can deal with individuals with \ncomplicated illnesses and treat their conditions in a more \ncomprehensive way, saving on less tests that need to be done, saving on \nhospitalizations.\n  We know how we can reduce hospital infection rates. There are ways we \ncan cut back on health care costs that will reduce Medicare and \nMedicaid and health care costs. That is what we need to do. That will \nsave money. Let's implement some of those cost savings.\n  I am honored to serve on the Senate Finance Committee. Our committee \nhas jurisdiction over the Tax Code. We spend $1.2 trillion a year in \ntax expenditures. That is not touched at all by sequestration. We need \nto take a look at the Tax Code. There are parts of the Tax Code that \nare not efficient. Let's get rid of those provisions and we can save \nmoney and use that to help balance the budget without these across-the-\nboard cuts.\n  Then we are bringing our troops home from Afghanistan. I hope we can \ndo that at a more rapid rate for many reasons. But those savings can \nalso be used to close the gap on the budget problems and to allow us to \nreplace sequestration.\n  The bottom line is what my constituents want is for Democrats and \nRepublicans to work together and to come up with a responsible budget \nplan for this\n\n[[Page S3150]]\n\ncountry. They want that for many reasons. First, that is the way \nbusiness should be done. Secondly, it gives predictability; we know \nwhat the budget is going to be. People can plan if they know what the \nTax Code looks like and they know what the Federal budget looks like. \nThey can plan and our economy will take off. Predictability is very \nimportant.\n  Bottom line, what I urge us all to do: Let's get rid of these across-\nthe-board cuts as soon as possible. We never should have been in this \nposition. We have seen it in a couple agencies where the public was \noutraged and they flooded our phones. We are going to see that happen \nmore and more because these are irrational cuts. We have a \nresponsibility to act. The sooner we do, the better it is going to be \nfor the American people, the better it is going to be for our economy. \nIt is the responsible thing for the Senate to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, let me first associate myself with the \ncomments of the Senator from Maryland. We are engaging in a bit of \ntheater of the absurd on the floor of the Senate, as we have been \nchided for years now that the Senate would not and could not adopt a \nbudget.\n  Having finally done that, Republicans are refusing to allow us to \nmove forward with the process that would finally get us out of this \ncrisis-by-crisis mentality and do what the American people have wanted \nus to do for a long time, which is to sit across the table with \nRepublicans, two parties in one room, with the TV cameras on, trying to \nfind some settlements, somewhere where 70 percent of the American \npublic can find agreement with us.\n\n\n                              Gun Control\n\n  I am here, though, to turn back the clock about 3 weeks to another \nday that I would argue is amongst the saddest this Chamber has seen in \na long time. That was the day in which we went against the wishes of 90 \npercent of the American public and refused to adopt a measure that \nwould have applied background checks to the vast majority of gun \npurchases in this country, that they also would have for the first time \nmade gun trafficking, illegal gun trafficking, a Federal crime.\n  During those days I came down to this floor four or five times to \ntell the stories of victims, the victims of Sandy Hook, but also the \nvictims of, frankly, countless other mass shootings and routine gun \nviolence mainly in our urban corridors. I said no matter what happens \non that vote that I wouldn't stop, that I would come down here and \ncontinue to tell the real stories that should matter.\n  We didn't get that bill passed, even though we had the support of 55 \nMembers of the Senate. Our fight isn't over because the plight of gun \nvictims and the surviving of relatives of gun victims are not over \neither.\n  This is an old chart. It is one I had up here for a number of hours \nduring that week. It displays the number of people who have been killed \nby guns since December 14, 2012, when my State was witness to one of \nthe worst mass shooting tragedies this country has ever seen.\n  We would have to now have two charts up here to simply display the \nsame thing, because this number, which was somewhere in the 3,000s, has \nnow easily cleared 4,000, maybe even up close to 5,000--the number of \npeople who since Sandy Hook have been killed across this country by gun \nviolence.\n  I wanted to come back down here to the Senate floor this week, as I \nwill next week and the week after, to continue to tell the stories of \nwho these people are, because they deserve an answer. The status quo is \nnot acceptable to the mounting legions of families who have lost loved \nones due to gun violence that could have been prevented if we had the \ncourage to stand up and do something in this Chamber, if we had the \ncourage to take on the gun lobby and make some commonsense changes the \nmajority of Americans, the vast majority of Americans, support.\n  Let me tell you a few of these stories today, because I know we have \nother issues on the floor today to talk about. Let me tell you about \nShamari Jenkins. She was 21 years old, and she lived in Hartford. About \na week ago, on April 29, she was gunned down while driving in a car \nthrough the city of Hartford with her boyfriend. She was driving \nthrough the city when someone shot a couple of bullets through the back \nof the vehicle. It hit her and killed her. It went through her torso \nand her shoulder. She was 4 months pregnant when she was shot and \nkilled. She was just a couple days away from that magical day many \nparents have experienced when they find out whether they are having a \nboy or a girl. That appointment was just a couple days away when she \nwas killed. Close friends and family describe her as sweet and upbeat, \nwith a lot of energy. Shamari was killed in Hartford at age 21 on April \n29. Every single day in this country, on average, 30 people are killed \nby guns, many of them stories just like this.\n  The ages of all of the people I have been talking about on this \nfloor--you get a couple who are in their forties or their fifties, a \nfew, as I will talk about later, even younger--the majority of these \nkids are 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21 years old. It is a cruel moment to take \nsomebody from this world, because when you are 21 you have a vision as \nto who this person is going to be. You can sort of see the greatness. \nHer friends described her as someone who always had a smile on her \nface. Yet you steal so much of their life. Shamari Jenkins, 21 years \nold, killed a week ago.\n  There are younger victims such as Caroline Starks, who, 1 day after \nShamari Jenkins was killed, was killed in Cumberland County, KY, by her \n5-year-old brother. She was 2 years old, and she was killed in an \naccidental shooting by her 5-year-old brother. She was killed by a .22 \ncaliber Crickett rifle. They were messing around in the little bit of \ntime that their mother had stepped outside onto the porch. Her brother \npicked up this little Crickett rifle, one he used to go hunting with \nhis family. He was 5 years old, and he shot his 2-year-old sister. She \ndied. It was a Crickett rifle. It is a cute name, right? It is a cute \nname because it is marketed to kids and sold as ``My First Rifle.'' It \nis made by a company that also makes another line of guns called \nChipmunk rifles.\n  I certainly understand that in a lot of families there is a long \nhistory of hunting together as a family. The reality is that some of \nthese shootings are malicious, with the number of guns that are out \nthere. A gun lobby organization that used to spend a lot of time on gun \nsafety now spends most of its time simply arguing for laws that \nperpetuate the number of guns in society. These accidental shootings \nare happening more and more.\n  Another one happened 3 days before Caroline Starks was killed. \nMichele Wanko of Parkside, PA, lost her husband William this year when \nshe accidentally shot and killed him in the basement of their home. He \nwas giving her lessons on how to use a semiautomatic pistol. As he \ndemonstrated to her how to use one, she picked up another gun and \naccidentally fired it into his upper chest. Her screams awoke their 5-\nyear-old son, who was sleeping alongside their 2-year-old son upstairs. \nIt is not just mass shootings, it is not just urban violence, it is \nalso this rash of accidental shootings taking the lives of mothers and \nchildren that we have seen as well.\n  We still should talk about these mass shootings because our inaction \nalmost guarantees it is going to happen again. A lot of people said the \nlaw that we had on the floor of the Senate a couple of weeks ago had \nnothing to do with Newtown, so why are we talking about a piece of \nlegislation that ultimately wouldn't have prevented an Adam Lanza from \nwalking into that school and shooting 26 people.\n\n  That is true, but we know from experience that a better background \ncheck system could have prevented at least one mass tragedy in this \ncountry, and that is the Columbine tragedy. The guns that were used to \nperpetuate that crime on April 20, 1999, were bought at a gun show, the \nTanner Gun Show, by a friend of the assailants. She bought the guns at \na gun show because she knew if she bought them at a federally licensed \ndealer, she wouldn't have been able to do so. She would not have been \nable to walk out of that store with a gun. She went into a gun show \nwhere she wouldn't have to go through a background check.\n\n[[Page S3151]]\n\n  Perhaps if we had a stronger background check system on the books on \nApril 20, 1999, Rachel Joy Scott would still be with us today. Rachel \nwas an aspiring actress. Her father said she was just made for the \ncamera. She wasn't just acting, she was writing plays. She had written \none already, and she was getting ready to write another one. She was a \ndevout Christian and she kept diaries where she wrote about her hope \nfor living a life that would change the world with small acts of \ncompassion.\n  Maybe if we had had a better background check system in 1999, Daniel \nLee Rohrbaough would still be alive today. He worked in his family's \ncar and home stereo business. He loved electronics, and he had real \ntalent for it. He would make a little bit of money working at the \nstore, but he would never spend it on himself. He spent almost all of \nthe money he earned on Christmas presents. His father remembers Danny's \ngenerosity by saying he didn't spend any of the money on himself, and \nhe was upset because he came up $4 short on the last present for \nChristmas.\n  Maybe we would still have Daniel Conner Mauser with us today. He was \na straight-A student. He was the top biology student in his sophomore \nclass. He was shy, but he knew he was shy and he wanted to overcome it, \nso he joined the debate team to become more confident about public \nspeaking. He was as compassionate as Daniel was. When a neighbor became \nill, he went down there, raked leaves, and asked how he could help his \nneighbor. He loved swimming, skiing, and hiking. He was on the school's \ncross-country team, a straight-A student, and the top biology student \nin his class. We will never get to know what Daniel Conner Mauser would \nhave been.\n  If we had a better background check system, maybe Matthew Joseph \nKechter would still be alive today. He was another straight-A student \nbut a student athlete as well. He was a starting lineman on Columbine's \nfootball team. He was a great student athlete but also a great older \nbrother. His younger brother looked up to Matthew and would wait at the \nmailbox for Matthew to come home from school every day. Matt hoped to \nattend the University of Colorado where he wanted to study \nengineering--a straight-A student, a student athlete who wanted to be \nan engineer. Doesn't that sound like the type of kid we need in this \ncountry today?\n  These are another half dozen of the thousands of victims we have read \nabout in the newspapers and watched news about on TV since December 14, \n2012.\n  One of the arguments I have heard repeated over and over, both during \nthe debate on the floor and since then, is that even if we passed these \nlaws, it wouldn't matter. Sure, you say the guns were purchased outside \nof the background check system for the Columbine shootings. Even if the \nbackground checks were required, these kids would have found another \nway to get the guns.\n  Another way of putting the argument is criminals are going to violate \nthe law, so why pass the law in the first place? That is as absurd an \nargument as you can muster in this place. Frankly, that is an argument \nnot to have any laws at all. People drive drunk and they kill people. \nRepublicans aren't coming down to the floor of the Senate and saying we \nshould get rid of drunk driving laws because there are people who still \ngo out and drink and drive. There are, unfortunately, other men out \nthere who beat their wives, but nobody is coming down to the floor of \nthe Senate or the House and arguing we should get rid of our domestic \nviolence laws because some people don't follow them.\n  The fact is we make a decision as a country what standards we are \ngoing to apply to conduct. We trust that is going to funnel some \nconduct away from the kinds we don't want into the kinds we want. It is \nalso going to allow us to punish those who act outside of the \nboundaries we have set. That is why we still have drunk driving laws \nand domestic violence laws, even if some people ignore them. It is why \nwe should have an expectation that criminals in this country shouldn't \nhave guns, even if some criminals are still going to ignore the law and \nget the guns anyway. That way we can punish those people who do wrong, \nand we can have some comfort in knowing that some people will choose to \ndo right because of the consequence of the law being in place.\n  There was no consequence for that young lady, the friend of the \nColumbine shooters, when she went outside the background check system \nto get guns for her friends. We will never know if she would have made \na different decision, but why not have the law to test out the theory. \nFor the thousands of people who have died since December 14, they would \ntake that chance that the law will work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I first of all thank my friend, the \nSenator from Connecticut, for his comments today and for his leadership \non this issue which is of such enormous importance.\n  I have been a long-time supporter of the second amendment, but like \nso many other Americans after Newtown, the status quo just didn't cut \nit. The Senator and so many others have continued to come down and \nraise the issue. At least we ought to make sure we have a system in \nplace in this country to prevent criminals and those with serious \nmental impairment from purchasing firearms. I think it is the most \nreasonable of all proposals. I thank the Senator for not letting us on \nthe Senate floor forget that tragedy and that issue. I have a sense, \nand I am sure it is the same in Connecticut and it probably is the same \nin the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the American people haven't \nforgotten. There is not a day that goes by when I don't have somebody \ncoming up and saying, you have got to bring that back up.\n  I again thank the Senator for his good work. I think those of us who \nwant to put in place appropriate, reasonable restrictions that the vast \nmajority of law-abiding gun owners support will have another day in \nthis hall.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Madam President, I note a lot of my colleagues have also been down \ntoday talking about the budget, an issue some would say I have been a \nlittle bit obsessed about in the 4 years I have been here.\n  I want to come and talk about that tomorrow, but at least \ntangentially I want to raise that same issue in my comments today.\n\n\n                      Tribute To Federal Employees\n\n           Timothy Gribben, Christine Heflin, Michelle Silver\n\n  Madam President, this week we celebrate Public Service Recognition \nWeek to honor public servants at all levels of government for their \nadmirable patriotism and contributions to our country. We talk about \nbudgets sometimes and we forget that a lot of the resources we pay in \ntaxes that go to budgets actually hire Americans who go to work every \nday trying to make our country a safer place to live and a better place \nto live. Quite honestly, the vast majority of folks who work in public \nservice go about doing it with very little recognition for the work \nthey do.\n  Since 2010, when I had the opportunity as a freshman Senator to \npreside more often than I would have liked to, I used to see then-\nSenator Ted Kaufman, who would come down to the floor almost every week \nand talk about a Federal employee. When Ted, who had served as staff \ndirector to Joe Biden for close to 30 years, left the Senate, I \ninherited that responsibility from him. While I have not been quite as \nconscientious as Senator Kaufman, I have tried to make certain to come \ndown on a regular basis and call out Federal employees who deserve \nrecognition, including even certain Federal employees who work in the \nSenate.\n  Today I want to take a moment to recognize three Federal employees \nwho particularly are relevant to the debate we are having about budgets \nbecause one of the issues we all have to recognize is we have to find \nways to make our Federal dollars go further. So I want to recognize \nthree Federal employees who happen to be Virginians, who are working to \nmake our government use data better to improve accountability and \ntransparency. These are individuals whom, as chair of the Budget \nCommittee's Government Performance Task Force, I have followed in some \nof their actions.\n\n[[Page S3152]]\n\n  First, I want to recognize Timothy Gribben. Tim is the Director of \nPerformance Management at the Small Business Administration, and in \nthis role he developed SBA's quarterly performance review process that \nis now considered a best practice among other agencies. Because of \nTim's commitment to transparent and accessible performance metrics--I \nknow that doesn't get everybody's eyes shiny, but performance metrics \nis something I am pretty interested in--the American public can now \nmore clearly track the support provided to small businesses from SBA to \nsee where our tax dollars are headed.\n  Tim has been recognized by the White House's Performance Improvement \nCouncil and the American Association of Government Accountants for his \nleadership.\n  Next, I want to recognize Christine Heflin. Christine is the Director \nof Performance Excellence at the Department of Commerce and has \nestablished the Performance Excellence Council to bring together \nperformance leaders from across the Department to exchange best \npractices. Because of Christine's expertise, she is sought by other \nagencies for advice, and she leads performance management 101 training \nacross the Department to educate staff on the benefits of data-driven \ndecisionmaking, the use of analytics, and performance improvement \ntechniques.\n  Finally, I would like to recognize Michelle Silver. Michelle served \nas the program manager for the Bank Act IT Modernization Program. Under \nher leadership, the program was able to successfully modernize the \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network's IT infrastructure. This \nsignificantly improved the ability of law enforcement, regulatory, and \nintelligence agencies to access and analyze financial data to detect \nand prevent financial crimes. It is important to note that Michelle's \nmanagement ensured the modernization program was delivered on time and \nwithin budget. Because of people like Michelle and many other hard-\nworking Federal employees at the Department of Treasury, our country's \nfinancial system is at least safer now than it was before from emerging \nthreats.\n  I know performance metrics, data analysis, and IT improvements aren't \nnecessarily the subject of debates every day on the floor of the \nSenate, but regardless of how we get our country's balance sheet back \nin order, I believe that will require both additional revenue and \nentitlement reforms so we don't keep coming back to the small portion \nof our budget which is discretionary programs. Even with all of that, \nwe still need to make sure we use those dollars in the most effective \nand efficient process possible.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Mr. Gribben, Ms. \nHeflin, and Ms. Silver, as well as all government employees at all \nlevels around the country for their commitment to public service. \nAgain, I remind all of my colleagues that as we debate budgets and we \ndebate the future of our country, there are literally millions of folks \nat all levels of public service who go to work every day to make our \ncountry safer, to make our country more efficient, and to provide \nservices for those who are in need.\n  A few minutes earlier today I was with seven DEA agents who had just \nreceived the Congressional Badge of Bravery. They had been recently \ndeployed to Afghanistan. These are all people who represent the \ncommitments we fight for on the floor of the Senate.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11:30 \na.m. on Wednesday, May 8, the Senate resume consideration of S. 601 and \nthe following amendments be the first amendments in order to the \npending Boxer-Vitter substitute amendment No. 799: Coburn amendment No. \n804 on ammunition; Coburn amendment No. 805 on Army Corps lands and \nguns; and Whitehouse amendment No. 803 on oceans; that there be no \nsecond-degree amendments in order to any of these amendments prior to \nvotes in relation to the amendments; that the Coburn and Whitehouse \namendments be subject to a 60-vote affirmative vote threshold; and that \nthe time until 2 p.m. be equally divided between the two leaders or \ntheir designees for debate on their amendments; that Senator Coburn \ncontrol 40 minutes of the Republican time; that at 2 p.m. the Senate \nproceed to votes in relation to the Coburn and Whitehouse amendments in \nthe order listed; that there be 2 minutes equally divided in between \nthe votes and all after the first vote be 10-minute votes; further, \nthat upon disposition of the Coburn and Whitehouse amendments, the \nsubstitute amendment, as amended, if amended, be agreed to and be \nconsidered original text for the purposes of further amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/07/senate-section/article/S3152-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

That is \njust me speaking.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what we did. Happily, we are moving forward \nwith the first votes on amendments to the WRDA bill--the water \nresources bill--tomorrow. I have to thank so much Majority Leader Reid \nbecause he worked very hard on making sure we could figure out a way to \nmove these votes forward. Senator Vitter and I both wanted to see this \nhappen, and we are very pleased.\n  So what will happen is we will first have a vote on an amendment by \nSenator Coburn dealing with a study about ammunition. Upon disposition \nof that amendment, we will move to another Coburn amendment that deals \nwith people being able to carry guns on Corps of Engineers land that \nhas levees and dams on it and so on. We will have debate and a vote on \nthat. Finally, we will have a vote on the Whitehouse amendment which \ndeals with an oceans trust fund. So those three votes will be in order, \nand following that we believe the Boxer-Vitter amendment will be \npending.\n  I wish to thank everybody for their cooperation in moving forward. I \ndon't understand why and how we would have gun amendments on a water \ninfrastructure bill, but that is just me. This is about water \ninfrastructure. It is about flood control. It is about making sure our \nports are deepened so that commerce can flow in and out. It is about \nwater conservation. It is about wetlands conservation and restoration. \nSo I don't quite get why we are voting on guns, but it is the \nRepublicans' desire that the first two votes be on guns, so that is \nwhat we are going to do. We will dispose of those.\n  I can only say to my colleagues, my friends, on both sides of the \naisle, could we keep the amendments to the subject at hand? If we could \nkeep the amendments to the subject at hand--I know there is a desire to \nhave votes on lots of issues, but I think we all agree that for the \neconomic well-being of our country, we need an infrastructure that is \ntop-notch. I hate to say it but our infrastructure has been rated as a \nD-plus. That means our ports are not functioning as they should and our \nflood control projects are not handling the extreme weather we are \nfacing. We need to get back to work here in regular order.\n  I know there are people here who think more gun votes is the way to \ngo. That is a very controversial subject. It tears at the heart of the \nAmerican people in many ways. But so be it. Let the country see what we \nare dealing with. The first two votes by the Republicans on a water \ninfrastructure bill are about guns. Let the people decide if they think \nit is appropriate on a water infrastructure bill that deals with flood\n\n[[Page S3153]]\n\ncontrol and the adequacy of our ports and our wetlands, and \nrestoration, if that bill should be burdened with amendments about \nguns. I don't think so. That is how I am talking about it. We will see \nwhat happens tomorrow, but at least we have a path forward.\n  Again, I thank Senator Vitter for working with me today. I thank \nSenator Reid and all of my colleagues for their indulgence. Frankly, I \nhoped we would have had a few relevant amendments disposed of, but at \nleast we have a path forward together, and I look forward to seeing \neverybody then.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this past week we observed in this \ncountry Workers Memorial Day--when we pause and remember those \nAmericans who lost their lives on the job.\n  For generations hard-working people have left their homes every \nmorning or for second or third shift to earn an honest living, to \nprovide for loved ones, to put food on the table. For generations too \nmany would leave for their jobs but return home from work injured or in \nfar too many cases not return home at all; they died operating heavy \nmachinery on late-night shifts; they died working in coal mines; they \ndied building roads and bridges; they died in far too many cases from \nlack of basic fire safety, ventilation systems, and lighting.\n  I have shared with my colleagues before that over the years many \ntimes I will wear a depiction of a canary in a bird cage on my lapel \nthat reminds me why we honor these workers and why honoring these \nworkers' lives matters. One hundred years ago, a mine worker took the \ncanary down in the mine in a cage. If the canary died from toxic gas or \nlack of oxygen, the mine worker quickly left the mine, understanding \nthat he had no union strong enough to protect him nor a government that \ncared enough to protect him.\n  In those days 100 years ago, when they took the canary in the mine, \nthe life expectancy for a child born in this country was only 45 or 46 \nyears. Today we live three decades longer because we understand \neverything from Medicare, to civil rights, to Social Security, to \nworkers' compensation, to minimum wage, to prohibition, to child labor, \nto auto safety, to safe drinking water and clean air laws.\n  This pin symbolizes people who work hard and play by the rules. We \nhave taken significant steps in this country to keep American workers \nsafe and to provide them with fair wages and benefits. We know more \nwork needs to be done.\n  Since the National Labor Relations Act and the Fair Labor Standards \nAct were enacted into law in the 1930s, workers in this country were \nguaranteed the right to form a union and bargain collectively. They \nbenefited from a minimum wage and from overtime pay.\n  Today we see vicious attacks on unions and collective bargaining from \nState legislatures at the behest of their corporate and far-right \nbenefactors. We see obstructionists in this body who block even the \nmost reasonable and clearly necessary nominations to the National Labor \nRelations Board.\n  Yes, there is more work to be done. Even as OSHA--the Occupational \nSafety and Health Administration--works to ensure safe working \nconditions, job fatality rates have not changed in the last few years. \nMore than 4,600 workers--think about that: 4,600 workers--were killed \non the job in 2011. That is more than 10 a day. And 4,600 American \nworkers went to work and didn't come home that night. About 50,000 more \ndied from occupational disease. That is almost 1,000 a week who died \nbecause of exposure to chemicals or something that happened to them in \nthe workplace.\n  Given the progress we have made over the last several decades, \nnonetheless, Americans live longer and enjoy a better quality of life, \nbut there is more work to be done because too many are still denied \nfair wages and benefits, and, equally important, too many are still at \nserious risk of injury or death on the job.\n  Just days ago, on May 4, two workers in Ohio were killed when part of \na crane fell on them at a steel mill construction site in Stark County, \nOH, in Perry Township. Brian Black, Mark Tovissi, and their families \nand all the workers of the Faircrest plant deserve better and deserve \nanswers.\n  So too do workers in McLennan County, TX, where a fertilizer plant \nexploded recently and was a major story in the national news. That \nfacility in West, TX, had not had a health and safety inspection since \n1985. This disaster shows the tragic consequences of not conducting \nregular workplace inspections.\n  Fewer American miners died or were injured in 2012 than ever before, \nbut in the first 3 months of 2013, 11 miners were killed in accidents \nthat the Mine Safety and Health Administration called ``preventable.''\n  Stephen Koff, a reporter at the Plain Dealer in Cleveland, documented \nsome of the problems the government has faced--the agency in charge of \nprotecting miners' safety--the problems they have in levying fines \nagainst coal mine owners who have violated public safety rules. Yet, in \nan interconnected, globalized society, we can't turn away from these \nworkplace disasters--not just in our country but overseas. The struggle \nto ensure that workers are treated with the dignity and respect they \ndeserve is an international, universal, fundamental right.\n  We have recoiled from the stories of hundreds of garment workers in \nBangladesh who died in a factory that collapsed a few weeks ago and \nothers who died in a factory fire last year. Several brand-name \nretailers contract work in Bangladesh. They have a responsibility, once \nthe label of their retail establishment is sewn into these clothes, \nwhether they own the factory or whether they are an American retailer \nor an American textile maker that owns the factory or whether they \nsubcontract to others and try to wash their hands of responsibility, \nthey have a responsibility to work with the Bangladesh Government, to \nwork with nongovernmental institutions, and to work with the workers \nthemselves to improve their working environment. Anything less is \nunacceptable.\n  The United States has a moral duty to lead by example. We should \nexamine contracts with companies that sell products manufactured by \nworkers who have been denied in these countries--similar to the way \nthey used to be in the United States and occasionally still are--who \nare denied even basic worker protections.\n  Let's not forget the American rescue workers who put their own lives \nin jeopardy to save hundreds of people over the past few weeks in Texas \nand in the home State of the Presiding Officer, the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts. First responders across our country deserve to know that \nwe are doing everything we can to keep them and the people they protect \nas safe as possible. These are, generally, public employees. They \ngenerally carry a union card. While bystanders and others tend to run \nfrom disasters, they run toward those disasters.\n\n  Let us always remember those whom we have lost over the years. \nWhether they are public sector or private sector workers, we have lost \nthem due to their labor. On Workers Memorial Day, particularly, \nremember them, but on every day.\n  Let us honor those workers who have died by renewing our commitment \nto protect hard-working American workers who get up, who go to work, \nwho try to provide for themselves and their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/07/senate-section/article/S3153-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3153-S3155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MARKETPLACE FAIRNESS ACT\n\n\n                               Tax Issues\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, the Marketplace Fairness Act is about \nStates' rights and giving States the right to decide to collect or not \ncollect taxes that are already owed. Critics have claimed that we are \ncreating a new Internet sales tax, that businesses would have to remit \nsales taxes to 9,600 different tax jurisdictions, and that today's \nsoftware simply isn't capable of helping businesses collect sales tax.\n  Nothing could be farther from the truth. On the issue of creating a \nnew tax or imposing new taxes, we made it clear in section 3(d) of the \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S3154]]\n\nthat nothing in the bill encourages a State to impose sales and use \ntaxes on any goods or services not subject to taxation prior to the \ndate of enactment. This includes imposing sales and use taxes on \nfinancial transactions or services and any other good or service that a \nState may be considering.\n  We also made it clear that nothing in this legislation limits the \nexisting authority of States to impose State and local sales and use \ntax on and collect such taxes directly from the purchaser. As a former \nmayor and State legislator, I strongly favor allowing States the \nauthority to require sales and use tax collection from retailers on all \nsales for each State that chooses to do so. We need to implement a plan \nthat will allow States to collect revenue using mechanisms already \napproved by their local leaders.\n  I would like to ask my friend Senator Alexander to help me respond to \nsome of these concerns because he has been vocal about States' rights \nand that this has nothing to do with taxing the Internet.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank Senator Enzi for this \nopportunity, and in fact there is a Federal moratorium that prohibits \nState taxes on access to the Internet. I was in the middle of that \ndebate several years ago, and when the Marketplace Fairness Act is \nenacted that ban will still be there. In other words, today there is a \nFederal ban on Internet access taxes, and after this law passes, there \nwill continue to be a ban on Internet access taxes. This issue is not \nabout taxing the Internet, it is about the collection of State sales \nand use taxes that are already owed.\n  The complexities raised by our critics are unfounded, and I would \nlike to ask Senator Durbin what his thoughts are on these claims.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, first, let me thank my colleagues \nSenator Enzi, Senator Alexander, and Senator Heitkamp for their work on \nthis important issue.\n  Senator Alexander is right about the Federal ban on Internet access \ntaxes. I also want our colleagues to know that the Marketplace Fairness \nAct would dramatically simplify and streamline the country's more than \n9,600 diverse State tax jurisdictions.\n  The bill provides States with two options that would allow them to \nbegin collecting State sales taxes from online and catalog purchases. \nBoth options would reduce the number of returns and audits businesses \nwould have to file from 9,600 to fewer than 50.\n  The bill also exempts businesses with less than $1 million in online \nor out-of-State sales from collection requirements. This small business \nexemption will protect small merchants and give new businesses time to \nget started.\n  Critics of the bill should not get away with saying this type of \nsimplification can't be done. The different tax rates and jurisdictions \nare no problem for today's software programs. When you order something \nonline, you have to put in your zip code. The zip code will tell you \nexactly how much is owed in sales and use taxes. As Senator Alexander \nhas said, it is as simple as looking up the weather.\n  We also made it very clear in the bill that States cannot require \nremote sellers to collect sales and use taxes already owed under State \nand local law until the State implements sales and use tax \nsimplification requirements and is able to provide software to sellers \nfree of charge.\n  Our goal is to allow States to satisfy the requirement to provide \nsoftware free of charge under section 2(b)(2)(D)(ii) of the Act either \nby developing the software themselves or by using the services of \ncertified software providers. If a remote seller elects to deploy and \nutilize a certified software provider, the seller should be permitted \nto deploy and utilize a certified software provider of their choice per \nsection 3(c) of the Act. It is not our intent to allow or encourage \nStates to require remote sellers to use the software provided by the \nState or certified software providers or penalize remote sellers for \nnot using such software or certified software providers.\n  Now I want to go back to an issue my colleague, Senator Enzi, \nmentioned earlier. This bill does not expand or enlarge the authority \nof States to impose sales and use taxes on products or services. And it \ndoes not urge States and localities to impose financial transaction \ntaxes. The bill only applies to sales and use taxes, so financial \ntransactions taxes are excluded from the authority under the Act.\n  In almost 200 years of sales and use tax history in the United \nStates, no State or locality has imposed a sales or use tax on \nfinancial transactions and no State is proposing to do so today. The \nMarketplace Fairness Act simply authorizes States to require remote \nsellers to collect taxes that are already owed under current law. As my \ncolleague said, the bill is very clear and states:\n  (d) NO NEW TAXES.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed as \nencouraging a State to impose sales and use taxes on any goods or \nservices not subject to taxation prior to the date of the enactment of \nthis Act.\n  I would like to ask my friend Senator Enzi if he agrees.\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes, we were deliberate by including language in the \nMarketplace Fairness Act to authorize States to require remote sellers \nto collect taxes that are already owed under current law. It was not \nour intention to urge States and localities to impose other taxes not \nassociated with sales and use taxes.\n  Another issue that my colleagues and I want to make clear is the \nreason we included language in the perfecting amendment recognizing \ntribal sovereignty. Tribes that have adopted sales taxes have the same \nconcerns as States about the collection of taxes on remote sales. \nDuring the drafting and consideration of this legislative concept in \n2005, Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota and I began working with the \nNational Congress for American Indians and the National Governors' \nAssociation to find common ground to allow tribal governments the \nopportunity to participate in the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax \nAgreement, SSUTA. After 2 years of deliberation, tribal government \nlegislative language was included in the Main Street Fairness Act bill \nintroduction in 2007.\n  Although not included in the introduced version of the Marketplace \nFairness Act this year, tribal governments requested the ability to \ncollect sales and use tax if they choose to participate in the \nalternative system, not the SSUTA. Those tribal governments who \nparticipate in a streamlined system would agree to the same rules as \nthe States who participate in that system. At this time, the Senate \nbill includes tribal governments in the ``State'' definition. Although \nsome may disagree, I do encourage my House colleagues working on the \nMarketplace Fairness Act to further review this specific policy issue \nwhen the bill is debated in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  This is a very important issue that Senator Heitkamp has experience \nwith, and I would ask her to share her comments with our colleagues. I \nalso want to say yet again how grateful, and lucky, we are to be \nworking with Senator Heitkamp on this issue. She has been working to \nsolve this problem for even longer than I have, and I want to ask her \nfor her thoughts on the legislation.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, I thank Senator Enzi, Senator Durbin, \nand Senator Alexander for their leadership on the Marketplace Fairness \nAct and am proud to join them to address an issue I have been working \non for just over 20 years now.\n  Tribes that have adopted sales taxes are faced with the same \nsituation as States with regard to the collection of taxes on remote \nsales. Tribal governments provide essential government services to \ntheir communities, and including them in the Marketplace Fairness Act \nsimply gives them the equal footing that they deserve.\n  Tribal governments that attempt to collect sales and use taxes from \nremote sellers will have to follow the same streamlined requirements \nthat all States must use, including software and audit compliance. \nAdditionally, the software provided--free-of-charge--to remote sellers \nunder this bill can easily calculate sales tax at the point of sale. \nMost tribal governments will negotiate agreements with their States to \nprovide for the collection of sales and use taxes from remote sellers \nand remittance to the tribe. As a result, businesses will have no \nadditional burden.\n  It is important to note that this bill does not authorize States to \ncollect a\n\n[[Page S3155]]\n\ntax on sales to tribal members in Indian country. Under the bill's \nsourcing rules, read in conjunction with the definition of ``State,'' a \nsale within a tribe's jurisdiction would be subject only to the tribal \ntax, and not to a non-tribal State or local tax. It is not the intent \nof the bill to subject such a sale to dual taxation--State and tribal--\nor to extend State taxation to tribal members residing in Indian \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/07/senate-section/article/S3155-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER OF GREATER COLUMBUS\n\n Mr. BROWN. Madam President, today I wish to celebrate the \n100th anniversary of the Jewish Community Center of Greater Columbus in \nColumbus, OH.\n  Since 1913, the JCC and its members have supported Ohioans through \nphysical and mental well-being activities, early childhood initiatives, \nsummer camps, and recreational sports programs.\n  I congratulate this vital organization on reaching this milestone and \njoin many central Ohioans in expressing the deepest gratitude for JCC's \nservice to the Greater Columbus community.\n  In 1913, Joseph Schonthal worked to help ensure Columbus's Jewish \nimmigrant population had a place to come together in brotherhood.\n  He began providing meeting rooms for these newcomers and organizing \nactivities for their children.\n  In 1918, he opened the Schonthal Center and the Jewish Infants Home \nof Ohio on East Rich Street in Columbus.\n  Nine years later, he purchased 25 acres of land in Union County for \nyouth summer camps. In 1949, with the help of the United Jewish Fund, \nthe JCC broke ground on its current home located on College Avenue.\n  Today's center is named in honor of Leo Yassenoff, the son of Russian \nimmigrants, who made Columbus his home in 1912.\n  He graduated from The Ohio State University in 1916. After serving in \nWorld War I, Leo Yassenoff helped start F Construction Company, which \nbuilt many local drive-in theaters.\n  Yassenoff was a philanthropist throughout his life and donated a \nsignificant sum to the Jewish Center upon his death in 1971.\n  In 1983, the current home for the Columbus JCC was named in his \nhonor.\n  In many ways, the stories of Leo Yassenoff and Joseph Schonthal are \nchapters in the larger American story--of neighbors coming together to \nmake stronger communities.\n  Today, the Jewish Community Center has multiple locations throughout \nthe Columbus Metropolitan area, which provide recreation facilities and \npre-school programs.\n  JCC also continues to host summer camps and educate both students and \nadults on Jewish cultural heritage. It remains a hub for education, the \narts, and spiritual well-being.\n  It engages the Columbus Metropolitan area as a whole; transcending \nissues, cultures, ethnicities, races, and religions. JCC also provides \nclasses to immigrants and new Americans.\n  It works with organizations like the United Way providing services \nand education opportunities for those with special needs.\n  Throughout the past century, the JCC has grown along with Columbus \nand remains focused on its goal: to serve its local community.\n  On behalf of the people of Ohio and the United States, I thank the \nJCC of Greater Columbus for all their efforts and wish them another one \nhundred years of success.

Coach Tarkanian will be inducted into the Hall \nof Fame on September 8, 2013.\n  Jerry Tarkanian headed the Runnin' Rebels for 19 seasons with an \naggressive and up-tempo style that captivated basketball fans in Las \nVegas and across the Nation. Coach Tarkanian posted an impressive \nwinning record at UNLV with a 509-105 winning record--in fact, he never \nhad a losing season with UNLV. He led the Runnin' Rebels to four NCAA \nFinal Four appearances, and a national championship in 1990 with a 103-\n73 runaway victory over Duke. The 1990 National Championship is still \nthe highest margin of victory in NCAA tournament championship game \nhistory.\n  Not only did Jerry Tarkanian help bring UNLV basketball to national \nprominence, he aided the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, in gaining \nexposure and distinction in Nevada. It would be impossible to quantify \nthe impact that Coach Tarkanian has had on the progress and success of \nUNLV, but his contributions to the State of Nevada certainly deserve \nour deep appreciation.\n  Although Coach Tarkanian has not nervously chewed on a towel in the \n`Shark Tank' for more than two decades, he is still a beloved figure in \nthe Silver State.

Not only has Coach \nAult been an unparalleled football coach, but he was also an extremely \ntalented student-athlete at the University of Nevada Reno, UNR, as the \nWolf Pack's star quarterback from 1965 to 1967.\n  Coach Ault was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in \n2002 after guiding the UNR football program from Division II to \nDivision I-AA to Division I-A. Coach Ault restored championship-caliber \nfootball to the University of Nevada by taking the Wolf Pack to seven \nstraight bowl appearances and two WAC Championships. In 2010, he \ncoached the team to a nearly perfect 13-1 record and finished the \nseason ranked No. 11 in the final top 25 polls. Throughout his career, \nCoach Ault was named by his peers seven times as the conference's Coach \nof the Year, and became the 54th coach in NCAA history to win 200 \ngames, and the 30th to win 200 games at one school.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Coach Chris Ault for \na distinguished coaching career in Nevada. It is my hope that he will \nserve as an example of what great things a person can accomplish when \nthey work with commitment, determination, and persistence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/07/senate-section/article/S3155-4", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3155-S3156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ALASKA MARINE HIGHWAY SYSTEM\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, today I wish to celebrate 50 \nyears of the Alaska Marine Highway System as an essential means of \ntransportation to the people of Southeast Alaska. The Marine Highway \nbegan with one ship in 1963 and has grown to 11 vessels serving more \nthan 350,000 passengers and 30 communities a year, along routes that \ntotal more than 3,000 miles.\n  Growing up in Southeast Alaska like I did, or in other remote coastal \ncommunities, you grow to love the Marine Highway and depend on it. With \n656,425 square miles of rugged wilderness, scenic beauty and abundant \nwildlife, Alaska is a large and diverse State. Naturally, traveling in \nAlaska presents some unique opportunities and challenges. Unlike the \nlower 48, many of our communities are not accessible by a land-based \nroad system, and our only means of travel is by air or sea. The Marine \nHighway is a significant part of our highway system, and where \ntraditional roads do not exist, it is our link to the rest of the \nState.\n  The Marine Highway began when the M/V Malaspina, a sleek blue and \ngold vessel named after a glacier in the panhandle of Southeast Alaska, \ndocked in Ketchikan for the first time on January 21, 1963. Three days \nlater it docked in Wrangell for the first time. My father, Frank \nMurkowski, whom at the\n\n[[Page S3156]]\n\ntime was president of the Wrangell Chamber of Commerce, was aboard the \nMalaspina for its maiden voyage to Petersburg. In its first year of \nservice, the Marine Highway added the Taku and Matanuska ferries, which \nbroadened service from Ketchikan to Petersburg, Sitka, Skagway, \nWrangell and Prince Rupert, British Columbia. During that inaugural \nyear the fleet moved more than 15,000 vehicles and 80,000 passengers.\n  In 2005, I attended the designation ceremony to name the Marine \nHighway as a National Scenic Byway--All American Road, the highest \nrecognition that can be received under the Byways Program. This \ndesignation recognized that for Southeast Alaska, the ferry system is a \npiece of history, a tourist attraction, and a way of life. It is the \nprimary transportation link for many of the 30 communities it serves \nthat populates Alaska's 35,000 miles from Bellingham, WA, up the Inside \nPassage, across the Gulf of Alaska and out along the 1,000 mile stretch \nof the Aleutian Chain to the Bering Sea. It also enables Juneau to \nserve as the only United States capital city not accessible by road.\n  The Marine Highway directly affects our school system in Southeast \nAlaska. Over 15 rural schools are given an economically feasible way to \ntravel so that students may participate in competitive academic and \nsporting events. This allows young Alaskans opportunities that would \notherwise be impossible, providing the chance to interact and identify \nwith communities, families and other students from across the State.\n  To commemorate this special occasion, this summer the M/V Malaspina \nwill sail a special voyage inspired by the 1963 inaugural sailing. The \ncelebration will include community events across Southeast Alaska \nshowcasing the unique culture and heritage of each community.\n  Much like the blue and gold of Alaska's state flag, the blue and gold \nships on the Alaska Marine Highway System embody the spirit and \nfortitude of Alaskans. What was once called one of the most important \nand permanent achievements for Alaska since statehood, the Marine \nHighway has grown alongside the people it serves to improve life in \nAlaska. We share pride for our unique State, and pride in the Alaska \nMarine Highway System.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/07/senate-section/article/S3156-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/07/senate-section/article/S3156-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/07/senate-section/article/S3156-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13338 OF MAY 11, 2004, WITH \nRESPECT TO THE BLOCKING OF PROPERTY OF CERTAIN PERSONS AND PROHIBITION \n   OF EXPORTATION AND RE-EXPORTATION OF CERTAIN GOODS TO SYRIA--PM 9\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency, unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have \nsent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice \nstating that the national emergency with respect to the actions of the \nGovernment of Syria declared in Executive Order 13338 of May 11, 2004--\nas modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps taken in \nExecutive Order 13399 of April 25, 2006, Executive Order 13460 of \nFebruary 13, 2008, Executive Order 13572 of April 29, 2011, Executive \nOrder 13573 of May 18, 2011, Executive Order 13582 of August 17, 2011, \nExecutive Order 13606 of April 22, 2012, and Executive Order 13608 of \nMay 1, 2012--is to continue in effect beyond May 11, 2013.\n  While the Syrian regime has reduced the number of foreign fighters \nbound for Iraq, the regime's brutal war on the Syrian people, who have \nbeen calling for freedom and a representative government, endangers not \nonly the Syrian people themselves, but could yield greater instability \nthroughout the region. The Syrian regime's actions and policies, \nincluding pursuing chemical and biological weapons, supporting \nterrorist organizations, and obstructing the Lebanese government's \nability to function effectively, continue to pose an unusual and \nextraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and \neconomy of the United States. For these reasons, I have determined that \nit is necessary to continue in effect the national emergency declared \nwith respect to this threat and to maintain in force the sanctions to \naddress this national emergency.\n  In addition, the United States condemns the Assad regime's use of \nbrutal violence and human rights abuses and calls on the Assad regime \nto stop its violent war and step aside to allow a political transition \nin Syria that will forge a credible path to a future of greater \nfreedom, democracy, opportunity, and justice.\n  The United States will consider changes in the composition, policies, \nand actions of the Government of Syria in determining whether to \ncontinue or terminate this national emergency in the future.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, May 7, 2013.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/07/senate-section/article/S3156-4", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:19 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novtony, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 291.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to enhance \nassistance for victims of sexual assault committed by members of the \nArmed Forces, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor because I believe the \ngreat strength of our military is in the character and dedication of \nour men and women who wear the uniform. It is the courage of these \nAmericans to volunteer to serve. That is the Pentagon's greatest asset.\n  I know it is said a lot, but take a minute to think about that. Our \nservicemembers volunteer to face danger, to put their lives on the line \nto protect our country and all of its people. When we think of those \ndangers, we think of IEDs. We think of battles with insurgents, many of \nwhom are so cowardly and evil that they refuse to even wear a uniform \nthemselves, and they seek to kill innocent civilians.\n  There are, unfortunately, other dangers as well, dangers that cannot \nbe expected and none of our courageous servicemembers should ever have \nto face. That is what I am speaking about, sexual assault. That \ncontinues to plague the ranks of our military services.\n  It is absolutely unconscionable that a fellow servicemember, the \nperson whom you rely on to have your back and be there for you, would \ncommit such a terrible crime. It is simply appalling that they could \ncommit such a personal violation of their brother or sister in uniform.\n  Even worse is the prevalence of these crimes. Just today, we are \nhearing the alarming statistic that the number of cases has increased \nby more than one-third since 2010. For the estimated 26,000 cases of \nmilitary sexual assault in 2012, less than 3,000 of them were reported. \nOut of 26,000, only 3,000 were reported. What is even more startling is \nthat of those who bravely came forward and reported the abuse, an \nastounding 62 percent of them were retaliated against in one way or \nanother.\n  According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, about one in five \nfemale veterans treated by the VA has suffered from military sexual \ntrauma. That is certainly not the act of a comrade. It is not in \nkeeping with the ethos in any service, and it can no longer be \ntolerated. We still have not done enough to put an end to these \nshameful acts.\n  Today I am taking action to change that. Today Senator Ayotte and I \njoined to introduce the Combatting Military Sexual Assault Act of 2013. \nThis is bipartisan legislation that we have worked on to make several \nvital improvements to protect our servicemembers, to assist the \nvictims, and to punish the criminals. Our bill, the Combatting Military \nSexual Assault Act, will create a new category of legal advocates \ncalled special victims' counsels who would be responsible for \nadvocating on behalf of the interests of the victim. These SVCs, \nspecial victims' counsels, would advise the victim on the range of \nlegal issues they might face. For example, when a young private first \nclass is intimidated into not reporting a sexual assault, by \nthreatening her with unrelated legal charges such as underage drinking, \nthis new advocate, the SVC, would be there to protect her and tell her \nthe truth.\n  This bill would also enhance the responsibilities and authority of \nthe Department of Defense Sexual Assault Prevention and Response \nOffice, known as the SAPRO, to provide better oversight of efforts to \ncombat military sexual assault across our Armed Forces. SAPRO would \nalso be required to regularly track and report on a range of MSA \nstatistics, including assault rates, the number of cases brought to \ntrial, and compliance within each of these individual services.\n  Some of this data collection and reporting is already being done, so \nthis requirement is not going to be burdensome. It would give that \noffice statutory authority to track and report to us on the extent of \nthe problem.\n  The Combatting Military Sexual Assault Act would also require sexual \nassault cases to be referred to the next superior competent authority \nfor court martial when there is a conflict of interest in the immediate \nchain of command. This is very important. This will help ensure that \nsexual assault allegations get a fair, impartial,and thorough \ninvestigation. The President of the Military Officers Association of \nAmerica agrees. They stated:\n\n       Preventing sexual assault is a duty of everyone in the \n     chain of command. This legislation will increase support for \n     sexual assault victims and strengthen policies and procedures \n     for such cases in our Nation's Armed Forces.\n\n  This legislation would also prohibit sexual contact between military \ninstructors and servicemembers during basic training or its equivalent \nor within 30 days after the training. As we have seen, with disturbing \nfrequency at places such as Lackland Air Force Base or the Air Force \nAcademy, new servicemembers are too often taken advantage of and \nabused.\n  In these settings, new servicemembers have every aspect of their life \ncontrolled by their instructor. While this is appropriate for military \ntraining, in this type of setting it is entirely inappropriate for \nsenior servicemembers to seek a sexual relationship with a junior \nsubordinate. It is our view it is impossible for a servicemember to \nfreely give consent in that setting.\n  This bill will also ensure that sexual assault response coordinators \nare available to members of the National Guard and Reserve at all \ntimes. I was told a very disturbing story recently by a female \nservicemember from the National Guard in my home State of Washington. \nAfter being sexually assaulted during her monthly drill on a military \nbase, she took all the necessary steps, including calling the sexual \nassault response coordinator. When she called, she was told that \nbecause the assault happened during a monthly drill, not on Active \nDuty, the sexual response coordinator could not help her. Those \nservices were only reserved for those on Active Duty.\n  That is absolutely unacceptable. When one of our men and women in \nuniform is the victim of a sexual assault, and they have the courage to \ncome forward and ask for help, the answer never, ever should be, sorry, \nthere are regulations, nothing I can do for you.\n  This bill is one step to address the crises we have in our own Armed \nForces, and it needs to be done now. Yesterday's news that the Air \nForce's chief of sexual assault prevention was arrested for sexual \nassault is another reminder that we have to change the culture around \nthis issue.\n  I want to be very clear. The military has taken some steps on its \nown. For instance, I am looking forward to seeing Secretary Hagel's \nproposal on how to reform article 60 of the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice. As I think most of our colleagues know, under article 60, the \nconvening authority of a court martial is empowered to dismiss the \njudgment of the court martial and overturn their verdict. Many of us, \nmyself included, have had serious concerns about how that authority has \nbeen used in sexual assault cases.\n  We are here today to introduce this bill, and I wish to thank the \nSenator from New Hampshire for her advocacy on this issue and for her \nhelp in putting this legislation together.\n  I also wish to thank Representative Tim Ryan for his leadership and \nchampioning our companion bill in the other Chamber.\n\n[[Page S3162]]\n\n  When I asked Navy Secretary Ray Mabus about the sexual assault \nepidemic, I was glad to hear him say ``concern'' wasn't a strong enough \nword to describe how he felt about this problem. He said he was angry \nabout it.\n  I know a lot of us share this feeling. We want it to stop. I am very \nhopeful both Chambers can work quickly to do right by our Nation's \nheroes. When our best and brightest put on a uniform and joined our \nU.S. Armed Forces, they do so with the understanding they will \nsacrifice much in the name of defending our country and its people. \nThat sacrifice should not have to come in the form of unwanted sexual \ncontact from within the ranks.\n  I am very pleased to introduce this bill. I wish to thank Senator \nAyotte again for her hard work and advocacy. It is a pleasure to work \nwith her.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 871\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Let me say I wish to thank very much my colleague from \nWashington, Senator Murray, for her leadership on this issue and for \nthe opportunity to work together to address this very important issue \nof making sure we eliminate sexual assaults that occur within our \nmilitary and that the victims of these crimes get the respect,\n\n[[Page S3164]]\n\nthe support, and the justice they deserve. I am very honored to work \nwith Senator Murray, and I thank her so much for giving me the \nopportunity to work with her on this important legislation to address a \nvery serious problem in our military.\n  I approach this issue not just as someone who comes from a military \nfamily and has such great, deep respect for the military--as I know \nSenator Murray does with the important position she has on the \nVeterans' Committee--but also as someone who serves on the Armed \nServices Committee and someone who worked in my prior career \nextensively with victims of sexual assault. During my time as a \nprosecutor in New Hampshire and then later as the State's attorney \ngeneral, I saw the devastating impact of these types of crimes.\n  I also saw the real need to address what is too often a silent crime. \nThe victims often suffer in silence for fear of coming forward and not \nbeing supported when they are to come forward and report a sexual \nassault.\n  That is very important, and that is why I also supported efforts \nearlier this year--that I know Senator Murray was a very strong leader \non--to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. I wish to thank her \nfor her leadership on that as well.\n  Currently, military sexual assault occurs at alarming levels \nthroughout all branches of our military. According to the Department of \nDefenses estimates, 19,000 servicemembers were sexually assaulted in \n2011, a rate of over 52 per day. Despite these shocking figures, fewer \nthan 2,800 assaults against servicemembers were reported to the \nDepartment of Defense over the same period.\n  The Department of Defense Sexual Assault Prevention and Response \nOffice's annual report, which was actually just released today at the \nsame time that we are filing our legislation, concludes that the number \nof people who made an anonymous sexual assault claim but never reported \nthe attack increased from 19,000 in 2011 to 26,000 in 2012, nearly a \n37-percent increase. Yet the number of reported sexual assaults against \nservicemembers only increased--in other words, those who did report and \ncome forward--by about 8 percent. This is a dramatic example of people \nwho were victims but feel they would have the support to come forward \nand report the crimes that were being committed against them.\n  Astonishingly, as Senator Murray mentioned, just yesterday it was \nreported that the police arrested a lieutenant colonel in charge of the \nAir Force's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response branch and charged \nhim with sexual battery, which brought this issue very much to the \nforefront, given the fact that this individual was charged with \nimportant responsibility over the Sexual Assault Prevention and \nResponse Program.\n  It is important to understand why sexual assault is so destructive, \nespecially when it occurs in our military--of course, when it occurs \nanywhere. Sexual assault is a serious and unacceptable crime that can \ninflict lasting emotional and physical impact on the victims of these \ncrimes that can last for years and throughout their lifetimes.\n  In the military, sexual assault can also damage unit morale, \nreadiness, the preparedness of our troops. Also, military sexual \nassault can negatively impact the well-earned reputation of those who \nserve honorably, which is obviously the overwhelming number of members \nof our military who serve our country with great courage and with great \ncharacter.\n  So we must aggressively tackle this problem to compassionately help \nvictims but also to protect the good order and discipline that \nultimately undermine and support the readiness of our military units. \nWe do our military and our servicemembers little good if we ignore this \nproblem.\n  Conversely, it is very important we pass commonsense legislation that \nwill help solve the problem. But we should make no mistake that, again, \nthe vast majority of our men and women in uniform serve with tremendous \ndignity and honor, and the United States continues to be the very best \nmilitary in the world because of the character, quality, and courage of \nour men and women in uniform. But when a servicemember fails to live up \nto our values and commits a sexual assault, we must ensure victims have \nthe support they need and the perpetrators are held accountable and are \nbrought to justice.\n  That is why Senator Murray and I have introduced this legislation \ntoday. Our legislation, titled the ``Combating Military Sexual Assault \nAct,'' would expand and improve military sexual assault prevention and \nresponse resources available to the victims of these crimes. Building \non the lessons we have learned from a pilot program already in place in \nthe Air Force, our bill would provide trained special victims' counsels \nto victims in all service branches to help them throughout the process. \nThese counsels can help comfort and advise victims after the crime has \noccurred. The special victims' counsel also provides victims the \nconfidence they need to come forward, report the crime, and seek \njustice.\n  The Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Welsh, testified this \nmorning before the Armed Services Committee ``the evidence is clear'' \nthat providing special victims' counsel to those who suffer from this \ncrime has been ``immensely helpful'' in the Air Force. So every victim \nof crime within our Armed Services deserves to have the support of the \nspecial victims' counsel.\n  Our bill would also ensure sexual assault response coordinators are \navailable to members of the National Guard and Reserve at all times, \nregardless of whether the servicemember is operating under title 10 or \ntitle 32 authority. It is very important we get this in the law now so \nthat our Guard men and women get the support they deserve. We could not \nhave fought the battles and wars we have fought without their courage \nand bravery and the sacrifices they have made.\n  Our bill would also make certain sexual assault cases are referred to \nthe general court-martial level when sexual assault charges are filed \nor to the next superior competent authority when there is a conflict of \ninterest in the immediate chain of command. Right now, the way the \nsystem is set up, there is not a set mechanism where there is a \nconflict of interest. This commonsense approach would recognize the \nuniquely devastating damage sexual assault crimes inflict on \nindividuals and ensure that victims can have confidence in the military \ncourt justice system.\n  In conclusion, allowing this problem to persist is simply \nunacceptable, both for the victims and for the morale and readiness of \nour forces that do so much to ensure the freedom of this country. We \nmust continue to make clear that sexual assault in the military simply \nwill not be tolerated, and we must match these words with actions. Our \nlegislation does just that.\n  I look forward to working with the Department of Defense, continuing \nto work with Senator Murray--and I thank her again for her leadership--\nas well as my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle in \nstrengthening existing laws and policies so that all military sexual \nassault victims can come forward without fear of retribution and with \nthe confidence they will receive the support, care, and justice they \ndeserve from our country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I want to thank my colleagues for \nworking on military sexual assault. Senator Gillibrand and I and others \nare working on a way to handle these assaults which takes them out of \nthe chain of command and makes sure the prosecutors get the chance to \ndecide whether a case goes forward, and no one in the chain of command \ncan overturn a military court that makes a decision.\n  So I look forward to working with all my colleagues, female \ncolleagues and male colleagues, because this is an absolute disgrace \nfor the greatest Nation on Earth. We have to change a culture that \nsomehow is permissive toward violence against women, and might I add \nmen as well, when we look at the numbers. There is a lot of sexual \nviolence against men in the military in terms of numbers--more cases \nagainst men than women--but in terms of percentages, there are more \nagainst women. It is a terrible situation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 882. A bill to amend the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to \nintegrate\n\n[[Page S3165]]\n\npublic libraries into State and local workforce investment boards, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Workforce \nInvestments through Local Libraries Act or the WILL Act with Senator \nCochran. During these challenging economic times, our one-stop system \nhas been stretched to the limit. Stepping in to help have been our \npublic libraries, which have always been a key access point for people \nlooking for employment or looking to make a career change. According to \nthe Institute of Museum and Library Services, 30 million Americans used \na library computer to help address their career and employment needs in \n2009.\n  The Employment and Training Administration and the Institute of \nMuseum and Library Services have developed a partnership to highlight \neffective practices and encourage collaboration between the workforce \ninvestment system and public libraries, but more needs to be done. \nThere are more than four times as many libraries as one-stop centers in \nhigh unemployment counties. We could greatly expand the reach of the \nworkforce investment system by fully integrating public libraries into \nthe delivery system and providing them with the resources they need to \nbetter assist Americans in finding work.\n  The Workforce Investments through Local Libraries, WILL, Act will \nstrengthen the connection between the public library system and the \none-stop system to better serve job seekers. The WILL Act will give \nlibrary users access to workforce activities and information related to \ntraining services and employment opportunities, including resume \ndevelopment, job bank web searches, literacy services, and workshops on \ncareer information. The goal of the WILL Act is to enable libraries to \naccess Workforce Investment Act resources to continue to provide job \nsearch support in communities all across America.\n  Specifically, the WILL Act amends the Workforce Investment Act, WIA, \nto: include library representation on state and local workforce \ninvestment boards; ensure the coordination of employment, training, and \nliteracy services carried out by public libraries as part of the state \nworkforce investment plan; recognize public libraries as an allowable \n``One-Stop'' partner; authorize new demonstration and pilot projects to \nestablish employment resources in public libraries; and encourage the \nEmployment and Training Administration to collaborate with other \nfederal agencies, including the Institute of Museum and Library \nServices, to leverage and expand access to workforce development \nresources.\n  To get Americans back to work, we need to leverage all of our \ncommunity assets. Public libraries play a vital role in providing \naccess to information, technology, support, and other essential \nresources to help Americans find good jobs and build successful \ncareers. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Cochran and me in \ncosponsoring the WILL Act and to support its inclusion in the effort to \nrenew the Workforce Investment Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Coburn, and Mr. \n        Rockefeller):\n  S. 884. A bill to require the Director of National Intelligence to \ndevelop a watch list and a priority watch list of foreign countries \nthat engage in economic or industrial espionage in cyberspace with \nrespect to United States trade secrets or proprietary information, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, one aspect of cybersecurity threats from \nforeign nations relates directly to America's global competitiveness.\n  If American entrepreneurs are known for one thing, it is innovation. \nThat innovation costs money. American companies invest billions and \nbillions of dollars every year on research and development to create \nproducts that are the best in the world. Companies in my State alone \ninvest $16 billion a year in research and development. When these \ninvestments succeed American companies are often the leaders in their \nindustries at home and in overseas markets, offering technologies that \nare not available elsewhere. This is a huge competitive value and one \nthat we must protect.\n  But too many U.S. companies of all sizes are being robbed of their \nintellectual property, the engine of their businesses, and the American \neconomy is being undermined through cyber theft. Often the culprits are \nforeign governments. To make matters worse, these governments share the \nstolen technology with companies that compete with the very U.S. \ncompanies that developed the technology in the first place.\n  General Keith B. Alexander, head of the National Security Agency and \nU.S. Cyber Command, recently called the theft of intellectual property \nfrom U.S. entities through cyberspace ``the greatest transfer of wealth \nin history.'' He estimated that such theft costs U.S. companies and \ninstitutions hundreds of billions of dollars. It is outrageous that \nAmerican trade secrets are being stolen and used to compete against us. \nSo who is responsible?\n  As far back as 2011, the National Counterintelligence Executive said \nin its annual report to Congress that ``Chinese actors are the world's \nmost active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage. U.S. \nprivate sector firms and cybersecurity specialists have reported an \nonslaught of computer network intrusions that have originated in \nChina.''\n  In March of this year, Mandiant, a company that investigates private \nsector cyber security breaches, published a report describing how a \ncyber-espionage unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army raided the \ncomputers of at least 141 different organizations, stealing \n``technology blueprints, proprietary manufacturing processes, test \nresults, business plans, pricing documents, [and] partnership \nagreements.'' According to Mandiant, the industries targeted by the PLA \n``match industries that China has identified as strategic to their \ngrowth.'' Mandiant's report exposed PLA cyber theft aimed at the \ninformation technology, transportation, aerospace, satellites and \ntelecommunications, and high end electronics industries, to name just a \nfew.\n  U.S. government reports also point to China. Just last week the U.S. \nTrade Representative issued its ``Special 301'' report reviewing the \nglobal state of intellectual property rights, IPR. USTR stated that \n``Obtaining effective enforcement of IPR in China remains a central \nchallenge, as it has been for many years.'' The report continued ``This \nsituation has been made worse by cyber theft, as information suggests \nthat actors located in China have been engaged in sophisticated, \ntargeted efforts to steal [intellectual property] from U.S. corporate \nsystems.''\n  Also last week, an article in Bloomberg described cyber espionage \nconducted by the Chinese People's Liberation Army against QinetiQ, a \ndefense contractor. The article said the PLA operation ``jeopardized \nthe [victim] company's sensitive technology involving drones, \nsatellites, the U.S. Army's combat helicopter fleet, and military \nrobotics, both already-deployed systems and those still in \ndevelopment.'' The report stated that the Chinese ``hackers had \nburrowed into almost every corner of QinetiQ's U.S. operations, \nincluding production facilities and engineering labs in St. Louis, \nPittsburgh, Long Beach, Mississippi, Huntsville, Alabama and \nAlbuquerque, New Mexico, where QinetiQ engineers work on satellite-\nbased espionage, among other projects.''\n  It is time that we fought back to protect American businesses and \nAmerican innovation. We need to call out those who are responsible for \ncyber theft and empower the President to hit the thieves where it hurts \nmost--in their wallets.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill along with Senators McCain, Coburn and \nRockefeller that calls on the Director of National Intelligence, DNI, \nto develop a list of foreign countries that engage in economic or \nindustrial espionage in cyberspace with respect to U.S. trade secrets \nor proprietary information. We have done something similar under the \nSpecial 301 process for intellectual property rights infringements in \nforeign countries.\n  Specifically, our legislation requires the DNI to publish an annual \nreport listing foreign countries that engage in, facilitate, support or \ntolerate economic and industrial espionage targeting U.S. trade secrets \nor proprietary\n\n[[Page S3166]]\n\ninformation through cyberspace. That report would identify:\n  A watch list of foreign countries that engage in economic or \nindustrial espionage in cyberspace with respect to trade secrets or \nproprietary information owned by United States persons; it would \nidentify a priority watch list of foreign countries that are the most \negregious offenders; U.S. technologies targeted for economic or \nindustrial espionage in cyberspace and U.S. technologies that have been \nstolen, to the extent that is known; articles manufactured or produced \nor services provided, without permission from the rights holder, using \nsuch stolen technologies or proprietary information; foreign companies, \nincluding state owned enterprises, that benefit from stolen \ntechnologies or proprietary information; details of the economic or \nindustrial espionage engaged in by foreign countries; and actions taken \nby DNI and other Federal agencies and progress made to decrease foreign \neconomic or industrial espionage in cyberspace against United States \npersons.\n  Creating a ``name and shame'' list, as this report would do, will \nshine a spotlight on those who are stealing U.S. technologies. But we \nneed more than a report, we need action.\n  Our bill provides for more than a report. In order to enforce \ncompliance with laws protecting U.S. patents, copyrights, and other \nintellectual property and protection of the Department of Defense \nsupply chain, our legislation requires the President to block imports \nof products if they: contain stolen U.S. technology or proprietary \ninformation, or are produced by a state-owned enterprise of a country \non the priority watch list and are the same as or similar to products \nmade using the stolen or targeted U.S. technology or proprietary \ninformation identified in the report, or are made by a company \nidentified in the report as having benefitted from the stolen U.S. \ntechnology or proprietary information.\n  Blocking imports of products that either incorporate intellectual \nproperty stolen from U.S. companies or are from companies otherwise \nthat benefit from cyber theft will send the message that we have had \nenough. If foreign governments--like the Chinese government--want to \ncontinue to deny their involvement in cyber theft despite the proof, \nthat's one thing. We can't stop the denials on the face of facts. But \nwe aren't without remedies. We can prevent the companies that benefit \nfrom the theft--including State-owned companies from getting away with \nthe benefits of that theft. Maybe once they understand that complicity \nwill cost them access to the U.S. market, they will press their \ngovernments to stop or refuse to benefit at least. We will hit them \nwhere it hurts with this legislation and we aim to get results.\n  We have stood by for far too long while our intellectual property and \nproprietary information is plundered in cyberspace and in turn used to \nundercut the very companies that developed it. It is now time to act. \nOur legislation will give our Government powerful tools to fight back \nagainst these crimes and protect the investments and property of U.S. \ncompanies and institutions. I urge my colleagues to work to enact this \nvery important legislation as quickly as possible. We have no time to \nlose.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 884\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to improve the \nTransition Assistance Program of the Department of Defense, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, the Transition Assistance Program, TAP, \nprovides training to servicemembers regarding veteran benefits, job \nsearch skills, pre-separation counseling, resume writing, how to \nprepare for interviews, and other transition training. TAP is a great \nprogram; however, there is always room for improvement. For this \nreason, I am joining with Senator's Moran and Manchin to introduce \ntheir Servicemembers' Choice in Transition Act of 2013. This \nlegislation enhances the content of TAP to enable those leaving \nmilitary service to better utilize their GI Bill benefits as a way to \ntransition to civilian employment. It also makes TAP more interactive \nand provides a better fit for each servicemembers' personal transition \ngoals.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 889\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Servicemembers' Choice in \n     Transition Act 0f 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONTENTS OF TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1144 of title 10, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b), by adding at the end the following \n     new paragraph:\n       ``(9) Provide information about disability-related \n     employment and education protections.''.\n       (2) by redesignating subsections (c), (d), and (e) as \n     subsections (d), (e), and (f), respectively; and\n       (3) by inserting after subsection (b) the following new \n     subsection (c):\n       ``(c) Additional Elements of Program.--The mandatory \n     program carried out under this section shall include--\n       ``(1) for any member who plans to use the member's \n     entitlement to educational assistance under title 38--\n       ``(A) instruction providing an overview of the use of such \n     entitlement; and\n       ``(B) testing to determine academic readiness for post-\n     secondary education, courses of post-secondary education \n     appropriate for the member, courses of post-secondary \n     education compatible with the member's education goals, and \n     instruction on how to finance the member's post-secondary \n     education; and\n       ``(2) instruction in the benefits under laws administered \n     by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and in other subjects \n     determined by the Secretary concerned.''.\n       (b) Deadline for Implementation.--The program carried out \n     under section 1144 of title 10, United States Code, shall \n     comply with the requirements of subsections (b)(9) and (c) of \n     such section, as added by subsection (a), by not later than \n     April 1, 2015.\n       (c) Feasibility Study.--Not later than 270 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs \n     of the Senate and the House of Representatives the results of \n     a study carried out by the Secretary to determine the \n     feasibility of providing the instruction described in \n     subsection (b) of section 1142 of title 10, United States \n     Code, at all overseas locations where such instruction is \n     provided by entering into a contract jointly with the \n     Secretary of Labor for the provision of such instruction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/07/senate-section/article/S3167-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3167-S3168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 130--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF MAY 1 THROUGH MAY 7, \n        2013, AS ``NATIONAL PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORT WEEK''\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself and Mr. Thune) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 130\n\n       Whereas a decline in physical activity has contributed to \n     the unprecedented epidemic of childhood obesity, which has \n     more than tripled in the United States since 1980;\n       Whereas regular physical activity is necessary to support \n     normal and healthy growth in children and is essential to the \n     continued health and well-being of children;\n       Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control, \n     overweight adolescents have a 70- to 80-percent chance of \n     becoming overweight adults, increasing their risk for chronic \n     disease, disability, and death;\n       Whereas physical activity reduces the risk of heart \n     disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and certain types of \n     cancers;\n       Whereas type 2 diabetes can no longer be referred to as \n     ``late in life'' or ``adult onset'' diabetes because type 2 \n     diabetes presently occurs in children as young as 10 years \n     old;\n       Whereas the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans \n     issued by the Department of Health and Human Services \n     recommend that children engage in at least 60 minutes of \n     physical activity on most, and preferably all, days of the \n     week;\n       Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control, only \n     19 percent of high school students are meeting the goal of 60 \n     minutes of physical activity each day;\n       Whereas children spend many of their waking hours at school \n     and, as a result, need to be active during the school day to \n     meet the recommendations of the Physical Activity Guidelines \n     for Americans;\n       Whereas nationally, according to the Centers for Disease \n     Control, 1 out of 4 children does not attend any school \n     physical education classes, and fewer than 1 in 4 children \n     get 20 minutes of vigorous activity every day;\n       Whereas teaching children about physical education and \n     sports not only ensures that the children are physically \n     active during the school day, but also educates the children \n     on how to be physically active and the importance of physical \n     activity;\n       Whereas according to a 2006 survey by the Department of \n     Health and Human Services, 3.8 percent of elementary schools, \n     7.9 percent of middle schools, and 2.1 percent of high \n     schools provide daily physical education (or an equivalent) \n     for the entire school year, and 22 percent of schools do not \n     require students to take any physical education courses at \n     all;\n       Whereas according to that 2006 survey, 13.7 percent of \n     elementary schools, 15.2 percent of middle schools, and 3.0 \n     percent of high schools provide physical education (or an \n     equivalent) at least 3 days per week for the entire school \n     year for students in all grades in the school;\n       Whereas research shows that fit and active children are \n     more likely to thrive academically;\n       Whereas increased time in physical education classes can \n     help the attention, concentration, and achievement test \n     scores of children;\n       Whereas participation in sports teams and physical activity \n     clubs, often organized by\n\n[[Page S3168]]\n\n     the school and run outside of the regular school day, can \n     improve grade point average, school attachment, educational \n     aspirations, and the likelihood of graduation;\n       Whereas participation in sports and physical activity \n     improves self-esteem and body image in children and adults;\n       Whereas children and youths who partake in physical \n     activity and sports programs have increased motor skills, \n     healthy lifestyles, social skills, a sense of fair play, \n     strong teamwork skills, self-discipline, and avoidance of \n     risky behaviors;\n       Whereas the social and environmental factors affecting \n     children are in the control of the adults and the communities \n     in which the children live, and therefore, the people of the \n     United States share a collective responsibility in reversing \n     the childhood obesity epidemic;\n       Whereas if efforts are made to intervene with unfit \n     children to bring those children to physically fit levels, \n     then there may also be a concomitant rise in the academic \n     performance of those children; and\n       Whereas Congress strongly supports efforts to increase \n     physical activity and participation of children and youth in \n     sports: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of May 1 through May 7, 2013, as \n     ``National Physical Education and Sport Week'';\n       (2) recognizes National Physical Education and Sport Week \n     and the central role of physical education and sports in \n     creating a healthy lifestyle for all children and youth;\n       (3) supports the implementation of local school wellness \n     policies (as that term is described in section 9A of the \n     Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1758b)) that include ambitious goals for physical education, \n     physical activity, and other activities that address the \n     childhood obesity epidemic and promote child wellness; and\n       (4) encourages schools to offer physical education classes \n     to students and work with community partners to provide \n     opportunities and safe spaces for physical activities before \n     and after school and during the summer months for all \n     children and youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/07/senate-section/article/S3168-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 796.

WATER SUPPLY.\n\n       Section 301 of the Water Supply Act of 1958 (43 U.S.C. \n     390b) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) The Committees of jurisdiction are very concerned \n     about the operation of projects in the Apalachicola-\n     Chattahoochee-Flint River System and the Alabama-Coosa-\n     Tallapoosa River System, and further, the Committees of \n     jurisdiction recognize that this ongoing water resources \n     dispute raises serious concerns related to the authority of \n     the Secretary of the Army to allocate substantial storage at \n     projects to provide local water supply pursuant to the Water \n     Supply Act of 1958 absent congressional approval. Interstate \n     water disputes of this nature are more properly addressed \n     through interstate water agreements that take into \n     consideration the concerns of all affected States including \n     impacts to other authorized uses of the projects, water \n     supply for communities and major cities in the region, water \n     quality, freshwater flows to communities, rivers, lakes, \n     estuaries, and bays located downstream of projects, \n     agricultural uses, economic development, and other \n     appropriate concerns. To that end, the Committees of \n     jurisdiction strongly urge the Governors of the affected \n     States to reach agreement on an interstate water compact as \n     soon as possible, and we pledge our commitment to work with \n     the affected States to ensure prompt consideration and \n     approval of any such agreement. Absent such action, the \n     Committees of jurisdiction should consider appropriate \n     legislation to address these matters including any necessary \n     clarifications to the Water Supply Act of 1958 or other law. \n     This subsection does not alter existing rights or obligations \n     under law.''.\n\n     SEC. 2016.
