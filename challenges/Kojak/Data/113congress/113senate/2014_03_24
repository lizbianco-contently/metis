The first item the Senate will consider, as I have already \nindicated, is a bipartisan package of aid to Ukraine. It includes \nsanctions against Russia for their untoward actions against their \nneighbor, Ukraine. As we prepare to debate this measure, I advise all \nSenators it is customary to show respect for the President--I am \nconfident everyone will--when he is overseas. He is at a nuclear \nconference over there in Europe as we speak and it is an important \nmeeting. President Putin is not there, but he has sent his Foreign \nMinister, as I understand it.\n  As we begin debate on this aid and sanctions package, I also hope the \nRepublicans who stopped action on this legislation prior to the break \nhave considered how their obstruction affects our great country's \nnational security as well as the people in Ukraine, who are struggling \nso very much.\n  Since this was blocked by some Republicans, these important sanctions \nhave not taken place. Russian lawmakers voted to annex Crimea and \nRussian forces have taken over, in many instances by force, military \nbases in Crimea. It is impossible to know whether events would have \nunfolded differently if the United States had responded to Russian \naggression with a strong unified voice, which we did not do.\n  When a few extreme Republicans blocked action on this robust bill, \nwhich was reported out of the Foreign Relations Committee with a strong \nbipartisan vote, and then, when it came to the Senate floor, we sent a \nvery weak message to the Russians by indicating we will work on this \nlater; we won't do it now. In spite of what some Republicans did with \ntheir obstruction, President Obama moved forward with additional \nsanctions, and I am glad he did. The President is working closely with \nour European allies to impose the most effective sanctions possible. \nThat is, in effect, what he is working on today.\n  In light of such clear-cut aggression against Ukraine, which \ncontinued as late as yesterday, it is difficult to believe Republicans \nblocked that package at all, but they did and it is almost unimaginable \nwhy they did this. They blocked aid to Ukraine in order to protect the \nanonymity of their big-time donors. They are saying: We will give the \nPresident the tools he needs to help the beleaguered people of Ukraine \nbut only if--only if--the 501(c)4 work being done by the Internal \nRevenue Service and the Treasury Department is stopped.\n  That is pretty absurd, but that is the truth. It is all over the news \ntoday. So Republicans delayed this aid package for 10 days in order to \nprotect the Koch brothers and billionaires just like them. That is very \nhard to believe, but it is true. Republicans objected to moving forward \nwith this aid package in\n\n[[Page S1678]]\n\norder to protect the ability of the Koch brothers and other GOP donors \nto hide behind shadowy front groups--groups that spend millions on \npolitical attack ads. This is the reason for holding up something that \nis so important to 46 million Ukrainians and important to our country. \nIt is important for our security. But they objected to moving forward \nwith this aid package unless, I repeat, we agreed to allow the Kochs \nand billionaires just like them to continue anonymously spending \nmillions and millions of dollars trying to buy America's democracy. \nHard to believe, but it is true.\n\n  I applaud so very much the ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, the junior Senator from Tennessee, as well as the senior \nSenator from Arizona, John McCain, for their impassioned defense of \nthis bill prior to the break. No one spoke more fluently and with more \narticulation than those two good men. They joined in defending \nbipartisan sanctions and the role of the International Monetary Fund in \nstabilizing Ukraine's economy and keeping Ukraine free.\n  The measure before the body includes vital loan guarantees, \nsanctions, and IMF funding. That is what they are holding up more than \nanything else. In the work we did on the omnibus, this was one of the \nlast items we tried to get done--IMF funding. But even back then they \nwould not agree to IMF funding unless Treasury stopped all work on \nlooking at these secret shadowy groups. If the American people knew \nwhat they were doing--but they do not because they are hidden--these \nmillions and millions they are spending on ads around the country are \nhidden behind phony organizations. We couldn't get that IMF funding in \nthe omnibus because Republicans opposed IMF funding unless they got \nrelief from the Treasury Department.\n  This legislation provides money for Ukraine--direct money. It is not \nvery much. But if the money we in effect owe the International Monetary \nFund was received by the IMF, they would be able to multiply that money \nmany times over, what we put into this. As I recall, it is $600 \nmillion. This would allow the International Monetary Fund to go to \nother countries that participate in IMF funding and it would generate \nmore than the $600 million. Ukraine needs this money.\n  We had Senator Durbin on a Sunday show, Senator Ayotte on a Sunday \nshow speaking together about how this country needs our help. And \nwithout this money, the help we give will be just a pat on the back, \nnot really much help. So I am very grateful to have the support of \nDemocrats and Republicans--this is bipartisan--to move this aid package \nforward this evening.\n  I hope the obstruction will stop. I am hopeful and somewhat confident \nthis legislation will receive the strong bipartisan support it \ndeserves.\n\n\n                              Unemployment\n\n  Like all Senators, I get lots and lots of letters and emails and \nphone calls each month. Some write, some call, pleading for additional \nunemployment benefits because they have been out of work and they can't \nfind a job. The sad part about that is most of them are not kids. I \nmean that not in the negative sense. They are not young men and women. \nMany of them trying to find a job are in their fifties and sixties and \nthey can't find work because they have been laid off because of the \nrecession, depression--whatever we want to call it--and they can't find \na job. They need this help.\n  A number of these individuals have been driven into poverty. One \nthing we have to do this work period is do something about unemployment \ncompensation, and we are going to try to do that. We have a bipartisan \nbill, and I so much appreciate the Republicans who have stood up and \nagreed to help us with that.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  There are also people who call, and they are calling because they are \nhappy. They have hope. They do that because for the first time in their \nadult lives they have health insurance or they have health insurance \nthat is cheaper than they had last year. They have family members who \nare disabled and who can now get health insurance. They couldn't do it \nbefore because they were considered to have a preexisting disability. \nPeople who are disabled are really happy because they can get insurance \nfor the first time in their lives or if they have had it in the past, \nit has been so outrageously costly that it was burdensome to them.\n  Four years ago yesterday, President Obama signed the Affordable Care \nAct into law, making quality health care available to millions and \nmillions of Americans for the first time in years. I talked to the \nPresident's Chief of Staff the day we left for our work period at home. \nIn the 2 days prior to that, 80,000 people each day had signed up. Tens \nof thousands of people every day are signing up. We are fast \napproaching 6 million. Some say we will get over that.\n  The mix of people who are signing up is good. It is a good mix. We \nhave a lot of young people. There was a piece on public radio this \nmorning of a young man 21 years old who never had insurance before but \nhe said: You know, I need insurance, so I am going to buy some \ninsurance. And it is really very inexpensive.\n  Connecticut has such an unusual experience. They have two stores set \nup for people to come in and get their health insurance, and they have \nhad thousands of people who have done that. Some people who aren't very \ncomputer literate have been able to go in and talk to somebody and sign \nup. They had the example of one woman who had struggled on the \ncomputer. She didn't know how to use it very well. She came in, and she \nsaves $300 a month for her health care. So that is what Connecticut has \ndone, but there are many messages of hope out there.\n  Families have college-aged children who have stayed on their parents' \nhealth plans. Seniors have saved hundreds of dollars on their \nprescriptions because we are filling the doughnut hole.\n  I have heard from entrepreneurs who finally--finally--can do what \nthey want to do, which is go out and start a business of their own. \nThey are entrepreneurs who have been locked into their jobs, but now \nthey can leave. They are not locked into jobs to keep their health \ninsurance; they can have health insurance on their own; they can strike \nout on their own without the fear of losing their health insurance. \nWomen are benefiting from free preventive care, and people with \npreexisting conditions, which I have talked about, have signed up for \nhealth insurance for the first time. One lifelong Republican called \nrecently to say that he and his son signed up for affordable insurance \nand saw the doctor for the first time in years. They had been without \nhealth insurance because of preexisting conditions they both have. But \nnow that his insurance company can no longer discriminate against him \nor his son, they are getting the lifesaving care they need and deserve. \nIn the long run, this saves huge amounts of money for us as a society.\n\n  Across the country, families such as the one I just mentioned have \nbeen freed from the fear of going bankrupt or reaching an arbitrary \nlifetime cap if they get sick. The Affordable Care Act puts patients in \ncharge of their own health care decisions. There are many others on the \nother side of the aisle who don't want this law to work. We are \napproaching 13 million people, right as we speak, who have insurance \nnow--or are using the benefits of this would be a better way to say it. \nSix million people have signed up, and 3 million people are on their \nparents' health insurance because of this law. We have at least 5 \nmillion or maybe more who are there because of Medicaid.\n  This is wonderful. These people have health care. It is good for our \ncountry. I can't imagine what the Republicans expect done--just to say, \nOK, get rid of all insurance we have? They keep talking about repealing \nthis bill. What are they talking about? They have had about 60 votes to \nrepeal it. It doesn't work, and all the polling--which they don't talk \nabout--is now saying: I am glad we have this. There are some who don't \nlike the bill because they don't think it is strong enough.\n  All the polls are somewhat misleading that the Republicans have been \nthrowing around here, but they are still spending millions of dollars \non disingenuous ads distorting the truth about the Affordable Care Act \nand how it is benefiting millions of Americans. We fought hard 4 years \nago to pass this landmark expansion of quality, affordable health care, \nand we will fight just as hard to make sure the law works for every \nAmerican family.\n\n[[Page S1679]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/24/senate-section/article/S1679-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 2148, H.R. 3474, AND H.R. 3979\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Recommending Geoffrey Crawford\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in Vermont we have been fortunate that for \nalmost two decades Judge William Sessions has served with distinction \nas a Federal judge for the District of Vermont. In January, Judge \nSessions announced that he would take senior status later this year. In \nresponse to this news, the Vermont Bar Association, Senator Sanders, \nand I, each appointed three members to the Judicial Nominating \nCommission.\n  The commission, as one can imagine, received many applications for \nthis district court vacancy. It interviewed and vetted seven finalists, \nand then recommended to us the two candidates who garnered unanimous \nsupport.\n  I spent hours interviewing them last week in Vermont, and today I am \nrecommending that the President nominate Geoffrey Crawford, a recently-\nappointed justice from Vermont's highest court. I talked to him at \ngreat length last week and again at length this morning. I am very \ncomfortable in forwarding his name to President Obama, as I now have.\n  Justice Crawford is an experienced and well-respected jurist. He is \nknown for his modesty and humanity, notwithstanding his elite \neducational background and intellectual heft. He was a successful \nplaintiffs' attorney before he was appointed to the Vermont Superior \nCourt in 2002.\n  Then-Judge Crawford served on the superior court in our State for \nmore than a decade, earning a reputation for his skill in working with \njuries and handling a wide variety of litigation. Attorneys who have \nappeared before him, on either side, have found him to be an engaged \nand careful jurist who treats everyone in the courtroom with respect. I \nhave talked with a number of those lawyers, and they speak of his \nrespect and abilities.\n  As a lawyer, I wanted to hear this, and although I did not know \nJustice Crawford before interviewing him for this vacancy, the Vermont \nlegal community repeatedly told me of his intelligence, warmth, and \nunwavering commitment to the highest calling of public service.\n  When I met Justice Crawford, I found him to be well deserving of \nthese accolades, and I was impressed by his thoughtfulness and \npragmatic approach to the law, as was the chief counsel of the \nJudiciary Committee, Kristine Lucius, and the state director of my \nVermont offices, John Tracy.\n  I am confident that Justice Crawford will make an excellent Federal \ndistrict court judge and I hope the President will nominate him soon \nfor the vacancy on Vermont's Federal district court.\n\n\n                    Tribute to General Richard Cody\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is my honor today to pay tribute to a \nfellow native of Montpelier, VT, GEN Richard Cody. General Cody is \ngoing to be honored next month--and deservedly so--by his alma mater, \nMontpelier High School.\n  Following his graduation from Montpelier High School, General Cody \nattended and graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. \nThis was the launch of an outstanding U.S. Army career which took him \nall over our country and world and culminated in his service from 2004 \nto 2008 as Vice Chief of Staff of the Army. I am really proud to share \na hometown with such a distinguished member of our military. I remember \nhow proud Marcelle and I were of General Cody on the day of his \nretirement ceremony, with full honors, here in Washington.\n  The Codys and the Leahys go back decades in Montpelier and have \nalways been friends. General Cody, his siblings, and parents have been \namong the business and civic leaders in that city for as long as I can \nremember, and they have always shown the best of true Vermont values. \nThe General brought those values of hard work, patriotism, and \nespecially integrity to his military career, and ended that career as \nthe best example a soldier could have. Even the Secretary of Defense \nwas there for the retirement ceremony to honor him.\n  I think of this man who would often march from his quarters in \nVirginia to the Pentagon carrying a military pack just to remind \nhimself of what soldiers on the front line were doing. I have known \nmany in the military--from privates to generals. No one has ranked \nhigher in my esteem than General Dick Cody. He set an example for the \nwhole country.\n  No salute to a member of the military would be complete without \nrecognizing the family beside the man. Dick's wife, Vicki, and his sons \nClint and Tyler, sacrificed much through his service to our country. In \nfact, Clint and Tyler followed in their father's footsteps, both as \nmembers of the Army, and served as helicopter pilots during several \ncombat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am told one flew the same \nhelicopter his father had flown.\n  In closing, I would like to thank the Montpelier High School Boosters \nClub, and the citizens of Montpelier, for honoring General Cody. There \nis no more deserving alumnus, and I am proud to call him a friend.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, when the Senate last met, I introduced, \ntogether with Senator Durbin, a resolution regarding our response to \nRussia's invasion of Ukraine. That resolution, which received unanimous \nsupport in the Senate, called for a number of specific steps to punish \nand isolate Russia for its actions.\n  Among these steps we called upon President Obama to impose sanctions \non officials of the Russian Federation who are most responsible for the \ninvasion of the Crimean region. I am pleased with recent announcements \nby the White House which demonstrate that the President has begun the \nprocess of sanctioning some of these individuals, although I had hoped \nthe numbers sanctioned would be far greater.\n  I also note that today the President is in the Netherlands discussing \nwith\n\n[[Page S1680]]\n\nour European allies and partners the need for further steps. I trust \nand hope he will be successful in reaching a firm consensus with our \nallies and friends to define a strong united response to Russian \naggression.\n  Further, I also welcome such provisions in the legislation that is \nnow pending in the Senate, the Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, \nDemocracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014, which I trust \nand hope the Senate will be acting on beginning this evening and \nperhaps extending into this week.\n  I would note time is somewhat of the essence. If we are going to send \na message to Russia, certainly we don't want to be bogged down in \ninternal delay over nonrelated or only slightly related issues. In \nfact, that is why Senator Durbin and I moved our provisions forward \nbefore the Senate adjourned for the break, simply to make sure there \nwas a united, bipartisan Senate unanimously approved agreement on 15 \nmeasures that would get the message to Vladimir Putin and the Russians \nthat we take this very seriously.\n  The legislation we will be dealing with also sanctions the Russians \nresponsible for this recent aggression by prohibiting them from coming \nto the United States and freezing their assets in America. Our European \nallies have done likewise, and together we have begun to respond to \nRussia's outrageous behavior.\n  However, it is my strong belief that much more needs to be done. We \nand our European allies must recognize the enormity of Putin's crime as \nhe rejects all modern standards of responsible international behavior \nand tramples on the sanctity of the territorial borders so vital to the \nstability of the postwar order.\n  The international response must be more vigorous if we are to prove \nthat Putin's behavior is unacceptable and cannot be repeated. A strong \nresponse now is the best way to reassure our allies and friends who are \nprecariously placed on Russia's borders that this outrage must be \nstopped, reversed, and ended. Conversely, to do little more than \nprevent a handful of Russian officials traveling abroad will show Putin \nand his cronies that in the end we actually do not mean what we say.\n  Again, the international response needs to be, has to be, much more \nvigorous if we are to prove that we stand together and united, one \nvoice, claiming that the behavior of President Putin is unacceptable \nand cannot be repeated.\n  When Senator Durbin and I introduced our prior resolution on this \nsubject, we signaled our willingness to work with the administration to \ncraft more punishing sanctions, including economic sanctions possibly \ntargeting key sectors of the Russian economy, and I believe many of us \nhere in the Senate on both sides of the aisle want to do more. I have \nsuggested a range of provisions that would reduce Russia's oil and gas \nexports--which contribute a very significant amount to their economy \nand are therefore very dependent--I hope the President is discussing \nthose very measures in Europe with our partners as we speak.\n  We are all aware that sanctioning key Russian economic activities \ncarries the possibility that our economic interests and those of our \nEuropean allies could be affected at the same time. While this is \nreason for us to be thoughtful in terms of how we move forward, it is \nnot a reason for inaction. It should not be the basis for our standing \nby and watching what is happening and simply saying: Well, this could \npotentially affect us economically back at home and therefore excuse \nthe actions and probably enable further actions by our Russian \nadversary in this case.\n  In the end, unpunished, unconstrained, rampant Russian territorial \nexpansion will threaten us all to a much greater extent. Doing \nsomething now could prevent something much worse later. Standing up now \ncould prevent something much more serious in terms of what we might \nhave to do later. Sound policy decisions must reflect full assessments \nof all eventual consequences, and that includes a clear picture of what \nthe world will look like if illegal, forceful annexation of a \nneighbor's territory is ignored or met only with a rap on the knuckles.\n  I continue to believe we can and must do more to isolate Russia. This \nincludes, for example, explicitly expelling Russia from the G8--not \ntemporarily but explicitly expelling them and ending the NATO-Russia \nCouncil.\n  In addition, I am proposing today a specific economic sanction that \nwill harm Russian interests in a serious way and, hopefully, with \nminimal or no damage to our own. I am introducing an amendment to \nUkraine aid bill and I trust it will find broad bipartisan support. The \npurpose of this amendment is to sanction Russia's Rosoboronexport, the \nsole state agency for export of Russian weapon systems and defense-\nrelated goods. This is a state corporation exclusively entitled to \nexport the entire range of Russian armaments officially allowed for \nexport. It was set up for that purpose. It was set up by President \nPutin. It is a state-owned enterprise and its business is sending \nRussian arms around the world--some to very bad actors.\n  Many of our colleagues here in the Senate know of this arms export \nagency because of Russia's continuing supply of arms to Assad's regime \nin Syria. Many here have repeatedly called on the administration to \nstop all cooperation with Rosoboronexport for that reason. We now have \na new, broader reason for ending all cooperation with this export \nagency of Russia. To take steps to meaningfully obstruct that agency's \nwork and the income it provides the Russian state will become the most \neffective ways we have of demonstrating our condemnation of Russian \naction by force of arms.\n  Let me briefly explain my amendment. It does three things: First, it \nprohibits the U.S. Government from doing any business with this Russian \nagency by prohibiting future contracts and canceling past contracts.\n  It is true the recent National Defense Authorization Act, which I \nsupported, also includes similar language. But that act includes a \nwaiver authority and another work-around provision the Defense \nDepartment has been using in order to buy Russian helicopters for \nAfghanistan. This practice has met with objection. It was objectionable \nwhen it began and it became more objectionable as the Russians \ncontinued to supply Assad. Now, based on what they have done in Crimea, \nit should be entirely unacceptable.\n  Also, I just learned this morning that President Karzai announced his \nsupport for the Russian annexation of Crimea and approval of Russian \nactions, which makes our purchase of Russian weapons for the Karzai \nregime even more outrageous. After all we have done to support \nPresident Karzai and the Afghans with U.S. tax dollars and the lives \nand injuries to U.S. and coalition soldiers--after all we have done \nover a decade of time--President Karzai reaches out and publicly \nsupports the Russian action, contrary to ours. Russia is the nation \nwhich pillaged Afghanistan for a decade. It is beyond belief that \nPresident Karzai can support, along with countries such as Syria and \nVenezuela--haven't heard from Cuba yet, but probably will--the Russian \naction when we are there trying to save his hide not only with our tax \ndollars but with our soldiers' lives.\n  So my amendment takes away this waiver and would put a complete end \nto Karzai's business dealings with the Russians. Karzai will have to \nbuy his Russian helicopters with his own money, not ours.\n  Secondly, I propose this amendment will prohibit contracts with any \ndomestic or foreign company that cooperates with Rosoboronexport in the \ndesign, manufacture, or military development of military equipment. \nOther types of business dealings with the corporation for nonmilitary \nactivities would not be affected. We are going after the military \nexports, many of which go to some of our sworn enemies.\n  Third, I propose to authorize the President to deduct from our \nforeign assistance programs any amount that a foreign state recipient \nspends on Russian weapons through Rosoboronexport. These deductions \nwould be made from the Economic Support Fund and security assistance \naccounts but would not affect other aid programs. The President would \nbe authorized to reprogram such funds for use elsewhere subject to \ncongressional notification.\n  If a USAID recipient is tempted to use some of our money to buy \nRussian weapons, they need to know we would deduct that amount from our \nassistance programs. They can buy Russian\n\n[[Page S1681]]\n\nweapons on their own dime, not on our dime.\n  Taken together, I believe these proposals would be a very useful \naddition to the Ukraine aid act and give it the additional teeth it \nneeds. This amendment would harm the Russian arms industry, the Russian \neconomy, Russian prestige, and Putin's standing in the world. That \nought to be our goal. Whether it is my amendment, any other amendment, \nor whether it is the act we will be debating, it needs to harm the \nRussian arms industry, the Russian energy portion of the economy, \nRussian prestige, and Putin's standing in the world.\n  This amendment will serve as a concrete and immediate response to the \nillegal invasion perpetrated by the Russian Federation. I urge the \nmajority leader to permit a full debate, an up-or-down vote on my \namendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I rise today to support the Ukraine \nassistance package, which will be on the floor for a vote later this \nevening. I want to thank the leadership of Senator Menendez and all the \ngreat work Senator Corker has put into this bill. I was proud to help \nput it together, along with Senators Johnson, McCain, and many others \nwho were part of our debate in the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I come to the floor, as I am sure others have and will over the \ncourse of this afternoon, to talk about the vital importance of a big \nbipartisan vote in favor of this legislation this evening.\n  Having just come from Ukraine--I was there this last weekend with a \nnumber of my colleagues, and it was my second trip to Kiev in the last \n3 months--I can tell you they are awaiting a very strong signal of \nsupport from the U.S. Congress that will send a message we are going to \nstand together with our Ukrainian brothers and sisters as they engage \nin this epic battle for their independence, for their freedom, and for \ntheir sovereignty.\n  I won't belabor the underlying details of the bill, but the three \ncomponents of the legislation are all equally important to Ukraine. We \nheard support for all three of these pieces while we were there over \nthis last weekend.\n  First and foremost, clearly, we have to deliver on our promise of \neconomic aid. There is $1 billion of loan guarantees in this bill, and \nit is contingent upon the signing of a new agreement with the IMF, but \nit will also leverage about $15 billion in funds from Europe. This is \nimportant because even before this crisis precipitated by the Russian \ninvasion of Crimea, Ukraine's economy was incredibly fragile, and this \ninternational crisis has done nothing but to further weaken the \ncountry.\n  Ukrainians have a new government--one they have faith in, one they \ncan believe in--that will finally bring an end to the corruption which \nhas been rife throughout the Ukrainian Government over the past decade. \nBut this new government will be undermined by an economic crisis that \nwill occur, guaranteed, unless the United States steps up and provides \nthis assistance. But we can't do it alone, and so that is why the \nsecond component of this bill would allow the United States to agree to \na set of IMF reforms that would dramatically increase the amount of \nfunding the IMF has to provide countries in crisis, such as Ukraine.\n  Every other IMF member has signed on to these reforms except for the \nUnited States, and it has been largely due to the intransigence of this \nbody that the United States stands on the sidelines. Some people have \ncategorized the IMF reform component of this bill as superfluous, as a \npolitical add-on. That couldn't be further from the truth. When we were \nmeeting with Ukrainian officials in this new government last weekend, \nthey specifically asked that we pass the IMF reforms, because they know \nthe only way they get an assistance package that is in the neighborhood \nof $20 billion or $30 billion is through the IMF. And the IMF will be \nmuch more likely able to provide that if the United States steps up and \nagrees to these reforms.\n  Lastly, we need to send a strong, clear message to Russia there are \nconsequences for their actions in Crimea. By giving the President the \nauthorization to move forward on a broad range of sanctions, we will \nshow that Putin was wrong when he calculated that a march into Crimea \nwould come at little to no cost to Russia.\n  I want to talk for a minute about what this really tells us about the \nstatus of Russia in the region and in the world. I am sure my other \ncolleagues will come down to talk about the importance of sanctions and \nhow they may change the calculuses being made in Russia and Moscow \ntoday.\n  I have watched the media portray the events of the last couple of \nweeks as some sign of Russian strength. To me, this isn't a sign of \nRussian strength, this is a sign of Russian weakness.\n  Putin has designs for reestablishing some sense of the old Soviet \nempire by reasserting control over what Putin calls the near abroad, \nwhich are the former Soviet republics and Soviet satellite states. His \ndream of reestablishing the Soviet empire fell apart the day President \nYanukovych fled Kiev.\n  Ukraine is the crown jewel of the near abroad. As Putin tried to \nrecreate that empire under the guise of something called the customs \nunion, he knew he couldn't do it without the second biggest country in \nEurope bordering on Russia--Ukraine. His invasion of Crimea was a \npanicked reaction to this new reality--a Ukraine now oriented toward \nthe European Union.\n  So today, I think it is important to understand the position Putin is \nin. He has made a mess for the international community to try to clean \nup through his invasion of Crimea.\n  Crimea represents 2 million people in a country of 45 million, and 90 \npercent of Ukraine has a government in Kiev which just signed an \nassociation agreement with the European Union. Russia's economy is \ngoing to hemorrhage if he continues the occupation of Crimea through a \nbroad-based set of international sanctions. He has become a pariah in \nthe world community.\n  I agree with my colleague from Indiana: We shouldn't just be talking \nabout removing Russia from the G8; we should take Russia out of the G8 \nand make it completely clear to them that they don't have a place at \nthe international table along with countries such as the United States, \nFrance, Germany, and England if they behave in this way.\n  The bill we are debating today will give the President and new \ngovernment in Kiev tools with which to try to address and perhaps end \nthis crisis. But it is important to remember that this is not about \nreestablishing the Cold War. The world is oriented along paradigms that \nhave nothing to do with who is with the United States and who is with \nRussia. This panicked invasion of Crimea, while rightly occupying the \nheadlines on a nightly basis, is a display of Russia's weak position in \nthe region and the world after the failure of their puppet government \nin Kiev to survive.\n  Lastly, I will talk about the broader history, both looking in the \npast but also looking to the future, we may miss when we concentrate on \nan hour-by-hour basis on the crisis at hand.\n  Having had the opportunity to visit Kiev a few times in the past \nseveral months, I have had the opportunity to learn a little bit about \nthe history of the place and of the people. There is a wonderful \ncathedral in Kiev called the Church of St. Sophia. It is absolutely \nstunningly beautiful. It was built by Ukraine's greatest leader, \nYaroslav the Wise. He presided over an empire which was at the time \ncalled Kievan Rus. Kievan Rus was essentially the hub of trading on the \nEurasian continent. It took goods from the east and transported them to \nthe west. It took goods from the Scandinavian countries and transported \nthem down to the Mediterranean. Everything ran through the territory of \nKievan Rus. It speaks to Ukraine's past but also to its future.\n  They have been set up with a false choice within the crisis of the \nlast several months: Join the European Union or stay aligned with \nRussia. But what we know is that Kiev historically has stood at the \ncrossroads--not just east and west but of east and west and north and \nsouth. This is Ukraine's past, but it is also going to be Ukraine's \nfuture.\n  While we try to deal today with a Russia run by a leader whose \nforeign policy seems dictated by a desire to poke a stick in the eye of \nthe United States, I ultimately think viewing the\n\n[[Page S1682]]\n\nforest through the trees also means acknowledging that Russia's future \nultimately, in a post-Putin era, is about integration with Europe and \nintegration with the West as well. Frankly, this is the direction \nRussia was heading until Putin took power.\n  The conversation about how we realize that ultimate paradigm is a \nconversation for another day. But when Senator McCain and I went to \nKiev in December and stood on the stage speaking to a million \nUkrainians who had come down to the square to protest the current \ngovernment, they were there to talk about one concept: dignity. For \nsome it was about Europe, for some it was about corruption, and for \nsome it was about the brutal violence on the square displayed by \nYanukovych. For most people, they wanted to restore dignity to their \nlives, and what dignity really is about in the end is the ability to \nchoose for yourself what your future is. This is why we are here to \nsupport Ukraine.\n  No country--the United States, the Russian Federation, Germany--\nshould dictate to the Ukrainians what their future should be. That is \nwhy, in the wake of the invasion, in the wake of years of economic \nmanipulation from Russia, we are going to extend a firm hand to the \nUkrainians with an assistance package and a message of economic \nconsequences to Russia.\n  The world we envision ultimately is one not only where Ukraine gets \nto go back to its historical routes and draw from east and west but one \nin which Russia realizes that their economic salvation lies not in \nsetting up some new Cold War but in fully integrating themselves, their \neconomy, and their political institutions not only with countries such \nas Ukraine, not only with the nations of the EU, but beyond to American \nshores as well. This is the future.\n  But that reality will never exist for the young nation of Ukraine \nunless it survives this moment. And we can send a strong message this \nevening that this body stands with that future for this young nation of \nUkraine by supporting the package before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                        Internal Revenue Service\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, while I realize Members of this body \nare very concerned about the situation in the Ukraine today and we are \nfocused on the crisis happening there, I wish to take a few minutes to \ndiscuss two bills I have recently introduced that deal with reforms to \nthe Internal Revenue Service.\n  As the Federal agency tasked with administering the U.S. Tax Code, \nthe IRS has extraordinary influence on the lives of Americans from all \nwalks of life and all points of view. Citizens have the absolute right \nto expect the IRS to be free from political influence, with taxpayers \ntreated fairly and enforcement carried out in an unbiased manner. \nUnfortunately, we have learned our expectations sometimes are very \ndifferent from reality.\n  In early 2013 the IRS acknowledged a history of targeting politically \nactive groups as some of these groups sought tax-exempt status. This \npractice first involved flagging groups concerned about government \nspending and debt. Ironically, the targeting came at a time when poll \nafter poll indicated that the Federal Government's out-of-control \nspending and our $17 trillion debt were top concerns for all Americans, \nand from my experience, they are the top concerns for Nebraskans as \nwell.\n  Despite these legitimate concerns and the patriotic desire of \nAmericans to effect change in government, the IRS worked to impede \nthese organizations from full participation in our democratic process. \nTo do so, the IRS dragged its feet and slow-walked applications for \ntax-exempt status, asking questions that weren't necessary, including \nquestions regarding political beliefs. That is why I recently \nintroduced S. 2043, the Stop IRS Overreach Act. This bill states that \nthe IRS shall not ask any taxpayer any question regarding their \nreligious, political, or social beliefs. This is a pretty \nstraightforward concept, and it is an American concept. It shouldn't \nmatter who you are or what you believe--we should all be treated \nequally before the law.\n  Given the recent behavior of the IRS, it appears this legislation is \nnecessary. I believe this measure should enjoy support from both \nparties. It is worth noting that the legislation passed the House of \nRepresentatives on a voice vote.\n  American taxpayers are also frustrated with the lack of \nresponsiveness from the IRS. Every single year taxpayers and their \naccountants write the IRS asking for additional information regarding \ntheir taxes. Often, the response from the IRS is silence--nothing but \nsilence.\n  So taxpayers wonder: Did they even get my question? Did they get my \nletter? Are they going to answer my question?\n  Silence. No answer.\n  The IRS currently is not required to respond to taxpayer \ncommunication. We all know, though, that the inverse is true--taxpayers \nare compelled to respond when the IRS requests any information. This is \na double standard which is not fair.\n  My bill, S. 2044, would require the IRS to respond to communication \nfrom any taxpayer within 30 days of receiving such communication. This \nway taxpayers will at least know that the IRS is not asleep at the \nswitch and that they have received their letter.\n  My bill would also make two other significant changes to the IRS: \nFirst, it would require the agency to notify a taxpayer if the agency \ndiscloses that person's information to another government entity. \nCurrent law doesn't require such disclosure. Next, the legislation \nwould require that when the IRS begins an audit on any individual \ntaxpayer, the audit and any tax assessed with the audit must be \ncompleted within 1 year. The window for these painstaking audits can't \nbe open forever. The uncertainty adversely impacts families, as these \naudits currently can be held up for years, with the taxpayers never \nquite sure if the tax is going to be assessed and when it is going to \nbe assessed.\n  The House approved identical legislation by a voice vote.\n  These two bills are straightforward. They make simple but important \nchanges to the way the IRS operates. Making these changes will help \nAmericans all across our country. I urge my fellow Senators on both \nsides of the aisle to support this legislation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                              Natural Gas\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, one of the true bright spots in our \neconomy right now has been, and continues to be, manufacturing. \nManufacturing jobs have been on the rise. We have over 12 million \nAmericans who are now employed with good-paying jobs in the \nmanufacturing sector. Many of them are in my own great State of \nMichigan.\n  This renaissance in the kind of good-paying jobs that built the \nmiddle class of this country is being powered in a significant way by \nAmerican natural gas. More than $100 billion in investments, in more \nthan 120 different manufacturing projects, is being fueled by abundant, \naffordable American natural gas. Thanks to American natural gas, the \npeople in our country have a great new opportunity to go to work, have \na good-paying job, and support their families.\n  Our country is truly blessed with this natural resource. It is \ncritical that we continue to put our American natural gas to work so we \ncan create American jobs, which is why I am confused and concerned by \nthose who are rushing to send this American resource overseas without a \ncareful review of the impact this will have on the costs to our \nmanufacturers, our jobs, and our families.\n  I am not opposed to exporting some of our natural gas as part of a \nbalanced, well-thought-out plan. A rush to approve every export \nfacility request immediately is not wise. It is not wise for our \neconomy or our people when we know that increased natural gas is needed \nhere at home.\n  People need jobs in America. We have about 10 million people out of \nwork. We have an awful lot of people who need a job. Good-paying jobs \nin manufacturing\n\n[[Page S1683]]\n\ncan and will be part of their future if we manage our natural gas \nresources the right way. It is critical for America that we get this \nright. We need to export our products, not our jobs, and that is the \ndebate I believe we should be having.\n  Low-cost natural gas is critical to our Nation's ability to create \nmanufacturing jobs. It is critical. If we start exporting too much of \nour natural gas without monitoring or evaluating the impact over time, \nwe may be giving up a real advantage we have right now for creating \njobs and bringing jobs home from other countries.\n  What do we hear from a lot of businesses that are making decisions to \nbring jobs home? They talk about low-energy costs. We don't want to \ngive that up as an advantage for America as we compete in a global \neconomy. Also, if increased exports raise prices to the same level as \nglobal oil prices--and obviously some folks would like to see that \nhappen for their own interests--American families will be hit with even \nhigher energy costs at home, and that doesn't make any sense either. \nExporting more American natural gas simply doesn't add up.\n  A study last month by Charles River Associates found that using our \nown low-cost natural gas to increase American manufacturing is twice as \nvaluable to our economy and creates eight times as many jobs as sending \nthis important American resource overseas. Let me say that again: Using \nour own low-cost natural gas to increase American manufacturing output \nis twice as valuable to our American economy and creates eight times as \nmany jobs as exporting this important American resource overseas.\n  I am particularly dismayed that some people are using the very \nserious crisis in Ukraine as an excuse to rush through new projects to \nexport our natural gas.\n  Last week I met with members of the Ukrainian community in Detroit. \nThey are deeply concerned about what is happening. This is personal for \nthem. They have family and friends in Ukraine. This crisis should not \nbe used by those in the oil and gas industry to rush through actions \nthat may be good for them in the long run. It certainly will not be \ngood for some people in the short run. Anything that is approved now \nwill take way too long before it has any impact in Ukraine. Raising \nprices may be good for some in the long run, but it will not be good \nfor American manufacturers. It is not good if the whole idea is to \ncreate American jobs here at home, and it is not good for middle-class \nfamilies.\n  I want to be very clear: I am extremely concerned about what is \nhappening in Ukraine. We must stand with the people of Ukraine and our \nallies in Europe against the outrageous actions of Russia and President \nPutin. This crisis is very serious and requires a serious response by \nthe Senate. I know colleagues on both sides of the aisle care deeply \nabout this issue. I hope and I assume we will pass a package to help \nUkraine as soon as possible.\n  Again, this crisis should not be used as an excuse to shortcut the \npermit process or the thoughtful evaluation that I know the Department \nof Energy is committed to doing to make sure we get this right. This \ncrisis should not be used to rush through new natural gas export \nfacilities that may undercut our effort to create good-paying jobs here \nat home.\n  The Department of Energy has already agreed to permit six liquefied \nnatural gas LNG export facilities that will export over 9 billion cubic \nfeet of LNG every day--and that is not counting the other 30 \napplications that have been approved for export to countries we have \nfree trade agreements with. I am not suggesting that should not have \nbeen done; I have not opposed that. But we better be careful on how we \nmove forward and how we evaluate the impact on our economy.\n  As we all know, LNG export facilities take years to build. We could \napprove permits for 100 new LNG facilities tomorrow, and unfortunately \nit would do nothing to address the crisis in Ukraine and potential \nsupply disruptions to our other important allies in Western Europe.\n  Here is what I am most concerned about: We all know that gas prices \nare decided by the global marketplace. Prices are high in Asia right \nnow. We don't have the existing infrastructure to get natural gas to \nUkraine. The gas in the export facilities that are rushed through are \nvery likely to go to Asia--very likely to go to China.\n  Should American natural gas be used to lower prices and create jobs \nin China or in other parts of Asia or should we be using low-cost \nnatural gas to create jobs right here at home? I hope we can all agree \non the answer to that question.\n  Rushing through more natural gas export facilities, unfortunately, \nwould not help Ukraine. However, it could have a negative effect on our \nown economy in the long run. Increasing exports would reduce our supply \nhere at home and raise consumer prices, and we all know how devastating \nthat would be for our families. Higher prices for natural gas means it \nwill cost more to cook your dinner, heat your home, and power your \nsmall business.\n  The recent propane shortages and dramatic price spikes we saw in \nStates across the country should raise a red flag for everybody. We \nsimply cannot afford to export too much natural gas too fast without \ntruly understanding the impact on our own jobs and families. Plus, \nsending so much of our natural gas abroad will neutralize the \ncompetitive advantage we have right now for cheap and abundant fuel. We \nhave an advantage right now, and we need to keep that advantage.\n  My concern is that we would be giving the big oil companies a boost \nbecause there would be higher prices for natural gas which would keep \noil as a viable alternative because there would not be the advantage of \nnatural gas anymore if we go to the global marketplace and all the \nprices go up.\n  In the end, the people of Ukraine and our allies who need our help \nwould not be receiving it. Our own manufacturers, businesses, and \nfamilies would not be receiving it. Instead, it would be going to the \noil companies.\n  Shame on us if we squander the opportunities that low-cost, abundant \nnatural gas resources offer our country. I believe we need to be smart \nin how we manage our resources.\n  Again, I am not opposed to exports. It is a question of a balance. It \nis a question of thinking it through in a thoughtful way and having an \nAmerican plan where we are balancing out part exports, part keeping \nnatural gas here at home, and making sure our manufacturers have the \nedge in a global economy because they have lower cost energy. We need \nto make sure we are bringing jobs back from overseas because of lower \ncost energy. We need to make sure our families have low-cost fuel and \nother energy assistance.\n  We need to be smart at this point in time about our resources. We \nhave the opportunity, I believe, to find the right balance that allows \nus to both benefit from some exports and benefit from the resources by \ncreating jobs here at home. Our manufacturers are families, the middle \nclass of this country, the folks trying to hold on, folks trying to get \ninto the middle class who know manufacturing jobs are a part of the way \nof doing that. They are counting on us. Our economy is counting on the \nfact that we will be smart about the way we make decisions about our \nnatural resources. Right now with natural gas we have the opportunity \nnot only for the States that have it to do well by exploration and \nextraction but by leveraging that as we look at the opportunities for \nmanufacturing; leveraging our own resources, which we are told will \ngive us eight times more in benefit in terms of jobs than just having \nour natural resources in America exported around the globe and the \nprices floating up to the higher prices of oil.\n\n  I thank the Chair. We are going to have a lot of discussion and \ndebate on this issue going forward. I look forward to that. I think \nthis is an opportunity for us to have an American plan on \nmanufacturing, with American low-cost energy, to be able to jump-start \nour economy moving forward.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I have a parliamentary inquiry: What is \nthe business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the motion to \nproceed to S. 2124, the Ukraine aid bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I urge my colleagues to not only vote for this particular measure but \nalso to\n\n[[Page S1684]]\n\nvote to pass as soon as possible the bill before the Senate that was \nreported out by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, by a vote of 14 \nto 4, before we went into recess. Obviously, it is intended to be an \nopening response--a beginning response--to the Russian aggression in \nUkraine; specifically now occupying and absorbing Crimea into Russia, \nan act of aggression the likes of which has not been seen in a long \ntime.\n  In addition, now additional pressures are being put on the Ukrainian \nGovernment as we speak, such as raising the price of gas, canceling \nUkraine special price discounts. Also, oil deliveries are slow, border \ncrossings for the delivery of trade have been closed, and the dirty \ntricks go on from the old KGB colonel Vladimir Putin.\n  This act is relatively mild. It will provide loan guarantees which \nare badly needed. Now the Ukrainian economy is under even greater \npressure and greater difficulty, given the actions taken by Vladimir \nPutin, and it would stabilize the Ukrainian economy. It is just a \nbeginning, but it is a strong signal of support by the United States \nfor this fledgling Ukrainian democracy.\n  The IMF reforms are considered somewhat controversial by some of my \ncolleagues, but the IMF reforms are not the reason this legislation is \nbefore us. The reason the legislation is before us is because Vladimir \nPutin has now absorbed Crimea into Russia. I predicted that when the \nUkrainian Government became a government of the people and threw out \nYanukovych, Putin would do exactly that because of his view of the need \nto have Sevastopol, the base on the Black Sea, in order to have access \nto the Mediterranean, without which his visions and view of the Russian \nempire would be threatened.\n  Right now the President of the United States is in Europe. I hope he \nis leading in Europe rather than just consulting in Europe. By the way, \na comment by the President--I still don't quite get it--that there \nwould not be a military excursion in Ukraine--I have never heard that \nword used in regard to military action. But the most important thing, \nin my view, is to pass this legislation as soon as possible. We can \nfight about other less important issues later on. We need to send a \nstrong signal to the people of Ukraine who are watching us as we speak \nand as we vote today, as to whether we are going to come to their \nassistance and at least take some small measures to punish Vladimir \nPutin. If we get hung up for another week or another who knows how many \nhours because of our failure to act, in my view, it sends exactly the \nwrong signals.\n  I also speak again in the strongest terms that we need to send \nmilitary assistance to this country. We need to help them defend \nthemselves. Russian troops are amassed on the border of Eastern Ukraine \nas we speak. I don't know whether Vladimir Putin will go into Eastern \nUkraine. I did predict he would go into Crimea. Now I believe he is \nwatching carefully for the reaction of the West, led by the United \nStates of America, as to how we are going to assist Ukraine, how we are \ngoing to prevent or at least make the cost of further encroachment into \nUkrainian territory a very expensive one.\n  We have military assistance programs with a myriad of nations, and we \nshould be giving them the weapons they need to defend themselves. I am \ntalking about defensive weaponry. It is shameful for us not to do so.\n  I see my colleague from Illinois with whom I was privileged and proud \nto travel to Ukraine, a man who understands these issues as well or \nbetter than anyone in this body and one who represents thousands and \nthousands and thousands of Ukrainian Americans whom I know he has met \nwith and who are deeply concerned.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wish to say through the Chair it was \nan honor to join my colleague Senator McCain in a whirlwind trip to \nUkraine: 48 hours, maybe 6 extra to spare; 2 full days of working, \nmeeting every leader at every level of government there and sensing \ntheir concern over the pending so-called referendum on Crimea and what \nRussia will do next. The Senator from Arizona and I stand together in a \nbipartisan fashion, urging the passage of this resolution as quickly as \npossible.\n  I just left the phone--the reason I came to the floor, I say to the \nSenator from Arizona, I was on the phone with the Ambassador of Ukraine \nand we were talking about the situation there, and I said: Senator \nMcCain is on the floor and I would like to go down and say a word.\n  He said the people of Ukraine are watching what we are doing. They \nare watching what Congress and the United States are going to do.\n  There are some differences between us. There are some differences \nbetween the parties. There comes a moment--and there always has, at \nleast in the past--where we decide we are going to stand together as a \nnation, particularly when it comes to issues of foreign policy. This \nresolution doesn't address every issue the Senator from Arizona has \nraised, but it certainly addresses some key issues on which the Senator \nand I both agree. We both voted for this in the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and we both want to see this move. The sooner the \nbetter.\n\n  I wish to salute my colleague, the Senator from Arizona, for \nreturning to the Maidan, that area in Kiev where 103 Ukrainians lost \ntheir lives demonstrating against the former government and asking for \nchange. Our experience together, visiting that country with a \ndelegation of eight Senators, I hope sent a strong message: There is \nbipartisan support for Ukraine and we will not tolerate Putin's \naggression at the expense of innocent people.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask my friend: Isn't it true the people of Ukraine are \nwatching in a way that is hard for them to understand--before an empty \nChamber. But, more importantly, whether we act and act quickly, that \nsignal to them as they face this additional Russian aggression, maybe \nnot military aggression but already borders have been closed, the price \nof their energy has been raised--in other words, Putin is putting more \nand more pressure on them. They look to us. Isn't it a fact they will \nnot quite understand if we go another several days because of some \nadditional issue that does not affect whether we are coming to their \nassistance, I ask my friend.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Through the Chair, I couldn't agree more. I think it is \nsignificant that when the new Prime Minister of Ukraine was scheduling \nhis first trip outside of the country, where did he come? Here, \nWashington, DC. With whom did he meet? The President and the leaders. \nWe sat together with him in a room downstairs--the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee room. He came here because he wanted to bring the \nmessage to us of what he feared would happen if Putin's aggression went \nforward, and he wanted us to bring the message to the world that the \nUnited States stood by him. How can we possibly explain to these people \nwho are worried about the existence and survival of their Nation that \nwe got tied up in some political squabble between the House and the \nSenate and the two political parties? It is important for us to move \nand move quickly.\n  The Senator from Arizona understands this as well or better than \nmost. Many of us have come from countries which were once under the \nyoke of the Soviets and we remember full well what it took to finally \nget independence and democracy. Today, Vladimir Putin is fighting to \nsave a failing Soviet franchise, and where he can't win the hearts and \nminds of neighboring nations, he instead uses masked gunmen, troops, \nbarbed wire, and energy extortion. That is how he works. He is not \nwinning this battle, but he is saying to the world: The only way I can \nkeep my ``friends'' in line is with pressure. So the United States, and \nI hope other civilized nations, will join us in saying that is \nunacceptable.\n  I thank the Senator and I agree with him. Now is the time to act in \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I note the presence of the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee whom I wish to thank for his rapid leadership in \ngetting this legislation approved by an overwhelming majority of the \ncommittee on a bipartisan basis. I know he is waiting to speak.\n\n[[Page S1685]]\n\n  I have just one more comment for my friend from Illinois. I \nunderstand he just met with Ukrainian Americans in Chicago, in his home \nState of Illinois. Isn't it true they don't quite understand why we \nhave not acted more rapidly in the face of naked aggression--which is \nincredible acquisition of territory which the Russian Government \nguaranteed as part of Ukraine when Ukraine gave up its nuclear \ninventory, which happened to be the third largest in the world. I see \nthe chairman waiting, so I will not ask any more questions, except to \nurge my colleagues let's have an overwhelming vote to move to this \nlegislation and get it done as quickly as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, first let me thank my two colleagues, \nboth distinguished members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator McCain and Senator Durbin. Their work and their leadership on \nthis issue has created the type of bipartisan spirit that I think is \nincredibly important in general but certainly in foreign relations. \nThey both added greatly to the legislation that came out of committee \nwith a strong bipartisan vote that we are considering on the floor.\n  Last week some of my colleagues in this Chamber were sanctioned by \nVladimir Putin for standing up for the Ukrainian people, standing up \nfor freedom, standing up for their democratic aspirations, standing up \nfor the sovereignty of Ukraine. As I said in Brussels at the German \nMarshall Fund this weekend, if I have been sanctioned for those \nreasons, then I say, by all means, Mr. Putin, sanction me.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to be supportive of the legislation. They \nmay be sanctioned at the end of the day, but that is really what \nstanding for Ukraine is all about at this critical moment and what it \nmeans beyond.\n  When we look around the world, we realize that every so often we face \na critical juncture at a time of great upheaval and change. With the \nbacksliding of Russian leadership to a pre-1991 posture, we are at such \na juncture. Vladimir Putin seems to view the pre-1991 Soviet Union's \nexpansionist authoritarianism as a present-day goal and the last two \ndecades, which saw the formation of new and independent states, as a \ndeparture from Peter the Great's expansionist aspirations.\n  From Ukraine, to Georgia, to the Middle East, we are seeing a new \nRussian leadership bent on using its military authority, its economic \nresources, and diplomacy to serve its parochial interests at any cost--\ndespite violations of its own legal commitments and those it has made \nto the international community.\n  Russia's flatout extortion of Ukraine, supported by former corrupt \nleaders of Ukraine, forced the political explosion which Russia then \nexploited.\n  In Syria, President Putin is actively propping up President Bashar \nal-Assad and perpetuating the world's worst humanitarian disaster.\n  In Iran, the ink of the Joint Plan of Action signed in Geneva last \nNovember was barely dry when reports surfaced that Tehran and Moscow \nwere negotiating an oil-for-goods swap worth $1.5 billion a month, and \nthat they planned to build a new nuclear plant--all steps that only aid \nIran in its pursuit of nuclear weapons, while diminishing the sanctions \nthat forced that country to the negotiating table in the first place.\n  It is no surprise that Putin and his cronies have already threatened \nto derail Syria and Iran talks if their countries do not step back from \npunishing Russia for its annexation of Ukraine.\n  In Geneva, as the P5+1 talks with Iran continue, we can only hope \nthat the crisis in Ukraine will not have a ripple effect in Russia's \nposition or participation.\n  But, in my view, Mr. Putin has miscalculated. He has reignited a \ndangerous pre-1991 Soviet-style game of Russian roulette with the \ninternational community, and we cannot blink.\n  He must understand that we will never accept his violation of \ninternational law in Ukraine. That is why we passed this legislation in \ncommittee--an aid package for Ukraine that provides loans for economic \nstabilization, supports planning for upcoming democratic elections, \naids in the recovery of stolen assets, and expands security cooperation \nbetween the two countries, and it holds Moscow accountable for its \naggressive stance against Ukraine.\n  First, this legislation provides for Ukrainian loan guarantees, \nconsistent with the $1 billion announced by the administration in \nrecent days. It mirrors the House legislation.\n  Second, it ensures that the Obama administration can assist the \nUkrainian Government to identify, secure, and recover assets linked to \nthe acts of corruption by Viktor Yanukovych, members of his family, or \nother former or current Ukrainian Government officials.\n  Third, it authorizes $50 million for democracy, governance, and civil \nsociety assistance and $100 million for enhanced security cooperation \nfor Ukraine and other states in Central and Eastern Europe.\n  Fourth, it mandates sanctions, complementing the President's recent \nExecutive order, against Ukrainians and Russians alike responsible for \nviolence and serious human rights abuses against antigovernment \nprotesters--and those responsible for undermining the peace, security, \nstability, sovereignty or territorial integrity of Ukraine--as well as \nimposing sanctions on Russian individuals complicit in or responsible \nfor significant corruption in Ukraine.\n  Fifth, it allows the administration to broadly sanction corrupt \nRussian officials and go after Putin's allies and cronies who are \nengaged in massive corruption to the detriment of the Russian people.\n  Finally, it provides needed reforms to the United States' \nparticipation in the International Monetary Fund, which would allow the \nUnited States to leverage significant support from the IMF for Ukraine \ntoday and for similar unforeseen crises that are going to come in the \nfuture.\n  It is the IMF that is leading the effort to stabilize Ukraine's \nfragile economy, an essential task if there is to be any chance of \nreaching a peaceful political solution to the standoff with Russia.\n  Congressional ratification of the 2010 IMF reforms would increase IMF \nemergency funding to Ukraine by up to 60 percent, and it would provide \nan additional $6 billion for longer-term support, setting an important \nmarker for other donors such as the EU and the World Bank.\n  Failure to approve the reforms, on the other hand, would undermine \nboth the IMF and the international standing of the United States.\n  Some countries are happy to see U.S. global influence diminish. \nFailing to approve the reforms weakens the United States and emboldens \nour competitors.\n  The IMF is strengthened at no cost to U.S. finances or influence. The \nUnited States retains its Executive Board seat and sole veto power at \nno net cost, since the $63 billion increase in U.S. quota is fully \noffset by an equivalent decrease to a separate emergency facility. \nOther countries, however, put in new money, increasing IMF lending \npower.\n  The fact is, it is a pure win for the United States. We will pay for \nthe $315 million budget impact of the bill with real cuts and from \nfunds that were underperforming or no longer needed. Given that the IMF \nhelps to stabilize countries, often precluding future need for military \naction, the relatively minor cost will pay back many times over.\n  This is not a partisan issue. Presidents Reagan, Clinton, and both \nPresidents Bush backed legislation to increase IMF resources, and \nPresident Reagan called the IMF ``the linchpin of the international \nfinancial system.''\n  These efforts combined send a message to the world that the \nannexation of Crimea will not stand.\n  Let me close by saying we are at a dangerous moment in history, with \nglobal consequences, and the world is watching.\n  If the West does not act, what will China say when it is looking at \nits territorial desires in the South China Sea? What will Iran say when \nwe are negotiating in Vienna about nuclear weapons? What will others in \nthe world say--North Korea, whose march to nuclear weapons on a greater \nscale is still in play?\n  All of them will be looking at what we in the West do or do not do, \nin making a decision about Russia's brazen\n\n[[Page S1686]]\n\nmove into Ukraine. They will be watching to see how far they can go, \nhow much they can do. They will be asking: What can I get away with?\n  The fact is, as a matter of principle, Ukrainian sovereignty cannot \nbe violated for simply looking westward and embracing ideals rooted in \nfreedom. These ideals must always remain first and foremost in our \nstrategic response to international events.\n  When I was in Brussels last week at NATO and the German Marshall \nFund, I said: The broader question that faces us is this: Can a united \ntransatlantic vision and our collective commitment to bold actions in \nthis century match the vision and commitment of those who created the \ninternational institutions which brought peace and prosperity to \nmillions in the last century?\n  I believe that--if we live, lead, and govern, guided by shared values \nand united by our common concerns--we can lead the world through this \ntransformational moment in history and prevent further Russian \naggression from taking us back prior to what was that 1991 world.\n  That is the choice before us. I urge my colleagues to strongly \nsupport the cloture motion so that we can work toward a statement that \nwill do exactly that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I will be happy to yield to the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think it is very clear that Vladimir Putin has amassed \nforces on the border of Russia and eastern Ukraine, and right now he is \ncalculating as to whether to move there or even into Moldova, where the \nTransnistrian region is now occupied and has been by Russian troops. \nAlso, there is pressure on the Baltic countries that is being exerted \nas we speak, a lot of it in defense of ``Russian-speaking people.'' If \nwe do not send this message now, with this package, in a bipartisan and \nstrong manner, Vladimir Putin will be encouraged to enact further acts \nof aggression against Crimea and in the region.\n  I would ask my colleague if he does not agree with that assessment.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I think the Senator is spot-on. Right now, Putin is \nlooking at whether or not he proceeds in Eastern Ukraine. He is looking \nat Transnistria and Moldova. He is calculating and he is calculating: \nWhat are the costs? What will the United States and the European Union \ndo?\n  From my perspective, President Putin only understands strength, and \nthat strength is either in a military context--which, of course, no one \nis speaking about at this moment--or an economic one. That is why this \npackage is so incredibly important--because it takes every single \ndimension that the distinguished Senator helped us in the committee on. \nIt aids Ukraine up front for the loan guarantee. It sanctions--and the \nSenator was very engaged in several elements of that--elements of the \nRussian hierarchy for engaging in corrupting the country, Ukraine, and \nat the same time for invading its territorial integrity. It prepares \nassistance for that election which is supposed to take place in May \nthat is critical to be fair, open, and transparent and, at the same \ntime, provides for the greater resources through the IMF.\n  So all of these elements are critical. It also includes a very clear \nstatement about greater defense cooperation, which is also critically \nimportant.\n  So these are all the elements of sending a strong message, as Putin \nis calculating: What will be the cost? If the cost is not high enough, \nhe may very well proceed into Eastern Ukraine or to those parts of \nMoldova. That is an action that we can ill-afford and the action that \nothers will look at across the world, as I mentioned, that they will \ncalculate: The West is not willing to take the actions necessary to \nstop my designs.\n  If that is the case, then I think we are in a world of hurt across \nthe globe.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the chairman for his eloquent statement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 329, S. 2124, a bill to support \n     sovereignty and democracy in Ukraine, and for other purposes.\n         Harry Reid, Robert Menendez, Debbie Stabenow, Barbara \n           Boxer, Patty Murray, Richard Blumenthal, Jeff Merkley, \n           Carl Levin, Joe Donnelly, Christopher A.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 2124, a bill to support sovereignty and \ndemocracy in Ukraine, and for other purposes, shall be brought to a \nclose?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

On this vote the yeas are 78, the nays are 17. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                             Oso Landslide\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am sure all our colleagues have seen \nthe news over the past few days from my home State of Washington where \nwe are suffering from a devastating natural disaster.\n  For those who haven't seen the coverage, on Saturday the town of Oso, \nWA--a very small, tightly knit community on the Stillaguamish River--\nwas hit by a massive landslide. It has cut off the town of Darrington \njust a few miles up State Road 530, and houses over a square mile have \nbeen swept away.\n  We know already we have lost eight people. This morning we learned \nthere are more than 100 people still missing, and right now in my home \nState of Washington there are dozens of families who do not know if \ntheir loved ones are still alive. These are moms and dads, they are \nsons and daughters, they are neighbors and friends who in the blink of \nan eye saw water and earth\n\n[[Page S1687]]\n\nwipe away their homes and their entire community, and now many of them \ndon't know if their loved ones survived.\n  I was in Arlington, WA, yesterday, where the search and rescue \noperations are being coordinated. It is just down the road from where \nthe slide hit, and I want to talk for a few minutes this evening on the \nSenate floor about this tragedy.\n  Oso and Darrington are very small towns like a lot of others in this \ncountry. The population of Oso is 180 people. These are the types of \nplaces where everyone knows everyone, where they stop to say hello, and \nwhere everyone lends a helping hand. It is impossible to describe the \nscope of this devastation. There isn't a single person who hasn't been \nimpacted in some way by this tragedy. There also isn't a single person \nanywhere who isn't doing everything they can to help. I saw neighbors \nwho were there providing food, providing shelter, offers of all kinds \nof hope, help, hugs, and prayers. First responders are risking their \nlives every minute, braving very dangerous conditions to look for \nsurvivors. People across my State are offering help and donations, \nanything they can to assist these communities that are experiencing the \nunthinkable. We have grocery stores offering food to the families who \nneed it and to the rescue workers. The Red Cross is there on the \nground. Tribal leaders from the local community are coming to offer \nwhat they can.\n  I wanted my colleagues to know that this weekend I saw some of the \nworst devastation I have ever witnessed in my home State. At the same \ntime I also saw firefighters who hadn't slept. They refused to stop as \nthey searched for survivors. I saw families refusing to give up hope, \nand I saw communities that need our entire State and our entire country \nto stand with them now.\n  Even though Oso and Darrington are 2,300 miles away from the Nation's \nCapital, our hearts and prayers are with the families in those \ncommunities tonight. In the coming weeks and months--and even years if \nthat is what it takes--all of us need to stand with the people of Oso \nand Darrington and Arlington and provide the Federal resources they are \ngoing to desperately need in this recovery and rebuilding operation. I \nwant them to know they will have the thoughts and prayers of everyone \nin this country going out to the real Washington as they see this \nthrough.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                      Smith and McHugh Nominations\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak in support of \ntwo nominees for Federal judgeships from Pennsylvania. I believe my \ncolleague Senator Casey is going to have a message he will share with \nus momentarily.\n  First, I wish to be very clear that I am very enthusiastically in \nsupport of both Judge Ed Smith and Mr. Gerald McHugh, the two nominees, \nboth of whom are likely to get a vote this week. If confirmed, they \nwill serve as U.S. district judges for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania.\n  I thank Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley for their work in \nushering these candidates through the committee process.\n  I thank Leader Reid and Leader McConnell for their role in ensuring \nthese nominees would have a chance to have a vote on the Senate floor.\n  Most of all, I thank my colleague Senator Casey. Senator Casey and I \nhave been working hard to fill a number of vacancies on the Federal \nbench in Pennsylvania since I got to the Senate. He predates my arrival \nhere, so he has been at this longer than I have, but since I have \narrived we have had a terrific working relationship. We have had eight \nterrific men and women confirmed to the Federal bench across \nPennsylvania. Hopefully, these two gentlemen will join them and we will \nbe up to 10.\n  We have developed a rigorous process by which the many candidates who \napply for these vacancies are thoroughly vetted, and I am very pleased \nthat we have been able to make this ongoing process work. \nPennsylvanians expect us to work together across party lines--a \nDemocratic Senator and a Republican Senator--to simply find the best \ncandidates. I have to say that I think we are doing exactly that with \nrespect to our judicial nominees, and there could be no better examples \nthan Judge Smith and Gerald McHugh.\n  Ed Smith was approved by the Judiciary Committee by a voice vote on \nJanuary 16. He is very well respected. I have known Judge Smith for \nnearly 20 years. There is no question that he has the requisite skills, \nthe knowledge, the background, and the acumen. He will be a great \nFederal judge. We know this because of what he has already accomplished \nin his career. He serves as a captain in the U.S. Navy, in the JAG \nCorps. He has been a commanding officer at the Navy Reserve Naval \nJustice School. He served as a military trial judge in the Navy \nReserve. He was deployed to Iraq in 2007 and 2008 to serve as a rule of \nlaw advisor to the Iraqis, and he received a Bronze Star for his \nservice.\n  Currently, Ed Smith is a judge on the Northampton County Court of \nCommon Pleas. He has been a partner in the law firm of DeRaymond & \nSmith, and he is a cum laude graduate from Dickinson Law School.\n  Importantly, Judge Smith has agreed that if he is confirmed, he will \nsit in the Easton Courthouse in the First District. That is a \ncourthouse which has not had a district court judge since 2004. The \npeople of Northampton County deserve to have that courthouse filled, \nand Judge Smith is an outstanding candidate to do it.\n  I am also delighted to support Gerald McHugh. Gerald McHugh is a \nhighly accomplished attorney, of very keen intellect, with a great \ncommitment to public service. He is currently a partner in the Raynes \nMcCarty firm. His work has mostly been in civil litigation, in medical \nmalpractice, in litigation regarding unsafe products, aviation \ndisasters, and in civil rights. He has been a shareholder in the firm \nof Litvin, Blumberg, Matusow & Young.\n  He began his career clerking for District Court Judge Luongo in the \nEastern District. He is a cum laude graduate from the University of \nPennsylvania Law School.\n  Gerald McHugh is not only a skilled lawyer, but he has been very \nactive in his community. He has been giving back to the greater \nPhiladelphia area for a long time. He is on the boards of many \ncharitable and civic organizations. He is the president of the \nPennsylvania Legal Aid Network and has been since 2004. He cofounded \nthe Hospitality House of Philadelphia to help ex-offenders, and he does \npro bono work to improve neighborhoods and prevent crime in West \nPhiladelphia.\n  Both of these candidates have the crucial qualities necessary to make \noutstanding judges, and they have manifested that throughout their very \ndistinguished careers. They have the intelligence, they have the \nintegrity, they have the commitment to public service, and they have \nrespect for the limited role the judiciary has under our constitutional \nsystem. So I am pleased to rise to speak on behalf of these two highly \naccomplished nominees, and I urge my colleagues to support their \nconfirmation later this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I would like to commend and salute the work \ndone by Senator Toomey and his staff, working with ours, as well as the \nleaders he mentioned, beginning with Majority Leader Reid and Chairman \nLeahy.\n  Like Senator Toomey, I am grateful to have the opportunity to talk \nabout both of these nominees for the U.S. District Court for the \nEastern District of Pennsylvania: Edward George Smith, who serves now \nas a judge, as well as Gerald Austin McHugh, Jr. I have known Gerald \nAustin McHugh, Jr., a lot longer, and I will speak about him first. I \nknow him as Jerry.\n  If there is one thing I could say about Jerry McHugh, it is he is a \nlawyer's lawyer. He is the kind of lawyer other lawyers go to for \nadvice, for guidance, and sometimes for education. He has been a great \nleader in the bar, but also someone who has been a strong advocate for \nthose who need a voice, often serving as a lawyer for those who \nwouldn't have an advocate absent his involvement in a case.\n  Jerry McHugh is a Philadelphia native. He was educated at St. Joe's \nUniversity in Philadelphia where he received a degree in theology, \ngraduating summa cum laude with the highest\n\n[[Page S1688]]\n\nhonors. He also graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law \nSchool, and he graduated from Penn law school with honors as well.\n  He began his practice at the law firm of Litvin Blumberg Matusow & \nYoung in the early 1980s. Prior to his career as a lawyer, he served \ntwo judges as a law clerk: first, Judge Spaeth, Superior Court of \nPennsylvania, the second highest court in the State right next to the \nSupreme Court of Pennsylvania. He then served Judge Alfred L. Luongo, \nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. He then \nwent into practice in the Litvin firm, and later the Raynes McCarty law \nfirm in Philadelphia, PA, starting in 2004.\n  I will highlight a few memberships which I think bear upon his work \nas a lawyer and the work he will do as a judge. He has been a member of \nthe Pennsylvania Trial Lawyers and a board member of the Legal Aid \nNetwork in Philadelphia. He served the bar association in a number of \ncapacities, including Volunteers for the Indigent Program, helping \nthose who may not have a voice.\n  Jerry focused his practice on complex civil litigation, including a \nvariety of matters. I think it is noteworthy that the Pennsylvania \nSupreme Court three times appointed him to chair the Pennsylvania \nInterest on Lawyers Trust Accounts Program, a program which is very \nimportant so that when the fund is needed to help resolve a case which \ninvolves a lawyer, the fund is there. It has to be administered and \noverseen by folks who have the highest integrity.\n  I know Jerry McHugh as someone who has a wide range of experience as \na lawyer, an advocate, an active citizen, someone who would bring to \nthe court a passion for justice and a sense of outrage in the face of \ninjustice. I can't say enough about his experience and his preparation \nfor this very important assignment he would have upon confirmation to \nbe a judge in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. I am grateful for \nhis willingness to serve.\n  In addition, Judge Edward George Smith, as Senator Toomey noted, has \na great career and a varied set of experiences, serving now as a judge \nin the Court of Common Pleas in Northampton County since January of \n2002. He was elected to that position and then retained, which is the \nultimate validation of someone's services on the bench in the Court of \nCommon Pleas in Pennsylvania.\n  Prior, as Senator Toomey noted, Judge Smith served the United States \nin the Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps as a captain, from 1984 \nuntil the present time. He also served in the DeRaymond & Smith law \nfirm for about 11 years. In that time period he served as solicitor for \na number of entities in the region.\n  Edward Smith has also demonstrated his commitment to his community. \nHe is a former president of the Boys and Girls Club of Easton, PA, \nformer president of the Kiwanis Club of Palmer Township, former \nemergency medical technician in Forks Township.\n  His 27-year military career is substantial. In addition to serving in \nthe Navy and achieving the rank of captain, he served our country in \nIraq. Just a few of his commendations are the Bronze Star medal, \nMeritorious Service medal, and the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation \nmedal.\n  Whether by way of life experience as well as legal experience or \nwhether his experience as a judge, Judge Smith is prepared to be a \njudge again on a different court--in this case, the U.S. District Court \nfor the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n  When we make decisions about whom to nominate for either the district \ncourt or the appellate court, we always want to consider a range of \ncharacteristics, experiences, and qualifications. First and foremost, \nwe look to people who have unquestioned integrity. We look to them as \npeople who have a varied experience, whether in the law as a judge or \nin other life experiences as well. We also look to people who can do \nthe job--not just by way of their integrity and ability but also those \nwho have the judicial temperament, the approach to litigants, to treat \nthem with fairness and to arrive at a measure of justice.\n  On those qualifications and characteristics, as well as others, both \nof these nominees possess them in abundance. I am grateful for Senator \nToomey's work with us to get this done to have two judges to be \nconfirmed, and we are looking forward to doing that later this week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         1964 Alaska Earthquake\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  In Alaska there is a great deal of attention focused this week on the \nGreat Alaska Earthquake of 1964. March 27 marked the 50th anniversary \nof this amazing physical event, the second largest earthquake that has \never been recorded, an episode Alaskans have been talking about for the \npast 50 years and will be talking about for the next 50. I rise this \nafternoon not to speak about that anniversary but to speak of a 25-year \nanniversary that while not caused by Mother Nature had a devastating \nimpact on Alaska and the surrounding waters of our State. I would like \nto speak very briefly about where we are 25 years after the Exxon \nValdez ran aground on Bligh Reef.\n  The Exxon Valdez was a 987-foot tanker. It was carrying 53 million \ngallons of crude oil. It struck Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound at \n12:04 a.m., on March 24, 1989, and within literally hours it had \nreleased approximately 11 million gallons of crude oil into the water.\n  As most know, the Alaskan coastline isn't just a nice thin straight \nbeach; it is hundreds and hundreds of coves and islands and miles of \nshoreline. That oil spread over approximately 1,000 miles of shoreline \nacross our coast. It is absolutely a fact that this environmental \ndisaster is something that has left an impression on Alaskans not \nunlike what we experienced 25 years prior to that with another one of \nMother Nature's devastations, the Great Friday earthquake in 1964.\n  It is important when we have milestones, when we have anniversaries \nor times where we pause to think about what has happened before, that \nwe not only think about the tragedy at the time but we think about how \nwe have moved forward from that time, hopefully learning from those \nincidents that trigger such strong memories.\n  So many Alaskans have stories of how they worked to help clean up the \noil spill in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez, whether it was \nfishermen who had been displaced--they were no longer going out and \nfishing; instead they charged their vessels to be part of the massive \ncleanup effort that was underway. The stories that are out there \nthroughout our State and from folks around the country are as poignant \nand touching 25 years later as they were at the time, because as the \nenvironment was impacted, the lives of Alaskans were clearly impacted.\n  I like to think I spend a good amount of time in the small fishing \ncommunity of Cordova--a community that was dramatically impacted by the \nExxon Valdez spill--visiting with fishermen and fishing families \ndecades after the fact and hearing their stories not only of the loss \nthey incurred because they were not able to go out and fish, they were \nnot able to meet their boat mortgages, but the other stresses the \ncommunity experienced because of this disaster, whether it was personal \nbankruptcies, whether it was divorce, whether it was social issues \nbecause people just couldn't deal with the fact that their landscape \nand their livelihoods had been changed. It was a very trying and \ntraumatic time. I think those scars take decades to heal.\n\n  My hope is that, as Alaskans, we come together and learn from these \ntragedies and events so we can move forward. We are pretty resilient \npeople. The people who have been so dramatically impacted are proof and \nevidence of that.\n  What else have we seen as we have tried to learn from that tragedy? I \nthink it is fair to say that at the time--back in 1989 when the Exxon \nValdez ran aground--there was perhaps, as some would call it, a \ncomplacency. Perhaps we were just not monitoring operations as we \nshould have,\n\n[[Page S1689]]\n\nbut we had an industry that had been operating quite safely--absolutely \nsafely--for decades without incident. When you lose that vigilance, \nthings can happen, and things happened with the Exxon Valdez.\n  Since that time, we have learned that you have to have a level of \npreparedness as you operate in areas such as the Prince William Sound, \nyou have to have a level of preparedness that meets the challenge you \nface. At the time the tanker ran aground, the spill response equipment \nthat was there and had been planned for was not readily available. We \ndidn't have sufficient boom available in the event of a disaster. We \ndidn't have the fleet that could go out and assist in the disaster.\n  Now, 25 years later, Alyeska has 189 skimmers, 49 miles of boom and \non-water storage capacity of almost 38 million gallons. We have put in \nplace a requirement that North Slope oil must be transported in double-\nhull tankers. You cannot bring a tanker in to carry North Slope crude \nunless it is double-hulled. It doesn't matter what the weather is, we \nrequire a level of escort--a two-tug escort--out of the Prince William \nSound. It can be a flat, calm summer day or a foul winter day, but \nevery tanker going out is escorted by two tugs. We also have radar \nmonitors that are in place that truly allow for a greater level of \noversight and scrutiny.\n  What we have done in response to the spill is, I think, something \nthat is worthy of note. Clearly, it is something that Other Nations \nlook to as the example of preparedness. We have our Prince William \nSound Regional Citizens Advisory Council in place. They are truly \nactive and engaged, not only with the community, but with the fishing \nfleets.\n  We have learned that the company Alyeska--the management company for \nthe transportation of Alaska's North Slope oil--conducts two major oil \nspill drills every year to make sure that there is a level of \npreparedness. We have about 400 local fishing boat owners that are \ntrained to deploy and maintain the boom. They come together with drills \nto make sure we never have anything like we saw with the Exxon Valdez \nagain.\n  I think it is fair to say that 25 years after the spill, we are \ncontinuing to monitor not only the land and water but our fisheries. I \nrecognize we still have a herring fishery that has not yet recovered. \nWe still have a bird population--the guillemot--which has not \nrecovered.\n  Twenty-five years is a long time. When you have a disaster, as we \nhad, it does leave an impact. My goal, mission, and effort as a \nlegislator is to make certain we do not have a level of complacency \nwhere we close our eyes and fail in our efforts for preparedness again.\n  I think what we have demonstrated in Alaska since the spill is, as I \nsay, admirable in recognizing that we had failed in a level of \nprevention, but we also recognized we could learn from that tragedy and \nmove forward, and we did.\n  I wanted to take a couple of minutes this afternoon and acknowledge \nthat there are still many Alaskans who woke up this morning not \nthinking about the weather or getting their kids to school, but with a \nvery strong reminder of where they were 25 years ago and how the events \nof that day changed people's lives. Again, the goal here is to never \nhave a tragedy of that scale and scope again.\n  With that, I thank the Chair, yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Richard Francis \nCline, a member of ``The Greatest Generation.'' Mr. Cline, who passed \naway last September at the age of 89, will be honored today by \ninterment at Arlington National Cemetery. Mr. Cline was a dedicated \nfather and patriot who, like so many of his generation, left friends, \nfamily, and the comfort of home to take up arms in defense of his \nNation.\n  A native of Chicago, and North Carolinian later in his life, Mr. \nCline and his eight siblings knew hardship early in life, coming of age \nduring the Great Depression. To help support his family he worked at \nseveral jobs as a boy and as a young man. He began working by selling \npopcorn at Wrigley Stadium at the age of 9 and learned, out of \nnecessity, the merit of a strong work ethic that would follow him for \nthe rest of his life.\n  After graduating from high school, he joined the U.S. Army at the age \nof 18. He served his country in General Patton's famous 3rd Army Corps, \nwhere he was a member of the 15th Medical Supply Division that operated \nin England as well as France and Belgium during the Battle of the \nBulge. He witnessed the horrors of war and served his country to \nprovide not only for his family, but also for the freedom of all \nAmericans.\n  While stationed in a small town in Belgium, he met his future wife, \nJeanine. She returned with him to America and they continued their \nlives together following the war. They were married for 64 years, and \ntogether they raised 4 children who saw their father not only as their \nparent, but as their friend.\n  Once Mr. Cline returned home, he started what would become a 44-year \ncareer with the Continental Can Corporation. Those who knew him would \ntell you that he expected nothing he did not earn, and worked hard to \nachieve the American dream he fought so hard to protect. He gave \nearnestly to his community in many ways throughout his life, often \nmaking wooden toys for children who might not otherwise have had any \npresents at Christmas. Richard Francis Cline embodied the spirit of the \n``greatest generation'' and made many who knew him proud to call him \nboth a fellow American and a friend.\n  I am honored to have been able to call Mr. Cline a constituent. His \ninterment at Arlington National Cemetery is recognition of his loyal \nservice to this great Nation. I offer my condolences to his family and \nthose who knew Mr. Richard Cline, for we have lost a remarkable man and \nrole model.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/24/senate-section/article/S1689-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1689-S1690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                REMEMBERING JUAN GONZALEZ AND BRIAN LAW\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of two dedicated public servants, California \nHighway Patrol officers Juan Gonzalez and Brian Law. Officer Gonzalez \nand Officer Law were tragically killed in the line of duty while \nresponding to an automobile accident in Kingsburg, CA.\n  A graduate of Tulare Union High School and California State \nUniversity, Fresno, Juan Gonzalez joined the California Highway Patrol \nin 2008, the culmination of years of hard work and the realization of a \ngoal that he had held since he was 5 years old. He worked for 2 years \nin San Jose before transferring to the Fresno area in 2010.\n  A Marine and Air Force reservist, Brian Law also graduated from the \nCalifornia Highway Patrol Academy in 2008 and worked in Alameda County \nfor the CHP for 5 years before transferring to Fresno last year.\n  Officer Gonzalez and Officer Law first met as cadets at the \nCalifornia Highway Patrol Academy, where they became good friends. In \n2013, they teamed up as partners in the CHP's Fresno office.\n  Those who knew Officer Gonzalez fondly remember him as a trusted \ncolleague and friend who was committed to his career and family. His \ndetermined spirit, unique laugh, and camaraderie will be missed.\n  Officer Law was an avid sports fan with an engaging personality whose \nwillingness to help others and passion for law enforcement helped him \nto become a respected member of the California Highway Patrol. Above \nall else,\n\n[[Page S1690]]\n\nBrian is remembered as a devoted family man.\n  Officers Gonzalez and Law dutifully served the people of California \nwith honor and valor. Their service and dedication epitomize the best \nideals of law enforcement, and I send my heartfelt sympathies to their \nfamilies, friends and colleagues--especially Maria, Officer Gonzalez's \nmother, and his sister Sandra; and Rebecca, Officer Law's wife; his \nstepdaughter Lauren; son Brandon; daughter Samantha; father Denis Law; \nmother Judy Doty; and sister Carol Law-Stetson.\n  They will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/24/senate-section/article/S1690-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING SERGEANT TOM SMITH\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \npaying tribute to Sergeant Tom Smith, a 23-year veteran of the Bay Area \nRapid Transit, BART, Police Department, who was an exceptional law \nenforcement officer, a devoted and loyal friend, and most of all a \ndedicated family man. Sergeant Smith was tragically struck down on \nJanuary 21, 2014, becoming the first police officer in BART's 42-year \nhistory to be killed in the line of duty.\n  Tom Smith was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, the \nyoungest of three brothers who all became police officers and the first \nto pursue a career in law enforcement. Joining the BART police at age \n19 as a cadet, he rose through the ranks, serving as a field training \nofficer and a K-9 handler before becoming a detective and eventually \nreaching the rank of Sergeant, where he led BART's detective unit.\n  Colleagues remember Sergeant Smith as an experienced and respected \nleader who was passionate about his work. It was through his job that \nhe met the love of his life, Kellie, a BART police officer with the K-9 \nunit. Married in 2001, Sergeant Smith and his wife have a beautiful 6-\nyear-old daughter, Summer. His friends remember him as a devoted \nhusband, father, and brother. When he was not on duty he spent as much \ntime as he could with Kellie and Summer, his brothers Patrick, a Newark \npolice officer, and Edward, an Alameda County sheriff's deputy, and his \nbrother-in-law Todd, a Hayward police officer.\n  Tom Smith dedicated his life to his family, his community, and his \ncountry. His dedicated and courageous service will not be forgotten. On \nbehalf of the people of California, whom he served so bravely, I extend \nmy gratitude and deepest sympathies to his family, friends, and \ncolleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/24/senate-section/article/S1690-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH DAKOTA COYOTES\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.

In just \ntheir second year of eligibility, this is an extraordinary achievement.\n  On March 11 the Coyotes faced off against the Denver Pioneers. They \nplayed remarkably well and defeated their rivals capturing the Summit \nLeague Championship title, and ultimately clinching an automatic berth \nin the NCAA tournament.\n  Founded in 1862, the University of South Dakota has continually \nsought and achieved excellence. As my alma mater, I personally can \nattest to the spirit of this world-class institution. Qualifying for \nthe NCAA Division I tournament exemplifies the hard work that defines \nthe USD community and showcases its prestige.\n  I commend the exceptional leadership and vision of president James W. \nAbbott who, in 2006, announced that USD's athletic programs would \ntransition from NCAA Division II to Division I. That move made this \njourney to the Big Dance possible. Additionally, director of athletics \nDavid Herbster along with head coach Amy Williams, assistant coaches \nBrook Atkinson, Josh Hutchinson, and Chuck Love, and graduate assistant \nTandem Mays helped lead the team through this remarkable season.\n  In honor of their dedication and success I would like to congratulate \nto each of the outstanding Coyote team members: Bailey Milne, Tia \nHemiller, Madeleine White, Kelly Stewart, Taylor Moore, Bridget Arens, \nRaeshel Contreras, Jaylah Jackson, Margaret McCloud, Emily Smith, Polly \nHarrington, Nicole Seekamp, Heidi Hoff, and Lisa Loeffler.

Mr. President, it is with profound sadness that \nI rise to honor the life and service of U.S. Air Force Master Sergeant \nDavid Poirier, who passed away February 28, 2014, while stationed at Al \nUdeid Air Base in Qatar. Master Sergeant Poirier was serving his sixth \ntour overseas as a member of the New Hampshire Air National Guard's \n157th Operational Support Squadron. He had also previously completed \ntours in Iraq, Afghanistan, Guam, Qatar, and El Salvador, in addition \nto other Guard missions in New Hampshire.\n  Dave, as he was known to family and friends, was born in Woonsocket, \nRI, and grew up in Blackstone, MA, where he graduated from Blackstone-\nMillville Regional High School. A resident of Salem, NH, Dave was an \nactive and respected member of the New Hampshire community in his role \nas an airman as well as his position as postmaster for the town of \nAtkinson. At the time of his passing at age 52, Dave had served over 22 \nyears in the U.S. Air Force and had earned the Air Force Commendation \nMedal twice, campaign medals for Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation \nIraqi Freedom, and the Global War on Terrorism, as well as other \nawards.\n  Like many New Englanders, Dave enjoyed the outdoors by taking camping \nand fishing trips throughout the region. He also took particular \npleasure in riding his Harley-Davidson on the back roads of New \nHampshire. Most of all, Dave loved spending time with his family, \nentertaining them with magic tricks and card games.\n  I had the honor of meeting Master Sergeant Poirier's family during \nhis dignified transfer ceremony at Pease Air National Guard Base. He \nwas a devoted family man and I know his absence will be felt by many. \nHowever, it is my hope that during this extremely difficult time Dave's \nfamily and friends will find comfort in knowing that Americans \neverywhere appreciate deeply his vow to defend our country so that the \nrest of us may continue to live in peace and freedom.\n  Along with his wife, Kim, Master Sergeant Poirier is survived by his \nsons Andrew and Bradley Poirier; his daughter Nicole Poirier; his step \nsons Kevin and Dillon Forzese; his grandchildren Eliana, Kai, and \nOlivia; his brothers Kenny, Charlie, John, and Bob Poirier; as well as \nhis step father Charlie Caine.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in honoring the life \nand service of this brave American, David Poirier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/24/senate-section/article/S1690-4", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1690-S1691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT RELATIVE TO THE ISSUANCE OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO TAKE \n  ADDITIONAL STEPS WITH RESPECT TO THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY ORIGINALLY \n  DECLARED ON MARCH 6, 2014 IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13660 WITH RESPECT TO \n UKRAINE, RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON MARCH 17, 2014--\n                                 PM 36\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 2014.\n     Hon.

The order also \n     blocks the property and interests in property of persons \n     determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n     with the Secretary of State:\n        to be an official of the Government of the Russian \n     Federation;\n        to operate in the arms and related materiel sector \n     in the Russian Federation;\n        to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or \n     purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly:\n        a senior official of the Government of the Russian \n     Federation; or\n        a person whose property and interests in property are \n     blocked pursuant to the order; or\n        to have materially assisted, sponsored, or \n     provided financial, material, or technological support for, \n     or goods or services to or in support of:\n        a senior official of the Government of the Russian \n     Federation; or\n        a person whose property and interests in property are \n     blocked pursuant to the order.\n       In addition, the order suspends entry into the United \n     States of any alien determined to meet one or more of the \n     above criteria.\n       I have delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury the \n     authority, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to \n     take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and \n     regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the \n     President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the \n     purposes of the order. All agencies of the United States \n     Government are directed to take all appropriate measures \n     within their authority to carry out the provisions of the \n     order.\n       I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.\n           Sincerely,\n     Barack Obama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/24/senate-section/article/S1691-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                    Enrolled Joint Resolution Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2013, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on March 14, 2014, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker had signed the following enrolled joint \nresolution:\n\n       S.J.

Res. 393\n\n       Whereas 1/3 of the population of the world is infected with \n     the tuberculosis bacterium;\n       Whereas more than 9,500 tuberculosis cases were reported in \n     the United States in 2013;\n       Whereas more than 1,300,000 individuals die from \n     tuberculosis each year;\n       Whereas over 95 percent of tuberculosis deaths occur in \n     low- and middle-income developing countries;\n       Whereas tuberculosis is the second leading global \n     infectious disease killer, behind HIV/AIDS, and claims \n     1,800,000 lives each year;\n       Whereas tuberculosis is a leading killer of people living \n     with HIV/AIDS, causing 1/5 of all deaths among people with \n     HIV/AIDS;\n       Whereas tuberculosis is the third leading killer of adult \n     women, and the stigma associated with tuberculosis \n     disproportionately affects women, causing women to delay \n     seeking care and interfering with treatment adherence;\n       Whereas the global tuberculosis pandemic and the spread of \n     drug-resistant tuberculosis present a persistent public \n     health threat to the United States;\n       Whereas according to 2009 data from the World Health \n     Organization, 3.6 percent of all new tuberculosis cases are \n     drug resistant;\n       Whereas multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (referred to in \n     this preamble as ``MDR-TB'') is present in virtually all \n     countries surveyed;\n       Whereas approximately 450,000 people around the world \n     developed MDR-TB in 2012;\n       Whereas extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (referred \n     to in this preamble as ``XDR-TB'') is a strain of \n     tuberculosis that is very difficult and expensive to treat \n     and has high and rapid fatality rates, especially among HIV/\n     AIDS patients;\n       Whereas there have been more than 63 cases of XDR-TB in the \n     United States between 2004 and 2014;\n       Whereas as of September 2013, 92 countries have reported at \n     least 1 case of XDR-TB;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     estimated, in 2009, that the cost of hospitalizing a single \n     patient with XDR-TB is $483,000;\n       Whereas, between 2005 and 2007, the 373 XDR-TB cases in the \n     United States collectively cost the health care system an \n     estimated $53,000,000;\n       Whereas the death rate of tuberculosis dropped 45 percent \n     between 1990 and 2012;\n       Whereas the Institute of Medicine found that a decrease in \n     tuberculosis control funding and the spread of HIV/AIDS \n     caused the resurgence of tuberculosis between 1980 and 1992;\n       Whereas although the number of tuberculosis cases in the \n     United States continues to decline, progress towards \n     eliminating tuberculosis has slowed and the disease does not \n     recognize borders;\n       Whereas African Americans are 8 times more likely to have \n     tuberculosis than Caucasians, and significant disparities \n     exist among other minorities in the United States, including \n     Native Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanic Americans;\n       Whereas over 530,000 children became infected with \n     tuberculosis in 2012;\n       Whereas tobacco use greatly increases the risk of \n     tuberculosis and death, and more than 20 percent of \n     tuberculosis cases worldwide attribute to smoking;\n       Whereas diabetes is a major risk factor for tuberculosis, \n     and people with diabetes are more likely to develop the \n     disease and have a higher risk of death due to the disease;\n       Whereas a new technology, known as Xpert, developed in the \n     United States, is able to diagnose cases of tuberculosis \n     within 2 hours, and such technology can even diagnose cases \n     that are difficult to detect, such as cases involving \n     individuals living with HIV;\n       Whereas although drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines for \n     tuberculosis exist, these technologies are antiquated and \n     increasingly inadequate for controlling the global epidemic;\n       Whereas Xpert can quickly detect resistance to 1 of the \n     primary tuberculosis drugs, but other tests to detect drug \n     resistance take at least 1 month to complete and the medical \n     community must develop even faster drug susceptibility tests \n     to stop the spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis;\n       Whereas Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, a tuberculosis vaccine \n     that is known as ``BCG'', provides some protection to \n     children but has little or no efficacy in preventing \n     pulmonary tuberculosis in adults;\n       Whereas there is a critical need for the development of \n     tuberculosis drugs that individuals can safely take \n     concurrently with antiretroviral therapy for HIV;\n       Whereas the Millennium Development Goal of the World Health \n     Organization is to reverse the spread of tuberculosis by \n     2015;\n       Whereas the enactment of the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde \n     United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 (Public \n     Law 110-293; 122 Stat. 2918) and the Comprehensive \n     Tuberculosis Elimination Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-392; 122 \n     Stat. 4195) provides an historic United States commitment to \n     the global eradication of tuberculosis, including a \n     commitment to successfully treating 4,500,000 tuberculosis \n     patients and 90,000 MDR-TB patients between 2008 and 2013 and \n     to providing additional treatment through coordinated \n     multilateral efforts;\n       Whereas the United States Agency for International \n     Development provides financial and technical assistance to \n     nearly 40 highly burdened tuberculosis countries, supports \n     the development of new diagnostic and treatment tools, and is \n     authorized to support research to develop new vaccines to \n     combat tuberculosis;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n     partnering with the other entities of the United States and \n     individual States and territories, directs the national \n     tuberculosis elimination program, directs essential national \n     tuberculosis surveillance, technical assistance, and \n     prevention activities, and supports the development of new \n     diagnostic, treatment, and prevention tools to combat \n     tuberculosis;\n       Whereas the National Institutes of Health, through its many \n     institutes and centers, plays the leading role in basic and \n     clinical research on the identification, treatment, and \n     prevention of tuberculosis;\n       Whereas the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and \n     Malaria provides 63 percent of all international financing \n     for tuberculosis programs;\n       Whereas the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and \n     Malaria finances--\n       (1) proposals worth $3,200,000,000 in 112 countries;\n       (2) tuberculosis treatment for 6,000,000 people; and\n       (3) 1,800,000 HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis services;\n\n       Whereas the prevalence and mortality rates of tuberculosis \n     are declining in many countries with programs supported by \n     the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; and\n       Whereas March 24, 2014, is World Tuberculosis Day, a day \n     that commemorates the date in 1882 on which Dr. Robert Koch \n     announced his discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the \n     bacteria that causes tuberculosis: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals of World Tuberculosis Day to raise \n     awareness about tuberculosis;\n       (2) commends the progress of anti-tuberculosis efforts by \n     entities that include the United States Agency for \n     International Development, the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the \n     Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; and\n       (3) reaffirms the commitment to global tuberculosis control \n     set forth in section 4 of the United States Leadership \n     Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (22 \n     U.S.C. 7603).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/24/senate-section/article/S1694-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1694-S1695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 394--DESIGNATING APRIL 5, 2014, AS ``GOLD STAR WIVES \n                                 DAY''\n\n  Mr. BURR (for himself and Mrs. Murray) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

It is not pleasant for some people, but I \nhave alerted everyone as often as I can. We have been able to avoid the \nweekends, but this work period is very significant. We have a lot we \nhave to get done. We may either have to start spending a weekend here \nand there or what we would have to do is just take the week we were \nsupposed to start our Easter break and work that week. It would be a \nshort week, but we would at least be here. So I just alert everyone so \npeople can't come back and say, ``Why didn't you tell us?''
