At 3 o'clock there will be four rollcall votes in \nrelation to amendments to the immigration bill.\n  Mr. President, I would simply add on that, I have had a number of \ncalls already this morning saying: You cannot have the votes then. I \nhave this. We have meetings. We would like to have the votes at 4 \no'clock.\n  This bill, we have to move forward on it. I was very happy we were \nable to get consent to have these four votes starting at 3 o'clock \ntoday. Time is of the essence on this legislation. I have been patient. \nWe have all been patient waiting to see what amendments people want to \noffer. I want to make sure that on some of these major issues people \nhave had the time to work through them. We know some of the issues are \ndifficult. I have been told Senator Hoeven and Senator Corker are \ntrying to work with the eight bipartisan Senators to come up with \nsomething they believe is important for them to vote on. I have no \nproblem with that, but I am just telling everybody, as I have now for \nquite a long time, that we are going to either file cloture on this on \nFriday, Saturday, Sunday, or Monday. We have to move forward on this \nlegislation.\n  So I urge people to work together to come up with whatever amendments \nthey believe are important. Of course, we are all looking at this major \nissue. I have talked to the Republicans' Gang of 8 and the Democrats' \nGang of 8. They are working on something dealing with border security. \nI am not telling anyone what to do other than to do it as quickly as \nyou can.\n  The time has come to make decisions on this important piece of \nlegislation. We say we have been on it 2 weeks. We have really been on \nit longer than that. That first week after the break there were \nmeetings going on all over this Capitol on what we should do with \nimmigration.\n  So I would hope people understand that this may not be one of our \nnormal weekends where we shoot out of town to go back to whereever we \ncome from. We have to move forward on this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/18/senate-section/article/S4535-6", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4535-S4536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BUDGET CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I talked yesterday at some length on the \nbudget. It is important. We are approaching 3 months where we have not \nbeen able to go to conference on this budget. This is so extremely \nimportant. I spent yesterday morning at the NIH. I was not able to meet \nwith all the heads of the Institutes, but I met with four of them, plus \nDr. Collins, who runs the NIH, the National Institutes of Health.\n  I will have more to say about this later, but South Africa, England, \nFrance, India--China is increasing their spending by almost 25 percent \nfor programs just like we have at NIH. What are we doing at NIH? We are \ncutting spending. They have been flat-funded since about 2004. With the \nstimulus bill, which is now going on 5 years ago, we gave them a shot \nin the arm because of Senator Specter. But that money has long since \nbeen gone. They are headed downhill, and they have been for several \nyears now. These wonderful scientists we have there are leaving.\n  One of the scientists from the University of Michigan, who, by the \nway, is best friends with my chief of staff, is basically staying away \nfrom NIH because you cannot have--and he is an expert, one of if not \nthe leading expert in the world on melanoma. He is not making \napplication for NIH grants anymore because they cannot do scientific \nresearch when it is only available for a year or two. So I hope we can \nmove forward on this budget conference and get something done on this \nto set the Nation's financial problems in the right direction. We are \nnot going to get anything done unless we are able to get something done \non the budget. We cannot do this.\n\n[[Page S4536]]\n\n  I am proud of the budget we passed. I think it is a very good budget, \nbut I realize if we go to conference we may have to change some of the \nthings we have in our budget. But we are never going to get this done \nunless we sit down and work this out, as we have done for more than two \ncenturies here in conferences between the House and the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/18/senate-section/article/S4536-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      STUDENT LOAN INTEREST RATES\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, day after day I have been coming to the \nSenate floor to remind the majority leader of the commitments he made \nto the American people in 2011 and again just a few months ago that he \nwould not break the rules of the Senate in order to change the rules of \nthe Senate; that he would preserve the rights of the minority in this \nbody; that he would not try to remake the Senate in the image of the \nHouse, something that could change our democracy in a very fundamental \nway.\n  So the question remains: Will he keep his word?\n  Here is what he said on January 27, 2011:\n\n       I will oppose any effort in this Congress or the next--\n\n  The one we are in now--\n\n     to change the Senate's rules other than through the regular \n     order.\n\n  And here is what he said this year, after I asked him to confirm that \nthe Senate would not consider any rules changes that did not go through \nthe regular order process:\n\n       That is correct. Any other resolutions related to Senate \n     procedure would be subject to a regular order process \n     including consideration by the Rules Committee.\n\n  Now, look, Mr. President, a Senator's word--especially the word of \nthe majority leader--is the currency of the realm in this Chamber--the \ncurrency of the realm in this Chamber. As the majority leader himself \nsaid:\n\n       Your word is your bond . . . if you tell [a Republican \n     Senator or a Democratic Senator] you are going to do \n     something, that is the way it is.\n\n  He is entirely correct. Senators keeping their word, well, that is \njust vital to a well-functioning Senate. But it is only part of the \nequation. We also need well-established rules that are clear, fair, and \npreserve the rights of all Senators--including those in the minority--\nto represent the views of their States and of their constituents. That \nis the other reason why I have been pressing the majority leader on \nthis issue.\n  As a matter of principle, holding a Senator to his or her word is \nimportant, but so is preserving a Senate that works the way it is \nsupposed to. And we cannot be assured of that until the majority leader \naffirmatively states that he will stay true to the commitments he has \nmade.\n  I understand my friend the majority leader is under a lot of \npressure. I have known him for a long time, and deep down I know he \nunderstands the far-reaching consequences of ``going nuclear.'' I think \nhe actually realizes how terrible an idea that would be because once \nthe Senate definitively breaks the rules to change the rules, the \npressure to respond in kind will be irresistible to future majorities. \nThe precedent will have been firmly and dramatically set.\n  Some Washington Democrats say: Oh, they just want to limit the rules \nchange to nominations; they just want to make a little adjustment on \nnominations, which is why they have been hurtling the Senate toward a \nmanufactured fight over a couple of the President's most controversial \nnominees. But Republicans have been treating the President's nominees \nmore than fairly.\n  At this point in President Bush's second term he had a total of 10 \njudicial confirmations; and, by the way, the Republicans were in the \nmajority in the Senate. President Bush, at this point in his second \nterm, with a Republican majority in the Senate, had 10 judicial \nconfirmations. So far in his second term, President Obama has had 26 \njudges confirmed--26, 26 to 10. Apples to apples: at this point in \nPresident Bush's term, with a Republican Senate; at this point in \nPresident Obama's term, with a Democratic Senate.\n  I would note that just yesterday the Senate approved two more \njudicial nominees. That leaves just five--just five--available to the \nfull Senate to be confirmed. There are only five around here. Think \nabout that. Of the 77 Federal judicial vacancies, the President has not \nnominated anyone for most of them, and only 5 remain on the Senate's \nExecutive Calendar. Moreover, only one of those nominees has been \nwaiting more than a month to be considered.\n  So it is hard to see this as anything other than a manufactured \ncrisis. There is no factual basis for it--a manufactured crisis. So the \nquestion is, a crisis to what end? Where does this lead us?\n  Well, one of the reasons the majority leader has refrained from \nchanging the rules thus far is this: He fully understands--he fully \nunderstands--that majorities are fleeting, but changes to the rules are \nnot, and breaking the rules to change the rules would fundamentally \nchange the Senate.\n  Future majorities would be looking to this precedent. I do not know \nwhat the future holds, but 2 years from now I could be setting the \nagenda around here. Once deployed, the nuclear option may have fallout \nin future Congresses, actually forever altering the deliberative nature \nof the Senate, which has made it the institution where enduring \ncompromises between the parties have been forged.\n  So it is time for sober consideration of the direction in which the \nSenate is being taken.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/18/senate-section/article/S4536-4", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the last few weeks, I have been \nlistening to the Republican leader ask the majority leader not to turn \nthe Senate into a place where a majority of 51 can do anything it \nwants. I am on the Senate floor today to suggest three reasons why I \nbelieve the majority leader will not do that:\n  No. 1, he said he would not. Senators keep their word.\n  No. 2, in 2007, the majority leader said to do so would be the end of \nthe Senate. There have not been many majority leaders in the history of \nthe Senate. I know none of them want to have written on their \ntombstone: He presided over ``the end of the Senate.''\n\n[[Page S4537]]\n\n  No. 3, the majority leader is an able and experienced legislator. He \nknows if Democrats find a way to use 51 votes to do anything they want \nto do, it will not be very long until Republicans find a way, if we are \nin the majority, to use 51 votes to do whatever we want to do.\n  So let me take these three reasons one by one. First, the majority \nleader has given his word. The Republican leader mentioned that. At the \nbeginning of the last two Congresses, at the request of the Republican \nleader, I worked with several Democrats and Republicans to change the \nrules of the Senate to make it work better. We succeeded in that. We \ntalked about it, negotiated, and we voted those changes through.\n  We eliminated the secret hold. We abolished 169 Senate-confirmed \npositions. We expedited 273 more. We reduced the time to confirm \ndistrict judges. We made it easier to go to conference. In exchange for \nall of that, the majority leader said he would not support changes in \nthe rules in this 2-year session of Congress except through the regular \norder. He said:\n\n       The minority leader and I have discussed this on numerous \n     occasions.\n\n  This is the Democratic leader.\n\n       The proper way to change the Senate rules is through the \n     procedures established in the rules. I will oppose any effort \n     in this Congress or the next to change the Senate rules other \n     than through the regular order.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed, following my remarks, the \nmajority leader's comments.\n  Second, I was a new Senator 10 years ago in 2003. I was absolutely \ninfuriated by what the Democrats did in the first few months. For the \nfirst time in history, they used the filibuster to deny a President's \njudicial nominations for the circuit courts of appeal. It had never \never been done before. So Republicans threatened the so-called \n``nuclear option.'' We threatened we would change the rules of the \nSenate so we could work our will with 51 votes.\n  Senator Reid said at the time ``that would be the end of the \nSenate.'' He wrote that in his book called ``The Good Fight'' in 2007. \nIt is the most eloquent statement I have heard about why changing the \nrules of the Senate to give a majority the right to do anything it \nwants with 51 votes is a bad idea. I wish to read a few sentences from \nSenator Reid's book ``The Good Fight,'' written in 2007.\n\n       Senator Frist of Tennessee, who was the majority leader, \n     had decided to pursue a rules change that would kill the \n     filibuster for judicial nominations.\n\n  Sounds familiar.\n\n       And once you open the Pandora's box, it was just a matter \n     of time before a Senate leader who couldn't get his way on \n     something moved to eliminate the filibuster for regular \n     business as well. That, simply put, would be the end of the \n     United States Senate.\n       It is the genius of the Founders that they conceived the \n     Senate as a solution to the small state / big state problem. \n     And central to that solution was the protection of the rights \n     of the minority. A filibuster is the minority's way of not \n     allowing the majority to shut off debate. And without robust \n     debate, the Senate is crippled. Such a move would transform \n     the body into an institution that looked like the House of \n     Representatives where everything passes with a simple \n     majority. And it would tamper dangerously with the Senate's \n     advise-and-consent function as enshrined in the Constitution. \n     If even the most controversial nominee could simply be rubber \n     stamped by a simply majority, advise and consent would be \n     gutted. Trent Lott of Mississippi knew what he was talking \n     about when he coined the name for what they were doing the \n     nuclear weapon.\n\n  One more paragraph.\n\n       But that was their point. They knew--Lott knew--if they \n     trifled with the basic framework of the Senate like that, it \n     would be nuclear. They knew that it would be a very radical \n     thing to do. They knew that it would shut the Senate down . . \n     . there will come a time when we will be gone.\n\n  This is Senator Reid talking.\n\n       There will come a time when we will all be gone, and the \n     institutions that we now serve will be run by men and women \n     not yet living. And those institutions will either function \n     well because we have taken care of them or they will be in \n     disarray and someone else's problem to solve. Well, because \n     the Republicans could not get their way getting some radical \n     judges confirmed to the Federal bench, they were threatening \n     to change the Senate so fundamentally that it would never be \n     the same again. In a fit of partisan fury, they were trying \n     to blow up the Senate. Senate rules can only be changed by a \n     two-thirds vote of the Senate, or 67 Senators. The \n     Republicans were going to do it illegally with a simple \n     majority, or 51. Vice President Cheney was prepared to \n     override the Senate Parliamentarian. Future generations be \n     damned.\n\n  Those are the words of the distinguished Senator from Nevada in 2007 \neloquently explaining why this body is so different from the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I ask unanimous consent not only to have those remarks printed in the \nRecord but several more pages from Senator Reid's excellent seventh \nchapter entitled ``The Nuclear Option'' in his book from 2007.\n  Third and finally, if the Democrats can turn the Senate into a place \nwhere a majority of 51 can do anything they want, soon a majority of 51 \nRepublicans is going to figure out the same thing to do. After 2014, \nsome observers have said we might even be in the majority. Senator \nMcConnell might be the Republican leader and the majority leader. After \n2016, we may even have a Republican President.\n  Preparing for that opportunity, I wish to suggest the 10 items, \nbriefly, I wish to see on an agenda if we Republicans are able to pass \nanything we want with 51 votes, as the majority leader has suggested.\n  No. 1, repeal ObamaCare.\n  No. 2, S. 2, that would be the second bill if I were the leader. I \nwould put up Pell grants for kids. Like the GI bill for veterans, Pell \ngrants follow students to the colleges of their choice--creating \nopportunity at the best colleges in the world. Why don't we do the same \nthing for students in kindergarten through the 12th grade, take the $60 \nbillion we spend, create a voucher for 25 million middle- and low-\nincome children. It would be $2,200 for each one of them, just the \nmoney we now spend. Let it follow them to any school they choose to \nattend, an accredited school, public or private.\n  No. 3 on my list, complete Yucca Mountain. I have spoken often of the \nimportance of nuclear energy to our country. It provides 20 percent of \nall of our electricity, 60 percent of our clean electricity for those \nconcerned about climate change and clean air. Since 2010, the majority \nleader has stalled the nuclear waste repository in Nevada. That \njeopardizes our 100 reactors. That jeopardizes our source of 60 percent \nof our clean electricity. If we had 51 votes in the Senate, we could \ndirect the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to issue a license. We could \ndirect the Department of Energy to build Yucca Mountain and we could \nfund the money to do it.\n  The junior Senator from Nevada, who shares Senator Reid's opposition \nto that, said something about this recently.\n\n       The day is going to come that either he is here or not--\n\n  That is the majority leader.\n\n     --or the Republicans take control and it's a 50-vote \n     threshold. Those kinds of issues are the ones that concern me \n     the most. When you are from a small State, you need as many \n     arrows in your quiver as possible to fight back on some of \n     these issues that you can be overtaken by. Frankly, the 60-\n     vote threshold is what has protected and saved Nevada in the \n     past.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have Senator Heller's comments printed in \nthe Record.\n  If all the Democrats who voted once upon a time for completing Yucca \nMountain were to do so again, we could get a bipartisan majority of 51 \nvotes today in the Senate to complete Yucca Mountain. So make no \nmistake, a vote to end the filibuster is a vote to complete Yucca \nMountain.\n  Here is the rest of my list--I will do it quickly--that I would \nsuggest to the Republican leader, if he were majority leader, as his \npriorities for a Senate where we could pass anything we wanted with 51 \nvotes.\n  Make the Consumer Protection Bureau accountable to Congress. That \nwould be No. 4.\n  No. 5, drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and build the \nKeystone Pipeline.\n  No. 6, fix the debt. It ought to be No. 1. Senator Corker and I have \na $1 trillion reform of entitlement programs that would put us on the \nroad toward fixing the debt.\n  No. 7, right to work for every State. We would reverse the \npresumption--create a presumption of freedom, giving workers in every \nState the right to work. States would have the right to opt out, to \ninsist on forced unionism, the reverse of what we have today.\n  No. 8, No EPA regulation of greenhouse gases.\n\n[[Page S4538]]\n\n  No. 9, Repeal the Death Tax.\n  Finally, No. 10, repeal Davis-Bacon, save taxpayers billions by \nending the Federal mandate on contractors.\n\n  The Republican leader and I have plenty of creative colleagues. They \nwill have their own top 10 lists. When word gets around on our side of \nthe aisle that the Senate will be like the House of Representatives and \na train can run through it without anyone slowing it down, there will \nbe a lot of my colleagues with their own ideas about adding a lot of \ncars to that freight train.\n  Jon Meacham's book about Thomas Jefferson is one I have been reading. \nHe reports a conversation between John Adams and Jefferson in 1798. \nAdams said:\n\n       No Republic could ever last which had not a senate . . . \n     strong enough to bear up against all popular storms and \n     passions . . .\n\n  And that--\n\n       Trusting the popular assembly for the preservation of our \n     liberties . . . was the mearest chimera imaginable.\n\n  Alexis de Tocqueville, while traveling our country in the 1830s, saw \nonly two great threats for our young democracy. One was Russia, one was \nthe tyranny of the majority.\n  Finally, as the Republican leader so well stated, there is no excuse \nhere for all of this talk. The Democrats are manufacturing a crisis. To \nsuggest Republicans are holding things up unnecessarily is absolute \nnonsense. In fact, over the last two Congresses, we have made it easier \nfor any President to have his or her nominations secured.\n  The Washington Post on March 18, the Congressional Research Service \non May 23, said President Obama's nominations for the Cabinet are \nmoving through the Senate at least as rapidly as his two predecessors. \nThe Secretary of Energy was recently confirmed 97 to 0. There may be \nanother three votes on Cabinet-level nominees this week.\n  Then as the Republican leader said, look at the Executive Calendar. \nOnly three district and two circuit judge nominees are waiting for \nfloor action.\n  As for filibusters, according to the Senate Historian, the number of \nSupreme Court Justices who have been denied their seats by filibuster \nis zero. The only possible exception is Abe Fortas, and Lyndon Johnson \nengineered a 45-to-43 vote so he could hold his head up while he \ncontinued to serve on the Court.\n  The number of Cabinet members who have been denied their seats by a \nfilibuster in the history of the Senate is zero.\n  The number of district judges who have been denied their seats by a \nfilibuster in the history of the Senate is zero. This is according to \nthe Senate Historian and the Congressional Research Service.\n  So what are they talking about? I know what they are talking about. \nThey are talking about circuit judges. That is the only exception. Why \nis it an exception? Because when I came to the Senate 10 years ago, the \nDemocrats broke historical precedent and blocked five distinguished \njudges of President Bush by a filibuster.\n  Republicans have returned the favor and blocked two of President \nObama's by a filibuster, which should be a lesson for the future to \nthose who want to change the rules. About half the Senate are serving \nin their first term. They may not know about the majority leader's \nstatements in 2007. They may not know about the history of the Senate. \nThey may have heard all of these conflicting facts and not have the \nright facts.\n  What I have given you is what the Senate Historian and the \nCongressional Research Service say are the facts. Of course, there have \nbeen delays. My own nomination was delayed 87 days by a Democratic \nSenator. I did not try to change the rules of the Senate. President \nReagan's nomination of Ed Meese was delayed a year by a Democratic \nSenate.\n  No one has ever disputed our right in the Senate, regardless of who \nwas in charge, to use our constitutional duty of advise and consent to \ndelay and examine, sometimes cause nominations to be withdrawn or even \nto defeat nominees by a majority vote.\n  Yes, some sub-Cabinet members have been denied their seats by a \nfilibuster. The Democrats denied John Bolton his post at the United \nNations.\n  Senator Warren Rudman told me the story of how the Democratic Senator \nfrom New Hampshire blocked his nomination by a secret hold. Nobody knew \nwhat was happening. I asked Senator Rudman what he did about it.\n  He said: I ran against the so-and-so in the next election, and I beat \nhim.\n  This is how Senator Rudman got to the Senate.\n  In summary, the idea that we have a crisis of nominations is \nabsolute, complete nonsense, totally unsupported by the facts. It \nshould be embarrassing to my friends on the other side to even bring it \nup. They should be congratulating us for helping to make it easier for \nany President to move nominations through.\n  The advise and consent is a constitutional prerogative that both \nparties have always defended.\n  There are three reasons why the majority leader will not turn the \nSenate into a place where a majority of 51 can do anything it wants, in \nmy judgment: one, he said he wouldn't, and Senators keep their word; \ntwo, he said the nuclear option would be the end of the Senate. No \nmajority leader wants written on his tombstone he presided over the end \nof the Senate; three, if Democrats turn the Senate into a place where \n51 Senators can do anything they want, it will not be long before \nRepublicans do the same.\n  To be very specific, if Senator Reid and Democrats vote to allow a \nmajority to do anything they want in the Senate and set that precedent, \nvoting to end the filibuster will be a vote to complete Yucca Mountain.\n  I come with respect to the Republican and the Democratic leaders, and \nespecially to this institution, to say let's end the threats, let's \nstop the nonsense, let's get back to work on immigration and the other \nimportant issues facing our country.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Reid made the same commitment (if anything, more broadly) \n     on January 27, 2011, when he said:\n       ``The minority leader and I have discussed this issue on \n     numerous occasions. I know that there is a strong interest in \n     rules changes among many in my caucus. In fact, I would \n     support many of these changes through regular order. But I \n     agree that the proper way to change Senate rules is through \n     the procedures established in those rules, and I will oppose \n     any effort in this Congress or the next to change the \n     Senate's rules other than through the regular order.''\n       The storm had been gathering all year. and word from \n     conservative columnists and in conservative circles was that \n     Senator Frist of Tennessee, who was the Majority Leader, had \n     decided to pursue a rules change that would kill the \n     filibuster for judicial nominations.\n       It is the genius of the founders that they conceived the \n     Senate as a solution to the small state/big state problem. \n     And central to that solution was the protection of the rights \n     of the minority. A filibuster is the minority's way of not \n     allowing the majority to shut off debate, and without robust \n     debate, the Senate is crippled. Such a move would transform \n     the body into an institution that looked just like the House \n     of Representatives, where everything passes with a simple \n     majority. And it would tamper dangerously with the Senate's \n     advise-and-consent function as enshrined in the Constitution. \n     If even the most controversial nominee could simply be \n     rubber-stamped by a simple majority, advise-and-consent would \n     be gutted. Trent Lott of Mississippi knew what he was talking \n     about when he coined a name for what they were doing: the \n     nuclear option.\n       And that was their point. They knew--Lott knew--if they \n     trifled with the basic frame work of the Senate like that, it \n     would be nuclear, They knew that it would be a very radical \n     thing to do. They knew that it would shut the Senate down. \n     United States senators can be a self-regarding bunch \n     sometimes, and I include myself in that description, but \n     there will come a time when we will all be gone, and the \n     institutions that we now serve will be run by men and women \n     not yet living, and those institutions will either function \n     well because we've taken care with them, or they will be in \n     disarray and someone else's problem to solve. Well, because \n     the Republicans couldn't get their way getting some radical \n     judges confirmed to the federal bench, they were threatening \n     to change the Senate so fundamentally that it would never be \n     the same again. In a fit of partisan fury, they were trying \n     to blow up the Senate. Senate rules can only be changed by a \n     two- thirds vote of the Senate, or sixty-seven senators. The \n     Republicans were going to do it illegally with a simple \n     majority, or fifty-one. Vice President Cheney was prepared to \n     overrule the Senate parliamentarian. Future generations be \n     damned.\n       Given that the filibuster is a perfectly reasonable tool to \n     effect compromise, we had been resorting to the filibuster on \n     a few judges. And that's just the way it was. For 230 years, \n     the U.S. Senate had been known as the world's greatest \n     deliberative body--not always efficient, but ultimately \n     effective.\n\n[[Page S4539]]\n\n       There had once been a time when the White House would \n     consult with home-state senators, of either party, before \n     sending prospective judges to the Senate for confirmation. If \n     either senator had a serious reservation about the nominee, \n     the nomination wouldn't go forward. The process was called \n     ``blue-slips.'' The slips were sent to individual senators. \n     If the slips didn't come back, there was a problem. The Bush \n     White House ignored the blue-slip tradition, among many other \n     traditions, and showed little deference to home-state \n     senators.\n       We realized that if they were not going to adhere to our \n     blue slips or entertain any advice from us, then they were \n     trying to subvert the minority's ability to perform its \n     advise-and-consent function under the Constitution. It was \n     clear that Bush and Karl Rove were going to try to load all \n     the courts--especially the circuit courts of appeals, because \n     you can't count on Supreme Court vacancies. And most of the \n     decisions are made by circuit courts anyway, so it could be \n     said that they are the most important judicial nominees of \n     all.\n       We Democrats made a decision that since the White House was \n     ignoring the Constitutional role of the Senate, then we were \n     going to have to delay some of the more extreme nominees. Be \n     cautious and look closely was the byword. One rule we tried \n     to follow was that if all Democrats on the Judiciary \n     Committee voted no on a nominee, then we would say, ``Slow \n     down.''\n       The Republicans immediately complained that they had never \n     filibustered Clinton's judges, a claim that simply wasn't \n     true. Frist himself had participated in the filibuster of the \n     nomination of Judge Richard Paez, which at the time had been \n     pending in the Senate for four years. When Senator Schumer \n     had called him on it on the Senate floor, Frist had stammered \n     to try to find a way to explain how their use of the \n     filibuster was legitimate and ours wasn't. And moreover, it \n     was a disingenuous claim. The reason the Republicans \n     didn't deploy the filibuster that often when Clinton was \n     President is that they had a majority in the Senate. and \n     they had simply refused to report more than sixty of \n     President Clinton's judicial nominees out of committee, \n     saving them the trouble of a filibuster. In any case, the \n     U.S. Senate had never reached a crisis point like this \n     before,\n       In the early part of 2005, I hadn't wanted to believe it \n     was true, and felt confident that we could certainly avoid \n     it. We make deals in the Senate, we compromise. It is \n     essential to the enterprise. I was determined to deal in good \n     faith, and in a fair and open-minded way, ``What I would like \n     to do is say there is no nuclear option in this Congress.'' I \n     said on the floor one day, ``and then move forward.'' Give us \n     a chance to show that we're going to deal with these nominees \n     in good faith and in the ordinary course. And if you don't \n     think we are fair, you can always come back next Congress and \n     try to invoke the nuclear option. Because it would take a \n     miracle for us to retake the Senate next year.\n       Did I regret saying this? No. Because at the time I \n     believed it, and so did everyone else.\n       And in any case, we had confirmed 204, or 95 percent, of \n     Bush's judicial nominations. It was almost inconceivable to \n     me that the Republicans would debilitate the Senate over \n     seven judges. But the President's man, Karl Rove, was \n     declaring that nothing short of 100 percent confirmation rate \n     would be acceptable to the White House, as if it were his \n     prerogative to simply eliminate the checks-and- balances \n     function of the Senate. Meanwhile, we were at war, gas prices \n     were spiking, and we were doing nothing about failing \n     pensions, failing schools, and a debt-riven economy. Where \n     was our sense of priorities?\n       I had been pressing Majority Leader Bill Frist in direct \n     talks for a compromise--one in which Democrats prevented the \n     confirmation of some objectionable judges and confirmed some \n     that we didn't want to confirm, all in the interest of the \n     long-term survival of the Senate. But I had been getting \n     nowhere. Those talks had essentially ceased by the end of \n     February. And then Senator Frist began advertising that he \n     was aggressively rounding up votes to change the Senate \n     rules, and Republican senators, some quite prominent, began \n     to announce publicly that they supported the idea. Pete \n     Domenici of New Mexico. Thad Cochran of Mississippi. Ted \n     Stevens of Alaska. Orrin Hatch of Utah. I was so disappointed \n     that they were willing to throw the Senate overboard to side \n     with a man who, it was clear, was becoming one of the worst \n     Presidents in our history. President Bush tried at any cost \n     to increase the power of the executive branch, and had only \n     disdain for the legislative branch. Throughout his first \n     term, he basically ignored Congress, and could count on \n     getting anything he wanted from the Republicans. But from \n     senators who had been around for a while and had a sense of \n     obligation to the institution, I found this capitulation \n     stunningly short-sighted. It was clear to me that Frist \n     wanted this confrontation, no matter the consequences.\n       And as the weeks and months passed, it dawned on me that \n     Frist's intransigence was owed in no small part to the fact \n     that he was running for President. Funding the filibuster so \n     that extremist judges could be confirmed with ease had become \n     a rallying cry for the Republican base, especially the \n     religious right. In fact, Senator Frist would be the featured \n     act at ``Justice Sunday,'' a raucous meeting at a church in \n     Louisville on the last Sunday in April that was billed as a \n     rally to ``Stop the Filibuster Against People of Faith.''\n       This implied, of course, that the filibuster itself was \n     somehow anti-Christian. I found this critique, which was \n     becoming common in those circles, to be very strange, to say \n     the least. Democratic opposition to a few of President Bush's \n     nominees had nothing whatsoever to do with their private \n     religious beliefs. But that did not stop James Dobson of \n     Focus on the Family of accusing me of ``judicial tyranny to \n     people of faith.''\n       ``The future of democracy and ordered liberty actually \n     depends on the outcome of this struggle.'' Dobson declared \n     from the pulpit at Justice Sunday.\n       So the battle lines were drawn.\n       All the while, very quietly, a small group of senators had \n     begun to talk about ways to avert the looming disaster.\n       Earlier in the year, Lamar Alexander, the Republican junior \n     senator from Tennessee, had gone to the floor and given a \n     speech that hadn't gotten much notice in which he had \n     proposed a solution. Since under Senate rules a supermajority \n     of sixty votes is required to end a filibuster, and the \n     makeup of the Senate stood at fifty-five in the Republican \n     caucus and forty-five in the Democratic, Alexander had \n     suggested that if six Republicans would pledge not to vote to \n     change Senate rules and six Democrats would pledge to never \n     filibuster judicial nominees, then we could dodge this \n     bullet. This would come to be know as ``the Alexander \n     solution.''\n       Of course, this was an imperfect solution--if the minority, \n     be it Democratic or Republican, pledged to never use the \n     filibuster, then you were de facto killing the filibuster \n     anyway and may as well change the rules. But Alexander's \n     thinking was in the right direction. In fact, I had begun \n     talking quietly to Republican senators one by one, canvassing \n     to see if I could get to the magic number six as well, should \n     Frist press a vote to change the rules. If he wanted to go \n     that way, maybe we could win the vote outright, without \n     having to forge a grand compromise.\n       I knew we had Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island. So there was \n     one. I thought we had the two Mainers. Olympia Snowe and \n     Susan Collins. I thought we had a good shot at Mike DeWine of \n     Ohio. We had a shot at Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. Maybe \n     Chuck Hagel of Nebraska. I knew we had a good shot at John \n     Warner of Virginia. Warner, a former Marine and secretary of \n     the Navy, was a man of high character. When Oliver North ran \n     as a Republican against Senator Chuck Robb in 1994. Warner \n     crossed party lines to campaign all over Virginia against \n     North. I also felt that Bob Bennett of Utah would, at the end \n     of the day, vote with us.\n       But these counts are very fluid and completely unreliable. \n     It would be hard to get and keep six. We were preparing \n     ourselves for a vote, but a vote would carry great risk.\n       As it turned out, Alexander's chief of staff was roommates \n     with the chief of staff of the freshman Democratic senator \n     from Arkansas, Mark Pryor. Pryor, whose father before him had \n     served three terms in the Senate, had been worrying over a \n     way to solve this thing. His chief of staff, a gravelly \n     voiced guy from Smackover, Arkansas, named Bob Russell, got a \n     copy of Alexander's speech from his roommate and gave it to \n     Pryor. Alexander's idea of a bipartisan coalition got Pryor \n     thinking, and he sought out the Tennessean and began a quiet \n     conversation about it.\n       At the same time, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, one of the more \n     conservative Democrats in the Senate, began having a similar \n     conversation with Trent Lott. At some point they became aware \n     of each other's efforts, and one day in late March, Pryor \n     approached Nelson on the floor to compare notes.\n       Lott and Alexander would quickly drop out of any \n     discussions. Such negotiations without Bill Frist's knowledge \n     proved too awkward, particularly for Alexander, who was a \n     fellow Tennessean. And even though there was antipathy \n     between Lott and Frist over the leadership shake-up in \n     2002, Lott backed away as well.\n       But others were eager to talk.\n       Knowing what was at stake, John McCain and Lindsey Graham \n     began meeting sub rosa with Pryor and Nelson. They would go \n     to a new office each time, so as not to arouse suspicion. \n     These four would form the nucleus of what would become the \n     Gang of Fourteen, the group of seven Republicans and seven \n     Democrats who would eventually bring the Senate back from the \n     brink. Starting early on in their negotiations, Pryor and \n     Nelson came to brief me on their talks, and I gave my quiet \n     sanction to the enterprise. Senator Joe Lieberman came to me \n     and said that he was going to drop out of the talks. I said, \n     ``Joe, stay, we might be able to get it done. It's a gamble. \n     But stay and try to work something out.''\n       Each meeting would be dedicated to some aspect of the \n     problem, and there was a lot of back and forth about what \n     would be the specific terminology that could trigger a \n     filibuster. Someone, probably Pryor, suggested \n     ``extraordinary circumstances,'' and that's what the group \n     would eventually settle on. What that meant is that to \n     filibuster a judicial nominee, you'd have to have an \n     articulable reason. And a good reason, not just fluff. \n     Slowly, they were joined by others. Ben Nelson approached \n     Robert Byrd to ask if he would join the effort. No one cares \n     more about the Senate than Byrd, and he agreed, anything to \n     preserve the rules. John Warner was the same way, and it may \n     have been Warner's presence in the negotiations that would \n     serve as the biggest rebuke to Frist.\n\n[[Page S4540]]\n\n     Ultimately, seven Republican senators would step away from \n     their leader, in an unmistakable comment on his recklessness.\n       Meanwhile, the drumbeat for the nuclear option was \n     intensifying in Washington, and was beginning to crowd out \n     all else. James Dobson said that the faithful were in their \n     foxholes, with bullets whizzing overhead. In mid-March, Frist \n     had promised to offer a compromise of some sort. A month \n     later, nothing. In mid-April, I was with the President at a \n     White House breakfast and took the opportunity to talk with \n     him about it. ``This nuclear option is very bad for the \n     country, Mr. President,'' I said. ``You shouldn't do this.''\n       Bush protested his innocence. ``I'm not involved in it at \n     all,'' he said. ``Not my deal.'' It may not have been the \n     President's deal, but it was Karl Rove's deal.\n       A couple of days later, Dick Cheney spoke for the White \n     House when he announced that the nuclear option was the way \n     to go, and that he'd be honored to break a tie vote in the \n     Senate when it was time to change the rules. The President \n     had misled me and the Senate.\n       And that was the second time I called George Bush a liar.\n       The first time was over the nuclear waste repository \n     located at Yucca Mountain, in my home state of Nevada. I have \n     successfully opposed this facility with every fiber in me \n     since I got to Washington, as it proposes to unsafely encase \n     tons of radioactive waste in a geological feature that is too \n     close to the water table, crossed by fault lines, unstable, \n     and unsound. And Yucca Mountain posed a grave danger to the \n     whole country, given that the waste--70,000 tons of the most \n     poisonous substance known to man--would have to be \n     transported over rail and road to the site from all over \n     America, past our homes, schools, and churches. Not a good \n     idea. President Bush committed to the people of Nevada that \n     he was similarly opposed to Yucca Mountain, and would only \n     allow it based on sound science. Within a few months of his \n     election, and with a hundred scientific studies awaiting \n     completion, Bush reversed himself. When one lies, one is a \n     liar. I called him a liar then, and with his obvious \n     duplicity on the nuclear option revealed by the Vice \n     President's pronouncement, I called the President a liar \n     again.\n       I then met again with Mark Pryor and Ben Nelson. I knew \n     that they were trying to close a deal with the Gang of \n     Fourteen. I was afraid to tell them to stop, and afraid to go \n     forward. But I patted them on the back and off they went.\n       ``Make a deal,'' I told them.\n       By this time, Bill Frist had been in the Senate for a \n     decade. An affable man and a brilliant heart-lung transplant \n     surgeon, he had been two years into his second term when \n     Majority Leader Trent Lott had heralded Senator Strom \n     Thurmond on his one hundredth birthday in early December 2002 \n     by saying that if Thurmond's segregationist campaign for the \n     presidency in 1948 had been successful, ``we wouldn't have \n     all these problems today.'' The uproar over Lott's comments \n     had wounded the Majority Leader, and just before Christmas \n     the White House had in effect ordered that Frist would \n     replace Lott and become the new Majority Leader, the first \n     time in Senate history that the President had chosen a Senate \n     party leader.\n       As Majority Leader, Frist had almost no legislative \n     experience and always seemed to me to be a little off balance \n     and unsure of himself. For someone who came from a career at \n     which he was consummate, this must have been frustrating. \n     When I became Minority Leader after the 2004 election, I \n     obviously got to watch Frist from a closer vantage point. My \n     sense of his slight discomfort in the role only deepened. In \n     negotiations, he sometimes would not be able to commit to a \n     position until he went back to check with his caucus, as if \n     he was unsure of his own authority. Now, anyone in a \n     leadership position who must constantly balance the interests \n     of several dozen powerful people, as well as the interests of \n     the country, can understand the challenges of such a \n     balancing act. And to a certain extent, I was in sympathy \n     with Frist. But my sympathy had limits. What Frist was doing \n     in driving the nuclear-option train was extremely reckless, \n     and betrayed no concern for the long-term welfare of the \n     institution. There are senators who are institutionalists and \n     there are senators who are not. Frist was not. He might not \n     mind, or fully grasp, the damage that he was about to do just \n     to gain short-term advantage, I reminded him: We are in the \n     minority at the moment, but we won't always be. You will \n     regret this if you do it.\n       By this time, the Senate was a swirl of activity. More \n     senators were taking to the floor to declare themselves in \n     support of the nuclear option or issue stern denunciations. \n     Senator Byrd gave a very dramatic speech excoriating Frist \n     for closely aligning his drive to the nuclear option with the \n     religious right's drive to pack the judiciary. And he \n     insisted that Frist remain on the floor to hear it.'' My wife \n     and I will soon be married, the Lord willing, in about \n     sixteen or seventeen more days, sixty-eight years.'' Byrd \n     said. ``We were both put under the water in that old \n     churchyard pool under the apple orchard in West Virginia, the \n     old Missionary Baptist Church there. Both Erma and I went \n     under the water. So I speak as a born-again Christian. You \n     hear that term thrown around. I have never made a big whoop-\n     de-do about being a born-again Christian, but I speak as a \n     born-again Christian.\n       ``Hear me, all you evangelicals out there! Hear me!''\n       Byrd was in his eighth term in the Senate, and before that \n     had served three terms in the House. He has been in Congress \n     about 25 percent of the time we have been a country. So his \n     testimony carried great power.\n       Negotiations among the Gang of Fourteen continued \n     feverishly. Not even a panicked Capitol evacuation in early \n     May could stop them. An unidentified plane had violated \n     the airspace over Washington, and the Capitol had to be \n     cleared in a hurry, but McCain, Pryor, and Nelson \n     continued talking nonetheless.\n       Joe Lieberman of Connecticut came to me again, concerned. \n     Talks had gotten down to specific judges, and the group was \n     trying to hammer out a number that would be acceptable to \n     confirm. Senator Lieberman was worried that our side might \n     have been giving away too much, and that in his view the \n     group was in danger of hatching a deal that would be \n     unacceptable to Democrats. He wanted to drop out. I told him \n     again that he couldn't. The future of the country could well \n     depend on his participation.\n       ``Joe. I need you there,'' I told him. ``Help protect us.''\n       Once the existence of the Gang of Fourteen became known, \n     once a ferocious scrutiny became trained on them, the group \n     started to feel an even more determined sense of mission. \n     They realized that they were doing something crucial, and \n     loyalty to party became less important than loyalty to the \n     Senate and to the country, at least for a little while.\n       And until the day that a deal was struck, the Republican \n     leader's office boasted that no such deal was possible.\n       As if to underscore this point, and see his game of chicken \n     through to the end, Frist actually scheduled a vote to change \n     Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate for May 24.\n       The Democratic senators came to see me and told me that \n     they had completed a deal to stop the nuclear option. They \n     had done it. I told Pryor, Nelson, and Salazar, ``Let's hope \n     it works.'' It did. And on the evening of May 23, 2005, the \n     brave Gang of Fourteen, patriots all--Pryor of Arkansas, \n     McCain of Arizona, Nelson of Nebraska, Graham of South \n     Carolina, Salazar of Colorado, Warner of Virginia, Inouye of \n     Hawaii, Snowe of Maine, Lieberman of Connecticut, Collins of \n     Maine, Landrieu of Louisiana, DeWine of Ohio, Byrd of West \n     Virginia, and Chafee of Rhode Island--signed a Memorandum of \n     Understanding, in which they allowed for the consideration of \n     three of the disputed judges, and rabled a couple more. \n     Personally I found these judges unacceptable, but such is \n     compromise. The deal that was struck was very similar to that \n     which I had proposed to Bill Frist months before.\n       As Frist and I were just about to discuss the Gang of \n     Fourteen deal before hordes of gathered press, Susan McCue, \n     my chief of staff, pulled me aside and said, ``Stop smiling \n     so much. Don't gloat.''\n       I didn't gloat, but I was indeed smiling. I couldn't help \n     it.\n       ``I remain concerned,'' Heller told The Washington \n     Examiner. ``The nuclear option, they claim will be limited \n     only to judicial nominations. But I don't believe that for a \n     second. Once they get a taste of the 50-vote threshold, I \n     think this thing spreads to every other issue.''\n       ``The day is going to come that either he's not here or the \n     Republicans take control and if it's a 50-vote threshold, \n     those kind of issues are the ones that concern me the most,'' \n     Heller said. ``When you're from a small state, you need as \n     many arrows in your quiver as possible to fight back on some \n     of these issues that you can be overtaken by. And, frankly, \n     this 60-vote threshold is what has protected and saved Nevada \n     in the past.''\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nTennessee and I be allowed to engage in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I wish to congratulate my friend from Tennessee on a \nbrilliant presentation on the history of the Senate and the current \nmanufactured crisis we face.\n  The only comment I would add, just by way of reiterating the point my \nfriend has already made, the Senator quoted Jefferson and Adams about \nthe tyranny of the majority.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That was de Tocqueville.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. De Tocqueville. Washington, when he was presiding over \nthe Constitutional Convention, according to legend, asked what will the \nSenate be like. He said: Well, it will be like the saucer under the \nteacup. The tea will slosh out of the cup, down into the saucer, and \ncool off.\n  In other words, from the very beginning, it was anticipated by the \nwise men who wrote the Constitution that the Senate would be a place \nwhere things slowed down and were thought over. That has been the \ntradition for a very long time throughout the history of our country.\n  Until the First World War, it was not possible to stop a debate at \nall. Cloture\n\n[[Page S4541]]\n\nwas actually adopted by the Senate in the late teens of the previous \ncentury and then lowered in the 1970s to the current two-thirds.\n  Looking at the history of our country, it is pretty clear to me that \nthe Senate has done exactly what Washington thought it would do, slow \nthings down and move them to the middle, and has been a place where \nbipartisan compromise was by and large achieved, except in periods of \ntime where either side had a very big majority which, of course, our \nfriends on the other side had in 2009 and 2010.\n  The American people took a look at that and decided to issue a \nnational restraining order and restore the kind of Senate they are more \ncomfortable with that operates, to use a football analogy, between the \ntwo 45-yard lines. There is not a doubt in my mind that if the majority \nbreaks the rules of the Senate, to change the rules of the Senate with \nregard to nominations, the next majority will do it for everything. The \nSenator from Tennessee has pointed that out.\n  I wouldn't be able to argue a year and a half from now, if I were the \nmajority leader, to my colleagues that we shouldn't enact our \nlegislative agenda with a simple 51 votes, having seen what the \nprevious majority just did. I mean, there would be no rational basis \nfor that.\n  It is appropriate to talk about what our agenda would be. I would be, \nof course, consulting with my colleagues on what our agenda would be, \nbut I don't think there is any doubt that virtually every Member of the \nSenate Republican conference would think repealing ObamaCare would be \njob one of a new Republican majority. I don't even have to guess is \nwhat likely to be the No. 1 priority: repealing ObamaCare.\n  The Senator from Tennessee mentioned drilling in ANWR. There has been \na majority in the Senate for quite some time, both when the Democrats \nwere in the majority and when the Republicans were in the majority, to \nlift the ban against drilling in ANWR.\n  I think that would certainly be on any top 10 list that I was able to \nput together as majority leader. Approving the Keystone Pipeline, we \nhave gotten as many as 60 votes for that. We have gotten as many as 56 \nvotes for ANWR.\n  What about repealing the death tax? We had as many as 57 votes back \nin 2006 to repeal the death tax entirely. There is a new bill being \nintroduced this afternoon by our colleague, Senator Thune of South \nDakota, to get rid of the death tax altogether, to get rid of the \ndilemma every American faces. He has to visit the IRS and the \nundertaker on the same day, the government's final outrage.\n  These are the kinds of priorities our Members feel strongly about. I \nthink I would be hard-pressed, with the new majority--having just \nwitnessed the way the Senate was changed with a simple majority by the \ncurrent Democratic majority--to argue that we should restrain ourselves \nfrom taking full advantage of this new Senate.\n  From the country's point of view, it is a huge step in the wrong \ndirection. I am not advocating that, but I would be hard-pressed to say \nto our Members, the precedence having been set, why should we confine \nit to nominations.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I agree with the Republican leader.\n  Of course, the distinguished majority leader agrees with the Senator \nas well. He said in his book in 2007--I read it, but I will read it \nagain--when talking about the Republican efforts several years ago, \nRepublicans were so upset with actual obstructionism, as opposed to \nmade up obstructionism, which is what we see here. They were so upset \nthat this is what Senator Reid said: If the majority leader pursues a \nrules change that would kill the filibuster for judicial nominations. \nAnd once you open that Pandora's box, it was just a matter of time \nbefore a Senate leader who couldn't get his way on something moved to \neliminate the filibuster from regular business as well, and that, \nsimply put, would be the end of the Senate.\n  What that means is the Senate would be similar to the House. A \nfreight train could run through it. Many Senators have not visited the \nHouse Rules Committee. I have. It is an interesting place.\n  The Republicans can run the House by a single vote. But if one goes \nup to the Rules Committee--and I am sure the distinguished Republican \nleader has been there--there are thirteen chairs, thirteen members.\n  How many Democrats do you suppose have those chairs? Four. How many \nRepublicans have those chairs? Nine. It is 2 to 1 plus 1 majority in \nthe House Rules Committee. In the House of Representatives, whatever \nthe majority wants to do it can do.\n  If we have a body with 51 votes to make all the decisions, and if I \nand others are deeply concerned about the nuclear waste sitting around \nin some of these 100 reactors--we have several of us on both sides of \nthe aisle who were working on legislation like that--and we want it put \nin a repository, legally, where it is supposed to be, we have 51 votes, \nif they all vote the way they voted before, to order the government to \nopen Yucca Mountain and put the nuclear waste there. This is what we \ncan do with 51 votes.\n  The way our government is designed, the House can order that, which \nthey have. The Senate hasn't because the majority leader has been able \nto make this body stop and think about whether it wanted to do this. I \nmay not like that result, but I prefer that process for the good of the \ncountry to give us the time to work things out.\n  I would ask the Republican leader, hasn't it always been the \nresponsibility, maybe the chief responsibility, of the Republican \nleader and the Democratic leader to preserve this institution? Newer \nSenators may not know as much about it, may not have as long a view as \nthey have.\n\n  Over the time the minority leader has been here, hasn't that been--I \nwould ask through the Chair to the Republican leader, hasn't that been \nthe responsibility of the leaders of the Senate?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will say to my friend from Tennessee, the Senator is \nabsolutely right. The one thing the two leaders have always agreed on \nis to protect the integrity of the institution.\n  For those who may be observing this colloquy, they probably wonder \nwhy it is occurring. I wish to explain to our colleagues--and to any \nothers who may be watching while this colloquy occurs--Senate \nRepublicans are tired of the culture of intimidation.\n  We have seen it over in the executive branch with the IRS and we have \nseen it at HHS with regard to ObamaCare; this feeling that if you are \nnot in the majority you need to sit down, shut up, and get out of the \nway. That mentality, that arrogance of power, has seeped into the \nSenate.\n  The culture of intimidation is this: Do what I want to do when I want \nto do it or I will break the rules of the Senate--change the rules of \nthe Senate by breaking the rules of the Senate. In other words, it is \nthe intimidation, the threat that has been hanging over the Senate as \nan institution for the last few months. It needs to come to an end.\n  I believe that is why the Senator from Tennessee and myself would \nlike the majority leader to answer the question does he intend to keep \nhis word.\n  Senators shouldn't have to walk on eggshells around here, afraid to \nexercise the rights they have under the rules of the Senate. There is \nno question that all Senators have a lot of power in this body. This \nbody operates on unanimous consent. That means if any 1 of the 100 \nwants to deny that, it makes it hard. That is the way the Senate has \nbeen for a very long time.\n  I want the culture of intimidation by the majority in the Senate to \ncome to an end. The way it can end is for the majority leader to say: \nMy word is good, and we will quit having this culture of intimidation \nhanging over the Senate for the next year and a half.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wish to congratulate the Republican leader on his \nremarks. It is important for those watching to know there are plenty of \nus here who know how the Senate is supposed to work, and we are doing \nthat. We passed the farm bill, and we passed the water resources bill, \ninvolving locks, dams, and ports in this country. We did that the way \nthe Senate is supposed to work. We worked across party lines. We got a \nconsensus, got more than the majority, and did it.\n  We have eight Senators who have come forward with an immigration \nbill, a tough issue, but we are working together to see if we can \nresolve that.\n\n[[Page S4542]]\n\n  I am part of a group of six or seven Senators who are trying to lower \ninterest rates for 100 percent of students, not just 40 percent. We are \nnot trying to ram it through with 51 votes, but we are trying to get a \nconsensus and then pass it and send it to the House. Hopefully, they \nwill do it.\n  When the great civil rights bills passed, they were a consensus, and \nthe country accepted them because they were important pieces of \nlegislation.\n  When the Republican leader and I were young--I was here and he was \nalmost here--we saw Senator Dirksen and President Johnson work together \nto get a supermajority to say to the country it is time to move ahead \non civil rights. That is the way the Senate is supposed to work. Let's \nstop the threats, stop the intimidation and recognize the progress we \nhave made and get back to work on immigration.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I wish to conclude by thanking the Senator from \nTennessee for a very impressive presentation and for his reminding us \nall of what makes the Senate great.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about Medicare solvency. I \nknow that to many people the words ``Medicare solvency,'' which is the \nability of the Medicare program to meet its financial obligations, \nsounds like an invitation to a nice nap.\n  You and I pay into Medicare every month, and we need to know that the \nbenefits we paid for will be there when we need them, and not just \nthat. I need to know Medicare will be around to cover my daughter and \nmy new grandson when they become eligible. That is what Medicare \nsolvency is about.\n  A couple of weeks ago we got some good news. According to the annual \nreport released by the Medicare board of trustees, Medicare will stay \nsolvent for 2 years longer than previously estimated.\n  There are a lot of things that are contributing to Medicare solvency, \nbut one big thing is health reform. In fact, Medicare will be solvent \nfor a total of 9 years longer than before we passed health reform. Let \nme say that again. The life of Medicare is 9 years longer today than it \nwas before we passed health reform.\n  HHS Secretary Sebelius said:\n\n       The Affordable Care Act has helped put Medicare on more \n     stable ground without eliminating a single benefit.\n\n  The point is that health reform is not just about making our health \ncoverage more comprehensive, it is not just making sure when we get \nsick we can get the care we need, it is also making Medicare more \nefficient. It is extending the life of Medicare so that Medicare can \nkeep supporting our parents and will be able to support our kids.\n  How exactly has health reform helped extend the solvency of Medicare? \nWell, to start with, it stopped Medicare from overpaying private \ninsurers. As you might know, seniors can choose to get their Medicare \nbenefits directly from the Medicare Program or get them through a \nprivate insurance program that gets paid by Medicare, which is called \nMedicare Advantage. Before we passed health reform, we were overpaying \nthese private insurers by about 14 percent. So we reduced what Medicare \npays these private insurance companies. In fact, over the next 10 years \nwe are going to reduce these insurance payments by about 14 percent, \nwhich CBO scored in 2010 as saving Medicare $136 billion over 10 years.\n  I will note that we were told by some of our colleagues that if we \ndid this, insurance companies were going to leave the market, that we \nweren't going to have Medicare Advantage anymore. Well, so far, \nenrollment in Medicare Advantage has gone up by 10 percent, and I am \nglad about that because Medicare Advantage serves an important purpose \nfor millions of seniors across our country.\n  We are also adjusting reimbursements to hospitals downward. Why and \nhow does that work for hospitals? When you insure 31 million people who \npreviously didn't have insurance, hospitals are no longer on the line \nfor uncompensated care when those 31 million people go into the \nemergency room. The hospitals aren't left holding the bag for all of \nthose costs.\n  And we didn't just extend the life of Medicare by 9 years; while we \nwere at it, we expanded benefits for Medicare beneficiaries. I go to a \nlot of senior centers and nursing homes in my home State of Minnesota, \nand I have to tell you, seniors are very happy about their new \nbenefits. They are very happy about the new free preventive care they \nget--the wellness checkups and the colonoscopies and the mammograms. \nThey know and we know that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of \ncure.\n  Do you know what else we are doing with that money? We are closing \nthe prescription drug doughnut hole--the gap in coverage under Medicare \nwhere seniors have to pay the full costs of their prescription drugs in \nthat gap. Seniors are very happy about that. For more than one-third of \nseniors, Social Security provides more than 90 percent of their income, \nand for one-quarter of elderly beneficiaries, Social Security is the \nsole source of their retirement income. So when Medicare stops covering \nthe cost of their prescription drugs in the doughnut hole, that is \nserious, and sometimes these seniors have to decide between food and \nheat and medicine. Well, because we have been closing this doughnut \nhole, many don't have to make that impossible choice anymore.\n  When I was running for the Senate back in 2008, a nurse in Cambridge, \nMN, told me about a senior being hospitalized. She was being treated by \nthe doctors and nurses so that she would be well enough to leave the \nhospital, and when she left the hospital, they would make sure to give \nher the prescriptions she needed.\n  After a few days, this nurse would call the pharmacy and ask: Has \nMrs. Johnson come in and filled those prescriptions?\n  The pharmacist would say: No, she hasn't.\n  Why was that? Because she was in the doughnut hole. And guess what. \nIn 10 days or in 2 weeks or whatever, Mrs. Johnson would end up back in \nthe hospital because she couldn't afford her medicine. These \nreadmissions cost our health care system a lot of money. But now, \nbecause we are closing the doughnut hole as part of the health care \nlaw, these seniors are able to get their medicine. This is improving \ntheir health, and it is saving us money.\n  So we have increased benefits and extended the life of Medicare, and \nthat was done as part of health care reform.\n  Many of the provisions of the health care reform law will make our \nhealth care system more efficient and will lower costs in the long run. \nI wish to touch briefly on one I authored that is already keeping costs \ndown for families in Minnesota and across our country. The provision of \nthe health care reform law that I authored is based on a Minnesota law \nin a way. In 1993 Minnesota wrote a law that insurance companies had to \nreport their medical loss ratio, and that is the piece I wrote into the \nlaw.\n  What is the medical loss ratio? Medical loss ratio is the percentage \nof premiums a health insurer receives that goes to actual health care--\nto actual health care, not to administrative costs, not to marketing \ncosts, not to profits, not to CEO salaries, but actual health care.\n  Starting in 1993 Minnesota health insurers had to submit to the \ncommissioner of commerce--the Minnesota Department of Commerce--their \nmedical loss ratio. They had to compute it and submit it. I took that \nand I put a little wrinkle into it. I wrote something called the 80-20 \nrule, which says that insurance companies have to spend at least 80 \npercent of their premiums on actual health care for small group \npolicies and individual policies and 85 percent for large group \npolicies, and if they do not meet that, the health insurer has to \nrebate the difference. Well, thanks to this provision of the law, last \nyear more than 12 million Americans benefited from $1.1 billion in \nrebates from insurers that did not meet the 80-20 rule, including \n123,000 consumers in Minnesota.\n  In a new report, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that premiums \nin the individual market would have been $1.9 billion higher last year \nif it weren't for the medical loss ratio rule and they would have been \n$856 million higher in 2011. That is more than $2.75\n\n[[Page S4543]]\n\nbillion in savings over the last 2 years alone. Those savings are in \naddition to the rebates consumers received. They estimated that \ninsurers would have raised their rates that much more--$2.75 billion \nmore--if they hadn't had to meet the 80-20 rule. This is another \nimportant way the health reform law is keeping health care costs down. \nSo the rule I wrote into the law has already saved Americans nearly $4 \nbillion in health care costs.\n  In fact, after going up at three times the rate of inflation for a \ndecade, over each of the last 2 years health care costs have gone up \nless than 4 percent for the first time in 50 years. That is according \nto data released by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  Now, I am not saying we are done, not by any stretch of the \nimagination. We have more work to do. In fact, one big thing we could \ndo would be to allow Medicare to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers on the price of their drugs. The VA does this, and they \npay nearly 50 percent less for the top 10 drugs than Medicare does. I \nhave a bill to allow Medicare to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers, and I hope to work with my colleagues to bring this \nproposal to the floor.\n  At the end of the day, my job is about strengthening what works in \nour country and fixing what doesn't. Medicare works. It works for \nseniors across the Nation, it works for grandparents from Pipestone to \nGrand Marais, and I hope to work with my colleagues to protect Medicare \nbenefits for our parents and grandparents, while strengthening the \nprogram for our children and grandchildren.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The assistant majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/18/senate-section/article/S4543-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4543-S4544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO RAY LaHOOD\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when President Obama was first elected \nback in 2008, I can recall the transition period because his transition \noffice was literally next door to my office in the Federal building in \nChicago. I can't think of a more exciting time. Here was my colleague \nin the Senate who had just been elected President of the United States.\n  The whole world was beating a path to his door. Security was at the \nhighest level, and I made a point of not interrupting him--which I \nwould have done regularly when he was my Senate colleague--during this \nhistoric and important moment as he prepared to lead America with the \nblessing and the mandate of the American people.\n  I didn't have a long list of requests--well, I did, but I didn't \nexercise it--but I spoke to him once or twice about a couple of things \nI thought might be helpful to the country and to him. I recommended to \nhim one person to appoint to his Cabinet--one person. I urged him to \nappoint Ray LaHood as America's Secretary of Transportation. I was \nconfident that Ray LaHood would serve America with the same integrity \nand energy he had shown while serving as a Member of Congress from our \nState of Illinois. As Secretary Ray LaHood prepares to leave this \nimportant Cabinet post, I am pleased but not a bit surprised to be able \nto say to the President that I was right. He was an excellent choice--\nin fact, one of the best ever when it comes to the Department of \nTransportation.\n  Make no mistake, Ray LaHood is a proud Republican. I remember meeting \nhim first when he was a staffer for Bob Michel, who was the Republican \nleader in the U.S. House of Representatives. Ray was a behind-the-\nscenes worker for the Republican minority leader in the House, and I \nknew he was from Peoria but little else about him. When Bob Michel \nannounced his retirement, Ray LaHood said he was going to run for that \nposition in Congress.\n  What surprised me was that some of my closest Democratic friends in \ncentral Illinois said they were going to financially support and do \neverything they could to elect Ray LaHood. And I thought, this is \nreally amazing. These partisan friends of mine think Ray LaHood, a \nRepublican, is a good person for this job.\n  So I started paying closer attention to this new Congressman. As it \nturned out, we became close friends. We worked together. We had \nadjoining congressional districts. Eventually, when I was elected to \nthe Senate, we worked all through central Illinois on common projects, \nand I was happy to do it. Ray was not working with a great appetite for \npublicity; he wanted to get the job done, and he didn't mind giving \ncredit to Democrats or Republicans if we could achieve our goals, the \nlocal goals we shared.\n  When he became Secretary of Transportation I saw that same spirit of \ncooperation and bipartisanship. Any time I spoke to President Obama or \nVice President Biden about Ray LaHood, their Secretary of \nTransportation, they always said the same thing: He is the best and we \nare sure glad he is part of our team.\n  The President could not find anyone better to carry out the \ntransportation agenda for America in his first term. I believe history \nis going to record Ray LaHood as one of the very best in that position. \nHe put millions of Americans back to work with the $48 billion \ntransportation funding that was part of President Obama's Recovery Act. \nHe oversaw the creation of the Nation's first high-speed rail program, \na program that Illinois has participated in with great commitment and \nexcitement. He also helped to create the TIGER Program, a $2.7 billion \ninvestment in America's future that has built some of our Nation's most \nsignificant transportation projects. And he helped save lives by \nfocusing personally on our national aviation system.\n  He also had another safety campaign. He conducted what he called a \nrampage against distracted driving, people who were texting or talking \non cell phones and trying to drive at the same time. He traveled more \nwidely and more frequently than many professional pilots did. As a \nWashington Post reporter wrote a while back:\n\n       There are just two kinds of states: States where [Ray \n     LaHood has] been to spread his gospel of safety and to \n     inspect transportation systems and those States that he plans \n     to visit soon.\n\n  The people of Illinois are grateful to Ray LaHood not only for his 4 \nhistoric years as Transportation Secretary, but also for his many \ndecades of service as staffer to Bob Michel and then a member in his \nown right in our Illinois delegation.\n  Ray was born and raised in Peoria, IL. He stayed true to his \nMidwestern values throughout his career. He started his public service \nas a teacher in a classroom. He cut his political teeth working for \nanother top Republican Congressman, Tom Railsback. As I mentioned, then \nhe went on to work for Bob Michel. In 1994 he was elected to Bob \nMichel's congressional district, the 18th District. The district \nstretches from Peoria, south to the State capital, my hometown of \nSpringfield.\n  There is a history of some pretty outstanding Congressmen from that \ndistrict. I mentioned Bob Michel, and I can include Everett McKinley \nDirksen as well. If you go far enough back in history you will find \nthere was a young Congressman from a part of that district by the name \nof Abraham Lincoln.\n  Ray is a great student of history. He inspired a great effort to \ncreate the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, and I was honored \nto join him as a co-chair with Harold Holzer of New York. We observed \nPresident Lincoln's 200th birthday in 2009 with suitable recognition \nand celebration across America.\n  Ray's work helped students everywhere learn a little bit more about \nPresident Lincoln and his role in America's history. Like his famous \npredecessors, Ray LaHood has raised the standard for civility and \ncooperation in the Congress. In the darkest hours of the House of \nRepresentatives when people were at each other's throats, it was Ray \nLaHood who reached across the aisle to a Democratic Congressman and \nsaid: Why don't we get together on a bipartisan basis, with our \nfamilies, for a weekend. It seems so obvious and easy. Nobody had ever \nthought about it before Ray.\n  Back in Illinois Ray used to convene bipartisan meetings with local \nofficials, State representatives, and his dedication to his district \nand his service in the House earned him the reputation as one of the \nbest. When President Obama nominated Ray for Transportation Secretary, \nall of us in Illinois knew the President had chosen the right person.\n  Ray's legacy in DC will be substantial, but it will be even greater \nback in\n\n[[Page S4544]]\n\nIllinois. He has helped protect and build Illinois during his tenure at \nthe Department of Transportation. It was such a treat to be able to \ncall the Department of Transportation, to speak to the Secretary of \nTransportation about an Illinois project and have him know instantly \nwhat you were talking about.\n  The O'Hare Modernization Program is a good example. There is hardly a \nmore important economic engine in the northern part of our State than \nthe O'Hare Airport. The modernization of O'Hare had reached a period of \nsome difficulty and controversy. Ray LaHood stepped in, brought the \nparties together, and put the Nation's largest airport expansion \nproject back on track.\n  Secretary LaHood, as I mentioned earlier, brought high-speed rail to \nIllinois. Last year we rode the first 110-mile-an-hour train between \nChicago and St. Louis. He helped build a beautiful new terminal at the \nPeoria International Airport.\n  Secretary LaHood's dedication to Illinois will be felt in every \ncorner of Illinois for generations to come. People will be able to \ntravel faster and more safely because of his work. He will bring new \nbusinesses to the State by those transportation investments, creating \nthe jobs that we all want to see.\n  Ray LaHood is a leader with integrity and character. He is also such \na good friend. I am going to miss him as my partner in government when \nhe retires from the position of Secretary of Transportation. The \nWashington Post article I mentioned earlier had a wonderful line. The \nreporter wrote:\n  Perhaps the most telling tidbit in LaHood's life is that he resided \nin Washington for 30 years without once getting a haircut here. A man \ntruly lives where he gets his haircut, and [for Ray LaHood] that is in \nPeoria, [IL].\n  As Ray LaHood prepares to leave President Obama's Cabinet and spend \nmore time with his family, I wish the best to him. His wife Kathy--who \nwas often at his side traveling back and forth between Illinois and \nWashington--will have more time with Ray and their four children: Amy, \nSara, Sam, and State Senator Darin LaHood and their wonderful families \ntoo. I look forward to working with Secretary LaHood and his very able \nsuccessor, former Charlotte mayor Anthony Foxx, to maintain and improve \nAmerica's transportation systems and networks, the backbone of our \neconomy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/18/senate-section/article/S4544-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4544-S4545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the continuing toll \nof gun violence on our Nation and on my home State of Illinois.\n  This past week we lost too many Americans, and too many Illinoisans, \nto gunfire. Last Monday, 18-year-old April McDaniel was sitting on her \nporch in Chicago when a masked gunman in a car opened fire, killing \nApril and wounding four of her friends. Last Tuesday, four members of \nthe Andrus family in Darien, Illinois--including the family's two \ndaughters, ages 16 and 22--were shot to death in an apparent murder-\nsuicide. On Thursday, 19-year-old Robert Allen was killed in a drive-by \nshooting on the South Side of Chicago. And over the weekend, at least 6 \nwere killed and dozens more were wounded in shootings across the \nChicago area.\n  This senseless violence is devastating personally to the families \ninvolved, and to all of us. Our thoughts and prayers are with the \nvictims and with their families. The sad reality is that gun violence \ncontinues to be an epidemic in America. Over 11,000 Americans are \nmurdered with guns each year. If you count suicides and accidental \nshootings, the death toll from guns rises to more than 31,000 Americans \neach year. We have become almost used to this, haven't we? We hear \nabout it every night on the news and we begin to think this is normal. \nBut it isn't normal in any country on Earth for so many people to die \nfrom the use of firearms.\n  You can get a sense of this grim toll by reading the daily ``Gun \nReport'' by New York Times columnist Joe Nocera. The report compiles \nnews stories about shootings across the nation. For example, \nyesterday's Gun Report describes shootings that took place over the \nweekend. It mentions: a 3-year-old in Columbus, Ohio and a 4-year-old \nin Wichita, Kansas who were hit on Friday by stray bullets; an 18-year-\nold girl in Ankeny, Iowa, who was accidentally shot and killed by her \nfather on Friday; a 30-minute shooting spree in Omaha, Nebraska on \nSaturday that left two dead and two critically injured; a 76-year-old \nman who shot and killed his 75-year-old wife on Saturday in Cortlandt, \nNew York after an argument; and a man who walked into a Catholic church \nin Ogden, Utah and shot his father-in-law in the head during Sunday \nmass. These are just a few of the shootings mentioned in one Gun \nReport. And each new day brings another long list of shootings in \ncommunities across America. It is appalling.\n  Last Friday marked 6 months since the tragedy in Newtown when a \ngunman murdered 20 small children and 6 educators at Sandy Hook \nElementary School. In the 6 months since that awful day, over 5,000 \nmore Americans have been killed by gunfire.\n  I commend my colleagues from Connecticut, Senator Chris Murphy and \nSenator Richard Blumenthal, who have come to this floor repeatedly to \ncall for reforms that will spare other families the tragedy that the \nNewtown families have suffered.\n  We need to heed those calls. We cannot simply shrug our shoulders and \nwrite off this epidemic of gun violence as the cost of living in \nAmerica.\n  There is some progress to report when it comes to reducing gun \nviolence. Officials at the local and state level are taking proactive \nsteps that are showing promising results.\n  In Chicago, for example, targeted policing strategies and community-\nbased violence-prevention efforts have contributed to a 31 percent \nreported decrease in homicides compared to last year. The violence of \nthis past week shows that more needs to be done, but this decline in \nkillings is positive news. I commend the local officials, including \nmayor Rahm Emanuel, who are doing everything they can to reduce gun \nviolence.\n  The General Assembly in Illinois just passed important legislation \nthat would mandate background checks for private gun sales and require \nreporting of lost and stolen guns to law enforcement, something we \nfailed to do. It should be a national law.\n  These are steps that will help keep guns out of the hands of \ncriminals and the mentally ill. They will help reduce crime and save \nlives.\n  Other States are stepping up as well, with significant reforms passed \nin States like Colorado, New York, Maryland and Connecticut.\n  But State action alone is not sufficient. We need to do our part in \nWashington. Too often these guns cross State lines. Too often States \nhave weak gun laws next to States with strong gun laws. That is why \nCongress needs to plug the gaping loopholes in our Federal background \ncheck system by passing legislation by Senator Joe Manchin, a \nconservative Democrat from West Virginia, and Senator Patrick Toomey, a \nconservative Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Congress also needs to pass a bill with real teeth to crack down on \nstraw purchasing and gun trafficking, a bill that I worked on with \nSenators Leahy, Collins, Gillibrand, and my colleague from Illinois, \nMark Kirk.\n  Members of Congress need to take a stand on the issue of gun safety \nand gun violence. There should be no more hiding behind these empty, \nsham reform proposals written by the gun lobby to accomplish nothing. \nAnd no more claims that all we need to do is just enforce the laws on \nthe books because we know the gun lobby has put loopholes in those laws \nthat you can drive a truck through.\n  I want to mention a few things Congress should do to help reduce gun \nviolence beyond the two items I mentioned. First, I will introduce \nlegislation to encourage more crime gun tracing by State and local law \nenforcement. Crime gun tracing is a valuable tool for criminal \ninvestigations. When a gun is recovered in a crime, a police department \ncan ask the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, known \nas the ATF, to trace the crime gun back to its first retail sale. This \ninformation can help identify criminal suspects and potential gun \ntraffickers. When all the crime guns in an area are traced, law \nenforcement can start to define and identify trafficking patterns.\n\n[[Page S4545]]\n\n  ATF's crime gun tracing system is easy for law enforcement and it is \nfree. Several years ago I reached out and challenged all of the law \nenforcement agencies in Illinois to submit the guns they had seized in \ncrimes for tracing through the ATF. I am pleased to report that 388 \nIllinois agencies are now using the system called eTRACE but there are \nstill thousands and thousands of law enforcement agencies across \nAmerica that are not tracing their crime guns.\n  The legislation I am introducing is called the Crime Gun Tracing Act. \nIt will require law enforcement agencies that apply for Federal COPS \ngrants to report how many crime guns they recovered in the last year \nand how many they submitted for tracing. It will then give a preference \nin COPS grant awards to agencies that traced all the crime guns they \nrecovered.\n  To be clear, law enforcement agencies should not just sit around and \nwait for a bill to pass before they start tracing crime guns. Tracing \nbrings enormous benefits at virtually no cost. Agencies should not wait \nfor this bill; they ought to start tracing today if they have not done \nso already. But the reality is many police departments, sheriffs' \noffices, have not been doing this. My bill will create an incentive for \nthem to start.\n  Let me say something else. The Senate needs to confirm a Director to \nhead the ATF. For the record, ATF has never had a Senate-confirmed \nDirector. The Senate refused to confirm a Director under President \nGeorge W. Bush and refused the second proposed Director under President \nObama. Now a third candidate is being considered.\n  Since the Director position began requiring Senate confirmation in \n2006, ATF has only had short-term Acting Directors, temporary leaders.\n  Whether it is a Republican President or a Democratic President, the \ngun lobby and their friends in the Senate have objected to every \nnominee. It looks as if they are preparing to mount an effort to stop \nthe most recent nominee by President Obama, Todd Jones of Minnesota.\n  To be effective and accountable, Federal law enforcement agencies \nneed Senate-confirmed leadership. But the gun lobby has done everything \nit can to keep this agency leaderless and weak. This is beyond \nhypocritical.\n  After the tragedy in Newtown, Mr. Wayne LaPierre of the National \nRifle Association appeared before our Senate Judiciary Committee and \nsaid he opposed efforts to close gun loopholes because ``we need to \nenforce the thousands of gun laws that are currently on the books.'' \nWell, the agency that enforces Federal gun laws and refers gun cases \nfor Federal prosecution is the ATF. In fact, for the past 15 years \nthere has been a provision written in an appropriations bill, a gun \nlobby rider, that prohibits any of ATF's enforcement functions from \nbeing moved to another agency. So the NRA is making sure that the ATF \nis the only game in town when it comes to enforcing gun laws, and then \nthey are making sure it never has a permanent Director.\n  I want to put the gun lobby on notice. If we can't get a Senate-\nconfirmed Director for the ATF, then I am going to move to repeal the \nrider and bring in other Federal agencies with Senate-confirmed \nleadership--such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation--to make sure \ngun laws are enforced effectively in this country. The National Rifle \nAssociation and the gun lobby cannot have it both ways. They cannot \ncomplain that the gun laws are not being enforced and then stop any \neffort to put a permanent leader in place at this agency. The gun lobby \nhas to make that choice. If they want to enforce gun laws on the books, \nthey can work with us to confirm a Director at the ATF. If they want to \nkeep blocking the ATF from having a Director, we will have to get other \nagencies involved to make sure laws are enforced. It is that simple.\n  In closing, I again extend my sympathy and prayers to the victims and \nfamilies of gun violence. We have to do our part in Washington to put \nan end to this. We haven't had the votes we needed yet, but we should \nnot give up. The American people are counting on us to make America \nsafer.\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that my last statement be \nplaced in a separate part of the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/18/senate-section/article/S4545-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4545-S4546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TYMOSHENKO IMPRISONMENT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an issue that I hoped I \nwouldn't need to bring up today but unfortunately I do. I am referring \nto the continued imprisonment of the former Prime Minister of Ukraine, \nYulia Tymoshenko, who has now sat in jail for almost 2 years.\n  In the fall of 2011 Ms. Tymoshenko was imprisoned for a 7-year term \non charges that she abused her office in connection with a natural gas \ncontract with Russia. I cannot judge the wisdom of that contract, but \nwhat is deeply troubling to me is the appearance of selective and \npolitically motivated imprisonment of a former political leader in the \ndemocratic nation of Ukraine.\n  Ukraine is a promising and hopeful new member of the community of \nfree-market democracies--one with a solid future in the West. It has \nstrong ties to Europe and the United States.\n  This photo shows police officers leading former Ukranian Prime \nMinister Yulia Tymoshenko out of the courtroom after the verdict in her \ncase in Kiev on October 11, 2011.\n  Ukraine is a great nation. It has helped NATO in Bosnia, Libya, Iraq, \nand Afghanistan. It is a major contributor and a valuable international \npeacekeeper. It was an early leader in throwing away the shackles of \nthe Soviet Union and declaring its own independence.\n  In 2004 Ms. Tymoshenko and countless other Ukrainians organized a \nseries of historic protests known as the Orange Revolution to address \nelectoral fraud in the Presidential election in those days.\n  Ukraine's future is clearly with the community of democracies, and \nthat is why the imprisonment of this former Prime Minister is so \ntroubling. When a nation is a member of a community of democracies, it \ncan't selectively throw its political opponents in jail for \nquestionable policy decisions. If a poor policy decision is made, let \nthe voters decide at the ballot box.\n  In the neighboring dictatorship of Belarus, 2010 Presidential \ncandidate Mikalai Statkevich, who had the temerity to run against the \nstrong-man dictator Viktor Lukashenko, still sits in jail because he \nchallenged the dictator in an election. I might remind my friends in \nUkraine that they do not want to be compared to Belarus. They should be \ndemocratic.\n  Countless international human rights groups and other countries have \ndecried the charges against Ms. Tymoshenko and called for her release. \nThe Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe passed a resolution \nin January of 2012 declaring that the articles under which Ms. \nTymoshenko was convicted were overly broad in application and \neffectively allow for ex post facto criminalization of normal political \ndecisionmaking. Later that year both the European Parliament and our \nvery own Senate passed resolutions condemning the sentencing of Ms. \nTymoshenko and calling for her release.\n  The European Court of Human Rights, which settles cases of rights \nabuses after plaintiffs have exhausted appeals in their home country \ncourts, recently considered this case and ruled that Ms. Tymoshenko's \npretrial detention was unlawful, that the lawfulness of her detention \nhad not been properly reviewed, her right to liberty had been \nrestricted, and that she had no possibility to seek compensation for \nher unlawful deprivation. That is unacceptable.\n  I truly hope this ruling will finally create the circumstances for a \nface-saving way out of this mess. Unfortunately and regrettably, it has \nnot happened. That is why I joined my colleagues, Senators Rubio, \nBoxer, Barrasso, Murphy, and Cardin, in submitting a resolution on the \nmatter. It is simple and straightforward and expresses continued \nconcern about Ms. Tymoshenko's selective and politically motivated \ndetention.\n  I will close by saying that I was in Ukraine last year. I met with \nPrime Minister Azarov and President Yanukovych. They were generous \nhosts and very kind. They told me that something would be done in a \npositive way about Ms. Tymoshenko's imprisonment. That was a year ago \nand nothing has happened. I was optimistic then\n\n[[Page S4546]]\n\nand I will remain optimistic, but I want the Ukraine Government to know \nthat we are going to hold them to the standards of democracy. They \ncannot imprison political opponents. You beat them in an election, move \non to lead, and you are held accountable by the people who vote.\n  I hope a decision will be made in the near future to release Ms. \nTymoshenko.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, when I closed last night I posed nine \nquestions to Secretary Napolitano about the immigration bill. She said \nthat when confirmed, she would answer questions that Congress put \nbefore her. My questions came at the end of her hearing on the \nimmigration bill, and we have not received an answer now in 49 or 50 \ndays. I would appreciate answers to those questions.\n  I would like to speak about the entry-exit system in the legislation \nbefore us. One of the concerns that has been made about the immigration \nbill before us is that it weakens current law in several areas. Now, \nwhen I go to my town meetings, I invariably get somebody who says: We \ndon't need more legislation; just enforce the laws that are on the \nbooks. Those very same constituents of mine would probably be really \nchagrined at the fact that we have legislation before us that would \nweaken current law.\n  Well, we had a lengthy discussion during the Judiciary Committee \nmarkup about provisions dealing with criminal activity and deterring \nillegal immigration in the future. I have found that many existing \nstatutes in this legislation--1,175 pages--have been revised and \nwatered down, which sends exactly the wrong signal that should be sent \nto the people who seek to intentionally break our laws.\n  The sponsors of the bill have claimed that the bill will make us \nsafer. They insist that the people will ``come out of the shadows,'' \nthus allowing us to know exactly who is here, where they are, and \nwhether they are a national security risk.\n  We have talked a lot about the need for border security in the last \nweek. I think it is the most important thing we can do for our national \nsecurity and to protect our sovereignty. Border security is what the \npeople demand. This legislation has weak border security provisions.\n  Amazingly, when I bring up border security, I am told by proponents \nof the bill that we don't need to put our entire focus on the border. \nWell, tell that to the people of grassroots America. These authors \nremind me that about 40 percent of the people here illegally are visa \noverstays or people who never returned to their home country. I don't \ndispute that 40-percent figure. I couldn't agree more that visa \noverstays need to be dealt with as much as people who are here \nundocumented and did not come here on a visa. We need to know who is in \nour country and when they are supposed to depart, and then we need to \nknow if they actually leave.\n  We realized this way back in 1996 when we created the entry-exit \nsystem. At that time, Congress--and still today--under the law, called \nfor a tracking system to be created, and this followed the first \nbombing of the World Trade Center. We knew there were gaping holes in \nour visa system, and that is why the entry-exit system was set up. \nUnfortunately--and the people of this country probably don't believe \nthis--we had legislation calling for this system to be in place and it \nstill is not in place. Administration after administration--and that is \nDemocratic, Republican, and now Democratic--dismissed the need to \nimplement an effective entry-exit system, thumbing their noses at the \nlaws on the books. So here we are today--17 years later--wondering when \nthat system and mandate from Congress will be achieved.\n  When introduced, the bill before us did nothing to track people who \nleft by land. It did nothing to capture biometrics of foreign nationals \nwho departed. We approved an amendment in committee that made the \nunderlying bill a little bit stronger, but it fell short of current \nlaw. Current law says we should track all people who come and go by \nusing biometrics. It says the entry-exit system should be in place at \nall air, sea, and land ports. We already know that anything less than \nwhat is in current law will not be effective.\n  The Government Accountability Office has stated that a biographic \nexit system, such as the one set forth in the underlying legislation, \nwill only hinder efforts to reliably identify overstays and that \nwithout a biometrics exit system, ``DHS cannot ensure the integrity of \nthe immigration system by identifying and removing those who have \noverstayed their original period of admission--a stated goal of US-\nVISIT.'' If we don't properly track departures, we won't know how many \npeople are overstaying their visas and we won't have any clue of who is \nin our country.\n  Some will say: We can't afford it. Some will say: Our airports aren't \ndevised in such a way to capture biometrics before people board \nairplanes. They will find any excuse not to implement current law, and \nthat is why this current law hasn't been executed in the last 17 years.\n  This is a border security and national security issue. Without this \nsystem in place, we are not in control of our immigration system.\n  Senator Vitter's amendment, which is pending, would ensure the \ncurrent law is met before we legalize millions of people. I encourage \nmy colleagues to understand how this bill weakens our ability to \nprotect the homeland. I also encourage the adoption of the Vitter \namendment when we vote at 3 o'clock.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/18/senate-section/article/S4546-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am encouraged that later today the Senate \nwill vote on four amendments to the\n\n[[Page S4547]]\n\nimmigration bill. I hope it is an indication that the Senate is going \nto begin considering amendments in an orderly and efficient way. I \nwould encourage Senators to file their amendments and come to the floor \nand offer them. I share the majority leader's wish to make progress on \nthis important legislation. We know the immigration system is sorely in \nneed of reform and now is the time to do it.\n  Last week we should have disposed of several amendments to the bill \nbefore us, but in the Senate, progress requires cooperation. Instead of \ngoing forward and actually having Senators take positions and vote up \nor down, we had objection after objection from the opponents of this \nlegislation who put the Senate in the unenviable position of having the \npublic see us as voting ``maybe.'' We know why people get discouraged \nwith Congress. They don't realize that there is a small number of \npeople blocking any voting. They expect us to vote for or against \nsomething. There are going to be political costs to voting for or \nvoting against, but they expect us to vote. It comes with the job. And \nwhen people objected to proceeding to comprehensive immigration reform, \nthat cost us several days. Again, the American public sees the Senate \nas voting ``maybe.''\n  Well, I am one Senator willing to take the consequences of voting for \nor against something and not voting ``maybe.'' I think most Senators \nwould prefer voting yes or no and not maybe. In fact, when we finally \nended the filibuster and were able to vote to proceed to the bill, 84 \nSenators stood up and said, Let's proceed. They voted in favor of doing \nso. They know they are going to risk some criticism for doing that, but \nat least they had the courage to do it.\n  We still have a tiny handful of Senators who keep on trying to say \nvote ``maybe.'' It is frustrating because that initial delay was not \nnecessary. It didn't add to the debate. It simply hindered the Senate's \nconsideration of the bill. In fact, opponents of the bipartisan \nlegislation have even objected to adoption of the Judiciary Committee \nsubstitute bill despite widespread praise from both Republicans and \nDemocrats for how we conducted our proceedings and our overwhelming \nbipartisan vote to get the bill to the full Senate. This was a bill \nwhere almost all of the amendments accepted in Committee were on a \nbipartisan vote. Additionally, over 40 amendments offered by \nRepublicans were accepted by the Committee.\n  So the votes against even proceeding to this bill indicate that at \nleast 15 Members of the minority are so dug in against comprehensive \nimmigration reform that they are unalterably opposed. They want us to \nvote maybe to duck the issue. They want to duck the issue. That is not \na profile in courage. Those few Senators should not further obstruct \nthe 84 Senators who appear ready to go to work on this bill and vote \nfor or against it. The question is whether the other Members of the \nRepublican Party will follow those who seek to delay the Senate's \nconsideration or whether they will work with us to pass a good bill.\n  More than 100 amendments have been filed to the comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill, but over the last 2 weeks we have only voted \nonce on the motion to table an amendment that already had been defeated \nin committee.\n\n  I began this process with a spirit of cooperation. I offered an \namendment on behalf of myself and Senator Hatch, the senior member of \nthe Republican Party, to strengthen our visa program for visiting \nforeign artists who come to perform with nonprofit arts organizations. \nI was then willing, following the procedures and the cooperation I have \nknown here in the Senate for decades, to give consent to Senator \nGrassley to set aside my amendment and offer his amendment relating to \nborder security. Unfortunately, when we asked for the same courtesy so \nthat other Senators, Republicans and Democrats alike, could call up \nadditional amendments, there was an objection. I was expected to \ncooperate and follow this normal procedure, but the second we asked for \nthe other side to do that, it was: Oh, no, we can't do it. The rules \nhave to be different.\n  Then when the majority leader offered a unanimous consent request to \nhave votes on the Grassley amendment and others in a manner that Senate \nRepublicans, including the Senate Republican leader just a few days \nago, had been insisting on with respect to amendments and legislation \nand nominations, the minority objected.\n  Then when the majority leader asked that a group of amendments \noffered by Senators on both sides of the aisle be allowed to be \noffered, again there was an objection.\n  So it is with great effort that we are trying to work through \namendments. But like the minority's treatment of nominations, even \nconsensus amendments are being objected to and delayed. We have been \nunable to get an amendment by the Republican Senator from Nevada \npending because there is Republican objection to a Republican Senator \noffering an amendment which is probably going to pass with overwhelming \nsupport from both Republicans and Democrats. It is no wonder public \napproval of Congress in last week's Gallup poll is 10 percent. At a \ntime when so many Americans are in favor of reforming the Nation's \nbroken immigration system, we in the Senate should be working together \nto meet that demand and reflect what the people of America want.\n  The President spoke again last week about immigration reform and what \nis needed. The President had with him a broad cross-section of those \nsupporting our efforts from business and labor to law enforcement, \nclergy, and from both sides of the aisle. Just as I worked with \nPresident Bush in 2006 when he supported comprehensive immigration \nreform, I urge Senate Republicans to work with us now. Senators from \nboth sides of the aisle worked together to develop this legislation--\nSenators from both sides of the aisle.\n  Then Senators from the Judiciary Committee considered it and adopted \nmore than 130 amendments to improve it, almost all of them with a \nbipartisan vote. Senators from both sides of the aisle need to come \ntogether now to defeat debilitating amendments and pass this \nlegislation.\n  One of the procedural disputes that has delayed us is the application \nof what the Majority Leader has termed the ``McConnell rule'' to \nprovide for 60-vote thresholds for adopting amendments. Senate \nRepublicans are now objecting to their leader's own rule. That is why \nthe Majority Leader on Thursday took the action left to him to move \nforward on the bill and moved to table Senator Grassley's amendment, \nwhich I had worked with Senator Grassley to allow him to offer and have \npending. I am glad that we have now gotten agreement to treat \nRepublican and Democratic amendments equally.\n  Though I am encouraged that we will begin voting on this legislation, \nI believe that the Senate should not have gone down the path insisted \nupon by the Republican leader when he demanded supermajority votes of \n60 by the Senate on so many amendments and legislation. He has made \neverything subject to a filibuster standard. I have tried to have the \nSenate act by a majority vote, which is the practice I would favor. \nUnfortunately, the Republican leader has prevailed over and over again \nand Republicans have insisted on 60-vote thresholds for the adoption of \namendments. That is the rule on which they have insisted. And late last \nweek, the minority objected to its own rule when the Majority Leader \nasked for consent to set votes for the Senate. They cannot insist upon \na rule for one side and not the other. They cannot have it both ways. I \nunderstand why the Majority Leader has asked for the same consents on \nwhich the Republican leader has insisted for years, following what the \nMajority Leader has termed the ``McConnell rule.''\n  What Republican Senators were insisting upon is a simple majority \nthreshold for their amendments and a 60-vote barrier for Democratic \nSenators' amendments. That is not fair. I am ready to work with the \nMajority Leader, the Republican leader, the Chairman and ranking member \nof the Rules Committee, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee \nand other interested Senators on reestablishing majority rule in the \nSenate except in special circumstances. That new arrangement will have \nto follow our work on this bill and not delay or be applied \nretroactively to undermine comprehensive immigration reform.\n  With respect to Senator Grassley's amendment, which was tabled last\n\n[[Page S4548]]\n\nweek, I note that it was tabled by a bipartisan majority of 57 votes. \nThat included five Republican votes. Of course, this was an amendment, \nas most people knew on the floor, that had been considered by the \nJudiciary Committee. It was defeated by a bipartisan vote of two-thirds \nof the committee. It would have undermined and unfairly preempted the \npathway to earn citizenship. It would have made the fates of millions \nseeking to come out of the shadows to join American life unfairly \ndepend on circumstances way beyond any control they might have. I am \ntroubled by proposals that contain false promises in which we promise \ncitizenship, but it is always over the next mountain: We are going to \ngive citizenship, but not quite yet. It is almost like Sisyphus pushing \nthat rock up the hill. I want the pathway to be clear and the goal of \ncitizenship attainable. It can't be rigged by some elusive \nprecondition. We should treat people fairly and not have their fates \ndetermined by matters beyond their control. No undocumented American \ncontrols the border or is responsible for its security. The things that \nare being set up to kill this bill would have blocked my grandparents \nfrom coming to Vermont from Italy and would have blocked the parents \nand grandparents of many of the Senators now serving in the Senate. So \nI don't want people to move out of the shadows or to be stuck in some \nunderclass. Just as we should not fault the DREAMers who were brought \nhere as children, we should not make people's fates and future status \ndependent on border enforcement conditions over which they have no \ncontrol.\n\n  This legislation is far too important to be subject to needless \ndelay, and I hope the votes today signal an end to the delay we have \nexperienced until this point. We should have a healthy and vigorous \ndebate on the bill reported out of the Judiciary Committee. Central to \nthat debate is considering and voting on amendments.\n  One of the bright moments so far during this debate, in the view of \nthe American public, was the way Republicans and Democrats alike worked \nin the Senate Judiciary Committee to get this bill before us in the \nfull Senate. The public debate was followed online by thousands of \npeople. We brought up amendments, we debated them, and then we voted on \nthem. Nobody voted maybe; they voted yes and they voted no. The \nAmerican public responded overwhelmingly, saying this was the way to \ngo, and I think Republicans and Democrats on the floor justly praised \nthe way it was done in the Judiciary Committee. There were 18 of us \nworking together, and I compliment the distinguished Senator from Iowa \nfor working with us. Although he disagreed with the outcome, we worked \ntogether to get that debate finished. We went into the evenings and we \nworked all day for a couple of weeks and we got it done. But now all \n100 of us should stand here and do the same thing. Demands for \ndifferent voting standards for Republican and Democratic amendments are \nwrong.\n  A couple of weeks ago, the distinguished Republican leader spoke at \nan event. I was sitting there. He knew I was following him to speak. He \nsaid, On a matter of this importance, all amendments should be subject \nto a 60-vote threshold. Well, I have had a different view in the past, \nbut I said, OK then, we will do that for both Democratic and Republican \namendments, but let's get it done. Having different standards for \nRepublicans and Democrats is not how the Judiciary Committee considered \nthis legislation. It is also not how the majority of Americans expect \nus to conduct the debate. The tactics of last week undermine the \nSenate's work on this important bill. Those who have already decided to \noppose this bill at the end of the Senate's consideration can vote \nagainst it, but they should not dictate the work of 84 Senators who are \nready to go forward and vote.\n  I call on all Senators to please file their amendments to this \nbipartisan legislation by Thursday and work with us, if need be, on \nFriday and Saturday and through the weekend, so we can make much-needed \nprogress on this legislation without further delay.\n  Mr. President, is there a division of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is equally divided.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield 10 minutes of my time to Senator Thune.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1197\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I think we all agree our immigration system \nis broken and it needs to be fixed. Unfortunately, every time Congress \nhas tried to fix our immigration system, promises of a more secure \nborder are never upheld. The bill we have in front of us today is \nfollowing the same path as past immigration bills.\n  Under this bill it is certain that 12 million people in this country \nwho are here illegally will receive legal status soon after the bill is \nenacted. However, the border security provisions of this bill are again \nnothing more than promises which, again, may never be upheld.\n  When I talk to the people I represent in the State of South Dakota, \none of the questions I get over and over is, When is our Federal \nGovernment going to keep its promises when it comes to the issue of \nborder security?\n  The second question is, Why do we need more laws when we are not \nenforcing the laws we currently have on the books?\n  It is time that we follow through on promises of a more secure \nborder.\n  Actually, you have to go back to 1996, which is the first time \nCongress spoke on this issue. At that time Congress stipulated that we \nneeded to have a double- and even triple-layered fence system on the \nborder.\n  Well, you roll time forward to 2006--10 years later--with the Secure \nFence Act. Congress again passed a law requiring a double-layered \nfence, this time indicating very specific locations, totaling around \n850 miles--even above the current 700-mile requirement. Eighty Senators \nvoted for that bill. Let me repeat that. Eighty Senators, Republicans \nand Democrats, in a bipartisan way voted in 2006, under the Secure \nFence Act, for 850 miles of double-layered fence.\n  Well, you go again forward to 2008. As part of the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, Congress specified this time that not less than 700 \nmiles of fencing would be required. To date, of course, of this \nrequirement, only about 40 miles of the double-layered fencing has been \ncompleted.\n  During debate on the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations \nAct in 2010, an amendment was offered to require the completion of at \nleast 700 miles of reinforced fencing along the southwest border, and \nthis time with a specific timeline, a specific date in mind: December \n31, 2010. That amendment was agreed to on the Senate floor. There were \n54 votes in favor of it, including 21 Democrats, 13 of whom are still \nhere today. But the fence has still not been completed.\n  The amendment I have offered, amendment No. 1197, simply requires \nthat we implement current law, completing 350 miles of double-layered \nfencing prior to RPI status being granted. The completion of this \nsection of the fence would be a tangible, visible demonstration that we \nare serious about this issue of border security. After RPI status is \ngranted, the remaining 350 miles required by current law would have to \nbe constructed during the 10-year period before registered provisional \nimmigrants can apply for green cards. So 350 miles before RPI status; \n350 miles after. I think it is a reasonable way of approaching this \nissue.\n  People have gotten up and said: Well, this fence is old school. It is \nnot the only answer. It requires a combination of technology and \nmanpower and surveillance, but there is an important place for \ninfrastructure to play in this. A double-layered fence, which was \ncalled for by Congress first in 1996, again in 2006, again in 2008--for \nwhich there was broad bipartisan support here in the Senate--should be \nsomething on which we follow through.\n  One of the other issues that has been raised is, well, there is not \nmoney to do this. There is money appropriated in this bill. Mr. \nPresident, $6.5 billion is appropriated, $1.5 billion of which is \ndedicated to infrastructure. If you look at what it would cost to build \na double-layered fence, the estimates are about $3.2 million per mile. \nSo the 350 miles we call for before RPI status is granted\n\n[[Page S4549]]\n\nwould run in the range of $1 billion--sufficient within the money \nalready allocated in the bill.\n  But my point, very simply, is this: We have made promises and \ncommitments to the American people over and over and over again in a \nbipartisan way here in the Senate which have not been followed through \non.\n  Now, the Senator from Alabama, who offered an amendment very similar \nto this at the Judiciary Committee markup, is here on the floor and has \nbeen a leader in terms of trying to secure our borders--an issue that I \nthink most Americans, before we deal with any other aspect or element \nof the immigration debate, believe ought to be addressed.\n  I would simply ask the Senator, if I might through the Chair, does he \nthink building 40 miles out of a 700-mile requirement is keeping the \npromise we made to build a border fence that is adequate to deter \nillegal crossings? Secondly, doesn't infrastructure, such as a double-\nlayered fence, enhance the effectiveness of border control agents and \nsurveillance technologies along the border--recognizing again that it \nis not the only answer; it is combined with, complemented by other \nforms of border security? But it is important, in my view, that we have \na visible, tangible way in which we make it very clear that this is a \ndeterrent to people coming to this country illegally.\n  We want people to come here legally. We are a welcoming nation. We \nare a nation of immigrants, but we are a nation of laws, and we have to \nenforce the laws. We have not been doing that, and we have not been \nkeeping the promises we made to the American people when it comes to \nborder security and more specifically when it comes to the building of \nthe fence.\n  So I would ask my colleague from Alabama, through the Chair, about \nhis views on this and whether we have followed through on a level that \nis anywhere consistent with what we promised to the American people. \nSecondly, doesn't the Senator think this infrastructure component is an \nimportant element when it comes to the border security part of this \ndebate on immigration reform?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota. \nHe is exactly correct. This is a failure of Congress and the \nadministration. As soon as some discretion was given to the \nadministration to not build a fence, they quit building a fence, and we \nare so far behind what we promised the American people.\n  I say to Senator Thune, I remember being engaged in the debate in \nboth of those years, 2006 and 2008. We actually came up with a fund. We \nfunded sufficiently the fence construction that needed to be done. We \ntold the American people we were going to do it. We were proud of \nourselves. Actually, I remember giving a hard time to my colleagues \nbecause in 2006 we authorized the fence but there was no money. So it \nwas later that we finally forced the money to be appropriated because \nthe issue was, you say you are for a fence, you go back home and say: I \nvoted for fencing and barriers, and then you do not put up the money. \nSo the money was even put up, and it still did not happen as required \nby law.\n  I say to Senator Thune, I think you said it so clearly. That is why \nthe American people are rightly concerned about amnesty first with a \npromise of enforcement in the future. Even when we pass laws that \nplainly say a fence shall be built, we put up money to build that \nfence, and it does not happen in the future.\n  So what we are asked to do with this legislation is to grant amnesty \nimmediately. That will happen. That is the one thing in this bill that \nwill happen. But we need to ask ourselves: What are the American people \ntelling us?\n\n  A recent poll showed that by a 4-to-1 margin the American people \nsaid: We want to see the enforcement first. Then we will talk about the \namnesty. Do your enforcement first.\n  The Senator's question is, How will it work? Well, we have discussed \nthat over the years. The greatest example of how it works is in San \nDiego. That area was in complete disarray, with violence, crime, drugs. \nIt was an economic disaster zone. There was a very grim situation in \nSan Diego. There were all kinds of illegality at the border. They built \na triple-layer secure fence, and across that entire area illegality \nended totally, virtually. Almost no illegality is continuing at that \nstretch of the border today. Crime was dramatically reduced. Economic \ngrowth occurred on both sides of the border. It was highly successful.\n  So several things happen. First, you end the illegality with a good \nfence. Second, it reduces dramatically the number of Border Patrol \nofficers needed to make sure illegal crossings are not occurring \nbecause there is a force multiplication of their ability. So you can \nsave a lot of money by having fewer people. When people see a very \nsecure fence, they decide it is not worth the attempt, so they don't \neven try to cross. That reduces the stress on the Border Patrol, the \nnumber of deportations, and the number of people who have to be sent \nback. Building a fence reduces costs and saves money in the long run \nand really achieves what I think the American people have asked us to \nachieve.\n  I say to Senator Thune, I think your amendment is very reasonable. It \ncertainly puts us on a path to completing the kind of barriers that are \nnecessary. As the Senator said, it comes nowhere close to saying there \nis a fence across the entire border. It would just be at the areas \nwhere it would be most effective.\n  Mr. THUNE. I say to my colleague from Alabama--and, again, I thank \nhim for his leadership on this issue, both past and present--what we \nare talking about here is something that is a part of the solution. \nThis is not the totality. This is not the entirety.\n  People come down here and say: Well, you cannot just build a fence. \nPeople will tunnel under it. They will climb over it.\n  Of course they will. But coupled with additional Border Patrol \nagents, coupled with surveillance, coupled with modern technologies, it \nis a composite solution, if you will, but it still very clearly is a \ndeterrent. It is a visible, tangible message and deterrent that we want \npeople to come to this country legally, we want to discourage illegal \nimmigration. I think the fence is part of the infrastructure component \nof that border security solution, and it is something we have all made \ncommitments on in the past.\n  I think it is very hard to ask people to vote for an immigration \nreform bill that includes the legalization component to it if we are \nnot going to follow through on the promises we have made because the \nAmerican people have heard this before. Promises, promises is something \nthey have heard plenty of in the past when it comes to this issue. We \nhave yet to follow through on this with the exception of the 36 miles \nthat I mentioned that have been built. But commitments were made in \n1996, requirements to do this in 2006. As the Senator said, in 2008 the \nmoney was added. That was a 76-to-17 vote here in the Senate. Seventy-\nsix Senators from both parties voted to fund this in 2008. In 2006, 80 \nSenators, including now-President Obama, who at that time was a \nSenator, now-Vice President Biden, who at that time was a Senator, and \nat that time Senator Hillary Clinton all voted for the Secure Fence Act \nin 2006.\n  So, again, I am not suggesting for a minute that it is the only \nsolution, the cure-all, the panacea that is going to address this \nissue, but I think it is something that is very real, very tangible, \nvery visible. It is something we have made a commitment on to the \nAmerican people, and I think it is something on which we ought to \nfollow through. It certainly ought to be a requirement--a condition, if \nyou will--in this legislation before some of these other elements come \nto pass because if it is not, it will never get done, as we have \nalready seen going back to 1996.\n  So I hope that on amendment No. 1197, when it is voted on this \nafternoon, we will have the same strong bipartisan support we have had \nin the past on this issue. I hope, again, as the Senator from Alabama \nand I have discussed, we will follow through on a commitment we made to \nthe American people and do something really meaningful on the issue of \nborder security.\n  With that, I say to my colleague from Alabama that, again, I \nappreciate his strong voice on this issue, and I hope he and I will be \njoined by many others today.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I say to Senator Thune, thank you for your leadership \nin offering a clear legislative proposal that will work. It is my \nobservation\n\n[[Page S4550]]\n\nthat things that get proposed around here that do not work often are \npassed; things that will actually work are difficult to get passed.\n  I say to Senator Thune, I do not know if you realize that all of the \nsponsors of the legislation have talked a good bit about fencing that \nmight occur, having a report on fencing. What we do know is that it did \nnot require fencing anywhere in the bill. But in case anybody had any \ndoubt about that, Senator Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, offered an amendment that explicitly stated that nothing in \nthe bill shall require the construction of any fencing at the border. \nSo despite what others have heard about this being the toughest bill \never and it is going to do more for enforcement than we have ever had, \nit, in fact, weakens and almost guarantees we will not have additional \nfencing, which would certainly be a component, in my mind, of a \nstronger, tougher enforcement mechanism.\n  Fencing barriers do, I believe, help the President, who should lead \non this, who should say clearly to the world: Our border is secure. We \nare building fences and do not come. The number of people who would \nattempt to come would drop a lot if we made that clear statement.\n  I thank the Senator for his good work.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I will say in closing, again, this is not--\nthe border is 2,000 miles long. This requires 700 miles. So it would be \nput in those areas where, as the Senator from Alabama noted, it is most \nneeded.\n  With that, I yield the floor and ask, when the time comes, for \nsupport on amendment No. 1197.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, last week I previewed an amendment I will \nbe offering, hopefully, as early as this afternoon, on the underlying \nimmigration bill. This is an amendment which the Democratic majority \nleader and at least one or two other Members of the Senate have called \na poison pill.\n  I find that somewhat bizarre, especially in light of what others have \nsaid about this amendment, which I will talk about briefly. It strikes \nme as unusual that anytime anyone offers a different idea by way of an \namendment that people do not like they call it a poison pill, as if \nthat was the only option. You either take it without the amendment or \nyou accept the amendment and it kills the legislation.\n  We know the truth is far different. In fact, several members of the \nso-called Gang of 8 who have been very much involved in negotiating the \nunderlying bill have different opinions, which actually I find somewhat \nrefreshing but not all that surprising.\n  Senator Flake, for example, from Arizona, said, ``I don't think it is \na poison pill,'' on June 12. Senator Rubio said of my results \namendment, ``It's an excellent place to start.'' I am grateful for \ntheir comments. Senator Bennet, a Senator from Colorado, on the other \nside of the aisle and Senator Flake argued that ``they are not afraid \nof adding a requirement to nab 90 percent of would-be border \ncrossers.'' That was at the Christian Science Monitor breakfast on June \n12. Senator Bennet went on to say, ``I have every confidence that we \nare going to meet the mark well before the 10 years.'' He said that on \nJune 12 as well.\n  The interesting point about this discussion is the very same \nmeasurement or standard that is in my amendment actually comes from the \nbill that was introduced by the Gang of 8: 100 percent situational \nawareness of the border and a 90-percent apprehension rate. All my \namendment did is to say: OK, you set the standard, but we are going to \nmake sure the Federal Government actually keeps its promises because, \nunfortunately, the history is littered--recent history, in particular--\nwith broken promises by the Federal Government, particularly when it \ncomes to immigration.\n  My amendment is necessary. My results amendment, which I will \ndescribe further, is necessary because in its current form, the \nunderlying bill does not include a genuine border security trigger. You \ndo not have to take my word for it. Last week, the assistant Democratic \nleader, Senator Durbin of Illinois, himself said quite explicitly that \nwhile the original proposal--as he described it in January 2013, he \nsaid: ``A pathway to citizenship needs to be contingent upon securing \nthe border.'' He said that in the context of the bipartisan framework \nfor comprehensive immigration reform.\n  But later on he was quoted in the National Journal, on June 11, \nsaying, ``The Gang of 8 bill has delinked the pathway to citizenship \nand border enforcement.'' The bill that is being sold today delinks the \npathway to citizenship and border enforcement. My amendment would \nreestablish the very same linkage the gang themselves trumpeted in \nJanuary 2013.\n  I think this is a remarkable admission, that the current bill delinks \nthe pathway to citizenship and border security. I think most Members of \nthe Senate believe that whatever we do in terms of the status of people \nwho are currently here in undocumented status, that one thing we have \nto do is to make sure we do not ever deal with this issue again by \nfailing to deal sensibly and responsibly with border security and \nenforcement.\n  Basically, the approach of the proponents of the underlying bill, as \ncurrently written, before my amendment, is: Trust us. Trust us. I have \nto say that you do not have to be a pollster to know there is not an \nawful lot of trust toward Washington and the Congress and the Federal \nGovernment. It is easy to understand why with all of the various \nscandals or things that have been represented one way that turn out to \nbe another way.\n  There is a trust deficit in Washington, DC.\n  For those of us who believe that doing nothing on immigration reform \nis not an option, what I would like to do is to do something to make \nthings better. But in order to get there, we are going to have to \nguarantee that border security and the interior enforcement provisions \nand the reestablishment of basic order to our broken immigration system \nis accomplished in this bill; otherwise, it is not going to happen.\n  In the words of Ronald Reagan, I think we should ask people to trust, \nbut we should also verify that trust is justified. I am not sure some \nof my colleagues appreciate how essential border security is to \nimmigration reform. For the past three decades, the American people \nhave been given one hollow promise after another about the Federal \nGovernment's commitment to secure our borders.\n  The rhetoric from Washington has been impressive, but the results \nhave been pathetic. The reality on the ground in Texas and in other \nborder States has been quite different. Let me put it this way. A \ndecade after the 9/11 terrorist attacks that killed 3,000 Americans in \nNew York, the Department of Homeland Security has gained operational \ncontrol of less than 45 percent of our southern border--45 percent. The \nSecretary of Homeland Security said: ``The border is secure.'' The \nPresident said: ``It is more secure than it has ever been''--45 percent \nsecure. For that matter, it has been more than a decade since the 9/11 \nCommission recommended another important requirement that is contained \nin my amendment, which is a nationwide biometric entry-exit system.\n  It has been 17 years since President Clinton signed legislation \nmandating such a system. So we wonder why there has been such a lack of \nconfidence and a trust deficit between the American people and \nWashington when it comes to immigration reform and fixing our broken \nimmigration system. It is because they have been sold one hollow \npromise after another.\n  We still do not have a biometric entry-exit system that President \nClinton signed into law 17 years ago, even though about half of illegal \nimmigration occurs when people come into the country legally and \noverstay their visa and simply melt into the great American landscape. \nThat is where 40 percent of our illegal immigration comes from. We are \nasking the American people to trust us again?\n  Until Congress acknowledges our credibility problem when it comes to \nenforcing our immigration laws, including border security, and until \nsuch time as we take serious action to fix it, we are never going to \nget true immigration reform, and we will never be able to pat ourselves \non the back and say: You know what. This is not going to happen again.\n\n[[Page S4551]]\n\n  My amendment goes beyond mere promises and platitudes. It demands \nresults. It creates a mechanism for ensuring them. Under my amendment, \nprobationary immigrants are not eligible for legalization until after \nthe United States-Mexico border has been secured and until after we \nhave a nationwide biometric entry-exit system at all airports and \nseaports and after we have a nationwide E-Verify system, which allows \nemployers to verify the eligibility of individuals who apply for jobs \nto work legally in the country.\n  That is what a real border security trigger looks like. That is why \nit is so important. Because we need to incentivize everybody who cares \npassionately about border security and restoring the rule of law to our \nbroken immigration system, on the one hand, and those who, on the other \nhand, more than anything else want an opportunity for people to \neventually become American citizens, even if they have entered the \ncountry illegally, after they have paid a fine and proceeded down a \ntough but fair path to citizenship.\n  What we need to do is incentivize the executive branch, the \nlegislative branch, and the entire bureaucracy to make sure we \nguarantee that those will happen. This is the only way I know of to do \nit. Unfortunately, many of our colleagues do not want a real trigger \nwhen it comes to border security. Above all, they want a pathway to \ncitizenship. I am not convinced beyond that they have much concern for \nwhether we keep our promises with regard to border security. They are \nhoping that once again the American people will put their faith in \nempty promises.\n  But the time for empty promises is over when it comes to our broken \nimmigration system. If we are ever going to push immigration reform \nacross the finish line, which I want to do, we need to guarantee \nresults. My amendment does that. I would contend that rather than my \namendment being the poison pill, the failure to pass a credible \nprovision ensuring border security and interior enforcement will be the \npoison pill that causes immigration reform to die.\n  That is not a result I want. I want us to see a solution. I do not \nwant the status quo because the status quo is broken. It serves no \none's best interests. I am just amazed at some of my colleagues who are \nresisting this amendment. Why will they not take yes for an answer? Why \nwill they not take yes for an answer on something that unites \nRepublicans and Democrats, who are actually desperately interested in \nfinding a solution and believe the status quo is simply unacceptable?\n  As I have repeatedly emphasized, my amendment simply uses the same \nborder security standards as the underlying Gang of 8 bill. They are \nthe ones who came up with the standard 100 percent situational \nawareness. They are the ones who came up with a 90-percent apprehension \nrate.\n  But their bill reiterates a promise but guarantees no results. We \nhave had 27 years of input since the 1986 amnesty, and we still do not \nhave secure borders. Now it is beyond time to guarantee not just more \npromises or inputs but real outputs.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The latest data shows that U.S. authorities apprehended \nabout 90,000 people along the United States-Mexico border between \nOctober of last year and March of this year. Given that we apprehend \nfewer than half of illegal border crossers, this means we still have \nhundreds of thousands of people coming into the country across our \nsouthern border every year.\n  The problem, it will not surprise the Presiding Officer, is \nparticularly serious in my State because we have the largest common \nborder with Mexico, 1,200 miles.\n  As the New York Times reported this last weekend: ``The front line of \nthe battle against illegal crossings has shifted for the first time in \nover a decade away from Arizona to the Rio Grande Valley of South \nTexas.''\n  Indeed, on one day in the Rio Grande Valley Sector, the Border Patrol \ndetained 700 people coming across the border; 400 of them were from \ncountries other than Mexico--400 of them. During the fiscal year which \nbegan last October, the number of apprehensions in South Texas has \nincreased by 55 percent, with more than 94,000 apprehensions just in \nthe Rio Grande Valley.\n  I was in South Texas a few weeks ago meeting with property owners, \nranchers, law enforcement officials, and others deeply concerned about \nthe rising tide of illegal immigration. But not only is this a national \nsecurity issue because people are coming from countries other than \nMexico, including countries that are of special concern because they \nare state sponsors of terrorism, this is also a major humanitarian \nissue.\n  In Brooks County last year, 129 bodies were found, people coming \nacross ranchland after suffering from exposure because they have come \nfrom Central America, they have come from China, and they have come \nfrom the Middle East. They have come from all over the world, and we \nhave seen a sharp increase in the number of people die because they are \ntrying to navigate our broken immigration system.\n  One final point about immigration reform. Whatever legislation we \npass in this Chamber will necessarily have to go to the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  If we want the Senate bill to have any chance of passing in the House \nand becoming law, we need to include real border security measures and \na real border security trigger. Our House colleagues have made that \nabundantly clear. In other words, my amendment is not a poison pill, it \nis the antidote because it is the only way we are ever going to truly \nhave bipartisan immigration reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allocated \n8 minutes and that the remaining Democratic time be under the control \nof the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Murphy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to add my support to S. 744, the \ncomprehensive immigration bill we have been debating over the past \nweek.\n  I first wish to thank the eight Senators who came together to draft \nthis bipartisan bill. They have done an extraordinary job. And I wish \nto particularly thank Senator Leahy for his brilliant leadership as \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Immigration reform is an important priority that for far too long has \nbeen left unaddressed. We all agree that the current system is broken. \nThe bill before us is a realistic approach to fixing this broken \nsystem. That is certainly better than continuing the failed status quo.\n  I have long been an advocate for comprehensive and commonsense \nimmigration reform that is tough but also fair. Standing here, \naddressing my colleagues, urging immigration reform, I cannot help but \nremember the 2006 and 2007 immigration debates and the many calls to \npass immigration reform during that time.\n  Today, 6 years later, we still have not passed needed reform, \nresponded to the overwhelming call to do so from the American people, \nand moved our immigration system into the 21st century. Today we once \nagain have the chance to act and pass comprehensive immigration reform.\n  This bill includes strong border security measures to better protect \nour national security and to ensure that those trying to come to the \nUnited States for better opportunities do so legally. It calls for \npersistent surveillance of the entire border, for the apprehension of \n90 percent of the illegal entries, and makes the investments in \ninfrastructure and technology we need to meet these tough goals.\n  The Secretary of Homeland Security would be required to submit both a \ncomprehensive southern border security strategy and a southern border \nfencing strategy to Congress, plans to achieve these goals, before the \n11 million immigrants waiting in the shadows could even begin the very \ntough but fair earned path to citizenship. This rigorous path includes \ncriminal background and national security checks; paying fines, fees, \nand taxes; learning civics and English; and going to the back of the \nimmigration waiting line.\n  The bill before us also improves worksite enforcement to better \nprotect\n\n[[Page S4552]]\n\nall workers and wages, and it makes changes to our immigration system \nthat will help us retain the bright and talented leaders of today and \ntomorrow and reduce backlogs and inefficiencies.\n  As we continue this debate, I am hopeful the Senate will have the \nopportunity to consider three amendments I have filed.\n  In the 1990s, Liberian refugees fled a brutal civil war that killed \nmore than 150,000 people and displaced more than half of the \npopulation. Since then, these individuals have been granted temporary \nprotected status or deferred enforced departure, granted by the \nadministration because the conditions in their home country of Liberia \nwere too dangerous for them to return. Many of these individuals have \nnow been legally residing--legally residing--in our country for more \nthan 20 years, paying taxes, holding jobs, and being part of our \ncommunities.\n  Amendment No. 1224 would clarify one aspect of the merit-based track \ntwo system, ensuring that it makes eligible these Liberians and others \nwho were granted TPS or DED due to dangerous or inhospitable conditions \nin their home countries and who meet the 10-year minimum requirement \nfor long-term alien workers.\n  This bill intended to include these populations. However, the long-\nterm alien section of the bill uses the term ``lawfully present.'' \nSince this term is not defined by statute and could be subject to \ninterpretation, these Liberians and others in similar situations could \nbe inadvertently excluded from this track. The intention was always to \ninclude these individuals. I ask my colleagues to work with me to \ncorrect this so these deserving individuals, whom four different \nPresidents have supported, are not left behind on a technicality.\n  The second amendment, No. 1223, recognizes the longstanding role that \nlibraries have played in helping new Americans learn English, American \ncivics, and integrate into our local communities. It ensures that they \ncontinue to have a voice in these critical efforts. Across the United \nStates, libraries are the cornerstone of all sorts of educational \nactivities. In fact, according to the Institute of Museum and Library \nServices (IMLS), more than 55 percent of new Americans use a public \nlibrary at least once a week.\n  Libraries offer learning opportunities to new Americans in a trusted \nenvironment. We have to recognize the vital importance of libraries as \nwe ask individuals to come forward to learn English, to learn civics, \nand to learn the skills that are required to participate fully in the \nlife of the American people.\n  This amendment expands on the recent partnership between U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and IMLS, and ensures that \nlibraries remain a keystone and a resource for new Americans. This \namendment would add the IMLS as a member of the Task Force on New \nAmericans to help direct integration policy and clarify the role that \nlibraries will continue to play in facilitating these services.\n  I have also filed an amendment with Senators Schumer and Casey, No. \n1233 that would upgrade the immigration bar on expatriate tax dodgers. \nI authored an amendment to the 1996 immigration law that prohibits \ncitizens who renounced their citizenship in order to avoid taxation \nfrom reentering the United States. I was prompted to act after hearing \nabout a raft of wealthy U.S. citizens who gave up their citizenship to \navoid paying taxes but would obtain reentry to the United States very \neasily and continue, effectually, to live their lives as Americans, \neven though they were for, tax purposes, foreigners.\n  One of the more egregious examples was Kenneth Dart, a billionaire \nwho, in the early 1990s, renounced his American citizenship to avoid \npaying U.S. taxes. He became a citizen of Belize and then was appointed \nby the Government of Belize to be a consular officer in Sarasota, FL, \nMr. Dart's hometown. This ruse and other ruses such as this must be \nstopped. My amendment would make it clear that the Department of \nHomeland Security must stop this flouting of the law by people who \navoid taxes by changing their citizenship and then freely return to the \nUnited States.\n  I look forward to action on these amendments during this debate. This \nis an important debate. Indeed, the strong bipartisan vote that brought \nus to this moment procedurally captures the overwhelming recognition \nthat we need to fix the system. We need to move forward.\n  This is a situation where we have a bipartisan bill that has \noverwhelming support in the United States. We must move it forward, \namend it appropriately as I have suggested, pass it, and then send it \nto the House with the hope and the expectation that the President will \nsign this bill, opening a new era in this country for the millions who \nare seeking to be Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Syria\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, there is so much good flowing through the \nveins of this country. We are, by and large, a compassionate, just \npeople. It hurts us deeply to see pain and suffering in places that \ndon't enjoy the relative safety and security of America.\n  We are, more so than ever before, a powerful people. We are the one \nremaining superpower with a military that dwarfs all others and a \nrecord of throwing our weight around in all corners of the globe.\n  Mixed correctly, this combination of goodness and power can be a \ntransformation. It can lighten the load of oppressed peoples. It can \nlift the disenfranchised. It can cure diseases.\n  There is one fatal trap that comes with these defining \ncharacteristics of 21st century America, a tripwire that has ensnared \nour Nation too many times in recent history. This is the belief that \nthere are no limits to what this combination of goodness and power can \nachieve. In a word, that trap is hubris. I rise because I fear we are \non the verge of falling into this trap once again.\n  In April, the Presiding Officer and I, as well as several other \nMembers of the Senate and the House, visited the Kilis refugee camps of \nTurkey and Syria. These were reportedly the best of the refugee camps \nset up to shelter Syrian families fleeing the blood and carnage of that \ncountry's civil war. It is not a place I would have wanted to stay for \nanother hour.\n  We met a girl who had half her face scarred by a Syrian rocket \nattack. I met a little orphan boy whose parents had been felled by the \nruthless tactics of Bashar al-Asad. We were there for an afternoon, but \nwe didn't need to spend more than 10 minutes in that place to be deeply \nmoved by the case of the refugees.\n  Of course, Syria presents not only a humanitarian imperative, Syria \nis of immense strategic importance to the United States. The Asad \nregime has been a thorn in our side for years, and now his refusal to \nstep down has created a bloody conflict that is in real time \ndestabilizing a region that is critical to our national security \ninterests. Even worse, the fight has drawn in Islamist groups \naffiliated with al-Qaida. A failure to root out their influence and \nreduce their presence threatens to hand them a new base of operation \nwith which to plot attacks against Americans.\n  It is easy to see why American intervention is so tempting. It is \neasy to see why President Obama has chosen to act: a humanitarian \ncrisis, a strategic interest, a uniquely American blend of goodness and \npower tells us we can, that we must try to make things better.\n  Here is the rub. It is not enough for there to be a will. There also \nhas to be a way.\n  Today in Syria I do not believe there is that way. I do not believe \nthis Congress should give the President the ability to escalate \nAmerica's role in the Syrian conflict without a clear set of goals and \na clear sense that we can achieve these goals.\n  Let's start with the odds attached to our first objective, \noverthrowing Bashar al-Asad. The unfortunate reality is that the \nmomentum is with the Asad regime. With the help of Hezbollah and Qasem \nSoleimani, a senior Iranian Quds Force commander, Asad has driven the \nrebels from the key town of Qusayr, and his forces are\n\n[[Page S4553]]\n\nnow battering the rebels' positions in Aleppo.\n  American-supplied automatic weapons are not going to be enough to \nchange this reality. While antitank and anti-aircraft weapons, along \nwith armored vehicles, could give the advantage to the Syrian \nopposition, this would, frankly, invite another more sinister problem. \nThe Syrian opposition is not a monolithic force. It is an interlocking, \nsometimes interdependently operating, sometimes independently \noperating, force.\n  Our favored faction is the Free Syrian Army, but they are currently \nfar from the most effective fighting force of the opposition.\n  Today the most effective fighting unit of the rebels is Jabat al-\nNusra, an Islamist extremist group with demonstrable ties to al-Qaida. \nIf we give heavy weaponry to the FSA, there is virtually no guarantee \nthese weapons will not find their way to Jabat al-Nusra, a group that \nrepresents the very movement we are fighting across the globe.\n  In fact, we have been down this road before. In the eighties, we gave \npowerful weapons to the mujahedin in Afghanistan, freedom fighters that \nwe supported in their war against the Soviets. Of course, as we all \nknow, after kicking out the Soviets, those fighters later formed the \nfoundation of the Taliban, providing a staging ground in Afghanistan \nfor al-Qaida's plans against the United States.\n  Let's take our second objective. Even if we are successful in \ntoppling Asad, it matters to us greatly who takes the reins of Syria \nnext. I can't imagine we are getting into this fight just to turn the \ncountry over to the al-Nusra front or another Iranian- or Russian-\nbacked regime. But if we do care about which regime comes next, and we \nshould, then we need to admit we aren't intervening in Syria for the \nshort run. We are in this for the long haul. Why? Because as we all \nlearned in history class, these upheavals run a pretty predictable \ncourse. There is first the revolution and then there is the civil war.\n  Iran nor Russia will allow a U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army to simply \nstand up a new government. Certainly, Jabat al-Nusra and other \nextremist groups are not going to do the lion's share of the early \nfighting and then just walk away with no role in the new government.\n  Then we have to admit we are in the medium and in the long term \ndeciding to arm one side of what promises to be a very complicated \nmultifront heavily proxied civil war.\n  One may say there is still an interest to negotiate the politics and \nthe military logistics of this second conflict. To that I would ask, \nwhat is the evidence we have ever gotten this tightrope right in the \npast? Recent history tells us America is pretty miserable at pulling \nthe strings of Middle Eastern politics. In Afghanistan, after 10 years \nof heavy military presence, many experts think that when we leave, the \nplace is going to look pretty much like it did before we got there. If \nwe can't effect change with tens of thousands of troops, how are we \ngoing to do it in Syria with just guns and cash?\n  There is a risk that our assistance could actually make things worse. \nWould it not embolden the Iranians, the Russians or the extremists to \nfight harder against the new regime if they know they are backed by \nAmerican money and arms?\n  As we saw in our disastrous occupation of Iraq, American presence \noften attracts extremists, not repels them. Our money and arms become \nbulletin board material for extremist groups around the globe. Why \nwould we want to help al-Qaida's recruitment by putting a big red, \nwhite, and blue target on Damascus for years to come?\n  The bottom line is this: Not everywhere where there is an American \ninterest is there also a reason for American military action. In Syria, \nwith a badly splintered opposition, a potential nightmare follow-on \ncivil war, I believe the odds are slim that U.S. military assistance \nwill make the difference that the President believes it will make. And \nI worry that our presence could harm, not advance, our national \nsecurity interests.\n  There is, thankfully, another way. Given the atrocities occurring \nwithin Syria and the potential for further destabilization in the \nregion, the United States cannot and should not simply walk away from \nSyria. We should dramatically increase our humanitarian aid--both \ninside and outside Syria. We should help improve conditions at the \nrefugee camps in Turkey and Jordan, and help other nations bearing the \nburden of displaced persons, such as Lebanon and Iraq, deal with the \ninflux of people. Put simply, we should concentrate our efforts on \nhumanitarian help inside Syria and on making sure the conflict doesn't \nspill outside of Syria's borders.\n  At the very least, our Nation's role in Syria deserves a full debate \nin Congress before America commits itself to a course of action with \nsuch potentially huge consequences for our national interests. \nAccording to published press reports, the administration has indicated \nit does not intend to seek congressional approval before shipping arms \nto the Free Syrian Army--at a time, I would note with some irony, when \nthe United States still officially recognizes the Asad government.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee has done its work here, and I commend \nChairman Menendez. We have had hearings, we have held a debate and a \nvote on a resolution, but now that the President has announced these \nnew steps, it is incumbent upon the full Senate to ask questions of the \nadministration's short-term and long-term goals, and to debate the \nconsequences of American intervention fully. This is serious business, \nand the American public deserves a full debate.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Presiding Officer for these few extra \nminutes. I intend to speak until 12:45.\n  There is a lot to say about the immigration bill, and obviously there \nare amendments that are pending.\n  One, the Thune amendment would delay the process of bringing people \nout of the shadows until 350 miles of double-layer fencing is complete. \nThis could have the impact of delaying the process for years. I note \nwith some interest that the Senator from Texas, Senator Cornyn, \nbelieves there is no more fencing required in the State of Texas.\n  Fencing is important. Surveillance is more important. This bill alone \nas presently written includes $1.5 billion of fencing for the southern \nborder as a trigger to begin adjustment of status for those in RPI \nstatus, but it doesn't arbitrarily dictate the number of miles of \ndouble-layer fencing that should be built. I think we should leave that \nto the best judgment of the Border Patrol.\n  I would point out that back in 2007, the Senators from Texas added an \namendment to an appropriations bill that said: If the Secretary \ndetermines the use or placement of resources is not the most \nappropriate means to achieve and maintain operational control over the \ninternational border. We currently have 352 miles of pedestrian \nfencing, 298 miles of vehicle fencing along the southern border, which \nis where the Border Patrol said it is most effective.\n  The Vitter amendment has the same limitations. We agree, and in the \nbill an exit-entry system is created. The bill mandates that before \nanyone receives a green card, an entry-exit system must be in place in \nall air and sea capabilities.\n  I want to remind my colleagues who keep referring back to 1986--and I \nwas around at that time--there was no real provision for border \nsecurity there. There are provisions here. And I want to emphasize that \nwe know exactly from the Border Patrol the technology that is needed in \neach sector in order to get 90-percent effective control of the border \nand 100-percent situational awareness, and these are detailed in \nimportant technology--which is the real answer to border security.\n  I am absolutely confident that with the implementation of this \ntechnology-based border security system, we can\n\n[[Page S4554]]\n\nabsolutely guarantee the American people--but, more importantly, the \nhead of the Border Patrol--I will have a statement from him early this \nafternoon, and he will say that if we implement the technology--which \nthey gave us the detailed list of--he is confident we can have 90-\npercent effective control of our border and 100-percent situational \nawareness.\n  I hope my colleagues who are concerned about border security--and \nlegitimately they are--will pay attention to the statement of the head \nof the Border Patrol who says unequivocally that if we adapt these \nspecific enforcement capabilities and technology, we will be able to \nhave control of our border. That is an important item in this debate \nand it is incredible detail.\n  Also in this legislation we need to give them the flexibility where \nthere is the improved technology, et cetera. We do need more people to \nfacilitate movement across our ports of entry, but we have 21,000 \nBorder Patrol. Today, on the Arizona-Mexico border there are people \nsitting in vehicles in 120-degree heat. In 1986, we had 4,000 Border \nPatrol. We now have 21,000. What we need is the technology that has \nbeen developed in the intervening years.\n  I would be more than happy to say to my colleagues that if we have a \nprovision that this strategy must be implemented and is providing 90-\npercent effective border control, that would serve as a trigger.\n  I hope my colleagues will reject the pending Vitter and Thune \namendments and we will move on with the legislative process.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/18/senate-section/article/S4554-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 3 \np.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees for debate on the pending amendments.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I come to the floor today to ask my \ncolleagues to join us in supporting the historic comprehensive \nimmigration bill that is before us today.\n  We worked hard on the Judiciary Committee to craft a strong \nbipartisan bill that bolsters our economy, secures our borders and \npromotes opportunity for both businesses and families.\n  I thank all of those involved in the original bill--Senators Schumer, \nMcCain, Durbin, Graham, Menendez, Rubio, Bennet and Flake. I thank the \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee who all had a hand in changes to the \nbill. And I specifically want to thank Senator Hatch who worked with me \non the I-Squared--Immigration Innovation--bill. The bill on the floor \ntoday contains many of the provisions from I-Squared that encourage \nmore American innovation.\n  As you know, we passed this comprehensive immigration bill out of \ncommittee on a bipartisan vote of 13 to 5 and I am hopeful we can build \nthat same kind of broad-based support on the Senate floor.\n  This is not going to be simple. It is not going to be easy. But the \nmost important thing--the reason I am optimistic we can get something \ndone--is the fact that we are all coming at this from the same basic \nstarting point:\n  Democrats and Republicans, Senators from border States and Senators \nfrom inland States, we can all agree on this: Our current immigration \nsystem is broken. And changes must be made.\n  The question now is how those changes should come about, and that is \nwhy we are having this debate--to find that common ground and pass a \nbill that is ultimately stronger because it reflects the needs and \npriorities of both parties and all regions of the country.\n  Passing comprehensive immigration reform will be a vital step forward \nfor our country. It will be vital to our immigrant communities, who \nhave been separated their families for too long. It will be vital to \nour security. And its will be vital to our economy, to strengthening \nour workforce, addressing our long-term fiscal challenges and promoting \ninnovation.\n  There are many strong and compelling arguments for immigration \nreform, but let me begin with the economic impact on our businesses and \nmajor industries.\n  Minnesota is a big agriculture State, just like the State of \nWisconsin, Madam President, and I can't tell you how many farmers and \nagricultural businesses I have heard from who tell me they rely on \nmigrant workers and other immigrants to keep their operations going. I \nhave heard it from high-tech startups, too, as well as big technology \ncompanies like 3M, St. Jude and Medtronic. I have heard it from the \nhomebuilders and the construction companies, even hospitals and health \ncare providers.\n  These businesses represent a vast range of industries and interests. \nBut when it comes to immigration reform, they all agree: It is critical \nto their operations, and it is a vital engine for growth and \ninnovation.\n  In fact, history shows that immigrants have helped America lead the \nworld in innovation and entrepreneurship for generations:\n  More than 30 percent of U.S. Nobel Laureates were born in other \ncountries. Ninety of the Fortune 500 companies were started by \nimmigrants, and 200 were started by immigrants or their children, \nincluding 3M, Medtronic, and Hormel in Minnesota.\n  Workers, inventors, scientists and researchers from around the world \nhave built America. And in an increasingly global economy, they are a \nbig part of keeping our country competitive today.\n  If we want to continue to be a country that thinks, invents and \nexports to the world, then we can not afford to shut out the world's \ntalent. It doesn't make sense to educate tomorrow's inventors and then \nsend them back home, so they can start the next Google in India or \nFrance.\n  That's why I introduced the I-Squared Act with Senator Hatch to make \nmuch needed reforms to allow our companies to bring in the engineers \nand scientists they need to compete on the world stage.\n  One of the things that bill would do is increase fees on employment-\nbased green cards, so that we can also reinvest in or own homegrown \ninnovation pipeline by funding more science, technology, engineering \nand math initiatives in our schools.\n  In my State the unemployment rate is at 5.4 percent. We actually have \njob openings for engineers, we have job openings for welders, and we \nwant those jobs to be filled from kids who go to the University of \nMinnesota. We want those jobs filled by kids who get a degree at a tech \nschool in Minnesota. But right now we have openings and we have to do a \ncombination of things. We have to be educating our own kids and making \nsure if there is a doctor coming from another country who is willing to \nstudy at the University of Minnesota or in Rochester, MN, and then \nwants to do his or her residency right in America in an underserved \narea in a place such as inner-city Minneapolis or a place such as Deep \nRiver Falls, MN, we let them do that residency or internship there \ninstead of sending them packing to their own country.\n  Much of the legislation that was in the I-Squared bill, as I \nmentioned, is included right here in the bill we are considering. The \nhealth care leaders' provision I mentioned originally, called the \nConrad 30 bill, something I worked on with Senator Heitkamp and Senator \nMoran and others--that is also in this bill.\n  Here's something else that's just good sense: Bringing the roughly 11 \nmillion undocumented workers out of the shadows.\n  Immigrants who are ``off the grid'' can not demand fair pay or \nbenefits, and there are those who seek to take advantage of that. It's \na bad thing for the American workers whose wages are  undercut. And \nit's a bad thing for the American families whose undocumented relatives \nare being exploited.\n\n  In addition to the economic implications, having millions of \nundocumented people living in our country poses a serious threat to \nboth our national security and public safety.\n  This bill takes the only rational and feasible approach to bringing \nthese\n\n[[Page S4555]]\n\npeople out of the shadows, by creating a fair, tough and accountable \npath to citizenship for those who have entered the country illegally or \noverstayed their visas.\n  It's not an easy path. You have to pay fines, stay employed, pass a \nbackground check, go to the back of the line, learn English and wait at \nleast 13 years to become a citizen.\n  And if you have committed a felony or three misdemeanors, you're not \neligible. You have to go back to your home country.\n  Keep in mind, none of these steps towards citizenship would even \nbegin until we had done what is necessary to secure our borders.\n  This bill immediately appropriates $4.5 billion towards adding more \nborder patrol agents, more fencing, and more technologies like aerial \nsurveillance to prevent illegal crossings over the southern border. \nThat is money that is being committed today, not a promise for future \nspending or something dependent on future Congresses. That money will \nbe spent to make our border more secure.\n  I think it is important to recognize that these new efforts would \ncome on top of all the progress we have already made in recent years. \nSome estimates show that net illegal migration over the Mexican border \nis actually negative--meaning more people are going back or being sent \nback to Mexico than are coming here illegally. We have seen a sea \nchange over the last few years and much of it, of course, is because of \nenforcement efforts going on, many funded by this Congress.\n  But preventing illegal immigration isn't just about stopping people \nat the border. It's also about removing the incentive for people to \ncome here illegally in the first place.\n  The way we do that is by requiring employers to start using the E-\nVerify system, so they can check whether or not a person is authorized \nto work in this country. And to ensure the smoothest possible \ntransition, we do it over a 5-year phase-in period based on the size \nand type of the company. So smaller companies, farmers--those who find \nit harder to use the system, they will go later.\n  I believe our compromise on the workplace enforcement issue is a good \none, and it's reflective of the bi-partisan, balanced approach that \nthis bill takes overall, on so many other complex issues.\n  The economic and security arguments for reform are compelling. But we \nknow there is so much more to this.\n  This is about maintaining America's role as a beacon for hope and \njustice in the world, particularly for those seeking refuge and asylum.\n  This is something we know a lot about in Minnesota, where we have \nalways opened our arms to people fleeing violence in their home \ncountries. Minnesota is home to the largest Somali population in North \nAmerica and the second largest Hmong population in the United States. \nWe actually have the first Hmong woman legislator, Mee Moua. We are \nbetter off because of the incredible diversity and entrepreneurial \nspirit these people have brought to our state.\n  We are proud of the work these people have done. We know and we \nbelieve we are better off because of the incredible diversity and \nentrepreneurial spirit these people have brought to our State from \nother countries.\n  Just as we have granted asylum to people fleeing violence in other \ncountries, we must also look after those fleeing violence here at home. \nThat is why I feel so strongly about the need to ensure immigrant \nvictims of domestic violence are not forced to suffer in silence.\n  The bill we are considering includes two amendments I introduced in \nthe Judiciary Committee that would protect immigrants who are victims \nof domestic violence and elder abuse. No person who is being abused \nshould be forced to live in fear because they are worried they will \nlose their immigration status if they speak up. Children should not be \nforced to live in fear either. So we need to change our laws to ensure \nthat families are not being torn apart by a system that is not only \ninefficient and expensive, but cruel: 64,500 immigrant parents were \nseparated from their citizen children during the first 6 months of 2010 \nas a result of deportation. So this bill is about protecting families. \nIt is also about building families.\n  If I can say one thing about the domestic abuse issue, I cannot tell \nyou how many cases we had when I was prosecutor where in fact the case \nwould come into the office and the victim would be an immigrant. The \nperpetrator, we would have found, was threatening to get her deported \nor get her mother deported, if she was illegal, or get her sister \ndeported or a family member deported if she reported it to the police. \nThis bill fixes a lot of that by the way it handles the U visa program \nas well as other amendments I included, and it makes it easier to \nprosecute these perpetrators.\n  As I mentioned, this bill is also about building families. Minnesota \nleads the country in international adoptions, and I've seen the \nincredible joy an adopted child from another country can bring to a new \nmom or dad. That's why I have introduced with Senators Coats and \nLandrieu a set of amendments to improve our system for international \nadoptions, so that more children can find a loving home here in the \nUnited States.\n\n  This bill is vital to our economy and to our national security, but \nmost importantly it is vital to maintaining America's remarkable \nheritage as a nation of immigrants.\n  I am myself here because of Slovenian and Swiss immigrants. My \ngrandpa on my dad's side worked 1,500 feet underground in the iron-ore \nmines of Ely, MN. His family came to northern Minnesota in search of \nwork, and the iron ore mines and forests of northern Minnesota seemed \nthe closest thing to home in Slovenia. My grandpa never graduated from \nhigh school, but he saved money in a coffee can so my dad could go to \ncollege.\n  My dad earned a journalism degree from the University of Minnesota \nand was a newspaper reporter and long-time columnist for the Star \nTribune. My mom was a teacher and she taught second grade until she was \n70 years old. Her parents came from Switzerland to Milwaukee where my \ngreat grandma ran a cheese shop. The Depression was hard on their \nfamily and out of work for several years, my grandpa made and sold \nminiature Swiss chalets made out of little pieces of wood.\n  So I stand here today on the shoulders of immigrants, the \ngranddaughter and great-granddaughter of iron ore miners and cheese-\nmakers and craftsmen, the daughter of a teacher and newspaper man . . . \nand the first woman elected to the Senate from the State of Minnesota.\n  It could not have been possible in a country that didn't believe in \nhard work, fair play and the promise of opportunity. It could not have \nbeen possible in a country that didn't open its arms to the risk-\ntakers, pilgrims and pioneers of the world.\n  So this is a very special and enduring part of the American story. \nAnd we need to be sure it continues for future generations in a way \nthat is fair, efficient and legal.\n  Passing this bill is important to our economy. It is important to our \nglobal competitiveness. It is important to our national security. And \nit is important millions of families throughout the U.S. who want to \ncome here and live that dream my grandparents and great grandparents \nlived.\n  It's too important for us not to act. To my colleagues, join us in \npassing this bill. Let's get it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I believe we must fix the immigration \nbill to make it fairer for women. The bill proposes a new merit-based \npoint system for allocating green cards to future immigrants. Simply \nput, the point system makes it harder for women than for men to come to \nthis country. The theory behind the merit system is that we should give \nimmigration preferences to people who hold advanced degrees or work in \nhigh-skilled jobs. This idea ignores the discrimination women endure in \nother countries.\n  Too many women overseas do not have the same educational or career\n\n[[Page S4556]]\n\nadvancement opportunities available to men in those countries. In \npractice, the bill's new point system takes that inequitable treatment \nabroad and cements it into our immigration laws. This bill reduces the \nopportunities for immigrants to come under the family-based green card \nsystem.\n  Currently, approximately 70 percent of immigrant women come to this \ncountry through the family-based system. This legislation increases the \namount of employment-based visas. This bill basically moves us away \nfrom the family-based system and into economic considerations. There is \nnothing wrong with that, but we should be fair to women while we are \ndoing it. The immigration avenues favor men over women by nearly a 4-\nto-1 margin.\n  Using the past as our guide, it is easy to see how the new merit-\nbased system, with heavy emphasis on factors such as education and \nexperience, will disadvantage women who apply for green card status. We \nall want a stronger economy, but we should not sacrifice the hard-won \nvictories of the women's equality movement to get it. Ensuring that \nwomen have an equal opportunity to come here is not an abstract policy \ncause to me.\n  When I was a young girl, my mother brought my brothers and me to this \ncountry in order to escape an abusive marriage. My life would be \ncompletely different if my mother was not able to take on that \ncourageous journey. I want women similar to her--women who don't have \nthe opportunities to succeed in their own countries--to be able to \nbuild a better life for themselves here. These disparities in the \nimmigration bill are fixable.\n  Later this week a number of my female Senate colleagues and I will \nintroduce a proposal that will address the disparities in the new \nmerit-based system. Let's improve immigration reform to make this bill \nbetter for women who deserve a fair shake in our green card system.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, coming up, we will be voting on some \namendments. I just want to share a few thoughts as we gather in advance \nof that. One of the comments made earlier by one of our good Senators \nindicated a belief that this immigration bill is going to raise the \nsalaries of American workers. I think that is what was said. I have to \npoint out that is not accurate.\n  This is a very serious issue we are confronting. This legislation \ndoes the opposite of what was said and creates an unprecedented flow of \nnew workers into America--the likes of which we have not seen before--\nand it will have a direct result of depressing job opportunities and \nwages of American citizens. It will affect immigrants who are legally \nhere and also looking for work. It will impact the wages of African \nAmericans, Hispanics, and any other group in America.\n  Here is the reason why: Under our current law, the legal flow of \npersons to America would be 1 million a year, and that is the largest \nof any country in the world. Over 10 years, that will rise to 10 \nmillion people. At this point, we now have 11 million immigrants here, \nplus a backlog of approximately 5 million more immigrants, which will \ntotal approximately 15 million people who would be legalized in very \nshort order under this legislation.\n  Some say, well, they are already working here, so there is not a \nproblem on employment. But many of those workers are in the shadows, \nunderemployed, maybe working part-time in restaurants or other places, \nand all of a sudden they will be given legal status. At that point, \nthey will be able to apply for any job in America. This will be good \nfor them, but the question is, Is it our duty to give our first \nresponsibility to those who have entered illegally? Don't we have a \nresponsibility to consider how it will impact people who are unemployed \ntoday and are out looking for work?\n  Since 1999, we know wages have dropped as much as 8 percent to 9 \npercent. Wages are declining, not going up in America today. One of the \nbig reasons, according to Professor Borjas at Harvard, is that the flow \nof labor from abroad creates an excess of labor and that causes wages \nto decline. It is just a fact, and that is the way that works.\n  In addition to that, we have our current law that allows temporary \nworkers and guest workers who come for a period of time, and then they \ncan work. What happens to that flow of workers today? They will double \nthe number of people who will be coming in as temporary workers. \nEveryone has to understand that many of them come for 3 years with \ntheir family after which they can reup for another 3 years. They also \ncompete for a limited number of jobs that legal immigrants would be \ncompeting for as well as citizens would be competing for.\n  So there is this bubble of 15 million that is accepted at once and a \ndoubling of the current flow of nonimmigrants. In addition to that, the \nannual immigrant flow into our country will increase at least 50 \npercent. It could be more than that. So that would go from 1 million a \nyear to 1.5 million a year. Over 10 years, that is 15 million.\n  There are 300 million people in this country, and as elected \nofficials, they are our primary responsibility. If this legislation \nwere to pass--the 8,000 pages in this bill--it would allow 30 million \npeople to be placed on a permanent path to citizenship over this 10-\nyear period, and that is well above what would normally be 10 million \npeople. In addition to that, the flow of so-called temporary guest \nworkers will be double what the current rate is.\n  Madam President, how much time is there on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 17 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask to be notified in 5 minutes.\n  I believe Senator Vitter's airplane has been delayed. His amendment \nis projected to come up. I don't know if it will be called up if he is \nnot able to get back.\n  He has an excellent amendment that deals with a fundamentally flawed \npart of our immigration system that the bill before us makes worse, not \nbetter. It absolutely and indisputably does make it better.\n  This is the current situation: Six times Congress in the last 10 or \n15 years has passed legislation to require an entry-exit visa system. \nIt is required that it be biometric. In other words, it would require \nfingerprints or something like that. Normally, fingerprints would be \nutilized.\n  People are fingerprinted when they come into the country. It goes \ninto the system, but we are not checking when anybody leaves. People \nlegally come on a visa, and they leave. Because we don't use a system \nwhen people leave the country, nobody knows whether they left. Forty \npercent of the people who enter the country illegally are coming \nthrough visa overstays. They get a legal visa, and they just don't \nleave. People don't even know if they left because they are not clocked \nout.\n  The 9/11 Commission said this is wrong. We need a biometric entry and \nexit system at land, sea, and airports.\n  What does this bill do? It eliminates that language that is already \nin law, passed by Congress, and inexplicably has never been carried \nout. The bill merely requires a biographic or electronic exit system. \nIt does not require a fingerprint-type exit system. Not only that, it \nonly requires it at air and seaports, not the land ports. The 9/11 \nCommission said that would not work because people come in all the time \nby air and leave by land, so we cannot rely on it. It will not \nestablish the right integrity to know whether somebody overstayed. That \nmakes perfect sense.\n  Senator Vitter attempts to address that. He suggests that we have an \nintegrated biometric entry-exit system operating and functioning at \nevery land, air, and seaport--not just air and sea--prior to the \nprocessing of any application for legal status pursuant to the original \nbiometric exit law, the 2004 Intelligence Reform Act, recommendations. \nThat is what the current law says.\n  In addition to that, before the implementation of any program \ngranting temporary legal status, the Department of Homeland Security \nSecretary must submit written certification of the deployment of the \nsystem which will then be fast-tracked and approved\n\n[[Page S4557]]\n\nthrough streamlined House and Senate procedures. This amendment is \nadded to the current bill, and it will be effective in accomplishing \nwhat we need. In other words, it has a little trigger that says they \ndon't get their legal status until the government does what they have \nbeen directed to do by Congress for over 10 years and have failed to \ndo.\n  We have had a pilot test at the Atlanta airport, for example, where \npeople go to the airport, catch a plane back home to England, Jordan, \nIndia or wherever they go, put their fingerprints on a machine, and it \nreads them as they go through the airport. What they found was that out \nof 29,744 people in that pilot test, 175 were on the watch list for \nterrorism or warrants were out for their arrest or other serious \ncharges were against them. They were able to identify them before they \nfled or left the country, and that is what the whole system was about.\n  They found it didn't slow down the airport and that it didn't cost \nnearly what people are saying it will cost. Some have said it would be \n$25 billion, and that is totally inaccurate. According to this report, \nit will not cost anything like that. Police officers have fingerprint \nreading machines in their automobiles. You can go by there, put your \nfingers on there to read your print, and if you have a warrant out for \narrest for murder or drug dealing or terrorism, you get apprehended.\n  They recently caught a terrorist--actually from Alabama--and \nprosecuted him in Alabama. He was trying to get on a plane in Atlanta.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair, reserve the remainder of my time, \nand yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, let me congratulate the Gang of 8 for \ntheir assiduous work on this immigration bill, as well as Senator Pat \nLeahy, the chairman of the committee, for doing a lot of good work.\n  There is much in this bill I support. I support the pathway to \ncitizenship. I support the DREAM Act. I support providing legal status \nto the foreign workers who are working in agriculture. We have to have \nstrong border security. I support that effort.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what I do not support. What I do not \nsupport is that at a time when nearly 14 percent of Americans do not \nhave a full-time job, at a time when youth unemployment is somewhere \naround 16 percent and kids from California to Maine are desperately \nseeking employment, I do not support the huge expansion in the guest \nworker program that will allow hundreds of thousands of entry-level \nguest workers to come into this country.\n  This is important for at least two reasons. We have kids all over \nAmerica who are wondering how they are going to afford to be able to go \nto college. Many of these young people are going out looking for summer \njobs, looking for part-time jobs in order to help them pay for college. \nThat is terribly important. We should not pass legislation which makes \nit harder for young people to get jobs in order to put away a few bucks \nto help pay for college.\n  Then there is another group of people, and those are young people \nwhom we don't talk about enough. Not everybody in America is going to \ncollege. There are millions of young people who graduate high school \nand want to go out and start their careers and make some money and move \nup the ladder. There are others who have dropped out of high school. We \ncannot turn our backs on those young people. They need jobs as well. If \nyoung people--young high school graduates, for example--are unable to \nfind entry-level jobs, how will they ever be able to develop the \nskills, the experience, and the confidence they need to break into the \njob market? And if they don't get those skills--if they don't get those \njobs and that income--there is a very strong possibility they may end \nup in antisocial or self-destructive activities.\n  Right now, on street corners all over this country, there are kids \nwho have nothing to do. And what are they doing when they stand on \nstreet corners? What they are doing is getting into drugs, they are \ngetting into crime, they are getting into self-destructive activity. We \nalready have too many young people in this country using drugs. We \nalready have too many young people involved in criminal activity. As a \nnation, we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth, \nincluding China. Let's put our young people into jobs, not into jails.\n  As I have heard on this floor time and time again, the best \nantipoverty program is a paycheck. Well, let's give the young people of \nthis country a paycheck. Let's put them to work. Let's give them at \nleast the entry-level jobs they need in order to earn some income \ntoday, but even more importantly, let's allow them to gain the job \nskills they need so they know what an honest day's work is about and \ncan move up the economic ladder and get better jobs in the future.\n  At a time when poverty in this country remains at an almost 50-year \nhigh, and when unemployment among young people is extremely high, I \nworry deeply that we are creating a permanent underclass--a large \nnumber of people who are poorly educated and who have limited or no job \nskills. This is an issue we must address and must address now. Either \nwe make a serious effort to find jobs for our young people now or we \nare going to pay later in terms of increased crime and the cost of \nincarceration.\n  Now, why is this issue of youth unemployment relevant to the debate \nwe are having on immigration reform? The answer is obvious to anyone \nwho has read the bill. This immigration reform legislation increases \nyouth unemployment by bringing into this country, through the J-1 \nprogram and the H-2B program, hundreds of thousands of low-skilled, \nentry-level workers who are taking the jobs young Americans need. At a \ntime when youth unemployment in this country is over 16 percent and the \nteen unemployment rate is over 25 percent, many of the jobs that used \nto be done by young Americans are now being performed by foreign \ncollege students through the J-1 summer work travel program.\n  Other entry-level foreign workers come into this country through the \nH-2B guest worker program. We have heard a lot of discussion about \nhigh-tech workers and how they can create jobs and all that. That is an \nissue for another discussion. Right now, what we are talking about is \nhundreds of thousands of foreign workers coming into this country not \nto do great scientific work, not as great entrepreneurs to start \nbusinesses, not as Ph.D. engineers, but as waiters and waitresses, \nkitchen help, lifeguards, front desk workers at hotels and resorts, ski \ninstructors, cooks, chefs, chambermaids, landscapers, parking lot \nattendants, cashiers, security guards, and many other entry-level jobs.\n  Does it really make sense to anyone when so many of our kids are \ndesperately looking for a way to earn an honest living that we say to \nthose kids: Sorry, you have to get to the back of the line because we \nare bringing in hundreds of thousands of foreign workers to do the jobs \nyou can do tomorrow?\n  The J-1 program for foreign college students is supposed to be used \nas a cultural exchange program--a program to bring young people into \nthis country to learn about our customs and to support international \ncooperation and understanding. That is why it is administered by the \nState Department. But instead of doing that, this J-1 program has \nmorphed into a low-wage jobs program to allow corporations such as \nMcDonald's, Dunkin Donuts, Disney World, Hershey's, and many other \nmajor resorts around the country to replace American workers with cheap \nlabor from overseas.\n  Each and every year companies from all over this country are hiring \nmore than 100,000 foreign college students in low-wage jobs through the \nJ-1 summer work travel program. Unlike other guest worker programs, the \nJ-1 program does not even require businesses to recruit or advertise \nfor American workers. What they can do is pay minimum wage. They don't \nhave to advertise for American workers. And guess what. For the foreign \nworker, they do not have to pay Social Security tax, they don't have to \npay Medicare tax, and they don't have to pay unemployment tax. So, \nessentially, we are creating a situation where it is absolutely \nadvantageous for an employer to hire a foreign worker rather than an \nAmerican worker.\n\n  So what I have done is introduced two pieces of legislation to \naddress this\n\n[[Page S4558]]\n\nissue. No. 1 basically says while I strongly support cultural \nprograms--bringing young people here from abroad is a great idea--at \nthis moment, with high unemployment, we cannot have those people \ncompeting with young Americans for a scarce number of jobs. So we \neliminate the employment element of the J-1 program.\n  The second bill says if we can't do that--and I hope we can--at the \nvery least we need a jobs program for American kids, not just a summer \njobs program but a yearlong jobs program. Let's not turn our backs on \nkids who want to get into the labor market, who want to develop a \ncareer. They need something in the summertime, they need something year \nround, and we have introduced legislation to do just that.\n  My time has expired. I yield my time, if he wants it, to Senator \nGrassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1197\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, we will soon be voting on the Thune \namendment, and I rise to speak in support of the Thune amendment.\n  The Thune amendment would strengthen the bill and beef up the \ntriggers that precede the legalization program.\n  The Thune amendment would ensure that current law regarding double-\nlayer fencing is implemented.\n  Over the years, administration after administration--and not just \nDemocrat or just Republican but both--has failed to enforce the laws on \nthe books. The American people don't want more laws that will simply be \nignored, they want the laws on the books to be enforced. This amendment \noffered by Senator Thune would ensure that the border is more secure \nbefore any legalization program is carried out.\n  In a new CNN poll released just today, 36 percent of those polled \nsaid they favored a path to citizenship for people who have come to \nthis country undocumented. But 62 percent of those polled said it is \nmore important to increase border security to reduce or eliminate the \nnumber of immigrants coming into the country without permission from \nour government. So if we stand with the American people, and if we want \nthe border secured, we will vote for the Thune amendment.\n  It is this simple: When issues come up in my town meetings in my \nState of Iowa and people are asking what is going on with immigration, \nand we sit down and try to explain to the people how this bill is \nmoving along or what it might include, invariably there are a lot of \npeople in the audience who say we don't need more legislation, we need \nto have the laws on the books enforced. I think this is backed up by \nthis poll we have heard about from CNN today.\n  In addition to that, I think it very much clarifies that people want \nthe laws on the books enforced. But, more importantly, they expect \npeople who take an oath to uphold the Constitution and the laws would \nactually carry out the laws they are elected to carry out. So I hope my \ncolleagues will vote for the Thune amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 1197, offered by the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I offer this amendment. It is a \ntechnical amendment, three technical but important changes to the Child \nCitizenship Act of 2000. Senator Coats, Senator Blunt, and Senator \nKlobuchar have helped lead this effort. I have explained it numerous \ntimes on the floor. I think the leaders have agreed on a voice vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have spoken with the distinguished \nranking member, Mr. Grassley. I understand we are able to agree to the \nLandrieu amendment by voice vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the 60-vote threshold with respect to \nthe Landrieu amendment be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I urge the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1222) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1228\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Before we do that, I wish to remind everybody the next \nvote will be a 10-minute vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple but it is \nimportant. It would finally demand and require execution and \nenforcement of the so-called US-VISIT system, an entry-exit system to \ncatch visa overstays. This system was first mandated by Congress in \n1996. We have had six additional votes by Congress demanding it then. \nThe 9/11 terrorists were visa overstays. As a result, this system was \nstrongly recommended, one of the top recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission. We must put this in place as we act on immigration. This \namendment would get that done.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree that we need to better track visa overstays. But a \nfully biometric entry-exit system at all air, sea, and land ports of \nentry is the kind of unrealistic trigger we can't adopt. Implementation \nof this amendment would be prohibitively expensive and cause all kinds \nof delays.\n  In the Judiciary Committee we adopted an amendment offered by Senator \nHatch which presents a more reasonable approach.\n\n[[Page S4559]]\n\n  I would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, we have talked about this since 1996 and \n9/11 happened. When are we going to do it if not now?\n  I urge support of the amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, this amendment will include the tribal \nrepresentatives on the DHS Border Task Force.\n  In this country within 100 miles of the border we have 13 Indian \nreservations, some of them right on the border. If we are going to make \nsure the borders are secure in the north and the south, Indians need to \nbe a part of the conversation, our Native American friends. They have a \nunique government-to-government status. As I said before, their input \nis critically important.\n  This amendment would not be costing anything, has bipartisan support, \nand it will add tribal representatives--two on the north and two on the \nsouthern region--to the Department of Homeland Security Border Task \nForce. I encourage a ``yea'' vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have no problems with this amendment. \nIt ensures that tribal communities are represented.\n  The bill's task force is a new and independent entity designed to \nprovide recommendations about immigration and border security. Mr. \nTester is adding four additional members to the task force to ensure \nthat the tribes are represented; however, this amendment does not \nfundamentally change the bill.\n  There is no opposition to making sure that the tribes have a voice in \npolicy. Of course, this task force doesn't have any real power, it only \nmakes recommendations. The Secretary isn't required to address their \nconcerns or enact their recommendations. Too often, the Secretary does \nnot take into consideration our recommendations. Even now she has a \nhard time implementing laws.\n  So, again, while the amendment is noncontroversial, Members should \nknow this task force is a figleaf for actual border security.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to reconsider the vote and lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I am here to speak to what is a historic \ndebate here on the floor of the Senate; that is, the debate we are \nhaving with regard to comprehensive immigration reform. We have a major \nopportunity here in the Congress to finally pass meaningful, strong, \nbipartisan legislation. Immigration reform is something Congress has \ngrappled with in fits and starts for over a decade. In fact, I remember \nthe summer 7 or 8 years ago when this Senate came very close to passing \ncomprehensive immigration reform and fell just short of that goal.\n  Today the need to act has become imperative. We cannot ignore it. \nThere are constituents in Colorado from across the spectrum who are \nhard-working. They are small business owners, religious leaders, \nfarmers, and citizens. They believe that now is the time.\n  If we look at our economy, it is beginning to gain strength. Our \neconomy is beginning to get its legs under it.\n\n[[Page S4560]]\n\nOur economy also needs the labor market certainty that would come from \nimmigration reform. So let's seize this opportunity to pass commonsense \nlegislation that our constituents expect.\n  I am looking right over the dais. Above the dais, I see ``e pluribus \nunum,'' which translates to ``out of many, one.'' That is a simple \nmotto which is engraved in this great Senate Chamber, and it is one of \nthe daily reminders that we are a nation of immigrants. Throughout our \nhistory, millions of immigrants--including my ancestors and the \nPresiding Officer's--braved hardship and great risks to come here. Why \nwas that? They sought freedom, opportunity, and a better life for their \nfamilies. Today's immigrants, in that same spirit, continue to brave \ngreat risks and hardships to obtain the American dream.\n  We have heard from fellow Americans who are opposed to fixing our \nbroken system. There are those among us who unfortunately see \nimmigrants as a burden on our country or want to enact overly punitive \nmeasures to punish undocumented immigrants. I ask that they remember \nthat our country was built and forged by immigrants whose blood and \nsweat built the America we know today.\n  To oppose this legislation, with all due respect, is to deny the \npromise our ancestors and even the Framers expected us to extend to \nthose outside our borders. Yes, we are a nation of laws, and we don't \ntake lightly the violation of our laws, but we are also a nation that \nwelcomes foreigners who want to build the American dream.\n  I would like to challenge my colleagues to remember that we are a \nbetter, stronger country because of our immigrants whose first glimpse \nof America was the Statue of Liberty emblazoned with the words of poet \nEmma Lazarus:\n\n       Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning \n     to breathe free.\n\n  Our country and our economy were built from the ground up by the hard \nwork and ingenuity of immigrants and their families. In recent years, \none in four of America's new small business owners has been an \nimmigrant. One in four high-tech startups in America was founded by \nimmigrants. And 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies--when they \nstarted--were created by first- or second-generation immigrants. If we \nlook at our system today, unfortunately, because it is broken, it has \nmade it harder for would-be business owners as I just described to \ncreate jobs and help spur our Nation's economic development.\n  Let me give another example. Right now our system invites the best \nand brightest from all over the world to come and study at our top \nuniversities. Once they have the training they need to create a new \ninvention or build a new business--listen to this--our system tells \nthem to go back home. That is not right.\n  I am pleased, honored, humbled, and a little bit proud that I have \nworked for years with Coloradans at my side to solve this problem and \nto make the United States a place where entrepreneurs are encouraged to \nstay, build businesses, and grow our economy. In that vein, I want to \nthank the Gang of 8 for their hard work in crafting a bill that is \nbuilt upon those principles. Entrepreneurs embody the American dream.\n  Fixing our broken system is about more than businesses and startups; \nit is principally about families. To say that our current broken \nimmigration system is bad for our families would be an understatement. \nThousands of fathers--myself included--gathered with their families \nthis past weekend to celebrate Father's Day. I couldn't help but think \nof the thousands of fathers our immigration system has separated from \ntheir loved ones or the countless fathers living today in Colorado who \nstruggle with the fear every day that they could be separated from \ntheir families.\n  There are fathers like Jorge, who has been living in the United \nStates for 23 years. He is the proud father of four U.S. citizen \nchildren, including a U.S. Army corporal. He has been contributing to \nour economy in Colorado and therefore to the American economy and his \ncommunity for many years. With immigration reform, Jorge will be able \nto come out of the shadows, where he will finally be able to realize \nthe American dream without the constant fear of being deported and \nseparated from his children. As I have suggested, unfortunately Jorge's \nsituation is not unique. The fact that our current system has brought \nus to the place where at any moment thousands of families can be ripped \napart is just not right.\n  This bill would give Jorge and millions of others like him a tough \nbut fair shot at earning legal status and eventually citizenship. Make \nno mistake. This process will not be without significant cost, and it \nwill not be easy.\n  Let me explain how I draw that conclusion. In order to get earned \nlegalization, Jorge will have to pass a background check, pay back \ntaxes, penalties, and fees, demonstrate work history, learn English, \nand go to the back of the line behind others who have also gone through \nthe process. This is a tough but fair road ahead. It is a path \nnegotiated by Senators of both parties and supported by the American \npeople.\n  Today there are an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in \nthe United States. Some cross the border illegally, others have \noverstayed their visas. Regardless of how they came, the overwhelming \nmajority of these folks, just like Jorge, are trying to earn a living \nand provide for their families.\n  There are thousands of immigrants in Colorado who are working in the \nshadows, where they are vulnerable to exploitive employers paying them \nless than minimum wage, making them work without overtime, and denying \nthem any of the benefits given to their other employees. That pushes \ndown standards for all workers. What I am saying is that our current \nimmigration system has fostered an underground economy that exploits a \ncheap source of labor while depressing wages for everyone else.\n  My conclusion is that this bill will ensure that businesses are all \nplaying by the same set of rules, and it includes tough penalties for \nbusinesses that do not. The underlying bill implements an effective \nemployment verification system that will prevent identity theft, the \nhiring of unauthorized workers, and send a clear message that will help \nprevent future waves of illegal immigration. It is a commonsense \nsolution. It is the kind of solution I have heard Coloradans ask for.\n  I will now turn my attention to the border. This legislation contains \nhistoric resources and measures to better secure our borders. Last week \nI heard time and time again: Borders first, borders first. To the \nColoradans who expect border security, as I do, I say the best thing we \ncan do for border security is pass a comprehensive immigration reform \nbill.\n  We have made significant progress over the past several years. We \nhave put $17 billion in resources into protecting our borders. As a \nresult, illegal border crossings are at their lowest levels in decades. \nLet's be clear. There is still room for significant improvement, and \nthe strong border security provisions in this bill help us get there. \nIn fact, the underlying bill would be the single biggest commitment to \nborder security in our Nation's history. Why? It would put another $6.5 \nbillion on top of what we are already spending toward stronger, \nsmarter, more innovative security along our borders. It would also \ndirect the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit to Congress a \ncomprehensive border security plan and a southern border fencing \nstrategy. Moreover, the legislation would delay the process of granting \nlegal status to immigrants until the plan and strategy have been \ndeployed, a mandatory employment verification system has been \nimplemented, and an electronic biographic entry-exit system is in place \nat major airports and seaports.\n  Finally, this legislation would hold employers more accountable if \nthey knowingly hire undocumented workers. We are saying that no longer \nwill we tolerate an underground market of workers who are illegally \nemployed and many times exploited.\n  As I begin to close, I would like to turn to a special group of \nColoradans who would be helped. This is a group about whom we all \nshould care and about whom I deeply care, and that is our students. I \nam very pleased and excited that the provisions for the DREAM Act are \nincluded in the comprehensive immigration reform bill we are \nconsidering.\n  I have stood alongside a steadfast group of my colleagues as we \nfought for\n\n[[Page S4561]]\n\npassage of the DREAM Act for many years. Along the way I have talked to \nand more importantly listened to countless Colorado students who have \nlooked me in the eyes and asked for their government to help give them \nstatus, opportunity, and potential so they can go on to be the next \ngeneration of American leaders without the daily fear of deportation. \nWe are talking about thousands of Colorado students who were brought to \nthe United States at a very young age. It wasn't their decision to be \nbrought here, but they came here with their parents. That cohort--\nliterally thousands of these wonderful, enthusiastic, energetic \nColoradans--is poised to graduate college or join the military and in \nthe process strengthen our country and grow our economy. Let's do the \nright thing by the DREAMers.\n  I say and implore my colleagues, let's not stand in the way of what \nAmericans want and what our economy needs. Our Nation will be stronger \nwhen our borders are secure, when employers are held accountable for \nthe workers they have hired, when jobs are filled with qualified and \ndocumented workers who contribute to the economy and undocumented \nworkers who are currently here are held accountable and given an \nopportunity to earn their legal status and then citizenship.\n  So for my colleagues who are here today and are serious about fixing \nour broken immigration system, let's actually have a serious debate to \nimprove this legislation. Let's vote on amendments with a sincere \nintent to really improve this bill. Let's work productively to find a \nbipartisan solution to this huge national issue in the same way the \nGang of 8 has worked for the past many months.\n  As I said in my opening remarks, we have a historic opportunity to \nfinally pass comprehensive immigration reform. We have an extraordinary \nopportunity to show the Senate at its best. Having the opportunity to \nopenly and honestly debate this legislation is one of the many reasons \nwe ran to serve in the Senate in the first place. The public has placed \ntheir trust in us to get this right, and we can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to present and discuss the next \namendment I personally offered which I am going to be bringing to the \nSenate floor; that is, amendment No. 1330, to prohibit anyone who has \nbeen convicted of offenses under the violence against women and \nchildren act from gaining legal status under the bill.\n  I think if we ask the American people if they support the outline \nthat has been presented as the guiding outline for the Gang of 8, the \nvast majority would say we absolutely support those principles. I would \nsay I support those principles as they were enumerated. The trouble is, \nin my opinion, when we actually read the bill--and let's remember, \nparticularly as we are in the middle of the debacle of executing \nObamaCare, it is important to read the bill, it is important to know \nwhat is in the bill--in my opinion, the trouble is when we actually \nread the bill, it doesn't stand up to those principles. It doesn't \nmatch.\n  One example is the absolute commitment made by the Gang of 8 early on \nin this process that individuals with a serious or significant criminal \nbackground would not get legal status and would be deported. They were \nvery specific about that. In their bipartisan framework for \ncomprehensive immigration reform, which the authors of this bill--the \nso-called Gang of 8--released in January of this year--they said very \nspecifically:\n\n       Individuals with a serious criminal background or others \n     who pose a threat to our national security will be ineligible \n     for legal status and subject to deportation.\n\n  It is very clear.\n  But then, again, when we actually read the bill, I believe it comes \nup far short of that. It does not include significant crimes, serious \ncrimes which it should include as a disqualification.\n  One of the areas I think is the clearest example of that is offenses \nunder the Violence Against Women Act, offenses that have to do with \ndomestic violence, with child abuse. Those are serious violent offenses \nthat every American citizen--particularly women--would certainly \nconsider very consequential, very significant, very serious, \nundermining their fundamental security.\n  This Vitter amendment No. 1330, which I will be presenting and \ngetting a vote on later in this debate, is simple. It simply says those \ncriminal offenses, a conviction of any of those criminal offenses under \nthe Violence Against Women Act--we are talking about domestic violence, \nwe are talking about child abuse--are disqualifiers. Nobody can gain \nlegal status if they are convicted of any of those offenses. That is a \ndisqualifier and it is grounds for deportation.\n  Again, it is very important to read the bill. It is very important \nthat if anything passes here, it actually matches the promises made to \nthe American people, the rhetoric the American people have heard for \nweeks and months. This is an important area where we need to get it \nright.\n  So I hope all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, agree that \nthese are serious offenses. Certainly, everybody seemed to agree in the \nimportant discussion about the Violence Against Women Act. Certainly, \neverybody seemed to agree then that those offenses that are all about \ndomestic violence and child abuse are very serious, very significant, \ninvolve or threaten violence, and certainly they should be \ndisqualifiers for a person becoming legalized under this bill and they \nshould be grounds for immediate deportation. I hope this is beyond \ndebate. I hope this amendment, as it should, gets widespread bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I very much look forward to continuing this discussion about \namendment No. 1330. I very much look forward to getting the vote it \nwill get because it deserves to get it--and I will demand it--and I \nvery much hope for and look forward to a strong bipartisan vote in \nsupport of stopping violence against women, in support of furthering \nthe protections of the Violence Against Women Act.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I know the parties are working on a \nunanimous consent agreement for the next tranche of amendments to come \nforward. I expect and hope mine will be one of them, but it is not \nquite completed yet. So rather than ask for unanimous consent to call \nup my amendment now, what I would like to do is just talk about it a \nlittle bit and explain to my colleagues what is in it.\n  We call my amendment the RESULTS amendment because it is necessary, \nbecause in the current form of the so-called Gang of 8 bill, it does \nnot include any genuine guarantee of border security. My colleagues \ndon't have to take my word for it. All they have to do is take a look \nat the chart behind me. Senator Durbin, one of the four Democrats and \nfour Republicans who were responsible for coming up with the so-called \nGang of 8 bill, said in January that in that bill, a pathway to \ncitizenship ``would be contingent upon securing the border.'' He said \nthat in January. I think a lot of people took him and others at their \nword, only to find out otherwise in June, 6 months later--June 2013--\nwhen he was quoted as saying that the gang has ``delinked the pathway \nto citizenship and border enforcement.''\n  What that means is the underlying bill gives a promise--another \nhollow, unenforceable promise--and, based upon our experience, I think \nthe American people would be justified in saying they are asking us to \ntrust them at a time when there is a genuine trust deficit with regard \nto the Federal Government. We have heard too many promises. We want \nguarantees that these promises will be delivered on, and that is what \nmy amendment is all about.\n  In the underlying bill, all we have is--first of all, we have a 100-\npercent situational awareness requirement and a 90-percent apprehension \nrequirement of people who are crossing the border illegally. But all \nthat is required in the underlying bill is the submission of a plan and \nsubstantial completion of that plan for which nobody has seen the \ncontents. That is 10 years from now. I don't think anyone would be out \nof bounds in saying there may be good intentions--people may actually \nbelieve what they say, but how can we possibly know that some unwritten \nplan that is going to be in place 10 years from now will actually be \nsuccessful in accomplishing the very goals that were set out in the \nbill?\n\n[[Page S4562]]\n\n  My amendment is slightly different because it embraces those same \nstandards, including 100 percent situational awareness and 90 percent \ncross-border apprehensions, and it says a person can't transition from \nprobationary status to legal permanent residency until it is certified \nthat they have accomplished those goals. What that does, simply stated, \nis--it doesn't punish anything, but it lines up all of the incentives \nfor those of us who want to secure the border and have a border \nimmigration system that actually works and incentives for those for \nwhom a pathway to citizenship is the holy grail; that is what they want \nmore than anything else. So it realigns incentives on the right and the \nleft and gets us in a position where we can actually look the American \npeople in the face and say we have as close as humanly possible a \nguarantee that these promises will ultimately be kept.\n  My amendment requires the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security inspector general, in consultation with \nthe Government Accountability Office and the Comptroller General, to \njointly certify that the following triggers are met before registered \nprovisional immigrants can adjust to lawful permanent residency or \ngreen card status. First, as I said, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity has to have achieved and maintained full situational awareness \nof the entire southern border for not less than 1 year. That means the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has the capability to conduct \ncontinuous and integrated monitoring, sensing or surveillance of each \nand every 1-mile segment of the southern border or its immediate \nvicinity.\n  Some may say: Full border situational awareness? How are we going to \ndo that? Are we going to link Border Patrol agents arm to arm across a \n2,000-mile border? Are we going to just build a fence, as some have \nadvocated, along the 2,000-mile border? The fact is we are going to use \nthe best technology and the best strategy to make sure the resources \nour U.S. military has deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq and which have \nbeen tested along the southern border are available for border control, \nso that by virtue of radar, eyes in the sky, dirigibles, and unmanned \naerial vehicles, a combination of these connected to the sensors on the \nground will make sure the Border Patrol knows what is happening along \nthe border when people try to cross and enter illegally. Then it is up \nto them to hit the 90-percent operational control requirement in both \nthe underlying bill and in my amendment.\n  The Department of Homeland Security is required to achieve that \noperational control for not less than 1 year, meaning it has an \neffectiveness apprehension rate of not less than 90 percent in each and \nevery sector of the southern border.\n  I saw this morning that Senator McCain said he expects to have a \nletter from the head of the Border Patrol which states that standard is \nimminently doable, given the proper resources. So if it is imminently \ndoable, then I would like to suggest, contrary to what the majority \nleader said a few days ago, that this amendment is not a poison pill. \nThis amendment would give the American people the confidence that we \nare actually going to do what is technologically feasible and which I \nbelieve they have a right to expect if we are going to be generous in \nthe way we treat the 11 million people who are here and provide them \nnot only an opportunity to apply for probation and to work, if they \nqualify and if they maintain the terms of that probation, but if they \nare successful, to ultimately apply 10 years hence for legal permanent \nresidency for those who want that and who have played by the rules.\n  The third trigger in my amendment is one that maintains the \nunderlying provision requiring the Department of Homeland Security to \nimplement an E-Verify system nationwide. The current situation is such \nthat individuals who want to work may have fake documents claiming to \nbe somebody they are not--maybe it is somebody else's Social Security \nnumber--in order to get hired. But the employer is not expected to be \nthe police; they are not expected to be able to look behind these \ndocuments. We know that massive identity theft and document fraud occur \nin such a way as to circumvent the efforts to enforce our system and to \nrestore legality into the system when it comes to people who come to \nthis country and want to work here. So that is the third one.\n  The fourth one, in order to fill a gaping hole in the bill with \nrespect to interior enforcement, the RESULTS amendment requires the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to initiate removal proceedings for at \nleast 90 percent of visa overstays who collectively currently account \nfor 40 percent of illegal immigration. I think it surprises a lot of \npeople to learn it is not just our porous borders, it is people who \nenter the country legally who simply overstay their visa and melt into \nthe great American landscape, unless they happen to get caught for \ncommitting a crime of some kind, and they typically are not identified \nor detained. This is simply unacceptable, and my amendment is designed \nto guarantee that the Department of Homeland Security will implement a \nprocedure which has been required for 17 years now. President Clinton \nsigned a provision into law requiring a biometric entry and exit \nsystem.\n  When a person enters the country on a foreign visa, they are required \nto give fingerprints--that is their biometric identifier--but there is \nno way and no means by which to check whether a person has left the \ncountry when their visa has expired. This is designed to deal with that \n40-percent source of illegal immigration.\n\n  My amendment authorizes the creation of a southern border security \ncommission similar to the one in the underlying bill, but does so in a \nway that respects the Constitution and federalism.\n  My amendment removes Washington, DC, appointees from the commission \nand allows State Governors to immediately begin advising the Department \non gaining operational control of the southern border. I think this is \nvery important because while I have heard colleagues here in the Senate \nwho have good intentions--but I think sometimes their only \nconsciousness of what the border may look like is derived from movies \nthey have seen or novels they have read--this requires consultation \nwith the people who know the border communities best, and that is the \npeople who live there and the State Governors who govern States on our \nU.S.-Mexico border.\n  My amendment also requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nissue a comprehensive southern border security strategy within 120 days \nof enactment. People who are listening may say: I thought the \nDepartment of Homeland Security already had a southern border security \nstrategy. And if it does not, why in the heck not?\n  Well, this would compel the Secretary--who, amazingly to most people \nin my State, when she declared the border is secure, nearly provoked \nlaughter, as much as anything else, because it is patently and \ndemonstrably not true--but this amendment would require such a strategy \nwithin 120 days of enactment of the bill and chart a course for \nachieving and maintaining full situational awareness and operational \ncontrol of the southern border.\n  The Secretary would also be required to submit semiannual reports on \nimplementation. This amendment would also streamline and improve the \nstrategy required under the underlying bill. For example, it combines \nthe southern border security strategy and the southern border fencing \nstrategy for administrative clarity and economies of scale.\n  It also addresses an oversight in the underlying bill by requiring \nthe Department of Homeland Security to develop a strategy to reduce \nland port of entry wait times by 50 percent in order to facilitate \nlegitimate commerce and encourage lawful cross-border trade.\n  This is something that is not sufficiently appreciated. Mexico is our \nthird largest trading partner. Six million jobs in America depend on \ncross-border trade with Mexico. Why in the world would we want to do \nanything that would make cross-border lawful trade worse? Right now, by \nfailing to update our infrastructure at the ports of entry--and to make \nsure we have adequate staffing here--there are huge wait lines which \nprove very useful to the people who want to smuggle drugs and people \nacross the border. So this would have a way of separating the \nlegitimate trade and traffic from the\n\n[[Page S4563]]\n\npeople who are up to no good: the drug dealers, the human traffickers, \nand the like.\n  There is a question that has arisen, as you might expect, about how \nwe are going to pay for all this. That is a good question, and it is an \nimportant question. My amendment creates a comprehensive immigration \nreform trust fund similar to that in the underlying bill. Ultimately, \nthe goal is for fees and fines to fund this entire piece of \nlegislation. But my amendment combines all border security funding \nstreams and makes $6.5 billion of these funds available immediately for \nimplementing the southern border security strategy.\n  The RESULTS amendment increases the number of Border Patrol agents \nand Customs and Border Protection officers by 5,000 each. Some people \nhave mistakenly said I want to add 10,000 Border Patrol agents to the \nborder on top of the 20,000 who are already there. Well, that is not \nentirely accurate. We want 5,000 more because if you have this great \ntechnology--which is going to give you eyes in the sky; 100-percent \nsituational awareness--when this technology identifies people trying to \ncross the border, you have to have somebody to go get them and to \ndetain them. That is why Border Patrol agents are important. In some \nparts of our 1,200-mile border in Texas alone, there are huge stretches \nof land that are vulnerable to cross-border traffic. That is why the \nRio Grande sector in South Texas is now the single most crossed sector.\n  The other day, when I was in Brooks County--Falfurrias, TX--the head \nof the Border Patrol sector in that area told me that in 1 day they had \n700 people coming across the border whom they detained. We do not know \nhow many got away, but they did detain 700 people. Madam President, 400 \nof them came from countries other than Mexico. In other words, Mexico's \neconomy is doing much better, and it is less and less incentive for \npeople to cross into the United States to work if they have a job where \nthey live. But in Central America things are pretty bad right now. So \n400 out of the 700 in 1 day came from Central America. Literally people \ncould come from anywhere around the world if they have the money and \nthe determination to penetrate our southern border. So it is important \nwe have increased numbers of Border Patrol agents as well as Customs \nand Border Protection officers to help facilitate legitimate commerce \nand to detain people trying to cross illegally.\n  By the way, the underlying bill already has a provision for \nadditional CBP officers--Customs and Border Protection officers--and my \namendment would increase that number by 3,500, and add 5,000 Border \nPatrol agents to it.\n  The RESULTS amendment also improves emergency border security \nresource appropriations by ensuring that deployment decisions are \nconsistent with the comprehensive strategy and not done in a piecemeal, \ndisconnected sort of way. It is important that we have a combination of \nnot only boots on the ground, infrastructure, but also that technology \nI think we would all agree upon, much of which the American taxpayer \nhas already paid for because it is being deployed by the U.S. military \nin places such as Afghanistan and Iraq. What we need to do is transfer \nsome of that to the Homeland Security Department--another part of the \nFederal Government--and to implement it to help provide that \nsituational awareness and enforcement.\n  My amendment also authorizes $1 billion a year for 6 years--it does \nnot appropriate it; it authorizes it--in emergency port of entry \npersonnel and infrastructure improvements. I already touched on that a \nmoment ago. But the whole idea of the underlying bill is to provide a \nguest worker program, a legal means to come and work in the United \nStates. The idea is that will allow law enforcement to focus on the bad \nactors. This has the similar rationale.\n  The RESULTS amendment further improves the land ports of entry by \nallowing the General Services Administration to enter into public-\nprivate partnerships to improve infrastructure and operations.\n  This amendment also repurposes the Tucson sector earmark in the \nunderlying bill to the full southern border to help ensure that \neffective border security prosecutions are increased in every sector, \nnot just in one, in Tucson.\n  By making improvements to the State Criminal Alien Assistance \nProgram--the so-called SCAAP bill--my amendment would help ensure that \nState and local governments are swiftly and fully compensated for their \nassistance in detaining criminal aliens who have been convicted of \noffenses and who are awaiting trial.\n  One of the great frustrations in my State--given our common border \nwith Mexico and the failure of the Federal Government to live up to its \nresponsibilities when it comes to border security--is that much of the \ncost of that is borne by local governments and local taxpayers in \ncounties along the U.S.-Mexico border, particularly when it comes to \neducation, health care, and law enforcement.\n  This SCAAP provision in my amendment would help make sure that in the \nlaw enforcement area State and local law enforcement officials are \nindemnified and, indeed, encouraged to help cooperate in detaining \ncriminal aliens who have been convicted of offenses and are awaiting \ntrial.\n  My amendment would also create the southern border security \nassistance grant program to help border law enforcement officials \ntarget drug traffickers, human traffickers, human smugglers, and \nviolent crime. Again, the Federal law enforcement agencies cannot do it \nby themselves, and local and State law enforcement in Texas do not \nexpect them to, but they do expect a little bit of help, financial \nhelp, particularly, when it comes to overtime, when it comes to \nequipment that is necessary to supplement the Federal effort or to fill \nthe gap when the Federal Government leaves a gap in law enforcement \nefforts.\n  My amendment would also remove a controversial provision in the \nunderlying bill that would prevent the emergency deportation of serious \ncriminals.\n  My amendment would remove a controversial disclosure bar that would \nprevent law enforcement and national security officials from obtaining \ncritical information contained in legalization applications filed under \nthis bill. My amendment would allow these officials to request and \nobtain information in connection with an independent criminal, national \nsecurity, or civil investigation.\n  This is directed at one of the biggest problems in the 1986 amnesty \nRonald Reagan signed, because he signed an amnesty for 3 million people \npremised on the idea that we were actually going to enforce the law and \nwe would never need to do that again. But so much of that amnesty was \nriddled with fraud and criminal activity because of the confidentiality \nprovisions which prohibited law enforcement from investigating and \ndetecting fraud and criminality. If we want to maintain the integrity \nof the provisions of this bill, we need to make sure our law \nenforcement officials are not blinded, but that they actually have the \nability to investigate these matters for a criminal, national security, \nor civil investigation.\n  My amendment would allow Citizenship and Immigration Services to turn \nover evidence of criminal activity or terrorism contained in \nlegalization applications filed under the bill to other law enforcement \nagencies after the application has been denied and all administrative \nappeals have been exhausted.\n  This would greatly work to reduce the potential for mass fraud that \noccurred in the 1986 amnesty bill, and it would allow the application \nprocess to maintain its basic integrity and ensure that national \nsecurity is protected.\n  My amendment would also give American diplomatic officials more \nflexibility to share foreigners' visa records with our allies by \nclarifying that the State Department may share visa records with a \nforeign government on a case-by-case basis for the purpose of \ndetermining removability or eligibility for a visa, admission, or other \nimmigration benefits--not just for crime prevention, investigation, and \npunishment--or when the sharing is in the national interest of the \nUnited States.\n  My amendment would further improve the public safety by denying \nprobationary status--something called RPI, or registered provisional \nimmigrant status--to any person who has been convicted of a crime \ninvolving domestic violence, child abuse, assault\n\n[[Page S4564]]\n\nwith bodily injury, violation of a protective order under the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, or drunk driving. These are serious offenses, and \nthe consequences are often tragic. The underlying bill would allow the \nvast majority of illegal immigrants who have committed these crimes to \nautomatically become registered provisional immigrants and, ultimately, \nhold open to them the possibility they could become American citizens. \nI think we need to draw a very bright line between those whose only \noffense is to try to come here for a better life and those who have \nshown such contempt for our laws and American law and order that they \ncommit crimes. We should not reward them with a registered provisional \nimmigrant or probationary status.\n  My amendment also removes an unjustified provision in the underlying \nbill that would allow repeat criminals with multiple convictions to \nautomatically obtain legal status, so long as they were convicted of \nthe multiple offenses on the same day. I know that sounds very strange, \nbut in the underlying bill, if you commit multiple offenses on one day, \nthey do not count as separate offenses for purposes of the bar--if you \ncommit three misdemeanors or a felony. So my amendment would fix that.\n  My amendment would also remove a dangerous provision in the \nunderlying bill that would allow the Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security unfettered discretion to waive this criminal activity \nprohibition and to allow people to gain legal status, even if they are \nrepeat criminals who have been convicted of three or more offenses.\n  My amendment would strike a controversial provision allowing \ndeportees and persons currently located outside the United States to \nqualify for probationary status. I do not know how many people have \nactually focused on this provision. I think most people thought this \nwas for people who were in the shadows in the United States whose only \noffense was simply a violation of our immigration laws to come here and \nwork. But this underlying bill would allow people who have already been \ndeported and who have committed crimes already to reenter the country \nand to qualify for probationary status. My amendment would change that \nand fix that.\n  My amendment would require the Secretary of Homeland Security, \nthrough her designees, to conduct interviews of applicants for RPI \nstatus who have been convicted of a criminal offense in order to \ndetermine whether the applicant is a danger to the public safety.\n  Now, I can imagine that somebody might have committed some \nmisdemeanor offense, but upon further inquiry and examination they may \nnot be deemed a threat to the public safety. That is what the purpose \nof that interview requirement would be. We also close a judicial review \nloophole that would allow dangerous individuals to remain in the United \nStates after their RPI application has been denied by the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  Finally, my amendment would take a hard line against human smuggling \nand the transnational criminal organizations that are the primary \nmovers of people and drugs across the southern borders. I do not know \nhow many of our colleagues really understand this now, but this is a \nmajor business that is primarily occupied by organized crime. It is the \ndrug cartels. It is what we sometimes call transnational criminal \norganizations and the people who work for them.\n  They are the primary agency moving people, drugs, and contraband \nacross the border. That is what my amendment is designed to attack--\nincreased penalties for human smuggling and the transnational criminal \norganizations that facilitate them. My amendment adds aggravated \npenalties for human smuggling that is committed by repeat offenders \nwhich result in death, result in human trafficking, or include \ninvoluntary sexual conduct.\n  I had the humbling experience the other day when I was in south Texas \nin meeting a young lady who is from Central America. Her parents paid \n$6,000 for her to be smuggled into the United States and to be reunited \nwith relatives in New Jersey, only to find out that did not work out \ntoo well, and she had to rejoin the person who brought her across the \nborder, the human smuggler, who promptly prostituted her and put her \ninto involuntary servitude where she was afraid to escape lest she be \ndeported and have to leave the country.\n  There are innumerable human tragedies which occur day in and day out \nunder the status quo, which is one reason why I believe we need to fix \nour broken immigration system, and particularly our porous border, that \nallows these predators to prey on innocent young women like this young \nwoman I met from Guatemala, and to basically commit them to human \nslavery in the United States in places like Houston, where she worked \nin a bar and was prostituted out numerous times a day. Because she felt \nso vulnerable, she believed the only way she could actually stay here \nwas to submit to the demands of this sexual predator.\n  My amendment respects the victims of abuse of human smuggling by \nrequiring the Department of Justice to ensure that information about \nmissing and unidentified migrant remains found on lands near the \nsouthern border is uploaded into the National Missing and Unidentified \nPersons System. We provide state and local officials with resources to \nidentify the victims.\n  This is another experience I had when I was in Brooks County recently \nin south Texas, where just last year alone they found 129 dead bodies--\nhuman remains--that they were unable to identify because these were \npeople simply left behind by the human smugglers who basically did not \ncare anything about them--only for the money they would provide, which \nonce provided, they could care less about whether these people actually \nmade their way into the United States, particularly if they were \nslowing down the rest of the group.\n  My RESULTS amendment disqualifies persons who have used a commercial \nmotor vehicle to commit a human smuggling offense from operating a \ncommercial vehicle for a year. We ban repeat human smugglers from \noperating commercial motor vehicles for life. This is a penalty that \nwill have teeth in it and deter this heinous crime. My amendment \ncreates special penalties for illegal immigrants convicted of drug \ntrafficking or crimes of violence.\n  Now, we understand that, again, some people have come across our \nborders without observing our immigration laws who want nothing but a \nchance to work. But if people have come across the border and engaged \nin drug trafficking or criminal violence, they deserve the special \npenalties provided for in my amendment. My amendment would create a new \ncrime for illegal border crossing with the intent to aid, abet, or \nengage in a crime of terrorism. Again, this is something I wonder \nwhether my colleagues really understand because they do not live along \nthe southwestern border.\n  We have had people from 100 different countries, including countries \nof special interest as state sponsors of terrorism, come across our \nsouthwestern border. When I was in Falfurrias the other day, the Border \nPatrol showed me rescue beacons which, if you get sick enough and \ndehydrated enough and exposed enough to the elements and just want to \ngive up, you can hit the beacon and the Border Patrol will come and \nrescue you.\n  They are listed in three languages: English, Spanish, and Chinese. I \nasked the Border Patrol: Well, Chinese, that seems a little bit out of \nplace in south Texas. They said: Well, for $30,000, if you are from \nChina, you can hire someone to smuggle you into the United States. So, \nas we have heard from both the Director of National Intelligence and \nthe head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, this vulnerability along \nour southwestern border is literally a national security vulnerability, \nand one reason we need to adopt my amendment.\n  My amendment closes loopholes in current laws that allow drug cartel \nmules to transport bulk cash and launder money with near impunity. So \nwhat happens is, the drugs come from the south of the border to the \nnorth of the border. Then the transaction is made by somebody buying \nthose drugs. The cash has to make its way back. We have developed \npretty sophisticated means through a wire transfer process to identify \nwhen large amounts of cash are transferred by wire. But there is also a \nhuge trade in bulk cash, where\n\n[[Page S4565]]\n\nliterally cash is transferred in bulk across the border south in order \nto launder it with near impunity. My amendment would address that \nproblem.\n  My amendment targets money-laundering efforts through stored value \ncards and blank checks. So why do it on the wire? Why do it in bulk \ncash if you can just do it through a gift card you can buy at a local \ngrocery store or blank checks? These are tactics that are frequently \nused by cartels to transport criminal proceeds across the southern \nborder and launder money.\n  In sum, my amendment goes beyond promises and platitudes. It demands \nresults. Again, it realigns the incentives for everybody to make sure \nthe Department of Homeland Security hits the standards in this bill of \n100 percent situational awareness, 90 percent operational control.\n  These are not my standards alone. These were standards that the Gang \nof 8 wrote initially into their bill. Their bill offers promises but no \nreal enforcement means to make sure it actually happens.\n  Under my amendment, people who applied for registered provisional \nstatus are not eligible for legal permanent residency until the \nAmerican people have the assurances that the border security measures, \nthe E-Verify provision, the biometric entry-exit system, all those \nthings have been done.\n  That seems like a small price to pay with a generous gift that the \nAmerican people are being asked to confer upon people who have entered \nthe country illegally or who came in legally and overstayed their visa \nin violation of our laws. Now, this is what a real border security \ntrigger looks like. Unfortunately, some of our colleagues do not want a \ntrigger at all. Above all, they want a pathway to citizenship \nregardless of whether we have secured our borders.\n  We have tried that before--in 1986. We have also promised people \nsince 1996 that we would implement a biometric entry-exit system and \nhave never delivered that. The 9/11 Commission identified the need for \na biometric entry-exit system as a national security imperative in the \n9/11 Commission report. We still have not done it. So why in the world \nwould the American people, at a time when their trust in the Federal \nGovernment is at an all-time low, why in the world would we simply say \ntrust us once more. We are going to promise you the Sun and the Moon \nand the aurora borealis, but we are not going to have any means \nnecessary in the bill to actually require the implementation of those \npromises. By the time the empty promises are realized, we know there \nwill be 11 million people on registered provisional immigrant status \nand potentially on the way to legal permanent residency and \ncitizenship.\n  CNN reported a poll today that said 6 out of 10 Americans in their \npoll were OK with providing people humane and compassionate treatment, \nincluding an opportunity to earn legal status in this country if they \ncould just be assured that the borders would be secured and our laws \nwould be enforced. My amendment accomplishes exactly that.\n  As I have repeatedly emphasized, my amendment uses the same border \nsecurity standards as the Gang of 8 bill. Again, the difference is that \nin my amendment it has a real trigger that is based on demonstrable \nresults, while their so-called trigger can be activated whether or not \nour borders are ever secured.\n  To put it another way, their trigger demands border security inputs. \nMy trigger demands border security results or outputs. We have now had \n27 years of inputs since the 1986 amnesty, and we still do not have \nsecure borders. It is long past time to demand results, or outputs, and \nnot just more hollow promises.\n  One final point about immigration reform. Whatever legislation we \npass in this Chamber will head over to the House of Representatives. If \nwe want the Senate bill to have any chance to become law, then we have \nto include real border security provisions and a real border security \ntrigger. Our House colleagues have made that abundantly clear.\n  In other words, my amendment is not a poison pill. It is an antidote \nbecause it is the only way we are ever going to truly get bipartisan \nimmigration reform, something which I hope and pray we will because the \nstatus quo is simply unacceptable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I understand I am not supposed to call up \nmy amendment. But I would like to discuss amendment No. 1298. If it \nwere appropriate, I would ask to make it pending. But, again, I \nunderstand we are not quite ready for that.\n  I am offering this amendment, when the time is right, because I think \nit is crucial that we have the strongest possible border protection \nsystem in place if this bill, in fact, does someday go into law. To \nthat end, I would like to ensure that we have the best trained \npersonnel securing our borders and overseeing the activity that \ncontributes to the safety of our Nation every day.\n  Therefore, I am proposing an amendment to require the Department of \nHomeland Security to set up a program to recruit highly qualified \nveterans of the Armed Forces as well as members of the Reserves to fill \ncrucial positions within Customs and Border Protection and Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement.\n  The security provided by these agents depends on the line watch \nagents who identify and apprehend undocumented aliens, smugglers, and \nterrorists. It depends on the agriculture and trade specialists, \naircraft pilots, and mission support staff. It also depends on the \nintelligence research specialists, report officers, and systems \nengineers. Although the role and responsibilities within ICE and CBP \nare varied, each plays a critical role in protecting the border. The \nability of these agencies to protect the border depends on the skills, \ntraining, and judgment of its employees.\n  The men and women who have served our Nation in the Armed Forces, as \nwell as those who have served in the Reserves, have a broad range of \ncapabilities that make them well suited to work in these important \nagencies. These men and women embody endurance and adaptability. Many \nof them have the human intelligence skills that ICE and CBP agents and \nofficers need to detect illegal border crossers and respond to other \nnefarious activities. They are familiar with the security equipment and \ntechnologies that these agencies rely upon.\n  They have experience responding to leads provided by electronic \nsensor systems and aircraft sightings, as well as interpreting and \nfollowing tracks and other physical evidence. They are trained in \ntarget assessment and have experience in disseminating the intelligence \nneeded to make informed operational strategies.\n  These men and women, in short, have the physical skills, operational \nexperience, and decisionmaking abilities needed by ICE and CBP to \nensure that our borders are stronger than ever.\n  Let me say this is one of these amendments that is a no-brainer. This \nmakes sense, and it helps our veterans in a couple of different ways. \nIt helps with the unemployment rate, but it also helps them continue to \nserve our country. The bottom line is it helps our country to have the \nbest, the brightest, most capable, and most experienced personnel we \ncan possibly have on the border.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment. Senator Johanns is my partner, and I \nam honored to be joined by him. Certainly, I would like to have broad-\nbased bipartisan support as we proceed when the time is right.\n  I hope to have this amendment included in the bill. Again, when the \ntime is right, I would ask that my colleagues consider supporting this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. My colleagues have heard me mention so many times that \nwe tend to delegate more and we ought to be legislating. This bill is \nanother example of delegating too much and giving too much authority to \nCabinet-level people, in this case the Secretary of Homeland Security, \nand not making enough hard decisions on the floor of the Senate.\n  It is reminiscent of the 1,693 delegations of authority we gave to \nCabinet people in the health care reform bill to a point where you can \nread that 2,700 pages and understand it, but we truly don't know what \nthe health care system in the United States is going to be\n\n[[Page S4566]]\n\nuntil those 1,693 regulations are put in place. That is going to be a \nlong way down the road.\n  I wish to point out to my colleagues, I think we are making the same \nmistake in this immigration bill that is before the Senate. I wish to \ntake some time to talk about how important it is to emphasize the need \nfor Congress to legislate, not delegate, especially with this \nimmigration bill before us.\n  When an immigration bill is nearly 1,200 pages long, the American \npeople should expect that it is their elected representatives writing \nthe legislation and making most of the decisions. They should expect \nthe executive branch and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in \nparticular, to carry out those policies.\n  There are individual circumstances that Congress cannot fully \nanticipate, so it is understandable, then, delegating some authority. \nWith direction from Congress, the Secretary should be able to issue \nregulations to enforce legislative policies in those situations. Those \nregulations and any discretion the Secretary exercises, such as other \ndelegations of power from Congress, should be subject to judicial \nreview to ensure that the policies Congress established are being \ncarried out according to congressional intent.\n  But this immigration bill takes a different and wrong-headed \napproach. It provides highly general discretion to the Secretary. It \ngives the Secretary tremendous, often unilateral, discretion to \nimplement the bill. In many instances, that discretion is not even \nsubject to judicial review.\n  This, obviously, is not the way power is supposed to work in our \nrepresentative system of government. Uncontrolled unilateral discretion \nis not what the Framers of the Constitution envisioned for a government \nwith separation of powers, checks, and balances. We have seen, for \ninstance, and recently with the IRS, what can happen when the executive \nbranch exercises authority with too much discretion and not enough \noversight.\n  By some accounts, there are 222 provisions in the bill that give the \nSecretary of Homeland Security discretion or even allow her to waive \notherwise governing parts of the bill. Other people have counted even \nmore than the 222 provisions I have just referred to. Whether it is \nmore or less, it is still a lot. In some cases, it is not just the \ndelegation, it is how it is delegated.\n  The Secretary's unbridled waiver authority makes a bill that is \nalready weak on immigration enforcement then even weaker.\n  Ironically, when the Judiciary Committee marked up the immigration \nbill, it rejected amendments that I and others offered to limit \njudicial review of immigration enforcement proceedings against people \nwho are in this country illegally. The majority argued against them by \nclaiming that judicial review, which historically has been limited to \nthese enforcement actions, should be expanded to cover these decisions \nand that is an expansion of judicial review.\n  Let me speak of the inconsistency of when they didn't think judicial \nreview should be there. The majority wants unlimited judicial review \nwhen the Secretary would take enforcement action against people in the \ncountry illegally.\n  At the same time, the bill provides more judicially unreviewable \ndiscretion for the Secretary when she decides not to enforce the law \nagainst undocumented immigrants.\n  The people of this country should be aware of the one-way ratchet for \ndiscretion that the bill contains. Then it adds judicial review when \nthe Secretary would enforce the law and does not provide judicial \nreview when the Secretary decides to withhold enforcement of border \nsecurity and other measures designed to reduce illegal immigration.\n  I believe it is worth noting some of the specific provisions of the \nbill that give the Secretary discretion in enforcement, sometimes \nwithout judicial review. Some of the specific language that allows her \nto waive provisions that supporters of the bill claim make this bill \neven tough on illegal immigration and border security should also be \ndiscussed.\n  When they are contrasted, the legislation's goal is very clear: enact \nvery general border security measures that are said to be tough, while \ngiving the Secretary often unilateral discretion and waiver authority \nto water down those measures.\n  For instance, the Secretary can commence processing petitions for \nregistered provisional immigrant status--RPI status we call it--based \non her determination of border security plans and how she views the \nstatus of their implementation. The fencing that the bill seems to \ndemand can be stopped by the Secretary when she believes it is \nsufficient.\n  The Secretary has the ability to decide whether certain criminal \noffenses should bar someone from the legalization program. She can \nwaive, with few exceptions, the grounds of inadmissibility prescribed \nin law. She is given discretion whether to bring deportation \nproceedings against those who do not qualify for RPI status. If they \nare denied, shouldn't they be deported?\n  The Secretary is also allowed to waive various requirements when a \nperson adjusts from RPI status to legal permanent resident status, \nincluding what counts as passing a background check.\n  The Secretary has broad authority on how to use the $8.3 billion in \nupfront funds transferred from the Treasury. On top of that, she has \nwide discretion on how to use the additional $3 billion in startup \ncosts that don't have to be entirely repaid to the Treasury.\n  Notwithstanding the constitutional powers of Congress over the purse, \nshe is given authority to establish a grant program for nonprofit \norganizations.\n  With respect to the point system, the Secretary is given discretion \nto recalculate the points for particular petitioners and to decide not \nto deport inadmissible persons.\n  She also has the discretion to waive requirements for citizenship \nthat otherwise apply under the bill.\n  The Secretary is also given a great deal of discretion in the \noperation of the electronic employment verification system; for \ninstance, which businesses will be exempt from the requirement; which \ndocuments can individuals present to prove identity or work \nauthorization. She also has the authority to determine when an employer \nwho has repeatedly violated the law is required to use the system. \nThose decisions will be vital in determining whether the employment \nverification system will be effective.\n  Members of this body can opine all day about what this bill does, but \nwe may not know for years, as in the case of ObamaCare, until these \nregulations are written or these waivers are used, the extent to which \nthis bill is carried out with the intent that we believe it is carried \nout.\n  We don't know that for years. I use the example of the health care \nlaw because we are learning, after 4 years that the bill has been \npassed, there are a lot of unknowns in it. We also learned there is not \na lot of certainty. That is the fallout from delegating so much power \nin one Secretary. We shouldn't repeat that mistake when we pass this \nbill next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. I wish to say thank you to Senator Manchin, former \nGovernor Manchin, for his willingness to let me slip ahead of him for a \nfew minutes. He is going to talk about the birthday of the State in \nwhich both of us were born, West Virginia. I am happy to be here to \ncheer him on and to applaud all the good work that goes on in my native \nState and the great work he is doing.\n  The Presiding Officer has a baseball team up there in Massachusetts, \nthose Red Sox, and every now and then there is a pitcher who telegraphs \na pitch. I wish to telegraph a pitch this afternoon.\n  I was surprised to find out last month from the chair of the Senate \nCommittee on Homeland Security, when I was down at the Mexican border \nof South Texas, that three out of every five people who come into our \ncountry illegally in Texas come not from Mexico, but they come from \nCentral American countries. They come from Guatemala, they come from \nHonduras, and they come from El Salvador--3 out of 5, 6 out of 10.\n  For the most part, they don't realize what they are getting into. \nThey don't realize the risks they face on their way to the north to go \nto the border of Mexico and even when they get across the border into \nthe United States. The dangers they face are of getting robbed,\n\n[[Page S4567]]\n\nraped, beaten, drown in the river, and die of starvation and \ndehydration in the desert. Finally, they get to this country at a time \nwhen employers are tightening up in terms of whom they actually hire. \nThey are not hiring those who are here and undocumented.\n  There is the prospect of detention, not a very pleasant experience, \nfollowed shortly thereafter by literally being transported back to \ntheir native countries. Most of the people who are trying to get here \nfrom those three countries, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, don't \nknow what they are getting into.\n  They need to know what they are getting into. When I was Governor, as \npart of the 50-State deal negotiated by the States' attorneys general, \nyou may recall, with the tobacco industry, we created a foundation out \nof that and called it the American Legacy Foundation. We ran something \ncalled a truth campaign. The idea was to convince people, such as these \npages, not to start smoking and, if they were smoking, to stop. It was \nhugely successful.\n  What we need is something similar to that, particularly in those \nCentral American countries, where the majority of people are now coming \nfrom in order to get into Texas and to the United States.\n  The other thing I would have us keep in mind, we have spent a fair \namount of resources in this country trying to help the Mexicans go \nafter the drug lords and to quash the drug trade. What is happening is \nit is akin to squeezing a balloon. The bad guys in Mexico have worked \ntheir way down to El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and created mischief \nthere, setting up a drug trade, creating a lot of violence, and making \nlife very unpleasant.\n  What you have in those countries is not a good situation. One can \nunderstand why people want to get out of it: for jobs, hope, and for \npersonal safety. One of the things we have done to help in Mexico--and \nwe are part of the problem. Our country's consumption of illegal drugs \nhas created this problem for Mexico. This deal where drugs come north \nand guns go south--we are part of that problem, and we need to \nacknowledge that. But we want to be part of the solution in Mexico, and \nI think we are playing a constructive role.\n\n  We need to be part of the solution in Honduras, El Salvador, and \nGuatemala and do a similar kind of thing we are doing in Mexico. Part \nof that is to help a little on their own public safety, the law \nenforcement efforts in those three countries. Part of it is helping on \neconomic development, job creation, so people don't feel the need to \nleave those countries and try to flee to our country. The last piece is \nto actually work with Mexico so they can do a better job of controlling \ntheir own borders, to make sure folks don't get, from south of them, \ninto Mexico and eventually work their way into Texas and into the \nUnited States.\n  I will be offering an amendment--not tonight but I suspect tomorrow--\nthat tries to say: Let's put together a truth campaign, convey what is \nreally facing the people, particularly from those three Central \nAmerican countries, who are trying to get to the United States and to \nalso see, while we are doing that, if we can't help a little on the \neconomic development and job creation side in those countries and in \nterms of helping them face lawlessness and crime. We can do a little to \nhelp there as well. I call this going after the underlying causes--not \njust treating the symptoms of the problem but going after the \nunderlying cause--and I think we should do this. So I will offer this \ntomorrow, and I hope my colleagues will agree.\n  I want to say again to my fellow native West Virginian, thank you for \nthe chance to go ahead. Thank you most of all for the great job you are \ndoing here and for being here to tell us a little bit of the good \ncoming out of the Mountain State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                     West Virginia's 150th Birthday\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, this week the State of West Virginia \nwill celebrate the sesquicentennial of its birth--a brave and daring \ndeclaration of statehood that is unprecedented in American history.\n  West Virginia was born out of the fiery turmoil of the Civil War 150 \nyears ago. It was founded by true patriots who were willing to risk \ntheir lives and fortunes in a united pursuit of justice and freedom for \nall.\n  To West Virginians, the names of Pierpont, Willey, and Boreman are \nnearly as familiar as Washington, Jefferson, and Franklin. Each of \nthese men was a pivotal figure in our States's improbable journey to \nindependence from Virginia and to our very own place in the Union.\n  But, of course, our forefathers could not have brought forth a new \nState conceived of liberty without the hand of Abraham Lincoln. It was \nLincoln who issued the proclamation creating West Virginia and \nestablishing our State's birthday as June 20, 1863. And \ncharacteristically with few words, the 16th President dismissed the \narguments of the day that his proclamation was illegal. Lincoln wrote:\n\n       It is said that the admission of West Virginia is \n     secession, and tolerated only because it is our secession. \n     Well, if we call it by that name, there is a difference \n     between secession against the Constitution, and secession in \n     favor of the Constitution.\n\n  Indeed, the people of West Virginia had a choice of two different \nflags to follow during the Civil War. There was, as Francis Pierpont \npointed out, ``no neutral ground.'' The choice, he said, was ``to stand \nby and live under the Constitution'' or support ``the military \ndespotism'' of the Confederacy. We chose wisely. We chose the Stars and \nStripes. We chose allegiance to the country for which it stands. We \nchose to live under a constitution that promised the constant pursuit \nof ``a more perfect union'' of States. And ever since that historic \nbeginning, we the people of West Virginia have never failed to answer \nour country's call. No demand has been too great, no danger too \ndaunting, and no trial too threatening.\n  The abundant natural resources of our State and the hard work and \nsacrifice of our people have made America stronger and safer. We mined \nthe coal that fueled the Industrial Revolution. We powered the \nrailroads across the North American continent and still today produce \nelectricity for cities all across this country. We stoked the steel \nfactories that armed our soldiers for battles all across the globe and \nbuilt the warships that plowed the oceans of the world. And we have \nfilled the ranks of our military forces in numbers far greater than \nshould ever be expected of our little State.\n  Consider this: According to U.S. census data, West Virginia ranked \nfirst, second, or third in military casualty rates in every U.S. war of \nthe 20th century--twice that of New York's and Connecticut's in Vietnam \nand more than 2\\1/2\\ times the rates of those two States in Korea. \nToday 13.8 percent of West Virginia's population is made up of \nveterans--the seventh highest percentage among all States. That is \nhigher than the national average of 12.1 percent. That is higher than \nStates with much larger populations, States such as Florida, New York, \nTexas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, or Massachusetts. It is like I \nalways say: West Virginia is one of the most patriotic States in the \ncountry.\n  The best steel comes from the hottest fires. We have all been told \nthat. Well, the fires of the Civil War transformed West Virginia from a \nfragile hope to a well-tempered, steely reality, dedicated to the \nideals of the Declaration of Independence and guarantees of the U.S. \nConstitution. But West Virginia is great because our people are great--\nmountaineers who will always be free. We are tough, independent, \ninventive, and honest. Our character is shaped by the wilderness of our \nState, its rushing streams, its boundless blue skies, its divine \nforests, and its majestic mountains.\n  Our home is, in the words of the best-selling novelist James \nAlexander Thom, ``a place for health and high spirits, where one's \nfirst look out the cabin door every morning [makes] the heart swell \nup.'' Thom wrote of our magnetic land as it existed long before it \nachieved statehood, but his words ring just as true of today's West \nVirginia. They pay homage to a State of natural beauty, world-class \noutdoor recreation, year-round festivals, ancient crafts, rich culture, \nstrong tradition, industry, and trade. It is a place of coal mines and \ncard tables, racing horses and soaring eagles, Rocket Boys and right \nstuff test pilots, sparkling lakes and magical mountains, breathtaking \nbackcountry and barbecue\n\n[[Page S4568]]\n\njoints, golf and the Greenbrier, battlefields and big-time college \nfootball, college towns and small towns that are pure Americana. It is \na place of power, pulse, and passion. It is the special place we call \nWest Virginia, the special place we call home.\n  I admit we have had our ups and downs and setbacks and triumphs. We \nhave had some pretty famous family feuds--a few you might have heard \nof--and life can be tough sometimes. But the spirit of West Virginia \nhas never been broken, and it never will. I learned that a long time \nago growing up in a small coal-mining town of hard-working men and \nwomen called Farmington, WV. When things got tough, they got tougher.\n  It is as if we still hear the words of Francis Pierpont to the \ndelegates to the Second Wheeling Convention in 1861 as they debated \nwhether to secede from Virginia. Pierpont said:\n\n       We are passing through a period of gloom and darkness . . . \n     but we must not despair. There is a just God who rides upon \n     the whirlwind and directs the storm.\n\n  It is as if we still hear the words of President John F. Kennedy from \nthe rain-soaked steps of the State capitol in Charleston during our \nState's centennial celebration. President Kennedy said:\n\n       The sun does not always shine in West Virginia, but the \n     people always do.\n\n  We are West Virginians. Even in the darkness and the gloom, we look \nto a just God who directs the storm. We are West Virginians. We are the \n35th State of these United States. We are West Virginians, and like the \nbrave, loyal patriots who made West Virginia the 35th star on Old \nGlory, our love of God and country and family and State is unshakable, \nand that is well worth celebrating every year.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, that was \nwonderful. I am sorry more of us weren't hear to hear those words.\n  The Senator holds the seat once held for many, many year by Robert \nByrd, who until maybe this month was the longest serving person in the \nhistory of our country to serve in Congress. I think the record was \njust eclipsed by John Dingell from Michigan--a most worthy successor.\n  The Senator from West Virginia knows there is another notable West \nVirginian who is rising now to national prominence to serve our country \nas the new Director of the Office of Management and Budget. She grew up \nin Hinton, WV, graduated from Hinton High School, played on the girls \nbasketball team, and her name is Sylvia Mathews Burwell.\n  So West Virginia is a State that has produced certainly a lot of \ncoal, a lot of natural resources, but also a lot of good people and a \nlot of good leaders. And this Senator came to us from West Virginia \nhaving been a two-term Governor and chairman of the National Governors \nAssociation, and I know he is marked maybe for greatness--maybe for \ngreatness. And I think his wife has a birthday tomorrow; West Virginia \nhas a birthday the day after tomorrow.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Hers is the 20th also.\n  Mr. CARPER. The fact is that West Virginia sort of separated itself \nfrom Virginia, and about 237 years ago this past Saturday, the State of \nDelaware gave Pennsylvania its independence. It is quite common to talk \nabout what is Delaware and what is not Delaware--Pennsylvania and \nDelaware were joined at the hip--but as I said, on June 15, 1776, \nDelaware gave Pennsylvania its independence and also declared our \nindependence from the tyranny of the British throne. But here we are 5 \ndays later celebrating West Virginia giving Virginia its independence, \nand now they are on their own and making us all proud.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I know the Senator from Delaware was also, like myself, \nborn in West Virginia. And when we think about all the famous people \nwho have come from West Virginia, we think about the men with the right \nstuff--Charles Yeager, General Yeager, who broke the sound barrier in \n1947; we think about the Rocket Boys and the movie ``October Sky.'' We \nthink about the Hatfield and McCoy feud--a couple of feuds we have had \nand some might say are still going on; and we think about the logo for \nthe National Basketball Association. Jerry West is the person dribbling \nthe basketball. That is his picture. That is the logo. So we think \nabout so many contributions, but most important of all the people in \nWest Virginia and all over this great country have contributed to who \nwe are today, and I am a proud West Virginian through and through.\n  Mr. CARPER. If I could add, Madam President, every Sunday night I \nturn on the radio to WNCN to hear simulcast across the country West \nVirginia Mountain State--it is great music, eclectic music that is \nwonderful and reminds me of home.\n  I thank the Senator for enabling us to help him celebrate West \nVirginia's birthday as well.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise to discuss the report by the \nCongressional Budget Office that was just released. This is a long-\nawaited report, and we have all been waiting with bated breath to see \nwhat they would say. The report assesses the economic and fiscal impact \nof S. 744, the bipartisan immigration bill being debated here in the \nSenate. We are still digesting the report, but at first glance it \ncontains some very positive news for comprehensive immigration reform \non a number of fronts.\n  At the beginning of our bipartisan negotiations on this bill, we made \nan important promise: Our bill will not add to the deficit. CBO found \nthat we kept our promise--and then some. Let me review some of the top-\nline findings of the CBO report.\n  CBO found our bill decreases Federal budget deficits by $197 billion \nover the 2014-2023 period. CBO finds we achieve about $700 billion in \ndeficit reduction in the second decade of implementation, from 2024 to \n2033. So the first 10 years, our bill, according to CBO, decreases the \ndeficit by $175 billion and in the second 10 years by $700 billion.\n  The CBO also released an economic analysis that found the bill will \nincrease GDP by 3.3 percent in 2023, and between 5.1 percent and 5.7 \npercent in 2033.\n  The second-decade figure on deficit reduction is quite relevant and \nremarkable. Many of the bill's opponents were specifically urging the \nCBO to look at the second decade in hopes it would show major costs, \nbut CBO found just the opposite.\n  I cannot overstate the significance of these findings. Simply put, \nthis report is a huge momentum boost for immigration reform. It debunks \nthe idea that immigration reform is anything other than a boon to our \neconomy, and robs the bill's opponents of one of their last remaining \narguments.\n  The report proves once and for all that immigration reform is not \nonly right to do to stay true to our Nation's principles, it will also \nboost our economy, reduce the deficit, and create jobs. Immigration \nreform should be a priority of progressives and conservatives alike.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Rosoboronexport\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I come to the floor to say a few words \nabout Rosoboronexport, the Russian State arms dealer which has been \nsupplying the Syrian Government with deadly weapons and thereby \nfacilitating mass murder. Last November I sponsored an amendment to \nprohibit the use of taxpayer dollars in America to enter into contracts \nor agreements with Rosoboronexport. My amendment had strong bipartisan \nsupport, and it passed unanimously. Yet just yesterday, as President \nObama met with Russian leader Vladimir Putin at the G8 Summit in \nNorthern Ireland, we learned the Pentagon signed a brandnew $572 \nmillion contract with Rosoboronexport to buy MI-17 helicopters for the \nAfghan Army.\n\n[[Page S4569]]\n\n  How did the Obama administration get around the prohibition in my \namendment? They argued that the Rosoboronexport contract was in our \nnational security interests. In other words, they want us to believe we \nare promoting U.S. security by doing business with a Russian arms \ndealer who is helping an anti-American, terror-sponsoring dictatorship \ncommit mass atrocities. Unbelievable.\n  Last year the Pentagon agreed to audit the contract with \nRosoboronexport and make good-faith efforts to find other procurement \nsources for the Afghan military. Now they are refusing to complete that \naudit on the grounds that Rosoboronexport simply has refused to \ncooperate.\n  Meanwhile, my office has learned that Army officials within the Non-\nStandard Rotary Wing Aviation Division, whose primary focus is the Mi-\n17 program, are the subjects of an ongoing criminal investigation. \nThis, obviously, raises troubling questions about whether the terms of \nthe new Mi-17 procurement contract resulted from criminal misconduct.\n  I want to take this opportunity to say once again that American \ntaxpayers should not be indirectly subsidizing the murder of Syrian \ncivilians, especially when there are perfectly good alternatives to \ndealing with Rosoboronexport. If the Pentagon continues this \nrelationship, it will undermine American efforts to stand by the Syrian \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nperhaps up to 20 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Global Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am here again--I think it is the \n36th time--to speak as I do every week on global climate change, to \nremind us that it is time for us to wake up and to take action to \nprotect our communities. The risks that we ignore will not go away on \ntheir own. The longer we remain asleep, the greater the challenges we \nleave for our children and grandchildren. The changes we are already \nseeing--rising sea levels, floods, and erosion, more powerful storms--\nare taking their toll in particular on our aging infrastructure which I \nwould like to talk about today--our roads, our bridges, our sewers and \nwater pipes. This kind of infrastructure is designed to operate for 50 \nto 100 years and to withstand expected environmental conditions. So \nwhat happens if expected weather and climate patterns change? Well, \nthey are.\n\n  According to the Draft National Climate Assessment:\n\n       U.S. average temperature has increased by about 1.5 degrees \n     Fahrenheit since 1895; more than 80% of this increase has \n     occurred since 1980. The most recent decade was the nation's \n     hottest on record.\n\n  We are also getting more precipitation with more and more of our rain \ncoming in big, heavy downpours. Between 1958 and 2011, the amount of \nrain that fell during individual rainstorms increased in every region \nof the country--up to 45 percent in the Midwest and 74 percent in our \nnortheast.\n  Last month the Government Accountability Office issued a report \nrevealing the risks posed to U.S. infrastructure by climate change. The \nreport--which I requested, along with finance chairman Max Baucus--\nshows we can no longer use historical climate patterns to plan our \ninfrastructure projects.\n  First, limited resources often must be focused on short-term \npriorities. Fixing an unexpected water main break, for example, won't \nusually allow for upgrades to account for climate change. And long-term \nprojects that do include climate change safeguards usually require more \nmoney upfront. That is GAO's warning.\n  GAO also found that local decisionmakers--folks in our home \ncommunities--need more and better climate information. The faster \nsomeone drives, the better their headlights need to be, and carbon \npollution is accelerating changes to our climate and weather. Our \ncommunities need the information--the headlights--to see these oncoming \nchanges, and it needs to be local.\n  When a bridge is constructed in Cape Hatteras, it is more helpful to \nknow how climate change will affect North Carolina than North America. \nThankfully, leaders across the country are waking up to the reality of \nclimate change and are making evidence-based, not ideological, \ndecisions about how to best serve their communities.\n  This is the Interstate 10 twin span bridge that crosses Lake \nPontchartrain near New Orleans. During Hurricane Katrina, the storm \nsurge rocked the bridge's 255-ton concrete bridge spans off of their \npiers, twisting many, and toppling others into the lake. Hurricane \nKatrina brought the largest storm surge on record for Lake \nPontchartrain. Scientists tell us that climate change loads the dice \nfor these stronger and more frequent storms. So the recovery design \nteam decided to strengthen and raise this bridge. They made a larger \ninitial investment in order to reduce maintenance costs in the future. \nThat is smart planning.\n  In 2012, Hurricane Isaac was the first major test for the new bridge, \nand it passed. The damage was limited to road signs and electrical \ncomponents. This is the new higher bridge over here and that is the old \nbridge down on the left there.\n  To the south, Louisiana State Highway 1 is the only access road to \nPort Fourchon. Senator Vitter, who is from Louisiana and our ranking \nmember on the Environment and Public Works Committee, has told us that \n18 percent of the Nation's oil supply passes through Port Fourchon. It \nis a pretty important port, and Highway 1--the only access road to it--\nis closed on average 3\\1/2\\ days a year due to flooding, according to \nGAO. NOAA scientists project that within 15 years portions of Louisiana \nHighway 1 will flood an average of 30 times each year. State and local \nofficials raised 11 miles of Highway 1 by more than 22 feet. So when \nHurricane Isaac brought a 6\\1/2\\ foot storm surge up the gulf, those \nraised portions were unaffected.\n  Up north in Milwaukee, WI, the metropolitan sewerage district spent \n$3 billion in 1993 to increase the capacity of its sewer system based \non historical rainfall records dating back to the 1960s. But extreme \nrainstorms in the Midwest have changed drastically. Milwaukee \nexperienced a 100-year storm 3 years in a row. Milwaukee experienced \n100-year storms in 2008, again in 2009, and again in 2010. The \nUniversity of Wisconsin projects these storms will be even more common \nin the future, so Milwaukee took steps to improve the ability of nearby \nnatural areas like wetlands to absorb the extra runoff from rainstorms. \nThis eased the pressure on the city's wastewater system.\n  The GAO infrastructure report also found that areas recently hit by a \nnatural disaster tend to get proactive about adaptation. I think it is \neasy to see how getting clobbered by a hurricane will help people to \nrethink their emergency preparedness. But waiting for disaster is not \nrisk management, and we can and must do better.\n  In my home State of Rhode Island, local leaders are wide awake to \nclimate change. For instance, North Kingstown is a municipality with \nplanners who have taken the best elevation data available and modeled \nexpected sea-level rise as well as sea-level rise plus 3 feet of storm \nsurge. By combining these with the models and maps that show the roads, \nemergency routes, water treatment plants, and estuaries, the town can \nbetter plan its transportation, conservation, and relocation projects.\n  Last week, North Kingstown's efforts were recognized by a grant from \nthe EPA and will be a model for communities throughout the country.\n  Other coastal States face many of the same risks we are facing in \nRhode Island--none more than Florida. A study of sea-level rise on U.S. \ncoasts found that in Florida more than 1.5 million residents and almost \n900,000 homes would be affected by 3 feet of sea-level rise. Both \nnumbers, 1.5 million residents and almost 900,000 homes, are almost \ndouble any other State in the Nation.\n\n[[Page S4570]]\n\n  These maps show what 3 feet of sea-level rise means for Miami-Dade \nCounty in southeastern Florida. The map on the left shows the current \nelevation in southern Miami-Dade compared to 3 feet of sea-level rise \nshown here on the right. The blue regions, which are green here, are \nthe regions that have gone underwater with 3 feet of sea-level rise. \nThey would lose acres and acres of land. This nuclear power station and \nthis wastewater treatment plant are virtually cut off from dry land.\n  And the flooding won't just be along the coast; low-lying inland \nareas are also at risk. That is because in Florida, particularly in the \nMiami metropolitan area, the buildings are built on limestone. Florida \nstands on a limestone geological base, and limestone is porous. Up in \nNew England, we can build levees and other structures to hold the water \nback. In Miami, they would be building those structures on a geological \nsponge. The water will seep under and through the porous limestone.\n\n  Rising seas don't just threaten southern Florida. According to the \nAmerican Security Project, Eglin Air Force Base on the Florida \npanhandle coast, which is the largest Air Force base in the world, is \none of the five most vulnerable U.S. military installations because of \nits vulnerability to storm surges, sea-level rise, and saltwater \nintrusion.\n  Responsible Floridians looking at these projections have decided to \ntake action. Four counties in Florida--Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, Broward, \nand Monroe--have formed the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change \nCompact. Using the best available science, they have assessed the \nvulnerability of south Florida's communities to sea-level rise. In \ntheir four counties in Florida alone, a 1-foot rise in sea level would \nendanger approximately $4 billion in property--just in those four \ncounties. A 3-foot sea-level rise would endanger approximately $31 \nbillion in property.\n  In Monroe County, 3 of the 4 hospitals, two-thirds of the schools, \nand 71 percent of emergency shelters are in danger by a 1-foot rise. \nThat is a lot of infrastructure at risk.\n  Together, these Florida counties, which are led both by Republicans \nand Democrats--this is a bipartisan county effort in Florida--have \nadopted a plan to mitigate property loss, make infrastructure more \nresilient, and protect those essential community structures such as \nhospitals, schools, and emergency shelters.\n  This past October, those member counties signed a 5-year plan with \n110 different action items, including efforts to make infrastructure \nmore resilient, reduce the threats to vital ecosystems, help farmers \nadapt, increase renewable energy capacity, and educate their public \nabout the threat of climate to Florida. Looking at all of those risks \nto Florida and looking at the bipartisan action taken by those county \nleaders in Florida, I have to ask: If you are a Member of Congress from \nFlorida, how can you credibly deny climate change?\n  Studies show about 95 percent of climate scientists think climate \nchange is really happening and humans really are contributing to it. \nAbout 5 percent disagree or aren't so sure. Can Floridians here in \nCongress really take the 5-percent bet? Does that seem smart, cautious, \nprudent, and responsible? This is the only Florida we have, and the \nSunshine State is ground zero for sea-level rise. It is long past time \nfor us to act on climate change, but it is not too late to be ready and \nit is not too late to be smart in Florida and elsewhere. In Florida, \nand in other States, infrastructure has to be designed for and adapted \nto the climate changes we can foresee.\n  I thank the Government Accountability Office for this report. Nature \ncould not be giving us clearer warnings. Whatever higher power gave us \nour advanced human capacity for perception, calculation, analysis, \ndeduction, and foresight has laid out before us more than enough \ninformation for us to make the right decisions. Fortunately, these \nhuman capacities provide us everything we need to act responsibly on \nthis information if only we will awaken.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1255\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise this evening to discuss an \namendment I have filed to the immigration bill. It is Senate amendment \nNo. 1255. It would ensure that the funding for an important border \nsecurity program known as Operation Stonegarden continues to be \nallocated by the Department of Homeland Security based on risk. Without \nmy amendment, 90 percent of the $50 million in funding for this program \nawarded annually would be earmarked for the southwest border. What I am \nproposing is that we not put a percentage in the bill but, rather, \nallow for a risk-based assessment of where Operation Stonegarden monies \nwould best be spent. This program has been extraordinarily successful \nin my State of Maine. It has helped Federal, county, State, and local \nlaw enforcement to pool their resources and work together to help \nsecure our border.\n  While the southwest border is much more likely to make the evening \nnews, we must not forget about our northern border. As the Department \nof Homeland Security pointed out when it released its first northern \nborder strategy in June 2012: ``The U.S.-Canadian border is the longest \ncommon border in the world'' and it presents ``unique security \nchallenges based on geography, weather, and the immense volume of trade \nand travel.''\n  According to a report released by the GAO in 2010, the Border Patrol \nhad situational awareness of only 25 percent of the 4,000-mile northern \nborder and operational control of only 32 miles--less than 1 percent. \nWe will hear those terms discussed a lot during the debate on \nimmigration with respect to the southwest border. I think it is \nimportant that we not forget we also have a 4,000-mile northern border.\n  This lack of situational awareness and operational control is \nespecially troubling because as GAO has observed: ``DHS reports that \nthe terrorist threat on the northern border is actually higher [than \nthe southern border], given the large expansive area with very limited \nlaw enforcement coverage.''\n  In the same report, GAO noted that the maritime border on the Great \nLakes and rivers is vulnerable to use by small vessels as a conduit for \nthe potential smuggling and exploitation by terrorists, alien \nsmuggling, trafficking of illicit drugs, and other contraband and \ncriminal activity. Also, the northern border's waterways frequently \nfreeze during the winter and can be easily crossed by foot, vehicle, or \nsnowmobile. The northern air border is also vulnerable to low-flying \naircraft that, for example, smuggle drugs by entering U.S. airspace \nfrom Canada.\n  Additionally, Customs and Border Protection reports that further \nthreats result from the fact that the northern border is exploited by \nwell-organized smuggling operations which can potentially also support \nthe movement of terrorists and their weapons.\n  There is also, regrettably, significant criminal activity on the \nnorthern border. In the same report, GAO noted that in fiscal year 2010 \nDHS has reported spending nearly $3 billion in its efforts to interdict \nand investigate illegal northern border activity, annually making \napproximately 6,000 arrests and interdicting approximately 40,000 \npounds of illegal drugs at and between the northern border ports of \nentry.\n  The Operation Stonegarden grant program is an effective resource for \naddressing security concerns on our northern, southern, western, and \ncoastal borders. Over the past 4 years, approximately $247 million in \nOperation Stonegarden funds has been allocated to 19 border States \nusing a risk-based analysis for determining the allocations rather than \nthe formula-based analysis that is included in this immigration bill.\n  Earmarking 90 percent of funding from Operation Stonegarden to the \nsouthwest border is ill-advised. Operation Stonegarden grants should be \nused to help secure our northern, southern, and coastal borders by \nfunding joint operations between the Border Patrol and State, county, \nand local\n\n[[Page S4571]]\n\nlaw enforcement. These joint operations can act as a force multiplier \nin areas that would otherwise be unguarded altogether.\n  My amendment would ensure that DHS continues to have the flexibility \nit needs to make risk-informed decisions about where Operation \nStonegarden funds will best serve the security of our Nation's borders.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I hope it will be \nbrought up at some point tomorrow.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \namendments be in order to be called up and that they not be subject to \nmodification or division, with the exception of the technical \nmodifications to the Merkley and Paul amendments contained in this \nagreement: Manchin No. 1268; Pryor No. 1298; Merkley No. 1237, as \nmodified with the changes at the desk; Boxer No. 1240; Reed No. 1224; \nCornyn No. 1251; Lee No. 1208; Paul No. 1200, as modified with the \nchanges at the desk; Heller No. 1227; and Cruz No. 1320; finally, that \nno second-degree amendments be in order to any of these amendments \nprior to votes in relation to the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we now have these amendments in order and \nwe will work with all the parties to see if we can have some way of \nproceeding to set up votes. I would hope we can work something out so \nwe do not have to do procedural things to try to get rid of them. We \nare going to do our utmost. I appreciate everyone's cooperation getting \nthis long list of amendments so we can start voting on them.\n  I think it would be a pretty fair assumption that we are not going to \nhave any votes tonight on these amendments. We will work something out \ntomorrow. It is about 7 o'clock and we still have a little more work to \ndo on other issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                       Luis Restrepo Confirmation\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise this evening to make some brief \ncomments regarding a judicial nominee we voted on yesterday--one of \ntwo--Judge Luis Restrepo from Philadelphia, from the southeastern \ncorner of Pennsylvania.\n  I rise tonight because my train was late last night so I was not able \nto make some comments about his nomination, his qualifications, prior \nto the vote. But I was honored that he received the vote of the Senate \nlast night.\n  I also rise because it is timely in another way because we are \nconsidering immigration reform. I was on the floor last week talking \nabout yet another judicial nominee from Pennsylvania--now a judge, as \nof last week. Judge Nitza Quinones, who is a native of Puerto Rico, \ncame to this country after her education and became a lawyer and an \nadvocate, and then, ultimately, a judge for more than two decades now, \nand now will serve on the Federal District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania.\n  So it is true of now Judge Restrepo. A native of Colombia, Judge \nRestrepo became a U.S. citizen in 1993. He earned a bachelor of arts \ndegree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1981 and a juris doctor \ndegree from Tulane University's School of Law in 1986.\n  He is highly regarded by lawyers and members of the bench. He \nexhibits an extraordinary command of the law and legal principles, as \nwell as a sense of fairness, sound judgment, and integrity.\n  Judge Restrepo has served as a magistrate judge for the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania since June of 2006.\n  Prior to his judicial appointment, he was a highly regarded lawyer \nand a founding member of the Kreasner & Restrepo firm in Philadelphia, \nconcentrating on both civil rights litigation as well as criminal \ndefense work.\n  He served as an assistant Federal defender with the Community Federal \nDefender for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania from 1990 to 1993, \nand as an assistant defender at the Defender Association of \nPhiladelphia from 1987 to 1990.\n  An adjunct professor at Temple University's James E. Bensley School \nof Law, he was also an adjunct professor at the University of \nPennsylvania School of Law from 1997 to 2009 and has taught with the \nNational Institute for Trial Advocacy in regional and national programs \nsince 1992.\n  I know the Presiding Officer knows something about being a law \nprofessor and the demands of that job and the demands of being an \nadvocate.\n  I think anyone who looks at Judge Restrepo's biography and background \nwould agree he is more than prepared to be a Federal district judge, \nand I am grateful that the Senate confirmed him.\n  Finally, Judge Restrepo has also served on the board of governors of \nthe Philadelphia Bar Association and is a past president of the \nHispanic Bar Association of Pennsylvania.\n  So for all those reasons and more, I believe he is not only ready to \nbe a Federal judge, but I am also here to express gratitude for his \nconfirmation and for the vote in the Senate.\n  As we consider immigration reform, we should be ever inspired by the \nstories we hear from not only judges who are nominated and confirmed \nhere, but others as well who come to this country, who work hard, who \nlearn a lot, and want to give back to their country by way of public \nservice. Judge Restrepo, this week, and Judge Quinones, last week, are \ntwo fine examples of that.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the prime sponsor, I suppose, of the \nimmigration bill before us--this 1,000-page document--Senator Schumer, \nannounced earlier today, based on the Congressional Budget Office \nreport, that lower deficits were promised, and that the bill, indeed, \nproduces lower deficits. I do not believe that is an accurate \nstatement, and I will share with you some of my concerns about that.\n  We have been through this before, where the budget numbers, in \nreality, have been utilized in a way that is not healthy, and it \ncreates a false impression of what is occurring here.\n  Secondly, I do not know that he talked about this--I doubt he did--\nthe CBO report is explicit. Under this legislation, if it were to pass, \nthe wages of American workers will fall for the next 12 years. They \nwill be lower than the inflation rate. They will decline from the \npresent unacceptably low rate, and continue to decline for 12 years, \naccording to this report. That alone should cause us to defeat this \nbill.\n  We have been told it is going to create prosperity and growth, but \nwhat it is going to produce is more unemployment, as this report \nexplicitly states. It is going to produce lower wages for Americans, as \nthis report explicitly states. And it is going to increase the deficit.\n  So I think we need to have an understanding here that something very \nserious is afoot: to suggest that you can bring in millions of new \nworkers to take jobs in the United States at a time of record \nunemployment and that will not impact wages, that will not make \nunemployment go up, goes beyond all common sense.\n  Dr. Borjas at Harvard has absolutely proven through peer-reviewed \nresearch that that is exactly what is going to happen. Wages go down, \nas they have been going down, and unemployment will go up. So this \nreport confirms that.\n  I will read some of the things that are in it.\n  I am on page 7 of ``The Economic Impact of S. 744, the Border \nSecurity, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act.''\n\n       S. 744 would allow significantly more workers with low \n     skills and with high skills to enter the United States--. . . \n     .\n\n  No doubt about that. They say it is a move to merit-based \nimmigration. But it is not a move to merit-based immigration. It \nincreases low-skill workers substantially, as well as increasing other \nworkers.\n\n\n[[Page S4572]]\n\n\n       Taking into account all of those flows of new immigrants, \n     CBO and JCT [Joint Tax] expect that a greater number of \n     immigrants with lower skills than with higher skills would be \n     added to the workforce. . . .\n\n  In other words, another group coming in, more lower skilled than \nhigher skilled, just as I indicated and other commentators have \nindicated previously.\n  The report said this:\n\n       Slightly pushing down the average wage of the labor force \n     as a whole.\n       Pushing down the wage of the labor force as a whole. But \n     they go on to say this. Get this. The next sentence:\n       However, CBO and Joint Tax expect that currently \n     unauthorized workers----\n\n  Illegal workers, in other words----\n\n     who attain legal status under 744 will see an increase in \n     their wages.\n\n  So I think this underestimates, if you read the report carefully, the \nadverse impact that the flow of workers will have on the wages of \nAmerican workers and lawful immigrants who are here today. But at any \nrate, it is clear that is so.\n  It goes on to say this, dramatically, I suggest:\n\n       The average wage would be lower than under current law over \n     the first dozen years. CBO estimates that it would increase \n     unemployment for at least 7 years.\n\n  So this is supposed to be good for the people we represent? Of \ncourse, I would like to ask our colleagues to think carefully about our \nduty. Who is it we represent in this body? What kind of \nresponsibilities do we have to decent, hard-working Americans who \nexperts have told us have seen their wages decline every year, \nvirtually, since 1999.\n  Wages have declined by as much as 8 percent since 2009 for a number \nof reasons. One of the reasons, according to Professor Borjas, is that \nimmigration is already pulling down wages by as much as 40 percent. So \nthis will add to the problem.\n  This report said, quite clearly, unequivocally, it is going to \nincrease unemployment, and it is going to pull down wages. That is \nexactly the wrong thing that ought to be happening at this time. How in \nthe world can we justify passing a bill that hammers the American \nworking man and woman who is out trying to feed a family, get a job, \nthat has a little retirement, a little health care, some money to be \nable to take care of the family, and hammer them with additional \nadverse economic impacts?\n  I suggest to you this is not a report that in any way justifies \nadvancing this legislation. Let me just take a moment. I wrestle with \nthese numbers. I see the Presiding Officer who is on the Budget \nCommittee understands these numbers. They say it pays down the deficit. \nLet me show you what it really says. This is the way they double \ncounted the money to justify ObamaCare.\n  Basically, they created, through cuts in Medicare, savings and they \nlengthened the life of Medicare, but they claim they used that same \nmoney to fund ObamaCare. At one point, Mr. Elmendorf, the Director of \nthe Office of Management and Budget, who wrote this said it was double \ncounting the money. You cannot use the same money to fund ObamaCare and \nuse that same money to strengthen Medicare. How simple is that?\n  We are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars in double \ncounting of the money. That is what is happening in here. Look at this \nreport. Impact on the deficit over the 10-year period, 2014 to 2023, \nthe budget deficit would increase by $14.2 billion. The debt would \nincrease by $14.2 billion. But then they say the off-budget money would \ndecrease the deficit by $211 billion.\n  My colleague, Senator Schumer, said this is all great. We have a big \nsurplus now. We have $200 billion in the off-budget account. But what \nis that money?\n  What is that money? That is the payroll taxes. That is your Social \nSecurity payment and your Medicare payment. When more of the illegal \naliens come in and get a Social Security number and pay Social Security \nand Medicare, the money comes into the government. All right? But is it \nfree to be spent on bridges and roads and aircraft and salaries for \nCongressmen and Senators? No.\n  This is money that is dedicated to Social Security and Medicare. This \nis the trust fund money that goes to Social Security and Medicare. Yes, \nwhen people are legalized, they will pay more Social Security and \nMedicare taxes on their payroll, but it is going to that fund to pay \nfor their retirement and their health care when they retire. You cannot \nuse that money. You cannot spend the money today and pretend it is \ngoing to be there to pay for their retirement when they retire.\n  They are going to pay into Medicare. They are going to pay into \nSocial Security. They are going to draw out Social Security and \nMedicare when they reach the right age. What we know is, as Mr. \nElmendorf indicates, as I have said repeatedly, most of these \nindividuals are lower income, lower skilled workers. Therefore, what we \nknow is in that regard, the lower skilled workers who pay into Social \nSecurity and Medicare take out more than they pay in. So this is not \ngoing to be positive, it seems to me, particularly when you account for \nthe fact that a lot of people have scored this, but they have not \nscored it from the fact that most of the workers who will be paying \nMedicare and Social Security are lower income workers and they will be \npaying the lower rates. Not a huge difference, but it is a difference.\n  So I would contend, I think, without fear of serious contradiction, \nalthough I expect political contradiction, that the off-budget money is \nyour Medicare and Social Security money. See, you paid into that. The \ngovernment, if it takes and spends it, does not have anything now to \npay your Social Security and your Medicare benefits when you get old. \nWe know it is already actuarially unsound. Those programs are in danger \nof defaulting a lot sooner than a lot of people think. We need to be \nsaving these programs, not weakening them.\n\n  So in the short run you get this bubble effect. You get an extra \ngroup of money. Since a lot of the workers are younger, it will look \ngood on the budget for 10 years. It looks good on the budget for 10 \nyears, but this is not money to be spent by the government. This is \nmoney that is dedicated to their retirement and will be drawn out by \nthese individuals when they go into retirement.\n  So I would suggest that this 10-year score, 2014 through 2023, shows \nthat the real impact is a $14.2 billion dollar reduction--increase in \nthe deficit of the United States over 10 years in the general fund \naccount. The off-budget section says it reduces the deficit by $200 \nbillion. But that money is utilized--it has to be in the trust fund to \nbe utilized for future payments to these individuals when they retire. \nIt is not money we can account for.\n  The mixing of these two matters is one of the most dramatic ways this \ncountry has gotten itself into an unsound financial course. We have \ndouble counted this money repeatedly. We have money coming in to Social \nSecurity and Medicare and we spend it immediately. We pretend it is \nstill there to pay for someone's retirement. This is going to be the \nsame except it is guaranteed to be a financial loser over the long run.\n  Again, I know Senator Sanders has talked about this, my colleague \nfrom Vermont. In a free market world, when you bring in more labor, the \nwages go down. I think CBO is probably underestimating this, frankly. \nProfessor Borjas at Harvard, his numbers look more grim than these. But \nthis is what they came up with. They have been trying to do guesswork \nand tell the truth the best they can, but they are getting a lot of \npressure from the other side.\n  A lot of Members here seem to think we can just bring in millions of \npeople and those millions of people will somehow create more revenue. \nWe are going to be like Jack Kemp. You know, everything is wonderful. \nIt is just going to grow. But we have to be prudent. We have to be \nresponsible. What we know is that since at least 1999, the wages of \naverage American people have not kept up with inflation. That means \nthose wages are on a net serious decline.\n  Professor Borjas says it declined by 8 percent. That is very real. My \nDemocratic colleagues used to be very critical when it was President \nBush because it was all his fault that wages were not keeping up with \ninflation, people were being hurt. So now they do not talk about that \nanymore. If they do, they blame it on President Bush even though he has \nbeen gone 5 or 6 years.\n  The reality is, I came to believe there is truth to this. It is not \njust a temporary cyclical thing that workers'\n\n[[Page S4573]]\n\nwages have not been keeping up. I think it is something deeper than \nthat. I think it is several things. Businesses are getting very intent \non reducing the number of employees they have to produce certain \nproducts and widgets. They are getting far more efficient. So we are \nmaking more widgets with less people.\n  If you go into plants like I do, you see these incredible robotics \nwhere you get dramatic improvements of productivity for widgets with \nless people. This creates, in some ways, unemployment.\n  Last month we had a moderate increase in jobs in May, but there was \nan 8,000-job reduction in manufacturing. The increase was in service \nindustries like restaurants and bars and that kind of thing. The \nincrease was also temporary. So this is not healthy. You have this \nunhealthy trend out there when you bring in large amounts of labor, a \nmajority of which the CBO says is low skilled, and you are hammering \nthe American worker.\n  Further, Peter Kirsanow, one of the outstanding members of the U.S. \nCommission on Civil Rights, along with Abigail Thernstrom, a brilliant \nlady who has written on these matters over the years, they wrote a \nletter recently that warned that passage of this bill will harm poor \npeople in America, particularly African Americans.\n  They said they had hearings on this matter. They have had the best \neconomists come and testify. They studied those reports. They say not a \nsingle one of the economists they dealt with denied that the wages \nwould be pulled down or unemployment would go up.\n  That is what CBO told us today: Unemployment will go up, wages will \ngo down. We have good Republican colleagues and they cannot conceive \nthat we are in such a circumstance. They just believe growth is always \ngood, and if you bring in more people you will have more growth. That \nis correct.\n  Let me tell you the brutal truth based on the in-depth analysis by \nProfessor Borjas at Harvard. He says the prosperity, the growth enures \nto the benefit of the manufacturers, of the employers who use a lot of \nlow-skilled labor. Their income will go up, but the average wage of the \naverage working person will go down. That is what large flows of \nimmigration will do when there is high unemployment.\n  Peter Kirsanow, a member of the Civil Rights Commission, in his \nletter, said that it is absolutely false that we have a shortage of \nlow-skilled labor. He says we have a glut of low-skilled labor. The \nfacts show that.\n  The number of people employed in the workforce today has reached the \nlevel of the 1970s. That was before women were going into the \nworkplace. As a percentage of the American population, the percentage \nof people who actually have a job today has been falling steadily, and \nit has now hit the level of the 1970s. Now they are going to bring in \nall these masters of the universe, these geniuses who have this plan \nthat somehow is going to fix everything. We will just bring in more \npeople.\n  We had a Senator today say that it is going to increase wages. How \ncan that be? What economic study shows that? Not any, to my knowledge. \nCBO says--wages are going to fall. Unemployment is going to go up, and \nit is not going to fix our deficit either.\n  I feel very strongly that we have to put on a realistic hat. We are \ngoing to have to ask ourselves: Whom do we represent? Are we \nrepresenting a political idea that is going to bring in more votes? Are \nwe representing people who entered the country illegally? Are those our \nfirst priority? Do we have any obligation to the people who fight our \nwars, raise our next generation of children, try to do the right thing, \npay their taxes, want to be able to have a decent job, a decent \nretirement plan, have a vacation every now and then, and have a health \ncare plan they can afford? Don't we owe them that? Shouldn't that be \nour primary responsibility right now? I think it is. I think that is \nour primary responsibility.\n  One says: Well, don't you care about people who are here illegally?\n  I say: Yes, I care about them. I care about them deeply.\n  I think we can work on this situation to not be in a position to say \nwe are going to deport all of those who are here illegally. We can \ntreat people compassionately. We are going to do the right thing about \nthat.\n  In the future, should we have a work flow every year in that doubles \nthe amount of guest workers who come in for the sole purpose of working \nand not becoming an immigrant, and should we increase the annual legal \nflow of immigrants from 1 million a year to 1.5 million a year, \nincreasing it 50 percent? Is that what good legislation would do? I \nmean, how did this happen?\n  Thomas Sowell, a Hoover Institution scholar and economist at Stanford \nUniversity, says there are three interests out here. One is the \nimmigrants. They win. This report says their salaries go up. The other \none is the politicians. They have it all figured out. They have written \na bill that they think serves their political interests. The question \nis, Who is representing the national interests? Who is representing the \nAmerican people's interests? Were they in these rooms when the chamber \nof commerce was there, La Raza was there, the business groups, \nagricultural groups, the labor unions and Mr. Trumka were there \ndividing up the pie, making sure their interests were protected? Who \nwas defending the interests of the dutiful worker who is out trying to \nfind a job today?\n  There was a report in the New York Times last week about an event in \nQueens. Apparently, there was a group of jobs that were going to be \noffered as elevator repair personnel in New York. The line started \nforming 5 days in advance. People brought their tents, they brought \ntheir food, they brought their sleeping bags, and they waited in line \nfor days to be able to get a job as an elevator repair person. We have \npeople saying these are jobs Americans won't do. That Americans won't \nwork, and that's why we need more labor.\n  Well, I always cut my own grass when I am home, but I am up here a \nlot, so there is a group that comes and cuts my grass in Mobile. These \nwere two African-American gentlemen in their 40's. They came out, did a \ngreat job in the heat in Alabama, and took care of my yard.\n  What is this--jobs Americans won't do? They want a job that has a \nretirement plan. They want a job that has some permanency to it. They \nwant a job that has a decent wage. Americans will work, and all hard \nwork should be honored.\n  I will acknowledge that in seasonal work, temporary work, certain \ncircumstances, we could develop a good migrant guest worker program \nthat could serve this. Maybe in different times, if unemployment is \nlow, we could justify bringing in even more workers than you would \nexpect. But at a time of high unemployment, we have low participation \nin the workforce, and we ought to be careful about bringing in large \namounts of labor that pleases rich businesses and manufacturing and \nagribusiness groups but doesn't necessarily protect the honest, decent, \nlegitimate interests of American workers. I think they are being \nforgotten too often in this process.\n  I wanted to push back to that. This report might look like it's \nsaying that we are creating a service and we are reducing the debt. In \none sense, on the on-budget analysis, the way we do our accounting \naround here, that impression is certainly created. It is a false \nimpression, and it is that false understanding of the reality of the \non-budget and off-budget accounting of revenue to America that has \ngotten us fundamentally in the problem we are now facing.\n  Again, I repeat, the on-budget deficit, according to the CBO report, \ngoes up over 10 years by $14 billion. It claims, though, that the \ndeficit drops on the off-budget. Remember, that money is obligated. \nThat is your withholding. That is your FICA. That is your Social \nSecurity, Medicare--withholdings on your paycheck. It goes up there, \nand it has been set aside for you, for your retirement, for your \nmedical care when you are elderly. It is not available for us to spend \ntoday willy-nilly.\n  And we think we have now created a circumstance where billions of \ndollars are being double-counted. Can you imagine that? That is what we \nare doing in this country. We are counting trillions of dollars--really \ndouble-counting it. Money that comes in we count in a unified budget as \nincome to the budget, but it is dedicated income. We owe the people who \npaid it into their Social Security check, their Medicare coverage. It \nis owed to them.\n  What we know is that when you have particularly lower--well, the \nwhole\n\n[[Page S4574]]\n\nprogram is unsustainable, but particularly the lower income workers pay \nin less than they will eventually take out over a lifetime. Adding all \nof these workers into the Social Security and Medicare system, where \nthey pay in, will not place us on a sound path.\n  Again, we need to be honest about where we are. The numbers do not \nlook good. This Congress needs to wrestle with how to deal \ncompassionately with the people who have been here a long time. We need \nto do it in a right way, but we have a responsibility, a financial duty \nto the people who sent us here to manage their money wisely and not \nmake our financial situation worse than it is today. We have an \nobligation to try to figure out a way to reverse the steady, long-term \ntrend of wage decline for millions of American workers. It needs to be \ngetting better. What this report says is that if this bill is passed, \nthis immigration bill is passed, it will make the long-term wage \nsituation of Americans worse. How wrong a direction could that be?\n  Look, if we let the labor market get a little tighter, we are going \nto find businesses that are willing to pay more to get a good worker. \nThat is the free market. These business guys don't mind trying--Walmart \nseeks the very lowest priced product it can get, whether it is China or \nthe United States. They are ruthless about it. It is free market, we \nsay. We value it. OK, we support free market. But if there is a labor \nshortage, why shouldn't the laboring man be able to get a little higher \nwage for a change around here? This large flow of immigration will \nimpact, adversely, their ability to find a job--unemployment will go \nup, according to the report--and we'll get a decrease in wages.\n  I yield the floor.\n Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, today I would like to indicate \nsupport for two amendments I cosponsored and were introduced by Senator \nThune and Senator Vitter.\n  The first is amendment No. 1197 introduced by Senator Thune. Border \nsecurity should be the number one priority in any immigration \ndiscussion, and building this fence which is already required by law \nwill help in that endeavor.\n  The second is Amendment No. 1228 introduced by Senator Vitter. This \nrequires that the biometric border check-in and check-out system be \nfully implemented prior to any legal status being granted to an illegal \nalien. Our national and economic security depends on us knowing who is \nin our country, and this amendment will help achieve that goal.\n  While I strongly disagree with granting amnesty to those who broke \nthe law, on the chance that this bill passes I want to make sure that \namendments like the two of these are included in the final \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/18/senate-section/article/S4574-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. KAINE.

Madam President, I rise today to honor and pay tribute \nto a selfless Kentuckian, Mr. Arnold Lee Watson of Letcher County, KY. \nWatson voluntarily devotes his time and skills to raise money for the \nVeterans Program Trust Fund.\n  Mr. Watson is the father-in-law of Letcher County Clerk Winston \nMeade. Together they have created a service that is becoming popular \namong many Kentucky counties. As license plates are dropped off in the \nLetcher County office, Watson turns the old plates into pieces of art. \nMeade and Watson build and sell license plate birdhouses statewide in \nan effort to raise money for veterans' homes in eastern, central, and \nwestern Kentucky.\n  Meade first saw these birdhouses after he purchased two at a meeting \nwith the Kentucky County Clerks Association. Mr. Watson is retired and \nsaw that he could spend time making birdhouses to raise money for \nH.A.V.E, or Help A Veteran Everyday. His interest in helping veterans \nis inspired by his brothers, all who have served our country.\n  Help a Veteran Everyday, or H.A.V.E, is a program that was adopted in \n2005 by the County Clerks of Kentucky. Across the Commonwealth, \ncounties are taking actions to collect donations for the organization \nwhich helps ensure that Kentucky's 339,000 veterans are provided for.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from a local publication \nextolling the work of Mr. Watson be printed in the Record. Since this \narticle was published, Watson has built more than 7,000 birdhouses and \nraised $140,000 in proceeds for Kentucky veterans. In addition, he \nplaced third in an arts-and-crafts competition at the Kentucky State \nFair in 2010.\n  Mr. Arnold Lee Watson's dedication and hard work not only helped \nLetcher County raise the most funds across the State, but also provided \nKentucky veterans with the support and benefits they deserve.\n  ``He loves working on them,'' Meade said of Watson in regard to \nbuilding the license plate birdhouses.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Mountain Eagle, Jan. 21, 2009]\n\n                      Turning Old Plates into $$$\n\n                            (By Sally Barto)\n\n       If old newspapers can be used to line birdcages, then old \n     license plates can be used to build birdhouses--about five a \n     day, in the case of one Letcher County man.\n       Arnold Lee Watson has been building birdhouses using old \n     license plates as a roof, then selling them to raise money \n     for the Veterans Program Trust Fund on behalf of the Letcher \n     County Clerk's Office.\n       Watson, of McRoberts, is the father in-law of Letcher \n     County Clerk Winston Meade. He decided to begin building the \n     unique and colorful birdhouses after Meade attended a meeting \n     of the Kentucky County Clerks Association and brought home \n     two similar birdhouses that were made elsewhere.\n       Watson has made about 50 birdhouses so far and the clerk's \n     office has sold 19, with proceeds going to the Help a Veteran \n     Everyday, or H.A.V.E. program.\n       Meade said Watson, who has three brothers who are veterans, \n     donates the materials and time used to make the birdhouses.\n       ``He wanted to do something to help veterans and this is \n     his way to help,'' said Meade.\n       The birdhouses, which are being sold for $20 each, are made \n     to resemble a mailbox and have a painted wooden base with an \n     old license plate draped over the top.\n       Depending on the specialty license plates obtained by \n     Meade, the roofs of the birdhouses have different themes \n     including nature, colleges, and volunteer fire fighting. \n     Meade said the most popular style of birdhouse is made using \n     an old University of Kentucky license plate.\n       Meade has traveled to several counties looking for unique \n     plates to use for making more birdhouses. People can donate \n     old plates to the clerk's office for the birdhouse project.\n       Selling license plate birdhouses is the latest effort by \n     Meade's office to raise money for the H.A.V.E. program. All \n     money raised through H.A.V.E., created by the Kentucky County \n     Clerk's Association, goes to the Kentucky Veterans Program \n     Trust Fund. The trust fund, established by the Kentucky \n     General Assembly in 1988, helps support projects and programs \n     for Kentucky veterans.\n       The Homeless Veterans Transitional Treatment program in \n     Lexington was established with funds from the trust. Money \n     from the fund was also used to purchase 10 vans for the \n     Disabled American Veterans organization, to purchase land for \n     a state veterans cemetery, and to enhance state veterans' \n     nursing homes.\n       ``Every penny is spent on the veterans,'' said Meade. \n     ``None of it is spent on salaries or anything like that.''\n       Meade was named 2008 clerk of the year for the H.A.V.E. \n     program for his efforts of raising money for the program.\n       ``This county has raised more money for the H.A.V.E. fund \n     than any other county in the state,'' said Meade. ``I was \n     real honored to receive this. I give the girls in the office \n     the credit for the funds they have raised for H.A.V.E.''\n       The clerk's office hosted a golf scramble at Raven Rock \n     Golf Course in September in which funds raised from the \n     scramble were used to finance a Christmas party for the East \n     Kentucky Veterans' Center in Hazard. During that time, the \n     center served seven residents from Letcher County.\n       When people purchase the veterans' specialty license plate, \n     $5 of the cost of the plate goes into the H.A.V.E. fund. The \n     clerk's office also welcomes cash donations to H.A.V.E.\n       ``This is one way to give back and to thank (veterans) for \n     what they have done for us,'' said Meade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/18/senate-section/article/S4574-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4574-S4575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO MARK AND MICHELE PANOZZO\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founder of the\n\n[[Page S4575]]\n\nSpecial Olympics once said, ``You are the stars and the world is \nwatching you. By your presence, you send a message to every village, \nevery city, and every nation. A message of hope. A message of \nvictory.''\n  Today, I would like to recognize a father and daughter who are \nsending their own message of hope and victory Mark and Michele Panozzo \nfrom Rockford, IL.\n  Last week, Michele Panozzo was recognized as the 2013 Outstanding \nAthlete Award by the Special Olympics of Illinois. Earlier this year, \nMichele and Mark Panozzo were both recognized as the Northern Illinois \nSpecial Olympics Athlete and Coach of the Year.\n  This father-daughter duo started their involvement in the Special \nOlympics more than 25 years ago when Michele, who has Down syndrome, \nwas 8 years old. Her first sport was basketball. Over the years she has \ncompeted in a variety of sports, including softball throw, bowling and \nbocce.\n  Her dad, Mark, has been by her side as her coach the whole time. And \nit is not just Michele who Mark helps. He is also the coach of the \nRockford Red Hots, a team of 45 Special Olympics athletes from the \nRockford region. Mark and Michele spend nearly every weekend with the \nRed Hots, whether at a competition, a practice, or at social outings \nwith teammates and their families.\n  Special Olympics is more than sports and competitions to Mark and \nMichele. It is a community that has welcomed and befriended them. Mark \nsays he treasures Special Olympics because of the smiles he sees on \nMichele's face after a competition, whether she won a gold medal or \nfinished last. Mark still proudly shows off a photo of the first time \nMichele competed in the Special Olympics; she was just 8 years old, her \nhair was in pigtails and her face was lit with excitement\n  Mark has worked for the U.S. Postal Service for more than 30 years. \nYears ago he switched his schedule to work nights so he could pick up \nMichele from school every day. Michele volunteers 3 days a week \ndelivering meals to home-bound seniors, helping at the food pantry and \nsorting clothes at the local donation center.\n  In July of 1968, the first Special Olympics Summer Games were held at \nSoldier Field in Chicago. Only one thousand athletes competed. Today, \nit is a growing, global movement in more than 170 countries, serving \nnearly 3.5 million athletes with intellectual disabilities. In \nIllinois, Special Olympics is making a difference in the lives of \n21,000 athletes and nearly 40,000 volunteers and by organizing 170 \ncompetitions each year.\n  I join the Special Olympics of Illinois in commending Michele and \nMark Panozzo for their dedication to Special Olympics. I am sure that \nEunice Kennedy Shriver would be proud of what Michele and Mark have \ncontributed to the Special Olympics community, and I am too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/18/senate-section/article/S4575-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4575-S4576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO PIER ODDONE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, next month Piermaria Oddone will retire \nas the director of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, \nIL, after 8 years of service in that position. Pier has led Fermilab \nthrough some challenging times, but he has also led the lab to many \nremarkable achievements.\n  Pier was born in Peru and after earning degrees from Massachusetts \nInstitute of Technology and Princeton University, he worked at Caltech, \nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Stanford Linear Accelerator \nCenter.\n  Then in 2005, Pier and his wonderful wife, Barbara, moved to \nFermilab, giving up the sunny west coast for cold Chicago winters. They \narrived to 6,800-acres of former farmland that Pier and the Fermilab \nteam have worked to restore to its native prairie. The laboratory \nmaintains strong ties with the descendants of the farm families that \nonce worked the land where Fermilab now sits, and every summer the \nfamilies are invited to a picnic the lab hosts for the community.\n  No other national lab director can boast of barns and a herd of \nbison.\n  An avid photographer, Pier has spent many weekends walking the lab's \ngrounds trying to capture its natural beauty through the lens. This is \none of the things he has loved most about Fermilab. Whether raising \nbison or maintaining high-tech facilities, Pier has worked diligently \nto ensure that Fermilab continues to attract some of the best \nscientists from around the world.\n  And it does.\n  Today, Fermilab is America's premier particle physics laboratory, \nsupporting thousands of scientists as they solve the mysteries of \nmatter, energy, space, and time.\n  Fermilab's mission is to drive discovery in particle physics by \nbuilding and operating world-class accelerator and detector facilities, \nperforming pioneering research with global partners, and transforming \ntechnologies for science and industry.\n  It has often been said that physicists build huge, complex machines \nto study the tiniest, most basic particles. Well, Fermilab physicists \nbuild facilities and create new technologies to carry out discovery \nscience and contribute to America's technology base.\n  During Pier's tenure as director, Fermilab launched a new era of \nscientific research focused on high-intensity particle beams through \nits cutting-edge muon and neutrino experiments.\n  Fermilab also pushed forward the world's understanding of the dark \nmatter and dark energy that constitute 96 percent of the universe with \nits leadership roles in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the state-of-\nthe-art Dark Energy Camera.\n  While this work was advancing, more than 100,000 students, from \nkindergarten through high school, were welcomed to the laboratory. \nFermilab's strong partnership with Illinois schools and teachers helps \nachieve their shared goal of inspiring young people to learn more about \nparticle physics, environment, ecology, and accelerator science--and \nultimately encouraging them to pursue careers in STEM fields.\n  In addition, Fermilab's Tevatron particle collider laid the \ngroundwork for the discovery of the Higgs particle last year by \ndeveloping the technologies and analysis tools that helped confirm \nevidence of the Higgs boson's existence.\n  And though the Tevatron has ended its extraordinary 28-year run, \nunder Pier's guidance Fermilab has maintained its position at the \nforefront of scientific research by serving as the U.S. hub for more \nthan 1,000 physicists working at the Large Hadron Collider.\n  The laboratory contributed large magnets and other components key to \nthe construction of the Large Hadron Collider and its experiments. Pier \neven created a control room at Fermilab so U.S. scientists can perform \nexperiments at the Collider remotely.\n  In his last year as director, Fermilab partnered with the State of \nIllinois to construct the Illinois Accelerator Research Center, or I-\nARC, which aims to accelerate the transition of technologies developed \nfor particle physics research to other sectors of society.\n  I-ARC will also assist small businesses as a test facility, providing \ntechnical expertise in accelerator technology and serving as a training \nground for the next generation of accelerator scientists and engineers.\n  Beyond the lab's accomplishments, Pier has been awarded many honors \nin his own right. He won the Panofsky Award of the American Physical \nSociety for the invention of the Asymmetric B-Factory, a new kind of \nparticle collider designed to study the difference between matter and \nantimatter. He is a fellow of the American Physical Society and the \nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences and is an elected member of the \nNational Academy of Sciences. And, in case one was not enough, he also \nholds an honorary doctorate from the Illinois Institute of Technology.\n  Needless to say, it is likely that Pier's contributions to particle \nphysics and to Fermilab will continue to benefit Illinois and the \ninternational research community long after he retires next month.\n  When asked what he plans to do upon his retirement, Pier talks about \nmaking wine on the vineyard he and his wife own in California.\n  At one point he even thought of this as a field of research at \nFermilab. He would try planting grapevines at the lab, hoping that the \nheat from the beam lines would keep the vines warm enough to survive \nthe winters. This way, the lab could make wine while unlocking the \nmysteries of the universe. It might not be a bad idea, but \nunfortunately he never had any time to test the experiment.\n\n[[Page S4576]]\n\n  Now, after 8 years as director, Pier's wine-making skills may be a \nlittle rusty, but I am sure he will be back to harvesting his Cabernet \nand Zinfandel grapes in no time. And I am also sure that Pier and \nBarbara will find more time to spend with their 2-year-old \ngranddaughter and the rest of their family.\n  On behalf of the people of Illinois and the global community of \nparticle physicists, I thank Pier for his 8 dedicated years at Fermilab \nand congratulate him on his successful career. I wish him all the best \nin his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/18/senate-section/article/S4576-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4576-S4580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SMALL BUSINESS DISASTER REFORM ACT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I come to speak on S. 415, the ``Small \nBusiness Disaster Reform Act of 2013.'' As Chair of the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, as well as a senator \nfrom a state hard hit by disasters, I am proud that yesterday our \ncommittee reported out S. 415 favorably on a bipartisan basis. In \nparticular, Section 2 of S. 415 modifies the SBA requirement that \nborrowers must use their personal home as collateral for business \ndisaster loans less than $200,000. This is a very important provision \nfor businesses impacted by natural and manmade disasters. For that \nreason, I want to provide additional information on the need to enact \nthis provision.\n  In terms of the legislative history of Section 2, a similar provision \npassed the House of Representatives twice in 2009: on October 29, 2009 \nby a vote of 389-32 as Section 801 of H.R. 3854 and again by voice vote \non November 6, 2009 as Section 2 of H.R. 3743. The same provision that \nis in S. 415 passed the Senate 62-32 on December 28, 2012 as Section \n501 of H.R. 1, the Hurricane Sandy Supplemental. However, it was not \nincluded in H.R. 152, the House-passed ``Disaster Relief Appropriations \nAct'' that subsequently was enacted into law. Despite the setback \nearlier this year, I remind my colleagues that this provision has a \nhistory of bipartisan Congressional support and has previously passed \nboth chambers of Congress.\n  This Congress, we also have significant bipartisan support. S. 415 \nhas six cosponsors: Senators Thad Cochran, Roger Wicker, Heidi \nHeitkamp, Kirsten Gillibrand, Mark Pryor, and Ben Cardin. The House \ncompanion to S. 415, H.R. 1974, was introduced by Representative \nPatrick Murphy last month and has 11 cosponsors: Reps. Mick Mulvaney, \nJudy Chu, Mike Coffman, Ted Deutch, Peter King, Alan Nunnelee, Donald \nM. Payne, Jr., Cedric Richmond, Tom Cole, Trey Radel, and Frederica \nWilson.\n  While I understand the need to secure the loans and minimize risk to \nthe taxpayers; SBA has at its disposal multiple ways to secure these \nloans. If business owners have literally lost everything, requiring a \n$400,000 home as collateral for a $150,000 loan is maddening especially \nwhen other repayment options are available. One can understand that \nrequirement for loans of $750,000 or $2 million. For the smaller \ndisaster loans, however, it is a non-starter for many businesses we \nhave heard from. The bill requires the SBA to seek other business \nassets--such as commercial real estate, equipment, or inventory--before \nrequiring a primary residence be used as collateral.\n  I want to reiterate that Section 2 is very clear that these business \nassets should be of equal or greater value than the amount of the loan. \nAlso, to ensure that this is a targeted improvement, the bill also \nincludes additional language that this bill in no way requires SBA to \nreduce the amount or quality of collateral it seeks on these types of \nloans. I want to especially thank my former Ranking Member Olympia \nSnowe for working with me to improve upon previous legislation on this \nparticular issue. The provision that I am re-introducing, as part of \nthis disaster legislation, is a direct result of discussions with both \nher and other stakeholders late last year. I believe that this bill is \nbetter because of improvements that came out these productive \ndiscussions.\n  Furthermore, SBA has repeatedly said publicly and in testimony before \nmy committee that it will not decline a borrower for a lack of \ncollateral. According to a July 14, 2010 correspondence between SBA and \nmy office, the agency notes that ``SBA is an aggressive lender and its \ncredit thresholds are well below traditional bank standards . . . SBA \ndoes not decline loans for insufficient collateral.'' SBA's current \npractice of making loans is based upon an individual/business \ndemonstrating the ability to repay and income. The agency declines \nborrowers for an inability to repay the loan. In regards to collateral, \nSBA follows traditional lending practices that seek the ``best \navailable collateral.'' Collateral is required for physical loans over \n$14,000 and Economic Injury Disaster Loans, EIDL, loans over $5,000. \nSBA takes real estate as collateral when it is available, but as I \nstated, the agency will not decline a loan for lack of collateral. \nInstead it requires borrowers to pledge what is available. However, in \npractice, SBA is requiring borrowers to put up a personal residence \nworth $300,000 or $400,000 for a business loan of $200,000 or less when \nthere are other assets available for SBA.\n  This provision does not substantively change SBA's current lending \npractices and it will not have a significant cost. I believe that this \nlegislation would not trigger direct spending nor would it have a \nsignificant impact on the subsidy rate for SBA disaster loans. \nCurrently for every $1 loaned out, it costs approximately 10 cents on \nthe dollar. Most importantly, this bill will greatly improve the SBA \ndisaster loan programs for businesses ahead of future disasters. If a \nbusiness comes to the SBA for a loan of less than $200,000 to make \nimmediate repairs or secure working capital, they can be assured that \nthey will not have to put up their personal home if SBA determines that \nthe business has other assets to go towards the loan. However, if \nbusinesses seek larger loans than $200,000 or if their business assets \nare not suitable collateral, then the current requirements will still \napply. This ensures that very small businesses and businesses seeking \nsmaller amounts of recovery loans are able to secure these loans \nwithout significant burdens on their personal property. For the \nbusiness owners we have spoken to, this provides some badly needed \nclarity to one of the Federal government's primary tools for responding \nto disasters.\n  To be clear though, while I do not want to see SBA tie up too much of \na business' collateral, I also believe that if a business is willing \nand able to put up business assets towards its disaster loan, SBA \nshould consider that first before attempting to bring in personal \nresidences. It is unreasonable for SBA to ask business owners operating \nin very different business environments post-disaster to jeopardize not \njust their business but also their home. Loans of $200,000 or less are \nalso the loans most likely to be repaid by the business so personal \nhomes should be collateral of last resort in instances where a business \ncan demonstrate the ability to repay the loan and that it has other \nassets.\n  As I have mentioned, there are also safeguards in the provision that \nensures that this provision will not reduce the quality of collateral \nrequired by SBA for these disaster loans nor will it reduce the quality \nof the SBA's general collateral requirements. These changes will assist \nthe SBA in cutting down on waste, fraud and abuse of these legislative \nreforms. In order to further assist the SBA, I believe it is important \nto clarify what types of business assets we understand they should \nreview. For example, I understand that SBA's current lending practices \nconsider the following business assets as suitable collateral: \ncommercial real estate; machinery and equipment; business inventory; \nand furniture and fixtures.\n  At our markup of S. 415 yesterday, there were concerns raised by some \nMinority members of our committee regarding the impact of this \nprovision. One argument was that SBA has not seized many personal homes \nin the last five years. However, the SBA has been more aggressive since \n2011 on foreclosures--sending out 113 foreclosure letters since then. \nThis year alone they have seized 4 homes in Minnesota, Virginia, \nIllinois, and Texas. Furthermore, borrowers my office has spoken to are \nless concerned about a personal home being seized than they are about \nliens tying up personal property and the general roadblock this \nrequirement\n\n[[Page S4577]]\n\nsets up in applying for SBA disaster assistance. This requirement is \ndiscouraging successful businesses from applying to SBA and causing \ncurrent applicants to withdraw their applications. As of May 2013, 35 \npercent of Sandy business applications were withdrawn, most citing \nburdensome lending requirements like this as the main factor.\n  Also, it is my understanding that another concern that has been cited \nwas that business equipment depreciates over time so this is a riskier \nasset for the Federal government than a personal home. This argument, \nhowever, is false. As it relates to equipment, the SBA factors in \ndepreciation when considering collateral from potential borrowers. They \nvalue equipment or inventory significantly less than real estate, due \nto depreciation. If equipment is not deemed a suitable asset to \ncollateralize the loan, SBA will not take it. Also, Section 2 still \nallows SBA to determine the appropriate business asset if not the home. \nIt is not specific to equipment. Other assets the SBA could consider \ninclude commercial real estate; machinery and equipment; business \ninventory; and furniture and fixtures.\n  Yet another concern that was raised was that, in utilizing business \nassets instead of personal homes, this makes it tougher for SBA to \nrecover funds in the event of a default. As I previously mentioned, the \nSBA factors in depreciation and potential recovery in the event of a \ndefault when considering collateral from potential borrowers. SBA will \nnot make a loan if it deems the business assets being offered will be \ndifficult to recover or that it does not have sufficient value to \ncollateralize the loan. Also, again the bill does not prohibit homes \noutright nor require business assets as collateral. It strikes a \ndelicate balance to instead require the SBA to review if suitable \nbusiness assets are available before using a personal home. If business \nassets are sufficient, SBA can use them. If business assets are not \nsufficient and the borrower is unwilling to put up their home, the SBA \nwill not make the loan.\n  Lastly, it was also put forward that that if Congress allows business \nassets to be used as collateral instead of homes, this increases the \nlikelihood of defaults. Again, this argument is false. In an April 1, \n2013 letter to my office, the SBA Inspector General confirmed that \nthere are no findings relative to business assets increasing defaults. \nThe Inspector General wrote that it has ``. . . conducted numerous \nreviews of key aspects of the SBA Disaster Assistance Program; however, \nthere are no specific findings relative to the `type' of collateral \nsecured relative to disaster assistance loans.'' Furthermore, the \nInspector General also confirmed that the SBA is still required to \nsecure the loans and Section 2 does not change that. The Inspector \nGeneral wrote that ``. . . Section 2 does not remove SBA's policy for \nsecuring loans with collateral equivalent to 100 percent equity of the \nloan. Section 2 also explicitly provides that nothing in the Section \ncan be construed to require the Administrator to reduce the amount of \ncollateral required to secure the loan.'' Again, if the business does \nnot have sufficient business assets or the SBA deems them risky, \nSection 2 does not change their ability to not make the loan.\n  In closing, I would like to note that Section 2 addresses a key issue \nthat is serving as a roadblock to business owners interested in \napplying for smaller SBA disaster loans. After the multiple disasters \nthat hit the Gulf Coast, my staff has consistently heard from business \nowners, discouraged from applying for SBA disaster loans. When we have \ninquired further on the main reasons behind this hesitation, the top \nconcern related to SBA requiring business owners to put up their \npersonal home as collateral for smaller SBA disaster loans for their \nbusiness. So let me provide you with two examples of businesses \nimpacted by this requirement.\n  The first example is LiemCo, a Long Island, NY specialty beverage \nrepair service with 15 employees. Think of ``Starbucks\"-type espresso \nmachines in restaurants and coffee shops--LiemCo fixes them. The \ncompany is family-owned and the son of the owners, Dominic Chieco runs \nit. His parents are still partial owners and he pays them a quarterly \ndraw which serves as their retirement income. Ownership is being \ngradually transferred to Dominic.\n  Prior to Hurricane Sandy, they did everything right. Dominic moved \nhis vehicles to higher ground; loaded key inventory in the trucks--\ninventory with high value or long delivery times; raised items to 6 \nfeet above the floor; purchased extra gas; and withdrew $5,000 in cash \nin case electricity went out at the banks. According to their local \nSmall Business Development Center, SBDC, they are well run and these \npreparations show that.\n  Despite that, Hurricane Sandy flooded his building about 4 to 5 feet. \nThe water went down after a couple of days but power was out for 3 \nweeks. The day after it came back on, a Nor'easter snow storm knocked \nout power for another week and a half. This caused physical property \ndamages of more than $250,000. Dominic kept employees on payroll--full \ntime--throughout recovery. He could not give them the customary \nChristmas bonus but once they re-opened after Christmas, he gave 1 \nemployee their bonus each week.\n  Dominic's biggest concern was the collateral requirement from SBA. \nHis building is valued at $1.2 million and only carried a $150,000 \nmortgage. The parents are still partial owners, so notwithstanding the \nvalue of the building, SBA still wanted a lien against the parents' \nhome for the guarantee for a $200,000 loan. This bothered them \ntremendously as it was their retirement security. Much of this would \nhave been eliminated if the collateral position on the parents' home \nhad not been required when sufficient collateral existed with the \nbusiness.\n  Another business impacted by this burdensome requirement is Water \nStreet Bistro in Madisonville, LA. Water Street Bistro is a small \nfamily-owned restaurant overlooking the sail boats on the Tchefuncte \nRiver just across the street. Tony Monroe and his wife Constance have \nowned their business for 9 years and have about 9 employees. Monroe \nstarted his culinary career at Cafe Sbisa in New Orleans and then went \nto Colorado before returning to the place he was born and raised.\n  Fortunately, after Hurricane Katrina, the Monroe's escaped damage to \ntheir restaurant and did not need to apply for SBA assistance. However, \nthis was not the case following Hurricane Isaac. Hurricane Isaac \nbrought 6 to 10 inches of water into their restaurant which caused them \nto close their business for 3 weeks. The Monroe's had to start all over \nand buy all new food and replace equipment, such as refrigerators, \nwhich cost around $30,000. In addition to the physical damage to their \nproperty, the Monroe's could not pay their staff during this time.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Monroe's biggest concern in applying to the SBA was the \ncollateral requirement. SBA required them to pledge their family home \nfor a loan of around $40,000 to $45,000. Once they found out the \nrequirement for pledging primary residence was firm, the Monroe's \ndecided not to pursue the loan. The Monroe's are in their 60's and \ncould not imagine using their home--valued around $200,000 to \n$250,000--as collateral. They ended up doing all of the repairs, for \nthe restaurant, on their own because they could not afford to pay for \nthese services.\n  I thank the Chair and I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \nApril 1, 2013, letter from the SBA Inspector General and other letters \nof support for S. 415 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Inspector \n           General,\n                                    Washington, DC, April 1, 2013.\n     Hon. Mary L. Landrieu,\n     Chair, Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chair Landrieu: Thank you for your March 20, 2013 \n     letter regarding S. 415, the Small Business Disaster Reform \n     Act of 2013. The U.S. Small Business Administration, Office \n     of Inspector General (SBA, OIG) shares the understanding \n     articulated in your letter relative to the plain reading of \n     Section 2 of S. 415. In context of the potential concerns \n     brought to the attention of the Committee on Small Business & \n     Entrepreneurship, two questions were posed to the OIG.\n       The OIG offers the following responses for your \n     consideration:\n       Does Section 2 of S. 415 remove SBA's ``one-to-one'' policy \n     for securing loans?\n       Section 2 of S. 415 states, ``. . . shall not require the \n     owner of the small business concern to use the primary \n     residence of the\n\n[[Page S4578]]\n\n     owner has other assets with a value equal to or greater than \n     the amount of the loan that could be used as collateral for \n     the loan: Provided further, That nothing in the preceding \n     proviso may be construed to reduce the amount of collateral \n     required by the Administrator in connection with a loan \n     described in the preceding proviso or to modify the standards \n     used to evaluate the quality (rather than the type) of such \n     collateral' . . .''\n       According to SBA standard operating procedures (SOP 50 30 \n     7), SBA generally deems collateral is adequate if the equity \n     is at least 100 percent of the loan amount. As such, a plain \n     reading of Section 2 does not remove SBA's policy for \n     securing loans with collateral equivalent to 100 percent \n     equity for the loan. Section 2 also explicitly provides that \n     nothing in the Section can be construed to require the \n     Administrator to reduce the amount of collateral required to \n     secure the loan.\n       Does alternative collateral (i.e., to a business owner's \n     primary personal residence) that is equal to or exceeding the \n     amount of a potential business disaster loan, as established \n     in Section 2 of S. 415, increase the likelihood of default?\n       The Office of Inspector General (OIG) has conducted \n     numerous reviews of key aspects of the SBA Disaster \n     Assistance Program; however, there are no specific findings \n     relative to the ``type'' of collateral secured relative to \n     disaster assistance loans. OIG's work has found that SBA \n     officials have not always adhered to established policies and \n     procedures in managing the program, increasing the risk of \n     default and subsequently, of loss to the taxpayer. We have \n     made numerous recommendations for corrective action based on \n     our work. Regardless of the type of collateral, SBA \n     officials' adherence to established policy and procedures \n     during loan origination, servicing, and if necessary \n     liquidation, decreases the risk of default and loss to the \n     taxpayer.\n       The OIG appreciates your continued interest in our work. \n     Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any \n     questions or need additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Peggy E. Gustafson,\n     Inspector General.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Association of Small Business\n\n\n                                          Development Centers,\n\n                                     Burke, VA, February 10, 2013.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Chair, Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, U.S. \n         Senate, Russell Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: Thank you for giving the Association \n     of Small Business Development Centers (ASBDC) the opportunity \n     to comment on your proposed legislative amendments to the \n     disaster assistance provisions in the Small Business Act (15 \n     USC 631 et seq.).\n       While Congress has taken a significant step in addressing \n     the resource issues following Sandy and other disasters there \n     are still restrictions in the SBDC assistance authority and \n     the US Small Business Administration's loan making authority \n     that could complicate future disaster recovery efforts. We \n     applaud your efforts to deal with those issues.\n       Under section 21(b)(3) of the Small Business Act (15 USC \n     648(b)(3)) SBDCs are limited in their ability to provide \n     services across state lines. This prevents SBDCs dealing with \n     disaster recovery, like New York and New Jersey, from being \n     able to draw upon the resources available in our nationwide \n     network of nearly 1,000 centers with over 4,500 business \n     advisors. It likewise prevents states with great experience \n     in disaster recovery assistance like Louisiana and Florida, \n     from providing assistance to their colleagues.\n       Your proposed legislation amends that SBDC geographic \n     service restriction for the purposes of providing disaster \n     support and assistance. Our Association wholeheartedly \n     endorses that change. Allowing SBDCs to share resources \n     across state lines or other boundaries for the purpose of \n     disaster recovery is a common sense proposal, little \n     different from utilities sharing linemen. In addition, we \n     would like to note that this provision has been supported by \n     the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship \n     twice in previous Congresses.\n       In addition, the ASBDC wishes to express its support for \n     your proposals to amend the collateral requirements in the \n     disaster loan program for loans under $200,000. SBDCs \n     routinely assist small business owners with their \n     applications for disaster loan assistance and have often \n     faced clients with qualms about some of those requirements.\n       We share a common goal of putting small business on the \n     road to recovery after disaster strikes and getting capital \n     flowing is a key factor in meeting that goal. To that end, \n     ASBDC supports your efforts to ease collateral requirements \n     and help improve the flow of disaster funds to small business \n     applicants. We believe your proposal to limit the use of \n     personal homes as collateral on smaller loans is consistent \n     with the need to get capital flowing to affected businesses \n     and ease the stress on these businesses. We also agree that \n     this change will not undermine the underwriting standards of \n     the disaster loan program.\n       Thank you again for kind attention and continuing support \n     of small business.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              C. E. ``Tee '' Rowe,\n     President/CEO, ASBDC.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            International Economic\n\n\n                                          Development Council,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2013.\n     Hon. Mary L. Landrieu,\n     Chair, Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, U.S. \n         Senate.\n     Hon. James E. Risch,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu and Senator Risch, On behalf of the \n     International Economic Development Council (IEDC), please \n     accept our appreciation for this opportunity to provide \n     comments related to proposed changes to federal disaster \n     assistance programs offered by the United States Small \n     Business Administration (SBA). Your continuing support of \n     these critical programs is worthy of praise and we thank you \n     for your leadership.\n       IEDC has a strong history of supporting disaster planning \n     and recovery. Our organization, with a membership of over \n     4,000 dedicated professionals, responded to communities in \n     need following the 2005 hurricane season, the BP Gulf oil \n     spill and other disaster-related incidents by providing \n     economic development recovery assistance. We have continued \n     our work in this area through technical assistance projects \n     and partnerships with federal agencies and other non-\n     governmental organizations. Our profession is invested in \n     helping our country prepare for and respond to disasters, \n     much the same as you and your colleagues on the Committee on \n     Small Business and Entrepreneurship. To this end, we support \n     proposed changes that will allow SBA to more effectively \n     deliver disaster recovery assistance to local businesses in \n     need of federal aid.\n       Rebuilding the local economy must be a top priority \n     following a disaster, second only to saving lives and homes. \n     IEDC supports the targeted changing of the current collateral \n     requirements that state a business owner must place their \n     home up as collateral in order to secure an SBA disaster \n     business loan of $200,000 or less. In times of crisis, \n     affected business owners are understandably reluctant to \n     place their personal homes up as collateral in order to \n     obtain a much needed loan to rebuild their business. \n     Consequently, SBA loans put in place to help businesses \n     rebuild following a disaster go underutilized. As lawmakers, \n     you have a responsibility to protect the taxpayer, which is \n     why we understand the need for posting collateral of equal or \n     greater value to the amount of the loan. The proposed \n     targeted change that eliminates the specific requirement of \n     using a home as collateral to guarantee a loan of $200,000 or \n     less, and instead allowing business assets to act as \n     collateral, will promote greater utilization of the loans. \n     This is an idea we can all get behind; one that will lead to \n     greater, faster economic recovery.\n       When disaster strikes, we should do everything in our power \n     to bring the full resources of the federal government to bear \n     in the impacted community. This includes, most especially, \n     bringing in top experts who can immediately begin helping \n     businesses and local economies recover. The national network \n     of over 1,100 Small Business Development Centers (SBDC) could \n     be an excellent resource to stricken communities. \n     Unfortunately, current rules prevent SBDC's from assisting \n     their counterparts in other jurisdictions. For example, those \n     communities in the mid-Atlantic and New England impacted by \n     Sandy are not able to benefit from the enormous amount of \n     knowledge and experience in storm recovery held by SBDC's in \n     Florida and the Gulf region. Certainly, we can all agree that \n     disasters warrant an extraordinary response and that response \n     must include qualified expertise from all corners of the \n     federal government.\n       Forty to sixty percent of small businesses that close as a \n     result of a disaster do not reopen. This is an unacceptably \n     high number. We would not accept that level of loss in homes \n     and we cannot accept that level of loss in jobs; our \n     communities cannot sustain such losses and duty dictates we \n     make certain they don't have to. By enacting common sense \n     legislation, like that which is under consideration here, and \n     freeing the flow of capital and expertise, we are taking \n     concrete steps to give our small businesses and local \n     economies the greatest chance to recover.\n       IEDC is your partner in the work of job creation. We thank \n     you for your leadership in support of small business and \n     stand ready to offer our assistance in this and future \n     efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n     Paul L. Krutko,\n       Chairman, International Economic Development Council, and \n     President and CEO, Ann Arbor SPARK.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                National Emergency\n\n\n                                       Management Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 21, 2013.\n     Senator Mary Landrieu,\n     Chairman, Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland \n         Security, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu, On behalf of the National Emergency \n     Management Association (NEMA), I write you today in support \n     of the Small Business Disaster Reform Act of 2013. NEMA is \n     comprised of the emergency management directors from the \n     states, the \n     U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia.\n\n[[Page S4579]]\n\n       While not a traditional ``first responder'' agency, the US \n     Small Business Administration (SBA) is a critical partner to \n     States and localities affected by a wide variety of \n     disasters. Following a disaster, SBA has the capability to \n     mobilize staff from the Office of Disaster Assistance to \n     begin disseminating public information about what services \n     SBA can provide to supplement many long-term federal recovery \n     programs. While the Federal Emergency Management Association \n     (FEMA) is often thought of as the primary agency for disaster \n     assistance, there are many unique situations where SBA loans \n     can be utilized in creative ways to assist citizens in need. \n     NEMA agrees that the SBA needs to be equipped with the \n     flexibility and authority to adequately assist disaster \n     victims and we believe this legislation accomplishes such an \n     objective.\n       The images of homes and businesses affected by flooding and \n     wind damage following Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee \n     painted a devastating picture in September 2011. In New York \n     State alone, the SBA approved over $100 million in loans for \n     citizens affected by the storms. More recently, Hurricane \n     Sandy reminded us of the critical role SBA has in the \n     disaster community. Ninety days after Hurricane Sandy struck \n     the Northeast, the SBA crossed the $1 billion threshold of \n     approved loans to more than 16,800 homeowners, renters and \n     businesses. This makes Hurricane Sandy, in terms of SBA \n     disaster lending, the third largest natural disaster in U.S. \n     history, behind Hurricanes Katrina/Rita/Wilma ($10.8 \n     billion), and the Northridge Earthquake ($4 billion).\n       The continued challenge of protecting the nation from a \n     variety of hazards within the reality of fiscal uncertainty \n     elevates the importance of cooperation throughout the \n     emergency management community. Leveraging resources from \n     across the federal family imperative following a disaster and \n     the communication and outreach by essential agencies is just \n     the first step to community recovery. Positive relationships \n     between federal, state, and local government stakeholders are \n     the lynchpin to coordinated recovery efforts that support \n     resilient individuals, prosperous businesses, and thriving \n     economies.\n       NEMA believes SBA deserves adequate flexibility. \n     Legislation such as this helps achieve that end. We remain \n     available as a resource for you and your staff as this effort \n     continues. Should you need any additional information or have \n     questions regarding NEMA's policy positions, please do not \n     hesitate to contact Matt Cowles, Director of Government \n     Relations at (202) 624-5459.\n           Sincerely,\n     John W.

Mary Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Landrieu and Cochran: The National Small \n     Business Association (NSBA) is pleased to support the \n     bipartisan Small Business Disaster Reform Act of 2013 (S. \n     415), which will make it much easier on small businesses \n     impacted by and recovering from a disaster. By clarifying \n     that the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) shall not \n     use a small business owner's primary residence as collateral \n     for disaster business loans less than $200,000 and \n     authorizing the SBA Administrator to allow out-of-state small \n     business development centers (SBDCs) to provide much-needed \n     assistance in Presidentially-declared disaster areas, this \n     bill will let small businesses do what they do best, create \n     jobs and energize the economy.\n       The importance of reforming and enhancing federal programs \n     to maximize their benefit to small businesses and \n     entrepreneurs is certainly recognized by the membership of \n     NSBA, and we greatly appreciate commonsense, bipartisan \n     reform measures like the Small Business Disaster Reform Act, \n     especially when they come at no cost to the American \n     taxpayer.\n       On behalf of the NSBA and our over 65,000 members across \n     the country, I would like to thank you and the cosponsors of \n     this legislation for your tireless efforts to promote \n     economic development and for your endless support of small \n     businesses impacted by disasters. We look forward to working \n     with you and your staffs to help enact this critical piece of \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Todd O. McCracken,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    March 5, 2013.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Chair, Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, U.S. \n         Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. James Risch,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chair Landrieu and Ranking Member Risch: We write to \n     you today in strong support of the Small Business Disaster \n     Reform Act of 2013. Greater New Orleans, Inc. is a regional \n     economic development alliance serving the 10-parish region of \n     Southeast Louisiana. The Partnership for New York City is a \n     nonprofit organization of the city's business leaders. We \n     represent very different regions of the country, but we are \n     both strong contributors to the national economy and we have \n     been seriously impacted by natural disasters that caused huge \n     economic damage.\n       The overall economic impact of Hurricane Katrina was \n     estimated to be $150B--the costliest natural disaster in U.S. \n     history. Similarly, the disruption and damage inflicted by \n     Super Storm Sandy--the second costliest natural disaster--is \n     estimated at over $80 billion and resulted in daily loss of \n     billions of dollars in economic output, not only locally but \n     across the country. The impact of these storms has been \n     particularly serious for small businesses, forcing some to \n     close shop entirely and many to reduce services. The Federal \n     government has programs that were intended to insure that \n     small businesses and local economies can quickly recover from \n     such disasters, but in our experience these programs are not \n     working as effectively as they should be and require \n     legislative amendment. That is why we are very interested in \n     prompt action on the Small Business Disaster Reform Act.\n       Here are some examples of what needs to change:\n       Small business owners are currently required by the Small \n     Business Administration (SBA) to put up their primary \n     residence as collateral for SBA disaster loans of less than \n     $200,000, even though the value of their home often exceeds \n     the value of the loan. The Small Business Disaster Reform Act \n     of 2013 would put in place a common sense solution that \n     requires the SBA to collateralize small loans with available \n     business assets of equal or greater value before requiring \n     the business owner to put up his or her personal home. In a \n     time of crisis, every possible measure should be taken to \n     avoid business owners having to put their families at further \n     risk. This reform would reduce pressure on affected business \n     owners and increase utilization of the SBA disaster loan \n     program, while still providing necessary protections to the \n     government in the event of default.\n       Small Business Development Centers, SBDCs, have also played \n     a critical role in helping businesses recover following \n     disasters. However, under current law, SBDCs can only assist \n     businesses in their prescribed geographic region, even though \n     often times after major disasters like hurricanes, SBDCs are \n     affected right along with businesses. Following a \n     Presidential declaration of a disaster, effected regions need \n     aid quickly and SBDCs in surrounding regions, including \n     across state lines, should be able to help neighboring \n     effected regions. This bill would allow for that.\n       Small businesses are often disproportionately damaged by \n     natural disasters due to loss of customer base, thin profit \n     margins, diminished access to capital and difficulty with \n     relocation. The reforms proposed would help business owners \n     take full advantage of available resources and accelerate \n     their recovery by cutting bureaucratic red tape and providing \n     businesses with the tools needed to resume normal business as \n     quickly as possible--putting people back to work.\n       We appreciate the Committee's work on this critically \n     important issue and urge the Senate to work together to \n     deliver these much needed reforms. Thank you in advance for \n     your work towards strengthening the economy.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael Hecht,\n       President & CEO, Greater New Orleans, Inc.\n     Kathryn S. Wylde,\n       President & CEO, Partnership for New York City.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              St. Tammany Economic\n\n\n                                       Development Foundation,\n\n                                Mandeville, LA, February 19, 2013.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Chair, Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, U.S. \n         Senate, Russell Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: The St. Tammany Economic Development \n     Foundation thanks you for the opportunity to comment on the \n     proposed amendments to the disaster assistance provisions in \n     the Small Business Act (15 US 6 31 et seq). As we learned \n     from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and most recently Isaac, the \n     sooner our small businesses are able to recover, the better \n     it is for the region, the state and the nation.\n       We fully endorse the proposed amendment to Section 1 of the \n     bill regarding collateral on business disaster loans. If \n     approved, no longer would small business owners have to use \n     their primary personal residence for collateral towards SBA \n     disaster business loans less than $200,000 if other assets \n     are available of equal or greater value than the amount of \n     the loan. In times of crisis, affected business owners are \n     understandably reluctant to place their personal homes up as \n     collateral in order to obtain a much needed loan to rebuild \n     their business. Allowing business assets to act as collateral \n     will promote greater utilization of the loans; leading to \n     faster economic recovery.\n       Under Section 2 of the bill, Small Business Development \n     Centers (SBDCs) are limited in their ability to provide \n     services across state\n\n[[Page S4580]]\n\n     lines. This prevents SBDCs in affected areas from being able \n     to draw upon the resources available from their colleagues \n     nationwide. Louisiana SBDCs have great experience in disaster \n     recovery assistance and should not be prevented from \n     providing assistance to their colleagues outside of Louisiana \n     in the event of disaster. Therefore, we fully support this \n     provision.\n       We applaud your efforts to protect small businesses in the \n     wake of disasters and thank you for continuing to be a strong \n     advocate on their behalf. After all, small businesses are the \n     lifeblood of our great nation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Brenda Bertus,\n       Executive Director, St. Tammany Economic Development \n     Foundation.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Charleston Metro\n\n\n                                          Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                             North Charleston, SC, March 21, 2013.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Chair, Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, U.S. \n         Senate, Russell Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: As President and CEO of the \n     Charleston Metro Chamber of Commerce, I would like to offer \n     our support of the Small Business Disaster Reform Act of \n     2013. As the region's largest private sector organization, \n     the Chamber represents more than 1,750 businesses and \n     represents more than 75,000 employees in our region. Small \n     businesses are the backbone of the American economy and, not \n     surprisingly, the Charleston Metro Chamber's largest customer \n     group. More than 80 percent of our members employ 50 or fewer \n     employees.\n       Your committee's proposed changes on the collateral \n     requirements and allowing small business development centers \n     to work across state lines following disasters are necessary. \n     Anything that can be done after a major disaster to help \n     speed-up the rebuilding efforts should be top priority.\n       I want to commend you on your leadership with this critical \n     piece of legislation. Please let me know if our team can ever \n     be of service to you or your committee.\n                                              Bryan S. Derreberry,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                       Mobile, AL, March 20, 2013.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Chair, Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. James Risch,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Landrieu and Senator Risch: The Mobile Area \n     Chamber of Commerce would like to thank you for this \n     opportunity to voice our support of the proposed changes to \n     federal disaster assistance program legislation as it relates \n     to programs offered by the U.S. Small Business \n     Administration. We offer our support for two provisions in \n     the ``Small Business Disaster Reform Act of 2013,'' S-115. We \n     support section 2 which modifies the collateral requirements \n     of Business Disaster Loans. We also support section 3 which \n     authorizes the U.S. Small Business Administration to allow \n     out-of-state small business development centers to provide \n     assistance in Presidentially-declared disaster areas.\n       The Mobile Area Chamber has 2087 member businesses, and \n     ninety percent of these businesses can be classified as small \n     businesses. We have worked closely with the U.S. Small \n     Business Administration office here in Mobile for over five \n     years. We petitioned heavily to get a U.S. Small Business \n     Administration office here locally, as this region received \n     fewer small business loans than any other area of the \n     country. Since opening the U.S. Small Business Administration \n     office here in Mobile, small business loans have risen \n     significantly.\n       As it relates to disaster assistance, the U.S. Small \n     Business Administration office here in Mobile was ``on the \n     ground'' and very helpful to area businesses in the aftermath \n     of Hurricane Katrina and the December 2012 tornados.\n       The Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce's mission is to serve \n     as a progressive advocate for business needs to promote the \n     Mobile area's economic well-being. Our program structure and \n     small business agenda reflect that as we offer disaster \n     planning, survival and recovery workshops. Most all of these \n     training sessions were done in conjunction with the local \n     U.S. Small Business Administration office.\n       Thank you for your hard work and leadership, as we share \n     the common goal of supporting the small business community. \n     We appreciate the opportunity to show our support for your \n     tremendous effort on behalf of small businesses in the Mobile \n     Bay region.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Darrell W.

Madam President, for Americans all across the country, June \n14 is a very special day--Flag Day. On that day, we all join together \nto celebrate our shared heritage and our history as a Nation as \nrepresented by our American flag.\n  We each have our own way of showing our respect and our great love \nfor this symbol of our land. Down through the years it has been given \nmany names, from the Stars and Stripes to Old Glory--to the Grand Old \nFlag that was memorialized in song. It has so many names because of all \nthat it represents. The story of our Flag reminds us of all the \nsacrifices that have been made over the years so that our Nation would \nalways be strong and free.\n  Each of us has our own favorite memory of the flag. There are some \nthat we recall from the pictures of the wars that we have seen, or from \nour remembrance of all the veterans who proudly fought, especially \nthose who died in the service of our Nation. Anyone who has seen a \npicture of the Marines raising the American flag during the battle of \nIwo Jima will never forget that iconic image. It held such meaning to \nus we created a statue to memorialize that moment. It stands just a \nshort distance from the Capitol, a reminder to us all that freedom is \nnot free. It comes to us at great cost.\n  Although we celebrate our American flag's proudest moments on this \nday, we should also remember those days when we did not treat the Stars \nand Stripes so kindly. There were those who thought to use the flag to \npromote their own agenda by burning it in the streets. Fortunately, \nthose moments were few and far between and were usually done by people \nwho did not understand the symbolism of the flag or fully appreciate \nall they had received from their citizenship. Some of them just did not \nrealize how blessed they were to be Americans.\n  Here in the Senate, we begin each session by joining together to \nrecite the Pledge of Allegiance. As we do, we pledge our loyalty to our \ncountry, our determination to do everything we can to make this a \nbetter place for us all to live, and most specifically, we pledge our \nlove and appreciation for this ``one Nation, under God, with liberty \nand justice for all.''\n  Over the years, our flags have inspired works of art of all kinds, \nmost especially a song with a remarkable story behind its origin. Every \nAmerican knows what happened on that day when our young Nation was in \nthe midst of a great war. We were fighting for our very right to be \nfree. As the battle waged, a young man, Francis Scott Key, mesmerized \nby the action of the battle, suddenly caught sight of our Flag, still \nflying proudly over the fort in the midst of all the gunshot, flame and \nfire around him. The words he wrote became another symbol of our Nation \nas he took up his pen to tell us about the sight. From where he stood \nhe could see ``the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, \nwhich, gave proof through the night, that our Flag was still there''--\nthe same Flag that still proudly flies ``o'er the land of the free and \nthe home of the brave.'' The Flag that helped to inspire those words is \nstill on display, one of the most popular attractions at the \nSmithsonian Institution just down the street from us.\n  On Flag Day, and every other day, I would encourage all Americans to \nfly their flag and to talk to their children and grandchildren about \nthe meaning of the flag and the history of our Nation. The great gifts \nwe have received of ``life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness'' \nshould never become just words to us. They are our birthright as \nAmericans and they should encourage us to continue to remember the \nsacrifices that have been made in our name. In a very real sense, Flag \nDay is a call to express the great pride we feel for this country and \nthose who served in our Armed Forces--our great heroes of the past--and \nthose who continue to serve our Nation all over the world--our heroes \nof the present.\n  I have often mentioned here on the floor what it means to me to be a \ngrandfather and the thrill of holding the next generation of your \nfamily in your arms. Well, my granddaughter continues to share with us \none of those special moments we all need to experience so we do not \nforget the legacy we have received from our citizenship. Every time she \nsees an American Flag she pauses, looks at it with an understanding \nthat surpasses her years, and with a smile of pride and admiration, \nsays ``God bless America!'' As she says those special words she looks \naround at everyone near her, expecting them to join her in expressing \nthat sentiment--which we do. She is only 2 years old\n\n[[Page S4581]]\n\nand she is already learned to do that all by herself--which makes her \ntwos not so terrible after all.\n  Friday morning, as I reflected about Flag Day I found myself reading \nthe words of Lloyd Ogilvie who served as our Senate Chaplain for many, \nmany years. In his book, One Quiet Moment, he wrote ``Thomas Jefferson \ninscribed in his memorial God, who gave us life, gave us liberty. Can \nthe liberties of a Nation be secure when we have removed a conviction \nthat these liberties are the gift of God?''\n  On Flag Day and throughout the year, those are good words of advice \nto consider and put into practice. We must never forget that all we \nhave received from our citizenship ultimately comes from God. Then it \nis up to us to share those great blessings with all those we meet as we \nwork together to make our Nation a better place not only for us, but \nfor our children and our grandchildren so they will never lose their \nfondness and appreciation for this great land of ours.\n  I can think of no better way to celebrate Flag Day than to join with \nmy granddaughter in her recognition of the flag with an exuberant ``God \nbless America!'' Yes! God bless America and God bless us all. May our \nfuture be as blessed as our past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/18/senate-section/article/S4581-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MACHIAS, MAINE\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President. I rise today to commemorate the 250th \nanniversary of the founding of Machias, ME, a remarkable town on the \nDowneast Coast that exemplifies the determination, resiliency, and \ncourage of our Nation. It was there, in 1775, just 12 years after the \nvillage was established, that the first naval battle of the American \nRevolution was fought and won.\n  The word ``Machias'' translates from the language of the \nPassamaquoddy Indians as ``bad little falls.'' The rushing water where \nthe Machias River plunges to the sea and the vast stands of virgin pine \ndrew the first settlers in 1763, who built a successful sawmill and a \nthriving community.\n  In early June of 1775, word reached Machias of the Battles at \nLexington and Concord in April, the first military engagements of the \nAmerican Revolution. When two British cargo ships, escorted by the \nwarship Margaretta, arrived at Machiasport to take on a shipment of \nlumber to build barracks for British troops under siege in Boston, they \nwere met by patriots eager to join the fight for freedom.\n  On June 12, with the town under threat of bombardment if it did not \ncooperate with the lumber shipment, a militia of 30 men under the \ncommand of CPT Jeremiah O'Brien stormed the Margaretta. Armed with \nmuskets, pitchforks, and axes, the militia captured the warship and \nsailed it triumphantly into harbor. The battle known as the ``Lexington \nof the Seas'' was a stunning American victory.\n  Among the heroes of that battle was a young woman named Hannah \nWeston. As the plans to seize the Margaretta were taking shape, this \n17-year-old wife of militiaman Josiah Weston went house to house \nthroughout the sparsely settled region collecting gunpowder and shot, \nand lugging the heavy load through the wilderness to the front lines. \nToday, the Hannah Weston Chapter of the Daughters of the American \nRevolution keeps her memory alive.\n  The Passamaquoddy gave Machias more than a name. By 1777, the town \nhad become a center of revolutionary activity and the British sent an \ninvasion fleet to crush the rebellion. Some 40 or 50 Passamaquoddy, led \nby Chief Joseph Neeala, joined the militia and the invaders were turned \nback.\n  Just outside of Machias stands Fort O'Brien, one of just a few forts \nto have been active in the American Revolution, the War of 1812, and \nthe Civil War. On the road to that historic site, on the banks of a \nsmall stream, there is a plaque that wonderfully describes the spirit \nof this community.\n  It was at that place in June of 1775, when the Margaretta's cannons \nthreatened Machias, that the townspeople met in open air to choose \nbetween a humiliating peace and a likely hopeless war. The words on the \nplaque tell the story: ``After some hours of fruitless discussion, \nBenjamin Foster, a man of action rather than words, leaped across this \nbrook and called all those to follow him who would, whatever the risk, \nstand by their countrymen and their country's cause. Almost to a man \nthe assembly followed and, without further formality, the settlement \nwas committed to the Revolution.''\n  Today, that settlement is a thriving community. Machias is the \nshiretown of Washington County and, as the home of the University of \nMaine at Machias, it is a center for education and the arts in the \nregion. Located in the heart of the blueberry industry, Machias hosts \nthe Maine Wild Blueberry Festival, one of our State's great summer \nevents.

Madam President, it is my pleasure to honor the \nresidents of Hot Springs County, WY as they celebrate their centennial.\n  Located in northern Wyoming, and nestled in the Big Horn Basin, Hot \nSprings County is an incredible place to live and work. Nearly 5,000 \nresidents reside in the communities of Kirby, East Thermopolis, and \nThermopolis, the county seat. The county boasts a wide range of \nrecreational opportunities, and its residents share the beauty of the \nBig Horn River, the Owl Creek Mountains, and the Wind River Canyon with \nvisitors from around the country.\n  Hot Springs County has a storied past and a promising future. The \ncounty is aptly named for the natural mineral hot springs in the area. \nFor thousands of years, Big Spring has produced millions of gallons of \nmineral water at a constant temperature of 135 degrees Fahrenheit. \nNorthern Arapahoe and Eastern Shoshone Native Americans relied on the \nspiritual and physical healing powers of the hot springs years before \nthe first settlers arrived. In 1896, under the guidance of Chief \nWashakie, the tribal leaders transferred ownership of the land \nsurrounding the springs to the U.S. Government. The treaty opened the \nnatural beauty of the area to the public to be enjoyed in perpetuity. \nToday, this historic treaty is celebrated every August with the Gift of \nthe Waters Pageant. This celebration recreates the treaty ceremony of \n1896 and is a truly special attraction.\n  In the past 100 years, Hot Springs County has benefitted from a \nvariety of industries and has enjoyed great economic success. The \ncounty played a key role in supplying oil to support the war effort \nduring World War II. The communities of Grass Creek and Hamilton Dome \nwere especially efficient producers of oil during this period. In \naddition, a portion of the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railroad \ntravels through the county. The Railroad connects the State to \nimportant supplies and goods from around the country.\n  Tourism is arguably the county's most successful industry. In \nThermopolis, Hot Springs State Park attracts thousands of guests every \nyear. Created from the land purchased in the Treaty of 1896, the Park \nprovides year-round recreation opportunities, including hiking, \npicnicking, and soaking in the world-famous hot springs. Just 20 miles \naway, folks can visit the Legend Rock Petroglyph Site, which is home to \nsome to the best-preserved examples of Dinwoody rock art in the world. \nThe Wyoming Dinosaur Center celebrates Wyoming's incredibly rich \nnatural history. It is one of the few centers in the world that has an \nactive excavation site within driving distance. Visitors can see active \ndig sites, explore modern preparation laboratories, and admire dozens \nof fossilized dinosaurs and specimens. Folks in the county have done an \nincredible job of preserving the county's rich history and sharing with \nits visitors.\n  Hot Springs County is a very special place to all of us in Wyoming. \nIn addition to being the hometown of my wife,\n\n[[Page S4582]]\n\nBobbi Brown Barrasso, Thermopolis is also the hometown of former \nWyoming Governor Dave Freudenthal. The fine folks of the county are \nincredible leaders and greatly contribute to the success of the entire \nState.\n  It is an honor to recognize the residents of Hot Springs County as \nthey celebrate their 100th anniversary. This year, the Hot Springs \nCounty Centennial Committee has planned a countywide celebration on \nJune 22nd to commemorate this milestone. I invite my colleagues to \nvisit the communities of Hot Springs County. The county's rich \nheritage, geological wonders, and genuine cowboy hospitality provide a \ntruly wonderful experience to visitors from all over the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/18/senate-section/article/S4582-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING THE NEHEMIAN\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, during Small Business Week it is \nimportant to recognize the ingenuity of small business owners who take \na leap of faith and invest in an idea in order to make their dream of \nbeing an entrepreneur a reality. I rise today to honor The Nehemian of \nBuhl, ID, a small business that has shown over the course of 25 years \nin business that they can take chances and survive in this economic \nclimate.\n  Over 26 years ago, Nancy Tyrrell and her husband, Ed, opened The \nNehemian, a shop that sold antiques and offered custom picture framing. \nBut after years of being in business, the Tyrrells wanted to expand \ntheir services and increase their sales. Tyrrell began designing custom \nkey fobs which depict Idaho points of pride, including the Boise State \nBroncos and the University of Idaho Vandals. As a result of this risk \nto produce and market new product, The Nehemian found great success in \nthe sale of these local treasures.\n  Tyrrell has faced her share of entrepreneurial challenges. After a \n$25,000 loss on a project, Tyrrell considered going back to teaching \ninstead of continuing as a small business owner. But her love for the \ncreative opportunities her business provided convinced her that she \nwouldn't be happy doing anything else. Instead of giving up, Tyrrell \nrededicated herself to her store and sought to expand into an untapped \nmarket. Her custom key fobs are manufactured by Silver Creek Mint, \nanother local business located in Buhl and where her son is employed. \nTyrrell licensed both the Boise State Bronco and University of Idaho \nVandal key fob with Collegiate Licensing Co. in order to sell to a \nmarket in which she recognized a demand for her product. After only 6 \nweeks of selling her custom key fobs, Tyrrell had recouped two thirds \nof her investment. Currently, The Nehemian sells 12 different \nvariations of key fobs. There is even a Great Seal of Idaho key fob \nwhich is sold at the Idaho State Capitol gift shop. Tyrrell also offers \nkey fob design services to large companies to commemorate special \nmilestones.\n  Though The Nehemian is a small company, they have learned to manage \ntheir resources well and expand their products. Nancy Tyrrell's \nbusiness has achieved a reputation of quality, as well as that of a \nunique Idaho gem. I would like to recognize The Nehemian as an Idaho \nSmall Business of the Day based on their resiliency through hard times, \ntheir willingness to take a risk and their creative spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/18/senate-section/article/S4582-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MIKE CURRY\n\n Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I wish to take a moment of the \nSenate's time to call your attention to the retirement of one of the \ntrue heroes of my home town of Gillette, WY. For 30 years our local \nbasketball team, the Camels, has been coached by one of the finest high \nschool coaches of all time--Mike Curry.\n  Mike has been doing a good job for so long we thought he would be on \nthe bench on the Camels' side of the court forever. That is why it took \nus all by surprise when Coach Curry decided to retire from coaching at \nthe end of this past season.\n  Over the years Coach Curry has been more than our coach--he's been a \nWyoming tradition. Ask anyone who is a Camels fan who has been \nresponsible for their success and every one will tell you our secret \nadvantage has been the coaching ability and basketball knowledge of \nCoach Curry.\n  His concern for each of his players, and his great love of Campbell \nCounty High School, has been evident for all the years of his service \nto the people of Gillette. It shows itself in the hearts of those he \nhas coached and in the lives of those he has worked with as their \nteacher. He has always been one to lead by quiet but focused example \nand that important quality of his has made him a role model that has \nhelped to provide guidance and direction to all those with whom he has \nworked.\n  If you ask the members of all those championship teams that played \nfor Coach Curry, they will tell you that they learned some important \nlessons from him that helped to shape their lives. Thanks to him they \ncame to realize what high expectations, teamwork, making good, \nthoughtful decisions and refusing to ever give up on a goal can mean to \nthe pursuit of a difficult challenge. Ask his current players and they \nwill tell you what it has meant to play for Coach Curry and to receive \nthe legacy of success from his past efforts that helped to get them \ninspired and motivated right from the start. They knew before they even \nmade the team how successful Coach Curry's Camels had been and that \nmade them ask more from themselves than anyone else would have ever \nthought was possible for them to achieve.\n  Coach Curry is now ending a remarkable career. In 30 years he has \ncollected 605 wins and 12 State titles. If we were to ask him which one \nwas sweeter--the first win or the last--I have a feeling he would tell \nus that they were all special because each one was made possible by a \nteam of young men committed to winning and to each other.\n  For my family, we will always remember Coach Curry for the impact he \nhad on our son, Brad. He also touched the rest of our family as we \nwatched the Camels play for and learn from a very strong, steady coach. \nFor the community of Gillette, we will always remember the key role \nCoach Curry played in strengthening Gillette's sense of community and \nincreasing our sense of pride in our school and those who wore its \ncolors.\n  Congratulations and good luck, Coach Curry. You did a great job and \nyou can now look back on your coaching career with the satisfaction \nthat comes from a job well done. You can also look ahead to some new \nadventures as this chapter of your life comes to a close and you begin \na new one. God bless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/18/senate-section/article/S4582-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4582-S4583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOHN J. SWEENEY\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the \ncontributions that John J. Sweeney, AFL-CIO president emeritus, has \nmade to improve the lives of working men and women and their families \nacross America and around the world. The labor movement is the \nfoundation of America's middle class, and John Sweeney understands that \nfact. He has devoted his life to fighting for workers so that they have \nsafe working conditions, good benefits, and a paycheck big enough to \nsupport a family.\n  John Sweeney's life is an inspirational one. He was born in the \nBronx, NY--the son of Irish immigrants. His parents knew the value of \nhard work. His father was a New York City bus driver and his mother \nworked as a domestic for wealthy families. John Sweeney's father was a \nmember of the union and it was that union membership and steady income \nthat made it possible for Sweeney to attend Iona College in New \nRochelle, N.Y. and graduate with a degree in economics. He also holds \nhonorary degrees from Georgetown University, Oberlin College, \nUniversity of Massachusetts at Amherst, the University of Baltimore, \nCatholic University Law School, the University of Toledo's College of \nLaw, Iona College and the College of New Rochelle.\n  Sweeney's first job in the labor movement was with the International \nLadies' Garment Workers, which later merged with the Clothing and \nTextile Workers Union. He joined SEIU Local 32B in New York City in \n1961 as a union representative. Sweeney was elected president of Local \n32B in 1976 and led two citywide strikes of apartment maintenance \nworkers during the 1970s.\n  John Sweeney was first elected president of the AFL-CIO in 1995 on a \nplatform of revitalizing the federation,\n\n[[Page S4583]]\n\nwhich has 57 affiliated unions and 12 million members, including 3 \nmillion members in Working America, its new community affiliate. At the \ntime of his election as president of the AFL-CIO, Sweeney was serving \nas president of the Service Employees International Union--SEIU. He \nbecame president emeritus of the AFL-CIO at the federation's \nconstitutional convention in September 2009, stepping down after 4 \nterms as president.\n  There is no denying that the past few years have been difficult ones \nfor the American labor movement, but John Sweeney continues to stand \nstrong in the fight for American workers. The American workforce is the \nbest trained and most efficient in the world. John Sweeney has been a \nbig part of that success and I hope my colleagues will join me in \nthanking him for his lifelong commitment to American workers and their \nfamilies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/18/senate-section/article/S4583-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:32 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 253.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to establish \na program to provide loans and loan guarantees to enable eligible \npublic entities to acquire interests in real property that are in \ncompliance with habitat conservation plans approved by the Secretary of \nthe Interior under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nInfrastructure Facilitation and Habitat Conservation Act of 2013.\n  This legislation will make it easier for communities across the \nNation to improve their public infrastructure by providing access to \ncost-effective Federal loan guarantees to mitigate the impacts of \ngrowth on the environment and endangered species.\n  This bill authorizes a 10-year pilot program, to be administered \njointly by the Secretaries of the Interior and Treasury, making credit \nmore readily available to eligible public entities which are sponsors \nof Habitat Conservation Plans, HCPs, under section 10 of the Endangered \nSpecies Act of 1973.\n  Habitat Conservation Plans were authorized by an amendment to the \nEndangered Species Act in 1982 as a means to permanently protect the\n\n[[Page S4588]]\n\nhabitat of threatened and endangered species, while facilitating the \ndevelopment of infrastructure, through issuance of a long-term \n``incidental take permit''.\n  Equally important, HCPs can be very effective in avoiding, minimizing \nand mitigating the effects of development on endangered species and \ntheir habitats. HCPs are an essential tool, as Congress intended, in \nbalancing the requirements of the Endangered Species Act with on-going \nconstruction and development activity.\n  In California, the Western Riverside County multiple-species HCP is a \nprime example of effective habitat management. The Western Riverside \nMSHCP covers an area of 1.26 million acres, of which 500,000 will be \npermanently protected for the benefit of 146 species of plants and \nanimals. To date, more than 347,000 acres of public land and 45,000 \nacres of private land have been protected, at a cost of $420 million. \nIn the case of the Western Riverside MSHCP, as with other HCPs \nnationwide, this strategy for advance mitigation of environmental \nimpacts has facilitated the development of much-needed transportation \ninfrastructure. To date, the Western Riverside MSHCP has resulted in \nexpedited environmental approval of 25 transportation infrastructure \nprojects, which have contributed 32,411 jobs and $2.2 billion to the \ncounty's economy.\n  Riverside has been one of the Nation's fastest growing counties, with \na rate of growth during the last decade of 42 percent. Unless the \ndevelopment of infrastructure can be made to keep pace with this \nexplosive population growth, neither environmental or livability goals \nwill be attained.\n  In recent years, the economic downturn has slowed the pace of habitat \nacquisition in Western Riverside and other similarly-situated \ncommunities. Revenue which had been generated by development fees to \nfinance acquisition of habitat has also slowed.\n  Now, ironically, signs of economic recovery in the region also signal \nincreasing real estate prices that will make the acquisition of \nmitigation lands more challenging. That's why it is important to \nprovide communities like Western Riverside ready access to capital now \nto help fund habitat conservation projects while real estate costs \nremain relatively low, saving them and other communities implementing \nHCP's billions of dollars.\n  Under this bill, loan guarantee applicants would have to demonstrate \ntheir credit-worthiness and the likely success of their habitat \nacquisition programs. Priority would be given to HCPs in biologically \nrich regions whose natural attributes are threatened by rapid \ndevelopment. Other than the modest costs of administration, the bill \nwould entail no federal expenditure unless the local government \ndefaulted--a very rare occurrence.\n  These Federal guarantees will assure access to commercial credit at \nreduced rates of interest, enabling participating communities to take \nadvantage of temporarily low prices for habitat. Prompt enactment of \nthis legislation will provide multiple benefits at very low cost to the \nFederal taxpayer: protection of more habitat more quickly, accelerated \ndevelopment of infrastructure with minimum environmental impact, and \nreduction in the total cost of HCP land acquisition.\n  A broad coalition of conservation organizations and infrastructure \ndevelopers supports this legislation. In fact, the Senate also \nexpressed support for this concept when it approved a similar, albeit \nmore narrowly defined innovative financing program as part of the Water \nResources Development Act, WRDA, last month. But where the WRDA \nprovisions would be applicable to mitigate the environmental impacts \nrelated to the development of water infrastructure, this legislation \nwould broaden that eligibility to transportation and other public \ninfrastructure.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I believe it will \nencourage infrastructure development and habitat conservation at \nminimal Federal risk. It is exactly the kind of partnership with local \ngovernment that should be utilized to maximize efficient use of Federal \ndollars.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1175\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the public availability of Medicare claims data; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, Senator Wyden and I reintroduced \nthe Medicare Data Access for Transparency and Accountability Act. This \ncollaborative effort includes two ideas for making Medicare billing and \nspending more transparent.\n  The first provision comes from a bill I introduced in 2011 to enhance \nthe government's ability to combat Medicare and Medicaid fraud. It \nwould require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue \nregulations making Medicare claims and payment data available to the \npublic, similar to other federal spending disclosed on \nwww.USAspending.gov.\n  That website was created by legislation sponsored by then-Senator \nObama and Senator Coburn. It lists almost all federal spending, but it \ndoesn't include payments made to Medicare providers.\n  That means virtually every other government program, including some \ndefense spending, is more transparent than the Medicare program.\n  Omitting Medicare spending is especially alarming when you consider \nthe portion of Federal spending that goes through the Medicare program. \nIn 2011, the Federal Government spent $549 billion on Medicare.\n  Taxpayers have a right to see how their hard-earned dollars are being \nspent. There should not be a special exception for hard-earned dollars \nthat happen to be spent through Medicare.\n  Transparency will restore that taxpayers' right.\n  Also, if doctors know that each claim they make will be publicly \navailable, it might deter some wasteful practices and overbilling.\n  Our bill accomplishes this by requiring the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to make available a searchable Medicare payment database \nthat the public can access at no cost.\n  The second provision in our bill clarifies that data on Medicare \npayments to physicians and suppliers do not fall under a Freedom of \nInformation Act, FOIA, exemption.\n  In 1979, a U.S. District Court ruled that Medicare is prohibited from \nreleasing physicians' billing information to the public.\n  For over three decades, third parties that tried to obtain physician \nspecific data through the FOIA process have failed. Taxpayers have been \ndenied their right.\n  Another recent court decision lifted the injunction, but it does not \ngo far enough.\n  Our bill would make Congress' intent clear and provide the public \nwith the tools to finally gain access to important Medicare data.\n  I would like to provide one example of how valuable access to \nMedicare billing data can be.\n  In 2011, using only a small portion of Medicare claims data, the Wall \nStreet Journal was able to identify suspicious billing patterns and \npotential abuses of the Medicare program.\n  The Wall Street Journal found cases where Medicare paid millions to a \nphysician sometimes for several years, before those questionable \npayments stopped.\n  That was only one organization using a limited set of Medicare data. \nWhen it comes to public programs like Medicare, the Federal Government \nneeds all the help it can get to identify and combat fraud, waste and \nabuse, and that is why a searchable Medicare claims database should be \nmade available to the public.\n  I have often quoted Justice Brandeis, who said, ``Sunlight is the \nbest disinfectant.'' That is what Senator Wyden and I are aiming to \naccomplish with the Medicare Data Act.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Grassley to \nintroduce the Medicare Data Access for Transparency and Accountability \nAct. I would like to begin by thanking my friend and esteemed colleague \nfor his unwavering commitment to greater transparency and \naccountability in government. This Medicare DATA Act advances that \ngoal.\n  Sunshine continues to be the greatest disinfectant. In that light, \nthe Medicare DATA Act ensures all taxpayers have access to Medicare \nClaims Database, both to aid them in making medical decisions, and in \nunderstanding what their money is paying for in this vital, yet \nenormous, health program. The Medicare Claims Database is an important \nresource for public and private stakeholders as it captures healthcare \nprovider payment and claims information for roughly one-third of the \nUnited States healthcare system. But why isn't this information already \navailable?\n  In 1978, the Department of Health Education and Welfare attempted to \nrelease this information, upon request, under the premise that \naccessibility to the source data was in the public interest and \ntherefore should be made available for public consumption. An \ninjunction by a Florida court, however, ordered otherwise.\n  I am pleased that the Florida court has reevaluated that decision and \nrecently lifted the injunction. This is a step in the right direction, \nbut the decision still leaves access to this data ``opaque.'' Data \nrequests are still subject to the Freedom of Information Act and can be \ndenied by Health and Human Services. Passage of the Medicare DATA Act \nwould put an end to that loophole.\n  Information affecting the American taxpayer should be part of the \npublic domain in a free society. With this principle in mind, I join \nwith Senator Grassley in changing ``business as usual.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so that Medicare \ndata is finally fully transparent and available to Medicare \nbeneficiaries and taxpayers alike. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Ms. Murkowski, \n        Mr. Udall of New Mexico, Mr. Begich, Mr. Merkley, and Mr. Lee):\n  S. 1182. A bill to modify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nof 1978 to require specific evidence for access to business records and \nother tangible things, and provide appropriate transition procedures, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an issue \nthat is critical to our constitutional rights and our national \nsecurity. The revelation and subsequent declassification of the \nNational Security Agency's intelligence gathering programs have shocked \nAmericans in ways that I long ago had telegraphed. We are having a \nspirited and critical debate about what the right balance between \nprivacy and security ought to be. With regards to NSA activity, I am \nintroducing bipartisan legislation today, with several senators of both \nparties, designed to narrow Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, known \nalso as the ``business records'' provision, to better balance the \nauthorities we give the federal government while protecting our \nconstitutional rights. More specifically, my legislation would prevent \nthe federal government from collecting millions of law-abiding \nAmericans' phone call records without first establishing some nexus to \nterrorism. We all expect the NSA to target terrorists, but the \nrevelations in the past few weeks have made clear that the information \nof millions of law-abiding Americans is being swept up in the process.\n  Let me start by saying that I continue to feel that a number of the \npermanent PATRIOT Act provisions\n\n[[Page S4590]]\n\nshould remain in place to give our intelligence community important \ntools to fight terrorism. But I also believe, as I stated two years ago \nwhen offering this same legislation as an amendment to the PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization bill, that Section 215 of this Act fails to strike the \nright balance between keeping us safe and protecting the privacy rights \nof Americans. Indeed, my concerns about this provision of the law have \nonly grown since I was first briefed on its secret interpretation and \nimplementation as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n  From the recent leaks and information since declassified about the \nSection 215 collection program, we know that the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court has interpreted this provision of the PATRIOT Act to \npermit the collection of millions of Americans' phone records on a \ndaily, ongoing basis. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, \nI have repeatedly expressed concern that the interpretation of this \nprovision of the PATRIOT Act, which allows the government to obtain \n``any tangible thing'' relevant to a national security investigation, \nis at odds with the plain meaning of the law. This secrecy has \nprevented Americans from understanding how these laws are being \nimplemented in their name. That is unacceptable.\n  Even before the nature of the bulk phone records collection program \nwas declassified, there was support for narrowing the language of \nSection 215 from many in Congress and many Americans who feel strongly \nabout their constitutional right to privacy. In fact, the PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization that passed the Senate in 2005 by unanimous consent \nincluded language that would limit the government's ability to collect \nAmericans' personal information without a demonstrated link to \nterrorism or espionage. While that language did not prevail in \nconference, it demonstrated that bipartisan agreement on reforms to \nSection 215 is possible.\n  In 2011, as the Senate took up the extension of a number of expiring \nprovisions of the PATRIOT Act, I offered an amendment drawn directly \nfrom language in the 2005 Senate-passed bill to narrow the application \nof this provision. That amendment unfortunately did not receive a vote. \nBut today, along with my colleague Sen. Wyden and others, I am back at \nit again--introducing bipartisan legislation drawn from that same \nlanguage.\n  Our bipartisan bill would narrow the PATRIOT Act Section 215 \ncollection authority to make it consistent with what most Americans \nbelieve the law allows. While this legislation would still allow law \nenforcement and intelligence agencies to use the PATRIOT Act to obtain \na wide range of records in the course of terrorism- and espionage-\nrelated investigations, it would require them to demonstrate that the \nrecords are in some way connected to terrorism or clandestine \nintelligence activities--which is not the case today. I don't think it \nis unreasonable to ask our law enforcement agencies to identify a \nterrorism or espionage investigation before collecting the private \ninformation of American citizens.\n  Many Coloradans share my belief that we need to place common-sense \nlimits on government investigations and link data collection to \nterrorist- or espionage-related activities. If we cannot assert some \nnexus to terrorism, then the government should keep its hands off the \nphone data of law-abiding Americans.\n  Let me be very clear: our government must continue to diligently and \naggressively combat terrorism. We all agree with that critically \nimportant goal. But I do not think that it is unreasonable to ask that \ncollection of phone data be limited to investigations that are actually \nrelated to terrorism or espionage. And I do not believe that we need to \nsacrifice national security to strike this balance. In fact, as a \nmember of the Intelligence Committee who has studied our surveillance \nprograms closely, it has not been demonstrated to me that the bulk \nphone records collection program has provided uniquely valuable \ninformation that has stopped terrorist attacks, beyond what is \navailable through less intrusive means. But if we are going to continue \nproviding this authority to collect phone data from Americans' \ncommunications, let's at least limit it to require a link to terrorism \nor espionage. This is a commonsense step that we can take to strike a \nbetter balance between keeping our country safe and respecting \nconstitutional rights.\n  I thank my colleagues who have cosponsored this legislation, and ask \nother colleagues to give it a close look. I will continue to press for \nthe PATRIOT Act to be reopened for debate, and when that occurs, I will \npush for passage of this bipartisan bill that strikes a better balance \nbetween keeping our nation safe and unduly trampling our constitutional \nrights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/18/senate-section/article/S4590-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 173--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2013 AS ``NATIONAL CHILD \n    AWARENESS MONTH'' TO PROMOTE AWARENESS OF CHARITIES BENEFITTING \n CHILDREN AND YOUTH-SERVING ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES \n AND RECOGNIZING EFFORTS MADE BY THOSE CHARITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS ON \nBEHALF OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH AS CRITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FUTURE OF \n                           THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Burr, Mr. Coburn, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nEnzi, and Mr. Durbin) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Madam President, there are many reasons given to enact \nimmigration reform. Being from Arizona, we bear a disproportionate \nburden in the State from the Federal Government's failure to have a \nsecure border and to have a rational immigration system.\n  There are many reasons, but the fiscal reason isn't often brought up. \nWe were just given good fiscal reason today by the Congressional Budget \nOffice that came forward with their estimate for the cost of the \nlegislation.\n  Just a few minutes ago we heard the ``glass half empty'' speech, and \nI want to give the ``glass half full''--or actually, decidedly more \nthan that. Let me take a few of the top-line numbers.\n  First, we are often told that if we enact this legislation, the \nincrease in population of those who come across--illegally or legally--\nin the next 10 years will be some 30 million people. That is disputed \nby the facts on the ground. But also CBO points out in their estimate \nthat by 2023, enacting S. 744 would lead to a net increase of 10.4 \nmillion in the number of people residing in the United States compared \nto the number of people projected under current law. So it is \nsignificantly lower.\n  The best estimate we have of the illegal population here is around 11 \nmillion. This would also lead to a substantial decrease in the illegal \npopulation obviously coming across. So we are looking at an increased \npopulation of about 10.4 million over 10 years, decidedly lower than \nsome of the estimates that are being thrown around.\n  Let's talk about a few of the fiscal numbers. We are told it would be \nextremely costly to enact this legislation. CBO says the following: \nThis will lead to an increase in Federal direct spending of $262 \nbillion over the 2014-2033 period. Most of these outlays will be for \nincreases in refundable tax credits, and on and on. So $262 billion in \nincreased spending sounds significant, until you consider that this \nlegislation will increase Federal revenues by $459 billion over the \n2014-2033 period. So $459 billion in increased revenue compared against \n$262 billion in increased spending. That is a $197 billion surplus--or \ndecrease in the deficit--over the 10-year budget window.\n  We often hear: That is OK for the first 10 years, but what happens \nafter that? CBO looked at that as well, and they said this: On balance, \nCBO and JCT--Joint Committee on Taxation--estimate that the changes in \ndirect spending in revenue would decrease Federal budget deficits by \nabout $700 billion, or 0.02 percent, of the gross domestic product, \nover the period 2024 to 2033. Again, CBO and JCT estimate the changes \nin direct spending revenue will decrease Federal spending deficits by \nabout $700 billion over the second 10-year budget window.\n  I know we often point out on this side of the aisle and the other \nside of the aisle as well these reports are only as good as the \nassumptions you make when you do these reports. Duly noted. But I think \nit is still instructive to look at this and dispel some of the wild \nrumors that are out there about the cost of this legislation, when CBO \nactually comes forward and says over a 20-year budget window, there \nwill be a $700 billion decrease in Federal deficits. That is \nsignificant.\n  Let me also say CBO looked at how this legislation would affect the \neconomy going forward. They looked at a further budget window. They say \nS. 744 would boost economic output, taking into account all economic \neffects including those reflected in the cost estimates. Again, they \nare talking about the direct spending that would increase through parts \nof this legislation as well. If you take that into account, still this \nbill would increase real inflation-adjusted GDP relative to the amount \nCBO projects under current law by 3.3 percent in 2023 and 5.4 percent \nin 2033--again, increasing economic activity by 3.3 percent in 2023 and \nby 5.4 percent in 2033. That is substantial.\n  When you look at the legislation and you look at what will happen \nwhen we increase legal immigration in ways that help the economy, \nparticularly on the H-1B side--high-tech STEM visas--we all know \nintuitively that will help\n\n[[Page S4621]]\n\nus, because those individuals who come with these kinds of degrees \nboost economic output and increase jobs. It is going to help this \neconomy, and this spells it out in dramatic fashion: 3.3 percent \nincrease in 2023 simply owing to this legislation, 5.4 percent in 2033 \njust owing to this legislation.\n  In summary, I want to say CBO estimates are only as good as the \nassumptions they make. But when they look at this legislation in a \ndispassionate way, as nonpartisan as they can get, they come up with \nfigures that show net revenue over expenses is quite substantial--over \n$700 billion over a 20-year budget window--and the economic output \nwould increase 3.3 percent by 2023 and 5.4 percent by 2033. That is \nsignificant and I think it bears noting.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/18/senate-section/article/S4621-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
