Mr. President, this week work continues on the farm bill, \nwhich will create jobs, cut taxpayer subsidies, and reduce the deficit. \nChairman Stabenow and Ranking Member Cochran have worked very hard to \ncome up with a finite list of amendments. They are still trying to do \nthat. I hope they can complete that today. I will give the managers as \nmuch time as we can to reach an agreement to consider a finite number \nof amendments to the farm bill.\n  I will not file cloture unless I have spoken more than once, before \nthe day is out, to Senator Stabenow and Senator Cochran. I hope I don't \nhave to file cloture on this legislation tonight, but we need to move \nforward. It is important to have ample time for debate on the \nimmigration bill reported just a few weeks ago by the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  The Senate must move forward before the end of June to protect \nstudents from the rising cost of education by keeping the loan rates \nlow. If we don't do something about that before the end of this month, \nit is going to more than double the rates. If we do nothing, it will \ndouble the rates. If we\n\n[[Page S3916]]\n\ndo what the House wants, it will triple the rates, so we cannot do \nthat. College is already unaffordable for too many young people, and if \nCongress fails to take action this month, as I have indicated--and I \nhave certainly underlined and underscored the fact--the pricetag will \ngo up significantly for them.\n  What is suggested by the House and the legislation they passed, it \nwill add about $6,500 to the average student's loan bill. Their \nproposal would be worse than doing nothing at all--worse than letting \nrates double next month.\n  I hope my Senate Republican colleagues will instead support our \nefforts to give middle-class families security by freezing interest \nrates at current levels for 2 years without adding a penny to the \ndeficit. This is exactly the kind of commonsense proposal we need to \nkeep our economy growing, and I will do everything I can to have a vote \non the student loan bill this week.\n  If the Republicans in the Senate want to put forward what they think \nshould be done, I will be happy to have a vote on theirs, and then we \nwill vote on ours.\n  Even if we have not completed action on the farm bill or student loan \nproposals, we will bring immigration to the floor next week. The \nimmigration system is broken and it needs to be fixed.\n  I am grateful Senator McConnell said he would not oppose moving to \nthe bill--at least that is the way I read it in the press. He doesn't \nbelieve we will need to have cloture on the bill. I hope we do not need \nto do that, but if we need to do it in order to get on the bill, I will \ndo that.\n  I know the Republican leader cannot control virtually every \nRepublican, but I hope we can move forward and start the debate on this \nbill.\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  During the recess I had the opportunity to appear at a number of \nevents in Nevada, and the topic at each one of those events was \nimmigration.\n  I appeared at an event in Las Vegas, where we had between 1,000 and \n2,000 people on the street. It was a very moving event. This has always \nbeen a personal issue for me. As I have said many times, my father-in-\nlaw emigrated from Russia.\n  I have seen firsthand a huge increase in the number of people coming \nto Nevada over the last 15 to 20 years. These people have been \ndevastated by our broken immigration system. I have personally devoted \nmore time to immigration reform than any other issue over my career in \nCongress. Each time I meet with my constituents, they are desperate for \ncommonsense reform. Each time I meet with them, my passion for fixing \nour broken immigration system is renewed.\n  This is personal for a lot of reasons. I will always remember when \nthere was a lot of anti-immigration stuff going on in Congress, I went \nhome--to my Washington home--and my wife said: Remember who I am; \nremember why I am here. My dad came from Russia.\n  Her words were to that effect. As a result of that brief conversation \nwith Landra, I got the message and I became an advocate for fixing our \nbroken immigration system.\n  My father-in-law contributed a lot to this country, but the one most \nimportant contribution was his only child who is now the mother of my 5 \nchildren and the grandmother of 16 grandchildren. So this issue is \nsomething that is important to me.\n  I admire and respect the work of the eight Senators--four Republicans \nand four Democrats. We need to move forward on this legislation. It is \nso very important.\n  I appeared not only at that huge event in Las Vegas, where there were \nthousands of people, I appeared in a Catholic Church last week in Reno. \nThere were 1,500 people who filled the church and people were standing \noutside. The 1,500 didn't count toward the people who were outside.\n  This was organized by faith leaders, not just Catholics. All faiths \nthat believe immigration reform is not a political issue but a moral \nissue were there. They don't believe it is an economic issue or \npolitical issue. I repeat, they believe it is a moral issue, and I \nagree. A Catholic priest from Carson City shared the story of his \ngrandparents who emigrated from Italy.\n  As I have already indicated, my wife's parents emigrated from \nRussia--my father-in-law at least. My mother-in-law barely made it \nhere; she almost was an immigrant, but she was a little baby born \nsomeplace in Canada.\n  Families who come here from other countries need to understand what \nthe law is, and we are trying to determine that as that is our job. \nToday immigrant families come seeking the same as generations before \nthem. My father-in-law Israel Goldfarb came here and changed his name. \nHe became Earl Gould, and that was the only person I ever knew. He died \nas a young man. He didn't get to enjoy his grandchildren.\n  So there are lots of reasons why we have to fix our broken \nimmigration system and help the many people who are undocumented here \nget right with the law. It is time for reform that helps them \ncontribute fully to their communities by learning English, paying \ntaxes, and starting down the pathway to earn their citizenship.\n  The bill we have from the Judiciary Committee is not a perfect bill, \nbut we don't have that here. In my more than three decades in Congress, \nthere has never been a perfect bill. The Founding Fathers could \nenvision nonperfect bills. They knew that is how we would get things \ndone, by compromise. Legislation is the art of compromise. It is up to \nus to ensure America remains the land of opportunity for people born \nwithin our borders as well as those who seek a better future on our \nshores.\n\n  Finally, on another subject, ads have been run on TV, the radio, and \nin the newspaper about how the Democrats need to follow regular order \nin the Senate, and we have done that. But now my Republican colleagues \nare silent. We have been waiting for months now to allow them to allow \nus to go to conference for regular order. They are refusing to go to \nconference so we can come up with a budget that we can negotiate with \nthe House as to what we should do.\n  It is obvious why we are not able to go to conference. It is so \nobvious. The Speaker does not want us to go to conference and the \nRepublicans in the Senate are trying to protect him and the unwieldy \njob he has over there. He is trying to protect his job, and the tea \nparty people are wreaking havoc with our country.\n  We should be able to go to conference. Republican Senators have said: \nLet's go to conference. What is stopping us from going to conference? I \njust talked about what is stopping us from going to conference, and it \nis truly detrimental to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/04/senate-section/article/S3916-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \nremarks of the majority leader with regard to our late colleague Frank \nLautenberg. He was, indeed, a member of the greatest generation, having \nfought in World War II and also has had distinguished service in the \nSenate.\n  I would also like to mention to my friend the majority leader, before \nhe leaves the floor, I indicated to him before the recess that I \nintended to bring up each day going forward a commitment he made to the \nSenate back in January of 2011 and again in January of 2013--the \nbeginning of the last two Congresses--with regard to using the nuclear \noption to change the rules of the Senate.\n  The most important currency of the realm in the Senate is one's word, \nand my good friend the majority leader said in January of 2011: ``I \nwill oppose any effort in this Congress, or the next, to change the \nSenate's rules other than through the regular order.'' It was not a \ncontingent commitment, it was not a contingent based on my judgment of \ngood behavior, it was a commitment.\n  Then again in January of 2013, in an exchange the majority leader and \nI had on the floor, I said I would confirm with the majority leader \nthat the Senate would not consider other resolutions relating to any \nstanding order or rules of this Congress unless they went through the \nregular order process. That was my question to my friend the majority \nleader to which he replied, ``That is correct.'' Any other resolutions \nrelated to Senate procedure would be subject to a regular order \nprocess, including consideration by the Rules Committee.\n\n[[Page S3917]]\n\n  My point is the commitment has been made, an unequivocal commitment \nhas been made. In the Senate, of course, how we deal with all issues is \nrelated to keeping our word. It will be important for the Senate to \nunderstand, before we go much further this year, what the majority \nleader's intentions are. Does he plan to keep his word issued in \nJanuary of 2011 and January of 2013 or not? I think the Senate is \nentitled to an answer. All Senators would be entitled to an answer, but \nparticularly the minority would be interested in an answer to that \nbefore we go any further into this session.\n\n\n                             Student Loans\n\n  With regard to the loan rates for students, I think it is interesting \nto note, as we go into this needless controversy because we are not \nthat far apart, one of the driving reasons for the increase in the \nstudent loan rates--two of them--is directly related to the passage of \nObamaCare. In ObamaCare, the Democratic majority, without a single \nRepublican vote, abolished the student loan program. The government \ntook it over and raised the rates. So that is one reason rates are \ngoing up. The second reason is the Medicaid mandate, which the Supreme \nCourt said is optional, but States are now wrestling with whether to \naccept this additional responsibility for vast new numbers of Americans \nwho will receive a free health care card.\n  The two biggest items in every State budget are Medicaid and \neducation. As Medicaid expenses rise, what State governments all across \nAmerica have done is reduced educational funding to public colleges and \nuniversities, and in response to that the colleges and universities \nraise tuition. So the new generation coming along is getting it both \nways: The rates are going up and the tuition is going up, so they have \nto pay back more at a higher rate, all related to something young \npeople had nothing to do with, which was the passage of ObamaCare.\n  Washington has had to grapple with a lot of big issues over the past \nfew years and we have had some pretty heated debates because there were \nreal philosophical differences over how to address those challenges. \nThat is why it is so nice to work on an issue where the two parties are \nin relative agreement. We are not that far apart on this student loan \nissue now. Neither party wants to see the rates rise in July, and both \nthe President and Republicans generally agree on the way to make that \nhappen. So there is no reason we should be fighting over this issue at \nthis particular point. There is no reason the President should be \nholding campaign-style events to bash Republicans for supposedly \nopposing him on student loans when we are in agreement on the need for \na permanent reform and when the plan we put forward is actually pretty \nsimilar to his own. Yet, somehow, that is what we saw last Friday at \nthe White House.\n  That is certainly not going to help the students. Having a true \npolicy debate is one thing, but provoking a partisan squabble seemingly \nfor its own sake is, frankly, ridiculous. Our constituents sent us here \nto govern, not to try to pick fake fights in some crusade to restore \nNancy Pelosi to her speakership.\n  What I am saying to the President and my Democratic friends is this: \nLet's put politicking aside. There is no reason for a fight here. I \nhope we can finally begin to work. Students are counting on us to \nactually get something done.\n  Here is a quick rundown of where we are on the issue. There is the \nSenate Democratic plan that everyone knows is just a political bill--a \nshort-term fix that would only apply to less than half of the students \nwho plan to take out new loans--new loans--and it would impose \npermanent tax hikes--permanent tax hikes--in return for a temporary \nplan for half of the students. Let me repeat that: Another temporary \nfix paid for with a permanent tax hike. Even the President has \ndismissed this approach. So in my view it is not worth much of a \ndiscussion at this point.\n  The fact is the proposals Republicans put forward are actually closer \nto what President Obama has asked for. We both agree on the need for \npermanent reform that takes the decisions on interest rates out of the \nhands of politicians. The House has already passed a bill that would \nachieve those two goals, and Senate Republicans have put forward a bill \nthat is also similar to the President's proposal, as both of our plans \nwould employ a variable market rate that, as with a mortgage, doesn't \nchange over the life of an individual student's loan. The President \nsaid he opposed a bill that didn't lock in rates. Ours gives students \nthe certainty that the President agrees they should have. So if the \nPresident were serious about getting this done, he would have spent \nthat time on Friday ringing up Senators to see how we could bridge our \nrelatively small differences, not having a press conference and bashing \nCongress. This is one issue where both parties can find quick \nagreement, but only if Washington Democrats have the will to do so. \nYoung Americans already have enough to worry about. They don't need \nWashington creating even more problems for them.\n  The youth unemployment rate for 20- to 24-year-olds is over 13 \npercent. In Kentucky it is more than 14 percent. Once many students \ngraduate from college, they face a highly uncertain future. So the \nPresident has a choice to make: Does he want to push some campaign \nissue for 2014 or does he want to address the problem here and prevent \nthis rate increase?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/04/senate-section/article/S3917-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I listened carefully to the statement made \nby the Republican leader. He talked about the issue of increased costs \nfor colleges, saying the tuition is going up, and we have a student \nloan issue coming up with interest rates perhaps doubling. It was \ninteresting when the Republican leader said the root cause of the \nproblem is ObamaCare.\n  Well, it turns out, if we listen to the statements and speeches from \nthe Republican side of the aisle, if a person's car won't start: \nObamaCare. Too many popups on your computer: ObamaCare. Basically, it \nturns out that every problem in America can be traced to ObamaCare. \nObamaCare, of course, is the health care reform act.\n  The health care reform act said, incidentally, that students in \ncollege can stay on their parents' health insurance plan until they \nreach the age of 26: ObamaCare. It also said those who are receiving \nprescription drugs under Medicare will pay less: ObamaCare. It went on \nto say you cannot discriminate against people when it comes to health \ninsurance if they have a preexisting medical condition: ObamaCare. So \nwhat we hear from the Republican side of the aisle: Any problem we have \nin the Midwest including too much rain in the Midwest: ObamaCare. It \nreaches the point where it strains credibility.\n  Here is what the problem is. On July 1, the interest rates on \nsubsidized loans double--double--from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent if we \ndo nothing. The Republicans in the House of Representatives said they \nhave a better plan. It is a plan which the Republican leader in the \nSenate just spoke to. We are going to move the interest rates--we are \ngoing to peg them to the 10-year Treasury bill, and the next thing we \nknow it turns out the interest rate coming out of the Republican bill \nin the House is higher than 6.8 percent. In other words, if we did \nnothing as opposed to the Republican plan, students would be better \noff.\n  But we have a better idea. We are going to do our best to make sure \nwe preserve the 3.4-percent interest rate on subsidized student loans. \nIs it important? It is critically important.\n  Look what is happening to students across America today. A lot of \nyoung people listen to their parents, listen to their teachers, and all \ntheir friends who say, Go to college, get a degree. It\n\n[[Page S3918]]\n\nis good advice. Then they sit down to figure out what it is going to \ncost and it turns out to be pretty expensive. As I look back on my \ncollege education--I won't tell my colleagues what my student loans \nwere; they will date me--I was scared to death when I ended up with \nthis huge student loan at the end of law school when I accumulated it \nall together. At the time I said to my wife, I don't know if we will \never be able to pay this back, it is so big. It was $8,500--$8,500 for \ncollege and law school--but it was more than half of my first year's \nincome, to put it in perspective.\n  Now look at what students are faced with. The average for-profit \ncollege costs $30,900 a year in tuition fees. These for-profit schools \nI will talk about in a minute are the most expensive schools in \nAmerica. They are the ones trying to lure students into their schools. \nThe biggest ones are the University of Phoenix, which has more students \nthan the combined enrollment of all the big 10 universities; Kaplan \nUniversity, which is owned by the Washington Post; DeVry University out \nof Chicago; and a variety of others. They can't wait to see these \nstudents coming out of high school and to sign them up for these for-\nprofit schools, the most expensive schools in America. There is \nsomething else involved in those schools. They have the highest student \nloan default rates. They charge the students too much for tuition and \nthey offer them too little by way of education and training. A lot of \nkids drop out, and even those who finish can't find a job. They default \non their student loans for these for-profit schools. But take a look at \nthe cost of education in general. Most students, unless they are lucky, \nwith parents who have a lot of money in the bank, have to borrow money, \nand if they have to borrow it, the question is, What do they pay when \nit comes to the interest on the student loans? Private loans--not the \ngovernment loans but private college loans--can have interest rates up \nto 18 percent. So unless a person has taken a course in consumer \neconomics or business in high school, that person may not know what the \ndifference is between 3.4 percent interest on a loan and 18 percent \ninterest. Believe me, it is dramatic. Students are faced with this \nreality.\n  The question obviously is what is Congress going to do about it? If \nwe are going to continue keeping the interest rate at an affordable \nlevel--3.4 percent for student loans--then we are going to have to take \naction before July 1. If we do nothing, it will double. If we do \nnothing, students will pay thousands of dollars more in paying off \ntheir loans.\n  How big is student loan debt in America? Student loan debt in America \nis larger than credit card debt. It is over $1 trillion. It is one of \nthe fastest growing areas of debt in America. As students get \nencumbered by this debt, obligated by this debt, many don't realize \nwhat they are up against.\n  This is not like any other loan a person can take out. Any loan a \nperson takes out for a car or a house or to buy a washer and a dryer is \ndischargeable in bankruptcy. If a person's finances go completely in \nthe tank and that person goes to a bankruptcy court, those other loans \ngo away, but not student loans. There are only four things that cannot \nbe discharged in bankruptcy: taxes owed to the government, alimony, \nchild support, and student loans. What it means is the decision made by \nthe 19- or 20-year-old about debt to go to school is a decision for a \nlifetime. It is going to stick with that person for a lifetime. When \nthe parents sign on as guarantors on these student loans, or \ngrandparents, they are on the hook too. If the student ends up dropping \nout of school, with plenty of debt and no diploma, they are in a bad \nsituation. They still have to pay off the loans.\n  What we are trying to do on the Democratic side is to keep the \ninterest rate on these loans as low and affordable as possible. I think \nthat is only reasonable. Why make it any harder for these students and \ntheir families? The Republican side, sadly, more than doubles the \ninterest rate on student loans. That is a worthy debate. I know the \nside I will be on. I think most Americans know what side we should all \nbe on: to try to keep the cost of these loans closer to being under \ncontrol; to try to keep the interest rate at the 3.4-percent level.\n  Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island recently introduced the Student \nLoan Relief and Refinancing Act which would prevent the interest rate \nhike by moving Federal student loans back to a market-based rate as it \nwas prior to 2007. Senator Reed's bill would offer adjustable interest \nrates for Federal student loans and parent PLUS loans--with a cap of \n6.8 percent for subsidized loans and 8.25 percent for unsubsidized and \nparent PLUS loans. Rates would be set every year based on the 91-day \nTreasury bill, plus a percentage determined by the Secretary of \nEducation to be necessary to cover program administration and borrower \nbenefits. The bill is revenue neutral. The bill will help current \nborrowers by allowing those stuck with high fixed-rate Federal student \nloans to refinance their loans into a new variable rate loan with a \ncap. Many students signed up for loans that were a bad deal and they \nwant to change them but they are stuck with them, so this Reed bill \ngives them a chance to refinance.\n  Congress should consider a long-term interest rate fix, but we need \nto act quickly to stop the interest rates from doubling on July 1. We \nhave a good short-term path that will extend the current 3.4-percent \ninterest rate for 2 years. The bill is fully paid for by closing three \ntax loopholes.\n  Senator McConnell was on the floor here complaining that we are doing \nTax Code changes to keep the interest rates low. Well, here are a \ncouple of the changes he was complaining about.\n  Our proposal would include a tax on the oil and gas companies from \ntar sands so they would put more money into the oil spill liability \ntrust fund. That is one of the things Senator McConnell said is not \nappropriate. The other one would close a tax loophole that allows non-\nU.S. companies to reduce their U.S. tax liability on income from their \nsales in the United States. I do not think that is unreasonable, \nparticularly if the money we are getting from that will help subsidize \na low-interest rate on student loans.\n\n  This bill is a temporary solution, I understand. But it is going to \nsave students in States like my State of Illinois a thousand dollars--\nat least a thousand dollars--by keeping the interest rate low in terms \nof what they will pay back over a lifetime.\n  The complicated proposal that came out of the House of \nRepresentatives--the Republican proposal--as I said, will more than \ndouble the interest rates students are going to face. Parents are going \nto have to have a higher liability on the loans they sign up for for \nthe students in their family, and that, to me, is not a good outcome \neither.\n  There has been a proposal that has been pushed by some of my \nRepublican colleagues--Senators Coburn, Burr, and Alexander--which \nwould adjust interest rates annually for both subsidized and \nunsubsidized loans, and it would be, like the House Republican bill, an \nincrease of 3 percent over the 10-year Treasury rate. There are no \ncaps, incidentally, on where that interest rate is going to go. So the \nstudents could have a liability much greater in the future.\n  Here is what it boils down to: If you believe education is \nimportant--and I think everyone does--if you believe college education \nis a ticket for a better life and a better opportunity to contribute to \nthis country--and most people do--we want to make sure it is affordable \nfor students from working-income homes and middle-income homes. That is \nwhy we want to keep this interest rate low. The Republican proposals--\nall of the Republican proposals--dramatically raise the student loan \ninterest rate beyond the level the Democrats are pushing for.\n  We have heard a lot of comment on the floor. There will be a lot of \ndebate on the floor about a lot of other issues--the IRS and other \nthings such as that. They are all worthy issues worth talking about. \nBut if you talk to the average family in my home state of Illinois or \naround the country, they are going to tell you that something like a \nstudent loan debate is much more important to them.\n  We want to be on the side of working to help middle-income and those \nfamilies who are working for a living, to give those families a chance \nto send their sons and daughters to college to have a better life in \nthe future and not burden them with a loan that is impossible for them \nto pay back.\n\n[[Page S3919]]\n\n  I want to close by saying a word about one category of schools I \nmentioned earlier, the for-profit schools. We have in our country not-\nfor-profit schools that include private colleges and universities as \nwell as public colleges and universities. Then there is a for-profit \nsector of higher education. I mentioned the leaders earlier--the \nUniversity of Phoenix, Kaplan, and DeVry. Those are three of the \nbiggest in the United States.\n  Currently, our Federal Government is subsidizing these for-profit \nschools in ways most taxpayers would not believe. Right now what these \nschools are bringing in is 75, 80, 85, and 90 percent of their revenue \ndirectly from the Federal Treasury. In other words, students come in \nand turn over their Pell grants, sign up for their government loans, \nand all of this government money flows into these for-profit schools.\n  Many of these schools offer valuable courses, but many of them are \nworthless. Many of them, unfortunately, burden these young people with \ndebt and offer them nothing by way of education or training so they can \nhave a better life. As a result, the students end up with a mountain of \ndebt they cannot pay back and they default on the debt. Here are the \nnumbers to keep in mind: There are three basic numbers which explain \nthe for-profit education industry in America.\n  Twelve. Twelve percent of high school graduates go to for-profit \nschools.\n  Twenty-five. Twenty-five percent of all the Federal aid to education \ngoes to for-profit schools; over $30 billion a year to for-profit \nschools. They would be the ninth largest Federal agency if you took \nfor-profit schools in the private sector by themselves; over $30 \nbillion. They would be the ninth largest, but they are private \ncompanies, for-profit companies.\n  The third number to remember is 47. Forty-seven percent of all the \nstudent loan defaults are by students in for-profit schools. That \nnumber tells the story. These poor students are being loaded with debt, \nand they are being given an education that is not worth it. At the end, \nthey cannot pay back their debt and they default on those debts. That \nis the reality of where we are today. In a few weeks--July 1--if we do \nnothing, interest rates on loans at all schools for government loans \nare going to double. If we do something, we can continue to protect \nstudents. But, in addition to that, we have to do something about \nhigher education and what is happening there. It is not just the for-\nprofit schools, many of which are ripping off these students. It is the \noverall cost of higher education. It is going beyond the reach of \naverage families across America.\n  I look back to my own life experience and, thank goodness, I had a \nchance to borrow the money and go to school, get an education, and end \nup, as I say, with a full-time government job. But the bottom line is, \nother people deserve the same opportunity. And if you are not from a \nwealthy family, you should be able to borrow the money to be able to \nget through school and make a success of your life.\n  Let's do our part here. Let's stand behind the working families. \nLet's support the Democratic approach, which will keep the interest \nrates at 3.4 percent. Let's reject the Republican approach that would \nmore than double these interest rates on these students and their \nfamilies. Let's give these young people a fighting chance to get a good \neducation and an opportunity to prosper in this great Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week we lost a Chicago original. \nFather Andrew Greeley was a Catholic priest in Chicago and a man of \ngreat accomplishment.\n  He was a best-selling author, college professor, newspaper columnist, \nand a sociologist at the University of Chicago. Most importantly, \naccording to Father Greeley, he was ``just a priest.''\n  Andrew Moran Greeley was born in Oak Park, a suburb west of Chicago. \nBy the time he was in second grade at St. Angela Elementary School, he \nknew he wanted to be a Catholic priest.\n  After being ordained, he served as an assistant pastor at Christ the \nKing Parish in Chicago and studied sociology at the University of \nChicago. He was released from archdiocesan duties to pursue his \nacademic interests in 1965, but he remained a priest in good standing \nthe rest of his life.\n  Although he never led a parish, Father Andrew Greeley regularly \nfilled in at Saint Mary of the Woods Church in Edgebrook. He would lead \nmass, preach, hear confessions, and officiate at weddings and baptisms.\n  But what brought Andrew Greeley international recognition was his \nwork as a writer, an author. He built an international assemblage of \nfans over a career spanning five decades.\n  Of the 60 novels Father Greeley wrote, some were considered \nscandalous with their portraits of hypocritical and sinful clerics. But \nhe also wrote more than 70 works of nonfiction, often on the sociology \nof religion. His clear writing style, consistent themes, and celebrity \nstature made him a leading spokesman for generations of Catholics.\n  Father Greeley enjoyed being a sociologist and a commentator on \ncurrent affairs. For much of his career, he divided his time between \nChicago and Tucson, AZ, where he taught at the University of Arizona.\n  He also achieved prominence as a journalist, writing a weekly column \nfor the Chicago Sun-Times and contributing regularly to American and \ninternational publications.\n  His weekly columns touched on all sorts of issues. From critiquing \nthe Catholic Church to the war in Iraq, Father Greeley was unapologetic \nin his ``tell it like it is'' Chicago style.\n  In July of 1986, Father Greeley wrote the first of many columns in \nthe Chicago Sun-Times about allegations of sexual abuse by Roman \nCatholic priests. His thoroughly honest and powerful reporting alerted \nthe Nation to this scandal way ahead of many others. It forced the \nChurch to acknowledge that it had a problem and a problem it had to \nsolve.\n  His opposition to the war in Iraq and a war on terror was so deep-\nseated that he compiled his writings and published them in a book. It \nwas meekly titled: ``A Stupid, Unjust, and Criminal War: Iraq 2001-\n2007.'' He gave me an autographed copy of that book.\n  Needless to say, Father Greeley rarely thought twice about holding \nback from saying what he thought.\n  He was criticized by his early critics for ``never having had an \nunpublished thought.'' But his ability to convey his opinion was also \nwhat made him successful in connecting with readers all over the world. \nHe had a popular approach to writing that interested people on issues \nthey normally would not connect with.\n  He attended Quigley Prep in Chicago, received his Licentiate in \nSacred Theology in 1954 from Saint Mary of the Lake Seminary in \nMundelein, and was ordained in 1954 as well. He continued his love of \nlearning by earning a master's degree in 1961 and a doctorate in 1962 \nwith a study on the effect of religion on the career paths of 1961 \ncollege grads.\n  His scholarship led to his longtime position as a senior researcher \non the staff of the university's National Opinion Research Center, \nwhich surveys American opinion on religion and other issues.\n  Later in life, after finding success as a novelist and published \nsociologist, Father Greeley created a foundation to help inner-city \nkids with a $1 million grant to distribute money to Catholic schools in \nChicago with high minority enrollments.\n  Father Greeley's other lifelong love--besides the Church, his family, \nand his writing--was the great city of Chicago. He was a classic \nexample of what Chicagoans call a ``lifer''--someone who never felt at \nhome anywhere other than the Windy City. Father Greeley was fond of the \ndifferent architectures and sculptures atop ordinary buildings around \nChicago, places the common working people lived, but which were adorned \nwith beautiful handmade\n\n[[Page S3920]]\n\nworkmanship. He would take pictures of these buildings and sculptures \nand loved to show them off.\n  He was a great fan of the Chicago Bulls and the Bears, and he never \nstopped praying that the Cubs would one day win another pennant.\n  Father Greeley wanted people to think of him as an honest and humble \npriest. But he was truly one of a kind. He touched and enriched so many \nlives.\n  I remember having lunch with him several years ago. He was just one \nof a kind--a Catholic priest who was part of the world and part of the \nworld's conversation but still dedicated to his vocation.\n  I send my condolences to his sister Mary Jule Durkin, his five nieces \nand two nephews.\n  Father Greeley blessed us with his presence for many wonderful years. \nHis passing is a great loss to the people of Chicago and to his friends \nand fans all over the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as is obvious, the people of South \nLouisiana have been through a whole lot in the last several years--\nHurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, many significant hurricanes since \nthen, most recently Hurricane Isaac, and the BP oil disaster, to name \njust a few really trying tragedies.\n  But now, having survived all of that, having endured through all of \nthat, many residents of South Louisiana think they face a challenge \nwhich is even greater and which is completely wholly manmade; that is, \nthe challenge presented by new changes to the National Flood Insurance \nProgram that many South Louisiana residents fear could make staying in \ntheir homes that they built, following all the rules every step of the \nway, unaffordable. That is a crying shame. We must avoid that happening \nat all costs.\n  First of all, let me underscore that I talk about the folks of South \nLouisiana because I represent them. They have been through so much. But \nthis is a national concern which potentially affects tens of millions \nof residents all around the country, in every one of the 50 States. \nThat too is a reason we must solve this problem.\n  Again, it is simple. When we reauthorized the National Flood \nInsurance Program last year, when we finally got past only renewing \nthat program by fits and starts for a very short-term period, we put \ninto the law several reforms that were supposed to make the program \nfiscally sound. However, as some of those reforms are beginning to be \nimplemented, they threaten to produce sky-high flood insurance premiums \nthat no one at the time we debated these changes--no one at FEMA, no \none in private insurance, and no outside expert--forecasted.\n  These sky-high premiums, if they are allowed to happen, threaten two \nthings: First of all, they threaten, as I said, many good, hard-working \ntaxpayers, residents who have followed all of the rules every step of \nthe way in building their homes, in renovating their homes, and buying \nflood insurance. They threaten their being able to stay in their homes. \nThey threaten the affordability of living that big part of the American \ndream. Second, they threaten making the National Flood Insurance \nProgram sound because if significant numbers of folks cannot stay in \ntheir homes, cannot afford flood insurance, cannot pay into the system \nand therefore leave the system, potentially turn over their keys to the \nbank, walk away, certainly leave the national flood insurance system, \nperhaps leave home ownership, that is a big defeat for the fiscal \nsoundness of the National Flood Insurance Program as well.\n  About 2\\1/2\\ weeks ago I was in Bayou Gauche, which is a middle-class \nneighborhood in St. Charles Parish, LA, up the river from New Orleans. \nI stood in the driveway of a home owned by homeowners who are facing \njust this crisis, just this challenge. As I said a few minutes ago, \nthey have survived a whole lot over the last several years: Hurricane \nKatrina, Hurricane Rita to their west, many major hurricanes since \nthen, including most recently Hurricane Isaac and the BP oilspill, the \nBP disaster. They have survived more than they ever imagined was \npossible in a lifetime. Yet now they are fearful that their greatest \nchallenge is yet ahead. Their greatest challenge is completely \nmanmade--the fact that some of these new changes to the National Flood \nInsurance Program could cost them their house, could make their staying \nin that solid middle-class neighborhood and in their house \nunaffordable.\n  When I was there, when we were talking about this challenge with many \nlocal residents and leaders, those homeowners presented me with this \nbox of keys. It is pretty heavy, but I want the Presiding Officer and \neveryone on the floor to see it. These are hundreds of house keys that \nhave been put in this box by homeowners who face the same threat, who \nsay that if the right reforms and changes are not made, they are \nhanding over these keys. They are handing them over to FEMA, they are \nhanding them over to the Federal Government, they are handing them over \nto the bank because their homes will no longer be affordable. They have \nto have flood insurance if they have any mortgage. Virtually everybody \nhas to have a mortgage to afford their house over time. If flood \ninsurance rates go sky high and rates are really unaffordable, they \nwill be handing over these keys for good.\n  They all know and expect that there are going to have to be changes \nto the program and some significant increases for the program to be \nfiscally sound and pay for itself. They are not arguing with that. I am \nnot arguing with that. What we are arguing against is completely \nunaffordable premium increases, things that will literally drive \nmiddle-class families out of their homes and out of their neighborhoods \nand make their American dream completely unaffordable. That should not \nbe allowed to happen. That should not be allowed to happen because it \nis wrong to give them that uncertainty and that future when they have \nfollowed the rules every step of the way as they existed under the \nNational Flood Insurance Program, under their mortgage, under \neverything else. It should not be allowed to happen because it will \nmean we will never achieve fiscal sustainability if tens of thousands \nand potentially hundreds of thousands of people around the country exit \nthe program as they are threatening to do.\n  We need to take action to be able to assure these homeowners that \nwill not happen to them. With that goal in mind, I am pursuing several \nthings.\n  First of all, some of this can and must be fixed administratively at \nFEMA. I have led several delegations to FEMA to talk about this, to \ndemand that they do what they can under their authority--particularly \nunder the so-called LAMP process--to make sure they get it right, \nparticularly in drafting and issuing new flood maps. LAMP is the new \nprocess that is under way at FEMA under which they are supposed to take \ninto account, in making new maps, all flood protections, all features \nthat are there on the ground to provide homeowners under that terrain \nflood protection, even if it is less than a 100-year level of \nprotection. FEMA is still in the midst of their LAMP process. They are \nnot finished by a long shot. We have to make sure FEMA gets that right, \nbuilds all protection features into their new map before any of those \nnew maps and any of those rates take effect. That is just the biggest \nexample\n\n[[Page S3921]]\n\nof what FEMA needs to do to get it right, what they can do under their \nauthority.\n  Part of this challenge is definitely administrative. That is why I \nhave led those groups to FEMA and why FEMA needs to get it right. That \nis also why I will be presenting this box of home keys to FEMA later \nthis week at the request of these Louisiana homeowners.\n  The other part of our challenge is that we get it right legislatively \nbecause, in addition to everything FEMA can and must do, there probably \nalso needs to be changes to Biggert-Waters to ensure homeowners are not \nthrown out of their homes because flood insurance is now unaffordable. \nThat is why I have teamed up with the senior Senator from Mississippi, \nThad Cochran, in introducing the Vitter-Cochran measure to fix \nprovisions in the National Flood Insurance Program. It will do several \nthings, at least four that are significant:\n\n  First, it would ensure that communities that are developing new maps \nby the end of this year will be able to maintain the old grandfathered \nrates that are subject to change in section 207 of Biggert-Waters.\n  Second, the bill would allow a 5-year phase-in of actuarially sound \nrates for newly purchased homes to require a reasonable phase-in to \nthose higher rates.\n  Third, the bill would authorize State and local governments \nflexibility to directly subsidize homeowners' flood-insured properties \nif that can be part of a solution as well.\n  Fourth, it would require that a minimum of 25 percent of mitigation \nfunding go directly to homeowners in a given year for programs and help \nthat directly impacts homeowners, such as home elevation.\n  I will be advancing that bill along with Thad Cochran and many other \ninterested Members. We will also be looking for amendment opportunities \nto advance those ideas and those provisions as well. Certainly, I am \njoining with my other colleagues from Louisiana, from the Sandy-hit \narea in the Northeast, and from all parts of the country to advance \nthese fixes.\n  Senator Landrieu has an amendment on the farm bill which is on the \nSenate floor now of which I am cosponsor, and I am certainly working \nwith her and many other Members to get this fix, to get it done, to \nreassure these threatened homeowners that help is on the way. We need \nto do this. We need to preserve the American dream and treat these \npeople right, not make their middle-class homes and middle-class \nneighborhoods all of a sudden, through no fault of their own, \nunaffordable. We need to do it for the very goal of putting the \nNational Flood Insurance Program on fiscally sound footing because if \nwe have tens or hundreds of thousands of residents exiting the program, \nturning their keys over, turning them in to FEMA, turning them in to \nthe bank, the National Flood Insurance Program will never get to that \nfiscally sound basis. We will have people exiting the system, no longer \nable to pay premiums. We need to get it right for them. We need to get \nit right for the American dream.\n  I look forward to working with all of our colleagues in doing so \nbecause, again, I started at the beginning talking about what South \nLouisiana has been through--many hurricanes and the BP disaster and \nmore. But this is not a parochial issue. It is not a Katrina issue. It \nis not a Sandy issue. It is far broader than this. This movie is coming \nto a theater near you. I urge Members to learn about that threatened \nimpact on their constituents, on their homeowners, and to immediately \njoin me and many others in this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz).

LAUTENBERG\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I join others of our colleagues in \nmourning the passing of our friend and former colleague Senator Frank \nLautenberg. Senator Lautenberg joined this body in 2003 for the second \ntime. I was immensely struck by his tenacious work ethic and his deep-\nseated devotion to the people of his State, the State of New Jersey. \nThese are attributes that would serve all of us well and served him \nwell and are something to which we can all and should all aspire.\n  Senator Lautenberg's legacy will be forever woven in the fabric of \nAmerica's history. His work on the new GI bill of rights has helped \nensure that thousands of America's fighting men and women receive the \nsupport they need when they come home and the opportunity to become \npart of the next ``greatest generation.''\n  With his passing, the Senate has lost its final member of what we all \nknow or have come to call, as Tom Brokaw did, the ``greatest \ngeneration,'' the World War II generation, the generation my dad served \nin as part of the Army Air Corps in flying B-17s in World War II, and \nmy father-in-law, who landed on Utah Beach on the second day of the \nNormandy invasion. These were great Americans, and it is their \nsacrifice and the contribution they have made to our way of life that \nhave made it possible for America to remain the envy of the world.\n  We are also reminded that our time in this Chamber is fleeting, and \nwe should be humbled by that reminder.\n  There have been 43 new Senators who have come to the Senate since \n2007 alone. The reason I counted is because that was the last time we \ntook up immigration reform--a subject we are going to turn to perhaps \nnext week. Forty-three new Senators since 2007. Perhaps we will have 44 \nby the time we turn to that topic next week. We are reminded it is our \nduty as Americans to ensure this Chamber will host future generations \nof great Americans as well.\n\n  As Senator Lautenberg goes to his rest, my prayer is that his loved \nones can take solace in the fact that he played such an important part \nin the great American story with honor and integrity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/04/senate-section/article/S3921-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3921-S3922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CULTURE OF INTIMIDATION\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the events of the last few weeks have \nthrown a spotlight on a culture in Washington which threatens the very \nfabric of what I just spoke about and that Senator Lautenberg fought \nfor and contributed to, one that would hopefully instill confidence in \nthe American people that what is happening here is in their best \ninterest; that people realize we are the employees of the American \npeople, here to serve their interests. That should be our primary \nfocus.\n  Unfortunately, we have learned a culture of intimidation has arisen \nin Washington, and, unfortunately, it has become all too pervasive and \nthreatens to become a cancer that cannot only destroy the public \nconfidence in their Federal Government but also destroy the nature of \nour democracy itself.\n  We have learned that IRS agents--we don't know how many yet, but we \ndo know that some--were deliberately targeting different political \ngroups because of their political activities. Remember, this is \nactivity protected by the First Amendment of the United States \nConstitution. If it weren't for the political activity of the American \npeople, we wouldn't have this great democracy which is the envy of the \nworld. But we have learned the Internal Revenue Service was asking \ndifferent groups inappropriate questions about their donors, their \npositions on various issues of the day, and the political affiliations \nof its officers and directors. We have learned these abuses went far \nbeyond two rogue employees in the Cincinnati field office; that the IRS \nheadquarters in Washington was involved as well.\n  Of course, the initial story that this was confined to a couple of \nself-starters and free agents in Cincinnati was laughable. We all know \nenough about bureaucracies to know that no one, particularly at a lower \nlevel to midlevel, instigates any sort of initiative as bold and as \ntoxic as this without some sort of approval from on high, whether it is \nimplicit or explicit.\n  We have now learned senior officials in the IRS knew about these \nabuses at least 2 years ago, yet failed to notify Congress or the \npublic. We have learned that one conservative activist from Houston, \nTX, one of my constituents, Catherine Engelbrecht, was targeted by \nmultiple Federal agencies, including the IRS, the FBI, the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and OSHA.\n  We have also learned the Environmental Protection Agency is yet \nanother agency that has discriminated\n\n[[Page S3922]]\n\nagainst political organizations they do not happen to agree with. And \nwe have learned the Obama administration, in the form of the Justice \nDepartment, has treated a reporter as if he were a criminal simply for \ndoing his job.\n  I have seen the explanation of the apologists at the Justice \nDepartment. They said just because they identified James Rosen as a \npotential criminal coconspirator, they never intended to prosecute him. \nThis is part of an affidavit designed to get at certain records that \nMr. Rosen and his family maintained, invading their privacy. It makes \nno sense they would claim in this affidavit, in order to get this \nsearch warrant, that he was a potential criminal coconspirator and at \nthe same time they never intended to prosecute him. Those are simply \nincompatible and inconsistent statements.\n  We have also learned the Department of Justice has conducted a \ndisturbingly intrusive and broad investigation into the phone records \nof journalists who worked for the Associated Press.\n  At the Department of Health and Human Services we have learned that \nKathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, has \nliterally been raising money from private companies she is responsible \nfor regulating in order to fund ObamaCare. That is a conflict of \ninterest, and that is the most charitable thing one can say about it.\n  We have further learned this culture of intimidation has also given \nway to a culture of coverups and misinformation. We have learned more \nabout the Obama administration's dishonest portrayal of the September \n2012 terrorist attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya. We \nhave learned the Obama State Department punished U.S. diplomats, \nwhistleblowers, for cooperating with congressional investigators.\n  Sadly, these abuses are part of a larger pattern that goes back \nseveral years. For example, in 2010, when we were considering the \nmatter of ObamaCare, various health insurance companies began alerting \ntheir customers about what they believed the impact of ObamaCare would \nbe on them, and that specifically, if passed, it would force them to \nraise premiums on their own customers. Secretary Sebelius, at the time, \nthreatened to punish these companies and bar them from participating in \nthe ObamaCare exchanges if they followed through in communicating with \ntheir own customers about what the impact of this legislation would be \non them.\n  By the way, the same IRS official who led the division to target \npolitical speech is now in charge of administering large portions of \nObamaCare, which depends upon the Internal Revenue Service to implement \nso much of it. At a time when the Internal Revenue Service has lost \ncredibility with the American people, it has no business administering \na law that will affect one-sixth of our national economy.\n  The same culture of intimidation we have seen at Health and Human \nServices and at the Internal Revenue Service has also been prevalent at \nthe Justice Department. That should be the bastion of justice and equal \ntreatment under the law, but, sadly, it is not. The case of Fox News \nreporter James Rosen is only the latest example.\n  In recent days we have learned DOJ officials tracked Rosen's \nmovements, got a search warrant to examine his private e-mails, and \neven obtained his parents' phone records. They treated him like a \ncriminal, which is quite remarkable because, as I said, he was simply \ndoing his job.\n  As the Washington correspondent for the New Yorker magazine noted:\n\n       It is unprecedented for the government, in an official \n     court document, to accuse a reporter of breaking the law for \n     conducting routine business of reporting on government \n     secrets.\n\n  I believe national security leaks should be investigated. But what \nabout going after the leaker? We recognize when reporters are targeted, \nit becomes especially sensitive, given the role of reporting the news \nand the freedom of the press guaranteed by the Constitution and the \nneed of our society to maintain the kind of openness that only comes \nwith a free and robust press.\n  In addition to an overbearing surveillance of individual journalists, \nthe Obama Justice Department also targeted whistleblowers in the \nnotorious Fast and Furious investigation. This is where guns were \npurchased in bulk in the United States and allowed to walk into the \nhands of the drug cartels in Mexico.\n  One Department of Justice official, a U.S. attorney in Arizona, tried \nto smear a whistleblower by leaking a private document. The Department \nof Justice inspector general called this behavior ``inappropriate for a \ndepartment employee and wholly unbefitting a United States attorney.'' \nMeanwhile, a separate Justice Department official was forced to resign \nher position when she was caught collaborating with leftwing bloggers \nto slander both whistleblowers and journalists.\n  As you can see, my conclusion there has been created a culture of \nintimidation is not the result of just one incident but a number of \nincidents and data points that, when connected, I think clearly paint \nthat very sad and troubling picture. This culture of intimidation has \nbecome entrenched at Federal agencies and departments all across the \nObama administration.\n  This culture of intimidation was troubling before the IRS scandal \nbroke, and it is even more troubling given all we have learned in the \npast few weeks. So I hope Congress will do its job on a bipartisan \nbasis--as the Finance Committee, under the leadership of Senators Max \nBaucus and Orrin Hatch, have already done on the IRS matter--to \ninvestigate this in a bipartisan way to get to the bottom of this \nmatter, recognizing this kind of abuse of power on the part of the \nInternal Revenue Service can be turned not just against conservative \npolitical speech but also against people on the political left or \nanybody in between. This should not and cannot be tolerated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/04/senate-section/article/S3922-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3922-S3923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE FISCAL CRISIS\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and couldn't agree \nwith him more on a number of the things he listed; in particular, the \nso-called affordable care act, which is anything but affordable.\n  I found out, as I traveled across the State of Indiana and spoke with \nHoosiers, that this law is having an enormous negative impact on the \ndecisions of employers, on health care providers, and on average \ncitizens relative to what is coming down the line within the next \nseveral months and into 2014.\n  This legislation is a colossal mistake. It is a mess. It is \ndistorting the economy, it is keeping people out of work, and it is \nkeeping employers from hiring new workers. People are trying to \nmanipulate the system now because what is being imposed on them is so \nDraconian and unsustainable and unaffordable. That is why we need to \nofficially call this ``unaffordable comprehensive health care reform'' \nrather than the Affordable Care Act. It is unaffordable.\n  But that is not why I came here today. I came here today to talk \nabout our current fiscal crisis. That has sort of taken a back seat to \nthe debates we have been having on the Senate floor, even though they \nare necessary--immigration, which is coming up, the farm bill that we \nare currently dealing with, gun issues, and others. The looming dark \ncloud, the big bear in the closet, is our fiscal crisis, and it is not \ngoing away.\n  Last Friday, the Social Security and Medicare trustees issued their \nannual report on the long-term financial status of the health and \nretirement security programs, and there was a little bit of good news; \nthat is, the current numbers that exist out there and the rate of \nspending down on these programs has slowed somewhat. But it is not the \nkind of news we ought to celebrate.\n  Some are saying: Oh, well, this takes the pressure off. Now we don't \nneed to do anything about the structural reform of our mandatory \nspending for our entitlement programs because, look, we just had a good \nreport. Let's just get back to regular business and we will worry about \nthis later.\n  Well, the fact remains our mandatory spending is not only \nunsustainable, it is having an immediate impact and will continue to \nhave an even greater impact on other essential functions of government \nas the cost of funding for the mandatory systems continues to\n\n[[Page S3923]]\n\nrise--and rise dramatically in future years with 10,000 baby boomers \nretiring every day.\n  Let me repeat that: 10,000 baby boomers are reaching retirement age \neach day, adding to the cost of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social \nSecurity.\n  We have known this was coming for years. We have known it was coming \nfor decades; that an amazing number of people born post-World War II \nnow have worked their way to the point of retirement. This has had an \nimpact on our economy, whether they were babies needing more cribs and \ndiapers, whether they were young children going to elementary school \nand we needed more schools, going to secondary colleges and \nuniversities and we needed to expand those, working their way through \nthe economy, having children--a dramatic impact with this bulge of baby \nboom babies growing up and working their way through the system. Yet \nwhile we knew all this was coming, Congress and the administration \nrepeatedly said: We will deal with this later. It is a crisis, we know, \nbut it is just too tough to deal with now.\n  What I am afraid of is that this latest report which came out and \nprovided a little bit of relief, a little bit of wiggle room, but it \ndid nothing to solve the long-term problem. What I am concerned about \nis that this report may be used to basically say we don't have to do \nanything now.\n  What is the impact? The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nreported earlier this year that spending on mandatory programs and \ninterest on the debt--because we have to borrow to cover this cost--\nwill consume 91 percent of all Federal revenues 10 years from now. \nAlready it is putting the squeeze on discretionary spending because \nwhat this means is that all other spending priorities are being \nsqueezed out by spending on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security and \nsome of the other mandatory programs.\n  If we are interested in a strong national defense, in a solid \neducation system, infrastructure and bridges and paving roads, medical \nresearch, food and drug safety, homeland security, border security--and \nother programs, these programs are getting squeezed every day in terms \nof the amount of resources available.\n  Why these groups don't form a coalition and come marching through the \nHalls of Congress and demand that we take action now on runaway \nmandatory spending, because it is simply wiping out their programs, is \nbeyond me. But it is the nature of the political beast to postpone the \ntough stuff, to not have to get to the point where they have to tell \nanybody no because we want everybody to love us so they will vote for \nus in the next election. It is incomprehensible that we continue to put \nthis off day after day, month after month, year after year, election \nafter election.\n  I have been around a while. How many times have we heard people say \nwe will do that after the next election? That was the mantra in the \n2012 Presidential election. Well, no. You see, the President couldn't \nstep up and do this and the ruling party couldn't step up and do this \nbecause we had a Presidential election. They said that as soon as the \nelection takes place, then we will have a period of time where we have \nbeen reelected to office or we have new Members coming in and we will \nnot have the pressure of an election before us and we will address this \nproblem.\n  Here we are now into the sixth month of this year, when everyone \nknows that the first 100 days of the new administration--or a second-\nterm in this case--is the best time to enact long-term good legislation \nthat addresses major problems--the days are slip-sliding away. The days \nare counting, and we continue debate and talk about and interject \nissues here that, yes, have importance but don't begin to rise to the \nlevel of importance of the need to address our fiscal situation.\n  The other thing I don't understand is why the young people of this \ncountry aren't standing up and demanding that we take action, because \nwe are taking money away from them. We are diminishing their future. We \nare leaving them with a debt burden they may not be able to pay.\n  The International Monetary Fund put out a report recently that to \ncover current obligations for young people, they--not us--will have to \npay either 35 percent more in taxes to keep these mandatory funds alive \nand solvent or receive 35 percent fewer benefits. This is at a time \nwhen our Nation's youth already face an unemployment crisis.\n  It is unconscionable. It is immoral for us to defer and to delay and \nto simply say we can't take care of these issues now and then move on \nthrough our lives, reap the benefits that come from some of these \nprograms, and then hand it over to our children and say: Good luck. You \nare either going to pay one-third more in taxes or you are going to get \none-third less in benefits, lifetime savings, Social Security for your \nretirement, health care coverage for your later years. Good luck with \nthat one. But we couldn't summon the will to do it. We couldn't bring \nourselves to make the hard choices.\n  Are we going to step up to the plate and be responsible? What is our \nlegacy going to be for those of us who are serving now? What are we \ngoing to tell our children and grandchildren? Will we say sorry, we \njust weren't able to do it? It was just too tough politically, we are \nworried about the folks back home that they might not take it the right \nway. It requires a little bit of sacrifice to reform these programs--\nactually, to save the programs--before they go broke. But, no, we just \ncouldn't do it. The President? No; kind of AWOL on this, hasn't stepped \nup. We thought for sure that after reelection, not being elected again, \nwe would get some kind of leadership.\n  I see it slip-sliding away, and now we are faced with that ultimate \nday of crisis when it hits and we have to make painful choices because \nwe have no other choice.\n  So why don't we take the rational approach? Why don't we have \nleadership that steps up and basically says this is what we need to do? \nWhy don't we put the future of America and the future of our children \nand grandchildren and succeeding generations ahead of our own political \ninterests? It is selfish not to do so. I think it is unconscionable. I \nthink it is immoral for us to continue doing this.\n  So I am going to continue to come to the floor as much as I can--I \nhave been doing this all year--and I am going to continue to urge the \nPresident to work with us. I am not making this a partisan issue. We \nare working with people across the aisle who understand this and want \nto do something about it. But we know we can't get it done without the \nPresident taking leadership and standing up and working with us.\n  There is a little bit going on right now, but here we are, 6 months \nlater, and we are not making the progress we need to make.\n  In the end, maybe we will pass another patch of legislation--a little \npatch here, a little patch there--and we will deal with the big thing \nlater. We just can't do it now.\n  For the sake of the future of this country, for the sake of the \nfuture of our children and grandchildren, for living up to our sworn \noath to do what is necessary to continue the great story of democracy \nin this Nation, we need to step up and do this. These reforms are \nnecessary. We all know it. We know the numbers. We know they are \nunsustainable. We know we must address it.\n  I urge my colleagues to do whatever is necessary to make the tough \nchoices. Interestingly enough, that legacy, if we stand up to do it, \nwill be worth whatever results or consequences come from our making \nthese decisions.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/04/senate-section/article/S3923-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I see my distinguished ranking member on \nthe floor. We are proceeding in our work on the farm bill this morning.\n  As we are moving through, we have a lot of discussions going on, \nworking to get agreement on both sides to be able to offer a number of \namendments for votes. We certainly are going to do everything we can, \nworking with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. It is critical that \nwe complete our work, ideally, this week.\n  I appreciate our Senate majority leader understanding what I say over \nand over, which is this is a jobs bill. Sixteen million people work in \nthis country because of agriculture and the food industry. This is \ntheir economic development jobs policy, and it is very important that \nwe complete our work as we have done this last year.\n  Let me remind colleagues again that 1 year ago--and most of us were \nhere at that time--one year ago we worked very hard. In fact, other \nthan the Budget resolution, I think we may have a record for the most \namendments that were voted on, on a piece of legislation. I don't know \nfor sure, but I think it ranks right up there. We voted on 73 different \namendments last year. Every one of the substantive amendments that was \npassed by the Senate is included in the bill that is in front of us, so \nwe start from a bill that was worked on by the entire Senate last year. \nWe are back again working through additional ideas, additional \namendments that people are interested in.\n  It is very important that we complete our work so that, hopefully, \nwhen the House brings the bill to the floor--and we are encouraged. We \nare hearing that within a couple of weeks it will come to the floor of \nthe House--that when they complete their work, we can actually go to \nconference and get a final bill on the President's desk before \nSeptember 30, which is what people around the country are counting on \nus to do.\n  Farmers and ranchers have to do the job in the morning, whether they \nfeel like it or not, because the job is in front of them. They have to \nwork hard and get it done, and we have to work hard and get our job \ndone. This is the time to complete a 5-year policy, and we intend to do \nthat and get it done in time so the right kinds of decisions can be \nmade.\n  Let me stress again that this bill is the one bill that has come \nbefore the Senate and passed last year that has real deficit reduction \nin it. We have looked at every page of what is called the farm bill. We \nhave called ours the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs bill because it \nis just that. It is about reform--reforming policies, cutting waste, \nfraud and abuse and creating more accountability. It is about food \npolicies for our country, nutrition policies for our country, and it is \nabout jobs.\n  We have scoured every page and actually in our process ended up \ncutting over 100 different programs and authorizations by either \ncombining them, cutting down on the duplication and paperwork or \neliminating them if they didn't make sense. If it doesn't work anymore, \nif it doesn't work from the taxpayers' standpoint, if it doesn't work \nfrom the standpoint of agricultural policy, we eliminated it.\n  We took what are currently 11 different definitions of what is \n``rural''--we had local mayors, local township officials telling us \nthey appreciate and count on rural development as their economic \ndevelopment arm for grants and loans for small businesses, for water \nand sewer projects, road projects. Whatever is done in small towns and \nrural communities across the country, USDA rural development is there \nsupporting those local efforts. But they said could you give us 1 \ndefinition of ``rural'' instead of 11, so we can figure out the \npaperwork and know how to interact with the USDA.\n  It sounded simple. It wasn't simple. But we have actually gotten it \ndown to one definition, dramatically cut the paperwork and reformed and \nstreamlined the process for local units of government.\n  We have $24 billion in bipartisan deficit reduction. We have, in \nfact, put together something that is four times more than required of \nthe across-the-board cuts in what has been dubbed sequestration. So \nrather than just doing what we are required to do under the law that \nestablished sequestration, we have gone four times more and created \npolicies supported by farmers, ranchers, those involved in \nconservation, and those involved across our country in every part of \nthe farm bill.\n  We have 12 different titles--and each one could actually be a \nseparate bill if we wanted to--that deal with a wide variety of topics, \nfrom our traditional commodities where there is certainly a lot of \ndebate as we have eliminated subsidies called direct payments and moved \nto crop insurance where it is based on risk. Farmers share in the cost \nof the insurance. There is no subsidy given. They get help if they have \na disaster. If something happens with the weather or there is some \nother kind of disaster, then, similar to any other kind of insurance, \nit helps cover the risk, and that is what we are moving to.\n  Conservation and bringing together 23 different programs; we cut it \ndown to 13, consolidated, streamlined, did a better job with more \nflexibility for communities and have created a conservation title \nsupported by more than 650 different conservation and environmental \norganizations across the country.\n  As to specialty crops, half of the cash receipts of the country \nroughly are something called fruits and vegetables and other specialty \ncrops. We strengthen those efforts, which are very important--local \nfood systems, farmers markets, areas that are very important in growing \nand certainly address the health of our country.\n  I mentioned rural development; an energy title that we have not only \nfocused on in terms of energy efficiency for our farmers on the farm, \nbioenergy, biofuels, but also a new area of reducing our reliance on \npetroleum by using agricultural products and byproducts in \nmanufacturing called biobased manufacturing. That is an exciting new \narea for jobs for us. We are seeing a lot of different possibilities in \nthe area of soybeans. We are seeing soybean oil used to replace \npetroleum oil in things such as foams. If you buy a number of different \nvehicles today and certainly in every Ford vehicle I know that is being \nproduced, the new Chevy Volt, and many other automobiles today, you are \nactually sitting on soybean foam instead of petroleum foam. It is \nbiodegradable. There are a lot of jokes about sitting on soybeans, but \nthe reality is this is something that is creating a market for growers. \nIt is biodegradable, gets us off foreign oil, and is creating jobs. \nThere are a lot of possibilities in this bill for new jobs.\n  We focus on foreign trade. The one area where we actually have a \ntrade surplus in our country is in agriculture. We are, in fact, \nfeeding the world and working with those around the globe to develop \ntheir own food systems. I am very proud of the role American farmers \nplay in addressing hunger around the world as well as international \nfood assistance.\n  We could go on. The bottom line is that this is a bill with \ntremendous impact--16 million people in the country directly impacted \nin terms of their jobs. Every American, if you had breakfast this \nmorning, thank a farmer. If you have lunch today, thank a farmer. If \nyou have dinner today, thank a farmer. We have the safest, most \naffordable food supply in the world because of a group of people who go \nout and take the risk against the weather, which is getting tougher and \ntougher as the climate is changing. They are willing to go out there \nand continue to be in this business. Our bill supports them with tools \nto help them manage their risk through insurance, to help them manage \ntheir risks on the farm in terms of keeping the soil on the ground as \nwell as protecting our water and protecting our air. Those kinds of \ntools are critically important as well.\n  This is a bill we have worked on now twice in the last year--last \nyear, this year--and we are looking forward to having the opportunity \nto bring this to completion, to work with our House colleagues in a \nbipartisan way to provide legislation that is good for those directly \ninvolved in agriculture and that is good for consumers, that is good \nfor taxpayers as we look at ways to reform our government, to work more \nefficiently and effectively on fewer dollars.\n\n[[Page S3925]]\n\n  We look forward to continuing throughout the day working with \ncolleagues. We are hopeful we will have amendments to bring forward, \nbut we do understand we have to move forward and get this done.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Unanimous Consent Request--H. Con. Res. 25\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, Senate Democrats have been waiting a \nvery long time to go to conference on our budget. In fact, it has now \nbeen 73 days. Until recently, we have gotten pretty used to Senate \nRepublicans simply standing and saying no.\n  For months Republicans have been offering a lot of excuses for why \nthey do not want to go to conference on the budget. They have said they \nwant a preconference ``framework,'' which, by the way, is what a budget \nis. They have said they would not allow us to go to conference unless \nwe guaranteed that the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations \nwould be protected from paying a penny more in taxes. They said they \ndid not want a bipartisan conference to take away the leverage they \nhave on the debt ceiling. And then they called for a do-over, which, \nactually, my ranking member on Budget called for again this morning--to \nbring up the House budget, have 50 hours of debate, a whole new round \nof unlimited amendments, go through the process all over, and they did \nthis after they praised the very open and thorough floor debate we had \non the Senate budget.\n  The story keeps changing. But even as some Republicans were focused \non finding excuses to move us closer and closer to this crisis rather \nthan have a budget deal, we have a number of Republicans who are now \njoining with us to call on regular order. Senator Coburn said that \nblocking conference is ``not a good position to be in.'' Senator \nBoozman said he would ``very much like to see a conference.'' Senator \nWicker said weeks ago that ``by the end of next week, we . . . should \nbe ready to go to conference.'' We have known for a while that blocking \nregular order--especially after calling for it so eagerly just a matter \nof months ago--was not sitting well with a number of our Republican \ncolleagues, and now, according to Politico, ``more Republicans appear \nto favor heading to conference than blocking it.'' I welcome that.\n  We need to move this to conference. It is the regular order. It will \nallow us to solve our country's problems, and we truly need a process \nto allow us to deal with our Nation's problems.\n  Senator McCain is on the floor, and I thank him because he \nunderstands the importance not just for this bill but for all \nlegislation in the Senate that we come here, we compromise, we fight \nhard for what we believe in, but at the end of the day just saying ``my \nway or the highway,'' even if you are a small minority, does not move \nthis country to the place where we need it to get to, which is not a \ncrisis-by-management place. I thank him for taking a lead and calling \nfor regular order. He has said that Republican preconditions such as \ndemanding that the conference agree to not raise the debt ceiling or \nraise taxes are ``absolutely out of line and unprecedented.'' Senator \nCollins joined us on the floor a few weeks ago to say that even though \nthere is a lot we do not see eye to eye on, we should at least go to \nconference and make our best effort to get a deal. I could not agree \nmore.\n  The stalling that we have seen is, as some have said on their side, \n``a little bizarre'' and ``ironic to say the least,'' especially after, \nI would remind everyone, 50 hours of debate, innumerable amendments \nthat took us way into the early hours, and we offered everybody the \nchance to speak. After that session was over, many of our Republican \ncolleagues came to me personally and thanked me for finally having an \nopen process. If they want us to have an open process, then they have \nto take that process and take it to the next step.\n  So I am deeply concerned. We are moving toward another manufactured \ncrisis this fall. We have our Appropriations subcommittees that need to \nmove forward. The country is very clearly tired of this country being \nmanaged by crisis. We just had a budget hearing this morning in which \nour witnesses, both Republicans and Democrats alike, said that moving \nus to a manufactured crisis would impact this economy in a horrific way \nthis fall. We do not need to have that happen.\n  I want to go to conference. Do I want to have a compromise? Not \nreally. I love where I stand. But I have been here a long time. You do \nnot get everything you want, but you do have to compromise in order to \nmove the country forward. And I am willing to go to conference with my \ncounterpart, Chairman Ryan, who is on a very different page than I am, \nand find our compromise and be willing to move that forward here in the \nCongress so we can get to a place that allows us to be able to lead \nthis country again. So I think we are at a very critical point.\n  I see Senator McCain is on the floor. I would be happy to yield to \nhim for a comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I understand that one of my colleagues \nwho will object is coming to the floor, so perhaps I would reserve the \nright to object on his behalf even though I am in stark disagreement. \nBut instead I will just make a comment, and I am sure my colleague on \nthis side of the aisle will voice an objection when he arrives.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is here.\n  Mr. McCAIN. He is here.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. If the Senator will yield, I can go ahead and offer the \nunanimous consent request at this time and we can move from there.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If it is OK with the Senator, because we know what is \ngoing to happen, I would like to make remarks, and then the Senator \nfrom Florida will make the same argument that was made the last few \ndays, and fortunately I do not have to listen again.\n  For 4 years Members on this side of the aisle argued strenuously that \nwe were doing a great disservice to the country by not taking up and \ndebating and amending a budget that would then go to conference with \nthe other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives, and then \nwe would do what we expect and, unfortunately, every family in America \nhas to do, and that is to pass a budget under which we would be guided \nin our authorization and appropriations process.\n  Now my colleague from Florida will come to the floor and say that we \nhave amassed a debt because of the budget. But we did not have a budget \nfor 4 years. So how can you argue that the fact that we may go to \nconference on a budget--that somehow that would be responsible for the \ndebt? Obviously, it is nonsense. Obviously, it is nonsense, just as, \nfrankly, it was nonsense when the same group of Senators said we should \nnot even debate gun measures in light of a tragedy that took place in \nConnecticut and another tragedy that took place in Tucson, AZ. They did \nnot even want to take up and debate ideas that some of us had to try to \nkeep weapons out of the hands of criminals and the hands of the \nmentally ill.\n  So now we have a Senate where we refuse to move forward on issues and \nhave open debate and discussion and votes. I have always believed, in \nthe years I have been here, with Republican and Democratic majorities, \nthat the way we are supposed to function is to say: OK, let's give it \nour best shot, and let's do the best we can, and let's have votes.\n  One of our objections against the majority leader was that he would \nnot let us have votes on amendments. We had--I have forgotten how \nmany--votes on the budget that lasted until I believe around 7 o'clock \nin the morning. So the opponents of moving forward on anything cannot \nargue we did not have votes on the budget, cannot argue they were \nblocked from whatever amendment they wanted to have voted on.\n  So now we are faced with a situation where we will not go to \nconference. And I want to tell my colleagues who continue to do this \nthat, with my strenuous objections, the majority will become frustrated \nand the majority\n\n[[Page S3926]]\n\ncan change the rules of the Senate. They can do that. And I must say \nthat although I would strenuously object to a change in the rules, I \ncan understand the frustration many of my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle feel at a failure of a simple process of going to conference \nwhen the majority on the other side of the Capitol is of our party. \nThat is really very difficult to understand, unless you take the word \nof one of my colleagues who came to the floor and said: I do not trust \nDemocrats, and I do not trust Republicans. Let me repeat what he said: \nI do not trust Democrats, and I do not trust Republicans. It is not a \nmatter of trusting Democrats or Republicans. What this is a matter of \nis whether we will go through the legislative process that people sent \nus here to do. And I have probably lost many more times than I have \nwon, but I have been satisfied in the times that I have lost that I was \nable to make my argument, put it to the will of the body, and it was \neither accepted or rejected. That is how people, schoolchildren all \nover America, expect us to behave. That is the way our Constitution is \nwritten. That is what this body is supposed to be about.\n  So when we have a--by the way, Madam President, this is the last time \nI am going to come to the floor on this exercise because it is \nobviously a fruitless kind of effort until something changes, and \nobviously that is not going to happen in the short term.\n  My friends will be saying they are Reagan Republicans, they are \nReagan Republicans. Well, I was here when Ronald Reagan was President \nof the United States. President Reagan, rightly or wrongly, passed \namnesty for 3 million people who were in this country illegally. Ronald \nReagan sat down with Tip O'Neill, and they saved Social Security from \nbankruptcy. Ronald Reagan sat down with the Democrats, and they agreed \non ways of increasing revenues and cutting spending. Ronald Reagan's \nrecord is very clear, and by the way, it was one of an assertive role \nof the United States of America and leadership in the world and not \ncome home to ``fortress America.'' So sometimes when I hear my \ncolleagues here talk about how they are Ronald Reagan Republicans, I do \nnot think Ronald Reagan would have disagreed that we should have a \nbudget, we should have a budget to guide the legislative agenda of the \nCongress of the United States.\n  So, as I said, I will not be coming back to the floor again while my \ncolleagues object. And I see my colleague from Utah who was so \nunfamiliar with what we do here that he claimed it was behind closed \ndoors in back rooms. The fact is that the budget conference is on C-\nSPAN and open to all.\n  So I can just say to my colleagues that this is not a proud moment \nfor me, as we block a process that was agreed to and enacted for many, \nmany years; was not enacted for 4 years over the strenuous objections \nof myself and my colleagues that we did not enact a budget. We enacted \na budget after an all-night marathon of vote after vote after vote on \nliterally any issue, and there was not a single vote proposed by my \ncolleagues here that said that we cannot agree to a lifting of the debt \nlimit. Now, the floor was open for that amendment, and I do not know \nwhy my colleagues now view this as the criteria for us moving forward \non the bill. So I wish them luck, and I will not be coming to the floor \nagain to object to their objection, and we will let the American people \nmake a judgment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nhis very heartfelt remarks. I know he and I do not agree on a lot, but \nwe do agree that we want this country to work because the alternative \nis not great. The way for this country to work is for us to come \ntogether with our differences of opinion and move forward, and that is \nwhat the conference committee is all about.\n  So, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed \nto the consideration of Calendar No. 33, H. Con. Res. 25; that the \namendment which is at the desk, the text of S. Con. Res. 8, the budget \nresolution passed by the Senate, be inserted in lieu thereof; that H. \nCon. Res. 25, as amended, be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table; that the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on \nthe part of the Senate; that following the authorization, two motions \nto instruct conferees be in order from each side: motion to instruct \nrelative to the debt limit and motion to instruct relative to taxes and \nrevenue; that there be 2 hours of debate equally divided between the \ntwo leaders or their designees prior to votes in relation to the \nmotions; further, that no amendments be in order to either of the \nmotions prior to the votes, all of the above occurring with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, reserving the right to object, first, I \nwant to thank the Senator from Arizona for protecting my right to \nobject in my absence before I made it to the floor.\n  Just to set the record straight, I do not think that we object to \nmoving to a budget conference; we object to moving to a budget \nconference and having the debt limit raised within that conference. So \nI would ask the Senator if she would consider adding a unanimous \nconsent agreement and that she modify her request so that it not be in \norder for the Senate to consider a conference report that includes \nreconciliation instructions to raise the debt limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, if the Senator heard my request, I said \nwe would consider a motion to instruct relative to the debt limit as \npart of our agreement to move to conference. So the Senator would be \nallowed to make his voice heard at that time. I would object to making \nit a requirement without a vote of the Senate that says the majority \nagrees with that. So I would object to his amendment and again ask for \nunanimous consent on the original request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Is there objection to the \noriginal request?\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/04/senate-section/article/S3926-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PROVIDING FOR USE OF THE CATAFALQUE\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                     The Past, Present, and Future\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, the Senate, I am learning, is an \ninstitution bound by tradition and precedent. One of the time-honored \nand worthwhile traditions in this body is that new Senators, for at \nleast the first few months of their service, are to be essentially seen \nand not heard until they deliver their maiden speeches on the Senate \nfloor. This, Madam President, I am doing today.\n  As an aside, and in the same vein of new Senators traditionally not \nbeing heard but seen, I may have been well advised for the first few \nmonths of my service to avoid the throngs of reporters who congregate \noutside this Chamber, but it is too late for that. Politicians, after \nall, can only heed so much advice.\n  For the past 12 years it was my privilege to serve in the House of \nRepresentatives, a body that has its own traditions and precedents. At \nits core the House is governed by the concept of majority rule--one \nparty can have a majority of only one or two and, by virtue of the \nrules, can still maintain control of that body. During my time in the \nHouse, I had the experience of being both in the majority and in the \nminority. All things equal, I have preferred the former, but I \nunderstood the power wielded by being in the majority is fleeting. That \nis as it should be.\n  The Senate, on the other hand, is a body governed by consensus. The \nparty holding the gavel is on a short leash. Bringing even the most \nnoncontroversial resolutions to the Senate floor requires the \nagreement, or at least the acquiescence, of the minority party. Over \nthe past decades, both parties have chafed under this arrangement. Both \nparties have at times considered changing the rules that would in some \nway make the Senate more like the House. Both parties have wisely \nreconsidered. The House has rules appropriate for the House. The rules \nof the Senate, however frustrating to the party that happens to wield \nthe gavel, are appropriate for the Senate.\n  I come to this point with great appreciation for those Arizona \nSenators who have preceded me. The 48th State in the Union, Arizona \ncelebrated its centennial just last year. Prior to my swearing in this \nyear, Arizona had sent just 10 Senators to this body. These Arizonans \nwho came before me left more of an impression than simply carving their \nnames in these desks. Few in this body have matched the longevity of \nCarl Hayden. Few have had the lasting impact of Barry Goldwater, who \nhelped launch the conservative movement.\n  I consider it a high honor to follow in the footsteps of Senator Jon \nKyl, whose steady principled leadership shaped Arizona for the better \nand made our Nation stronger and more secure. My constituents now call \nthe same telephone number I once answered as an intern for Senator \nDennis DeConcini. He taught me a great deal about constituent service.\n  Now I have the incredible honor to serve here with Senator John \nMcCain who, as a prisoner of war, taught us all the meaning of \nsacrifice. Since that time he has served Arizona, the country, and the \nSenate nobly and honorably. Fortunately for all of us his service to \nthis institution continues. It is my great privilege to serve with him.\n  The challenges America faces today are legion and growing. Abroad, \ncells of terrorists bent on our destruction continue to incubate. Some \nreceive aid and comfort from countries with long-held grievances and \nirreconcilable enmity toward the United States. Other terrorists take \nadvantage of failed states and lawless regions to hatch their plans.\n  But it is not just individual terrorists or terror cells we have to \nworry about. Countries unbound by the norms and conventions of \ntraditional nation-states now threaten peace. Today our concern is \nprimarily focused on Iran and North Korea, but myriad other countries \nare but one election or coup removed from boiling over into regional \nand international instability.\n  Here at home our fiscal situation is dire. We continue to spend \nconsiderably more than we take in. Worse yet, we have no serious plan \nto remedy the problem in any structural way. We seem to endlessly lurch \nfrom cliff to crisis and back again with fiscal high-wire acts that \nerode the confidence of markets and invite the disdain of our \nconstituents.\n  It is understandable that with 2-year election cycles the House of \nRepresentatives begins to focus on the next election as soon as one \nelection is finished. In the House difficult issues are often avoided \nor perpetually shelved until the next election. But in the Senate we \nhave 6-year terms. Senators, therefore, should come with an added dose \nof courage to take up the thorny and vexing issues on which the other \nChamber takes a pass. It is our responsibility to lead, and if there \nwas ever a time for this body, this Chamber--the United States Senate--\nto lead, this is it.\n  I am a proud and unapologetic conservative and a Republican, and I \nhope my votes will consistently reflect that philosophy. So I am not \nsuggesting we hold hands and agree on every issue or even most issues. \nThere are profound and meaningful differences between the parties. But \nI want to spend more time exercising my franchise while debating the \nlegislation itself and less time on deciding whether such legislation \nshould be debated on the Senate floor.\n\n  There is a time and a place for using supermajority rules to block \nlegislation and/or nominees from coming to the Senate floor; there is a \ntime and a place for partisanship but not every time and not every \nplace.\n  This country yearns for a functioning Senate, a Senate that \nrecognizes the gravity of our fiscal situation and its responsibility \nto propose and adopt measures to solve it for the long term. This \ncountry yearns for a Senate that exercises its prerogative as part of \nthe first branch of government to rein in executive branch excesses in \nboth domestic and foreign affairs.\n  Domestically, the parade of missteps and abuses at the IRS and other \nFederal agencies stand as exhibit A of the need for more robust \nlegislative direction and oversight. Recent Presidents, both Republican \nand Democratic, have exercised authority in the foreign arena far \nbeyond that contemplated for a Commander in Chief, often obligating \nfuture Congresses to financial commitments far beyond security \narrangements. A better functioning Senate, less distracted by games of \nshirts and skins, would not countenance such theft of its authority.\n  Now is not the time for this institution to retreat into irrelevance, \nwhere the sum of our influence is to sign off on another continuing \nresolution to fund the government for another 6 months; where success \nis measured by how well our tracks are covered when the debt ceiling is \nraised; where prioritizing spending cuts are avoided by invoking \nanother sequester. No, we have been there, done that. It is time now \nfor the Senate to lead.\n  There are encouraging signs we may be moving in this direction. \nEarlier this year a budget was passed by this Chamber. It wasn't a \nbudget I preferred, but I was given ample opportunity to offer and \ndebate amendments to that legislation, as were my Republican \ncolleagues. We came up short, but at least the Senate got back to \nregular order.\n  In the coming weeks this body will consider an immigration bill. \nImmigration reform has been and remains a complex and vexing issue, \nwith Members holding strong and discordant views on many of its facets. \nStill, a bill having had a thorough vetting in committee will now be \nallowed to come to the Senate floor to be debated, amended, and, \nhopefully, improved upon. This is the way it should work.\n\n[[Page S3928]]\n\n  To conclude, a few days after last November's election, the 12 newly \nelected Senate freshmen were invited to the National Archives. We were \ntaken to the legislative vault where we viewed the original signed \ncopies of the first bill enacted by Congress, as well as other landmark \npieces of legislation and memorabilia. Oaths of allegiance signed by \nRevolutionary War soldiers witnessed by General Washington, and \ndocuments and artifacts related to the Civil War, segregation, and \nwomen's suffrage were also on hand. It was an affirmation to me of the \ntumultuous seas through which our ship of state has sailed for more \nthan 200 years.\n  We have had many brilliant and inspired individuals at the helm and \ntrimming the sails along the way. We have also had personalities \nranging from mediocre to malevolent. But our system of government has \nsurvived them all.\n  Serious challenges lie ahead, but any honest reckoning of our history \nand our prospects will note we have confronted and survived more \ndaunting challenges than we now face. This is a durable, resilient \nsystem of government, designed to withstand the foibles of men, \nincluding yours truly.\n  It is the honor of a lifetime just to be here in this storied \ninstitution--more than I could have ever hoped for. My modest hope \ngoing forward is that my contributions will in some small way honor the \nSenate's storied past and help it realize its full potential as the \nworld's most deliberative body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, first let me congratulate Senator Flake \non his maiden speech. It was very thoughtful and I think a challenge to \nthis body to get back to the work it has been given by the American \npeople.\n  I come to the floor to once again talk about the 4,670 victims of gun \nviolence we have seen across this country since December 14.\n  December 14 is a date that everyone in Connecticut knows but, as time \ngoes by, maybe fades from the memories of other Americans. That is the \nday in which a deranged young man walked into Sandy Hook Elementary \nSchool in Newtown, CT, and gunned down 20 6- and 7-year-olds, in \naddition to 6 teachers and education professionals who were charged \nwith taking care of those kids. That is a day none of us will ever \nforget.\n  We came to the floor of the Senate in the weeks and months that \nfollowed with the intention of passing legislation that would make sure \nwe did everything within our power to assure that another Sandy Hook \ndidn't happen somewhere else in this country. But we also were \nendeavoring to do something about the all too routine gun violence that \nhas plagued our cities and our suburbs--frankly, almost every community \nin this country.\n  This is a stunning number. Since December 14 of last year, in just \nover 6 months, 4,670 people have died from gun violence, and during \nthat time the Senate and the House of Representatives have done nothing \nto try to change that reality. I will at least give this body credit; \nwe debated a bill in the Judiciary Committee and we brought it to the \nSenate floor. Because of the rules of this place, unfortunately, 55 \nvotes was not enough to get a gun violence package passed that would \nhave imposed criminal background checks on thousands of gun purchases \nthat now operate outside that system that would have made it a Federal \ncrime to illegally traffic in guns, that would have placed more \nresources in the hands of mental health professionals. At least in the \nSenate we tried to do it. The House, on the other hand, has taken no \nsteps to try to cut down on the 4,670 deaths all across this country \njust in the last 6 months.\n  What I have tried to do every week since the failure of that bill is \nto come down to the floor of the Senate. Instead of talking over and \nover about the policy implications or the different ways and paths we \ncan get to a gun violence package, instead, I think it is important to \ntalk about the victims. Who are these 4,670 people? Because their \nstories should be the ones that move this place to action.\n  One such story as that of Matthew Tarto, age 16, who died just a few \ndays ago, May 24. He was killed implausibly by his father. His 52-year-\nold father killed his 16-year-old son in an apparent murder-suicide.\n  Matthew was an amazing young man. He was a backup offensive lineman \nfor his high school, John Curtis Christian School. He was a superior \ntrack and field athlete. He was an honor roll student. His friends \ncalled him a happy-go-lucky kid. They said he always had a smile. His \nfootball coach said:\n\n       This kind of thing is unbelievable, that something like \n     this could happen. The only way we know how to get through \n     this is with deep prayer. I just feel so heartbroken, not \n     only for his family but for the kids, his friends and his \n     teammates.\n\n  We talk a lot about the fact that it is important to change gun laws. \nThere are others who say that all of our emphasis should be on early \nintervention; that our mental health system should be the sole focus of \nthis place so we can stop these murders before they happen. But as we \nknow, often we can't see these things coming.\n  The case of Matthew Tarto is such an illustration. Neighbors said \nthey never saw any signs of trouble from this household. In fact, one \nneighbor remembers seeing the father and the son taking walks together \nthrough the neighborhood just days and weeks before this happened.\n  Matthew was an amazing guy: honor roll student, great athlete, \nfriendly, happy-go-lucky kid, but in an awful murder-suicide, he was \ntaken from us, as well as his father.\n  Another 16-year-old 3 days beforehand was gunned down in the Back of \nthe Yards neighborhood of Chicago. Angel Cano was killed with a gunshot \nwound to the head. He was pronounced dead on the scene, according to \nthe Cook County Medical Examiner's Office.\n  His father had brought his oldest son to Chicago from Mexico in 2004 \nin search of a better life. His father said his son just desperately \nwanted to be someone. His son, at 16 years old, had dreams of becoming \na singer or a professional soccer player. He was always down at the \nlocal soccer fields playing soccer, endlessly, teaching other young \nkids how to be better soccer players. At 16, he still had this dream. \nYet apparently on the way back from the soccer fields that evening, he \nwas gunned down. The police have said it may be gang related, but the \nfamily says that Angel was never, ever affiliated with any gangs.\n  Then, lastly, the story of Jamica Woods. Ms. Woods was 37 years old. \nThe night before she died, on May 20, her boyfriend uploaded pictures \nonto his Facebook page of a shotgun, along with pictures of a shotgun \nshell, that he had recently bought at Walmart. He uploaded the pictures \nbecause he had already set about a plan to kill his girlfriend the next \nnight.\n  According to police, Ms. Woods had taken out an emergency protective \norder against her boyfriend last December, but she had never gone about \nthe process of finalizing it. She was in the process of kicking her \nboyfriend out when she got killed. Had she just taken a few more steps, \nit is possible he would have never been able to buy that gun in the \nfirst place. If she had taken those steps to fill out a protective \norder and if that order had been filed and if the Walmart had run a \nbackground check and found that protective order, it is possible she \nwould still be alive today.\n  Frankly, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of men and women \nacross this country who are alive today because of that law--because of \nthat law that came so very close to saving Jamica Woods: a protective \norder being filed due to domestic violence, a gun purchase being \nstopped because of that order.\n  One of the reasons we have that law on the books today is the \nadvocacy of Senator Frank Lautenberg. Senator Frank Lautenberg, who \ndied this week, made it his life's cause to try to make the streets of \nhis State of New Jersey safer. He was advocating right up until his \nfinal days on the floor of this Chamber to enact a ban on high-capacity \nmagazines such as the one that killed 20 little 6- and 7-year-olds in \nConnecticut.\n  But he was successful in passing through this Chamber a piece of \nlegislation that keeps guns out of the hands of people who have been \nconvicted of domestic violence. It is a law that has worked. It is a \nlaw that has saved the\n\n[[Page S3929]]\n\nlives of hundreds, if not thousands, of men and women all across this \ncountry. It is a reminder that this place can do something about the \n4,670 people who have died since Newtown due to gun violence.\n  Frank Lautenberg knew this place had the power to save lives by \nenacting commonsense gun violence legislation--in his case, just a \nsimple rule that if someone has been convicted of domestic violence, \nmaybe they shouldn't get their hands on a gun.\n  Senator Lautenberg's work is a reminder that whether it is next \nmonth, later this year or next year, we still have work to do to try to \nhonor the memories of the thousands of victims of gun violence all \nacross this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I rise this afternoon to say a few \nwords about the immigration reform bill that, as I understand it, we \nwill begin discussing next week. As the son of an immigrant, somebody \nwho came to this country at the age of 17 without a nickel in his \npocket and who was able to send his two kids to college, needless to \nsay I support immigration. Our country is unique in the world. Our \ncountry is great because we are the sons and daughters of immigrants. I \nthink we should all be very proud of that.\n  I also commend the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy and Senator \nSchumer and Senator Durbin--all of those people who have been working \nvery hard on what I consider to be a good and strong immigration reform \nbill. Here are some of the very strong components of that bill that I \nhope every Member of the Senate would support: That is the need for a \npathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants in \nthis country. Bringing undocumented workers out of the shadows and \ngiving them legal status will make it more difficult for employers to \nundercut the wages and benefits of all workers and, in my view, will be \ngood for the entire economy.\n\n  I have always--and continue to--strongly support the DREAM Act part \nof the immigration reform bill, which is to make sure that children of \nillegal immigrants who are brought into this country by their parents \nyears and years ago are allowed to become citizens.\n  I strongly support a number of the provisions that deal with \nagriculture. Some years ago I was in Immokalee, FL, a place that I \nsuspect has some of the most exploited workers in America. They pick \nthe tomatoes which go to the fast-food restaurants throughout this \ncountry. I can tell everyone that in the State of Vermont, we have \ndairy farms that are now dependent on foreign labor, and it is \nimportant that we treat those workers with dignity and give them legal \nstatus. It is extremely important to have an approach which provides \nlegal status for agricultural workers.\n  I obviously support making sure our borders are strong and that we \nstop illegal immigration as best we can, and I applaud the committee \nfor including all of those provisions in the immigration bill that is \ngoing to come to the Senate I expect next week.\n  What I worry about very much, and have deep concerns about in terms \nof the current legislation, is that while we have made a good step \nforward in terms of improving our economy as to where it was in the \nmidst of the financial crisis, we still have a long way to go. The real \nunemployment rate in America is not 7.5 percent. That is the official \nunemployment rate. The real unemployment rate is closer to 14 percent. \nIf we include those people who have given up looking for work in high-\nunemployment areas and people who are working part time and want to \nwork full time, the real unemployment rate is closer to 14 percent. In \nother words, if we include unemployment among minorities as well as the \nyoung people in this country, we continue to have a very serious \nunemployment problem in the United States of America, and it is an \nissue with which we have to deal. I have a number of ideas on how to \ndeal with it. One thing we sure as heck do not want to do is make a bad \nsituation worse.\n  It seems to me that in a moment when our middle class continues to \ndisappear, when millions of workers are working longer hours for lower \nwages, when median-family income has gone down by $5,000 since 1999, it \ndoes not make a lot of sense to me that we have an immigration reform \nbill which includes a massive increase in temporary guest worker \nprograms that will allow large multinational corporations to import \nhundreds of thousands of temporary blue-collar and white-collar guest \nworkers.\n  One of my major concerns is that corporate America is sort of using \nimmigration reform as a means to continue their effort to lower wages \nin the United States of America, and we must not allow that to happen.\n  We all know we have a serious crisis in terms of the high cost of a \ncollege education, which is another issue we are going to be dealing \nwith soon on the floor. One thing I can say--and I suspect I speak for \na number of other Members in Congress--is if we didn't come from a \nfamily with a lot of money and we needed to get some financial help in \norder to pay for college, we worked in the summertime. I find it \nalarming that within this bill we are looking at a situation in which \nwe are importing a lot of young people from Europe and elsewhere to \nfill jobs which young people in this country need in the summertime to \nallow them to get going in terms of their careers and allow them to \nmake a few bucks in order to help them with their college education.\n  I understand that jobs such as a waiter, waitress, or busboy--and I \ndid some of that when I was a kid--are not glamorous jobs. But you know \nwhat. They help a little bit as far as paying for college. I know it is \nnot glamorous to work as a lifeguard, at the front desk of a hotel or \nresort, as a ski instructor, as a cook or chef in a kitchen, as a \nchambermaid, or as a landscaper. The jobs I just mentioned will not pay \nhuge amounts of money, but for someone who needs to figure out how to \npay for college in the fall, those jobs help. For someone who needs \nsome experience in order to get their career off the ground, those jobs \nhelp. I am concerned that kids in this country are going to be looking \nfor jobs and employers are going to say: Well, actually we don't have \nany jobs; the job has been filled by some young person from Eastern \nEurope. So I want us to take that issue into account.\n  Theoretically the J-1 Program is supposed to bring young people into \nthis country so they can learn about our culture. It is a program to \nexpose young people from around the world to American culture, and that \nis a good thing. I believe in that. I believe young people in America \nshould have the opportunity to go abroad, and young people from around \nthe world should have the opportunity to learn about America. It is a \ngood thing.\n  I fear this J-1 Program is being exploited by corporations such as \nHershey's and McDonald's in an effort to simply bring students from \nabroad to work at low-paying jobs in the United States.\n  Supporters of the temporary H-2B Guest Worker Program claim there are \nnot enough Americans willing to do these types of jobs; that in essence \nwhat they are saying is the young American people are too lazy to work \nat these jobs. I do not accept that. I truly do not accept it. I think \nit is a slap in the face not only to our young people but to the many \nworking people who do not have much in the way of an education and want \nto work so they can earn some money. It is a slap in the face to say to \nthose people: No, we are going to have to bring people in from abroad \nto do those jobs, such as being a waiter, waitress, chambermaid, or \nlifeguard. These are not high-tech skilled jobs; these are jobs our \nyoung people can do and need to do.\n  I have a great concern about the transformation of the J-1 Program \nfrom being a program dealing with American culture to being one where \ncorporations are exploiting young people from abroad to work in low-\npaying jobs in the United States.\n\n[[Page S3930]]\n\n  I also find it interesting that instead of raising wages in this \ncountry to attract workers, what many of these companies are doing is \nbringing in people from abroad. We know what supply and demand is \nabout. What we learned in economics 101 in college is that if an \nemployer cannot find a certain type of worker, the way to entice that \nworker is to raise wages. Instead of raising wages, what employers are \nsaying is: We have huge amounts of cheap labor all over the world. \nInstead of raising wages for American workers, we are going to bring in \ncheap labor from around the world, and I think that is wrong. I think \nas we deal with this legislation, this is an issue we have to address \nfront and center.\n\n  When we talk about H-2B jobs, what we are talking about is people who \nmay be working as a landscaper, amusement park worker, housekeeper, \nwaiter, or waitress. Further, during the summer, businesses are using \nguest worker programs to hire young people from other countries to be \nlifeguards.\n  Maybe I am mistaken, but I kind of think there are young people in \nthis country who can work as lifeguards and hold other positions in \nsome of the resorts all over this country. We are talking jobs such as \nbeing a ski instructor in Vermont. I can tell everyone that in the \nState of Vermont, we have a whole lot of young people who are very good \nat skiing and can teach skiing. We don't need people from Europe to \ntake those jobs away from young Americans.\n  Let me be clear--and I find this to be interesting, if not ironic--\nthe same corporations and businesses that support a massive expansion \nin guest worker programs coincidentally happen to be the same exact \ncorporations that are opposed to raising the minimum wage. These are \nthe same corporations that support the outsourcing of American jobs, \nnot to mention the same corporations which in some cases have reduced \nwages and benefits for American workers at a time when corporate \nAmerica is making record-breaking profits.\n  In too many cases the H-2B Program for lower skilled guest workers, \nas well as the H-1B Program for high-skilled guest workers, is being \nused by employers to drive down the wages and benefits of American \nworkers and to replace American workers with cheap labor from abroad.\n  Here is what it comes down to: supply and demand. If the employers of \nthis country need labor, let them start raising wages for American \nworkers rather than bringing in cheap labor from all over this world. \nThe immigration reform bill that passed the Senate Judiciary Committee \ncould increase the number of low-skilled--I hear speeches here that we \nare going to have these genius high-tech guys who are going to start \ncompanies and create all kinds of jobs. Great. That is not what we are \ntalking about here. We are talking about an immigration reform bill \nfrom the Judiciary Committee that could increase the number of low-\nskilled guest workers by as much as 800 percent over the next 5 years \nand could more than triple the number of temporary white-collar guest \nworkers coming into this country. During the next 5 years, H-1B high-\nskilled visas could go from 85,000 to as many as 230,000. The number of \nH-2B low-skilled visas could go from 65,000 to as many as 325,000. The \nnew W visa program for low-skilled workers could go as high as 200,000.\n  The first question the American people and Members have to ask is, is \nunemployment throughout America in States such as Arizona, Oklahoma, \nVermont, Michigan so low right now that we desperately need more and \nmore foreign workers to fill jobs Americans cannot fill?\n  The high-tech industry tells us they need the H-1B Program so they \ncan hire the best and the brightest science, technology, engineering, \nand math workers in the world, and that there are not qualified \nAmerican workers in these fields. Let me be the first to admit that in \nsome cases I believe that is true. I have spoken to employers in \nVermont. I suspect it is true all over this country, that there are \nareas where companies cannot find the skilled workers they need so they \nneed employees from abroad, and to the degree that is true, let us \naddress that issue. But let's also give some facts which suggest that \nmay not be quite as true as some of the employers and corporations are \nsaying.\n  In 2010, 54 percent of H-1B guest workers were employed in entry-\nlevel jobs. So the argument is: Hey, we need all of these brilliant \nguys who are going to start companies and create jobs. In 2010, 54 \npercent of the H-1B guest workers were employed in entry-level jobs and \nperformed ``routine tasks requiring limited judgment'' according to the \nGovernment Accountability Office.\n  In 2010 the official U.S. unemployment rate averaged more than 9.6 \npercent per month. Why couldn't these types of jobs be performed by \nAmericans?\n  So, again, the point is--I know some of my friends say: Every one of \nthese guys is some genius who is going to start a company. I wish that \nwere the case. Many of these are lower wage, entry-level jobs that \ncertainly American workers could do.\n  Further, only 6 percent of H-1B visas were given to workers with \nhighly specialized skills in 2010. That is the issue I keep hearing \nabout, highly specialized skills, but only 6 percent of H-1B visas went \nto those folks. More than 80 percent of H-1B guest workers are paid \nwages that are less than American workers in comparable positions, \naccording to the Economic Policy Institute. Over 9 million Americans \nhave degrees in a STEM-related field, but only about 3 million have a \njob in that area.\n  Last year the top 10 employers of H-1B guest workers were all \noffshore outsourcing companies. Let me repeat that. One of the great \ncrises we have faced in the last 30 years is that companies have shut \ndown in America, moved abroad, and gotten cheap labor abroad. The top \n10 employers of H-1B guest workers were all offshore outsourcing \ncompanies. These firms are responsible for shifting huge numbers of \nAmerican information technology jobs to India and other countries. \nNearly half of all H-1B visas go to offshore outsourcing firms, while \nless than 3 percent of them apply to become permanent residents.\n  Further, half of all recent college graduates majoring in computer \nand information science did not receive jobs in the information \ntechnology sector. In other words, we have large numbers of Americans \nwho are graduating with degrees who can handle these jobs. Yet we are \nbringing in large numbers of people from abroad to do them. It doesn't \nmake a whole lot of sense to me.\n  Not only would the Senate immigration bill greatly expand the number \nof H-1B guest workers, it also would provide an unlimited number of \ngreen cards to foreign graduates who receive a master's degree or a \nPh.D. in a STEM-related field. If we are going to provide green cards \nto every foreign student with an advanced STEM degree, what purpose \ndoes the H-1B program serve other than to suppress the wages of \nAmerican workers who are already struggling? At the very least I \nbelieve we should prohibit offshore outsourcing firms from hiring \ntemporary guest workers.\n  Under the Senate immigration bill, the number of college-educated H-\n1B guest workers and STEM green card holders who are under 30 years of \nage will exceed the number of jobs that are available for young \ninformation technology graduates. What message does that send to young \npeople in our country who are interested in pursuing careers in \ninformation technology?\n  Making matters even worse, I am very concerned that Senator Hatch was \nable to gut the very modest reforms to the H-1B program designed to \nprevent companies from replacing American workers with H-1B guest \nworkers. At a minimum it is essential that these proworker reforms be \nput back into the bill before it is passed by the full Senate.\n  This country was built by immigrants. I am a son of an immigrant, and \nmany of us are. I believe we are a nation that wants to see \ncomprehensive immigration reform passed. I certainly do.\n  Again, I wish to congratulate all of those people who have worked on \nthis bill because there are a lot of very important and positive \nprovisions in the bill. But I think we have to improve the bill as it \nleaves committee and as it comes to the floor of the Senate. What we \nwant to make certain of is\n\n[[Page S3931]]\n\nthat at a time when this country continues to struggle economically, \nwhen millions of people are working longer hours for lower wages, when \nminority unemployment is extraordinarily high, we do not take any \naction that lowers wages or increases unemployment for American \nworkers.\n  Again, my congratulations to those who worked on this bill, but we \nhave a whole lot of work to do as the bill reaches the floor, and I \nintend to be working with my colleagues to make those improvements.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Vermont that I \nappreciate much of what he had to say, and I look forward to working \nwith him to see how we can best address some of his very legitimate \nconcerns.\n  I would point out to my friend from Vermont that there is going to be \na requirement for any of these foreign workers that first the job be \nadvertised in a variety of ways to make sure there are no American \nworkers who would take these jobs. I hope that to some degree resolves \nsome of his concerns. But I paid close attention to his statement, and \nI look forward to addressing some of those very legitimate concerns. I \nthank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and call up McCain amendment No. 956.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I object. Reserving the right to object, \nI have some difficulty with the amendment the Senator from Arizona \nwishes to discuss. I have been trying to get a vote on amendment No. \n1113 on flood insurance, and one of the Members from the other side is \nholding it up. So until we get things worked out--and I hope the \nSenator from Arizona will appreciate the predicament we are in. I am \nhappy for the Senator to discuss his amendment, but to call up an \namendment and to then vote on it, I would have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Louisiana \nallowing me to discuss my amendment. I am deeply appreciative.\n  This amendment would eliminate a proposed catfish inspection program \nwithin the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA. The Government \nAccountability Office, GAO, warns that this catfish program will be \n``duplicative'' and ``wasteful'' of federal resources. I am grateful \nfor the support of my colleagues who have cosponsored this amendment: \nSenators Shaheen, Crapo, Coburn, Cantwell, Murray, Warner, Ayotte, \nRisch, Kirk, Lautenberg, and Inhofe.\n  Mr. President, I will ask to add the following senators as cosponsors \nto this amendment: Senators Whitehouse, Reed, Heller, and Cowan.\n  When Congress passed the 2008 Farm Bill, a small provision was \nquietly added in conference that requires USDA to establish an office \nto inspect catfish. Just catfish. According to USDA, setting up the \ncatfish office will cost taxpayers about $30 million, and then cost \nanother $15 million a year to operate. At least 95 new government \ninspectors would be hired, trained, and placed throughout the United \nStates to inspect catfish. I support ensuring that our Nation's food \nsupply is safe--except that USDA is not in the business of inspecting \ncatfish or any other seafood. USDA is responsible for inspecting meat, \npoultry, and egg products. All other food, including seafood, is \ninspected and certified by the Food and Drug Administration, FDA.\n  There is no such thing as ``USDA Grade A seafood.'' So why should we \nspend millions in taxpayer dollars every year to inspect catfish? GAO \nasked the same question and in 4 different reports concluded that the \ncatfish office is duplicative of FDA functions and explicitly \nrecommended that Congress repeal it.\n  It's ``duplicative'' because we would be wasting tax dollars on \nhaving USDA inspectors doing the same work alongside FDA inspectors. \nThis would be a burden to any business that stores, processes or \ndistributes seafood.\n  According to a GAO report titled ``Actions Needed to Reduce \nFragmentation, Overlap, and Duplication,'' GAO said: ``We suggest that \nCongress repeal the provisions that assigned USDA responsibilities for \nexamining and inspecting catfish'' because ``USDA plans are essentially \nthe same as FDA's hazard analysis requirements.''\n  In another report published in 2011, GAO said the USDA catfish \nprogram ``fragments our food safety system'' and ``splits up seafood \noversight between FDA and USDA, expending scarce resources.''\n  In another GAO report, simply titled--``Responsibility for Inspecting \nCatfish Should Not Be Assigned to USDA,'' GAO said: ``[USDA] uses \noutdated and limited information as its scientific bases for catfish \ninspection'' and that ``the cost effectiveness of the catfish \ninspection program is unclear because USDA would oversee a small \nfraction of all seafood imports while FDA, using its enhanced \nauthorities, could undertake oversight of all imported seafood.''\n  GAO is not the only critic of the catfish office. The Centers for \nDisease Control reports that of the 1.8 billion catfish meals enjoyed \nby Americans, only two people get sick a year. FDA requires foreign \nproducers to abide by the same food safety standards as domestic \nfacilities and turns away unsafe seafood. In fact, USDA itself says \nthere is no benefit for having them inspect catfish. A report issued in \n2010 by the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service said, ``There is \nsubstantial uncertainty regarding the actual effectiveness of the \ncatfish inspection program'' and that there is ``no rational \nrelationship'' between the Catfish Office and human health. That is \nprobably why the President's Budget for FY2014 proposes to eliminate \nthe program. If USDA can't justify a catfish inspection program--how \ncan anyone in Congress?\n  The USDA catfish does nothing to enhance food safety. GAO says it's a \nsham. USDA says it's a sham. FDA says it's a sham. OMB says it's a \nsham. So why did Congress propose it in 2008? It turns out there's a \ngroup of domestic catfish farmers in two or three southern States that \nare having a difficult time competing against catfish importers. In \nclassic Farm Bill politics, they worked up some talking points about \nhow Americans need a whole new government agency to inspect foreign \ncatfish imports.\n  Unfortunately, there are grave trade implications if we don't repeal \nthe catfish program. Trade experts warn that Vietnam and other Asian \nexporters of catfish have a strong case that the USDA Catfish Office \nwould constitute a WTO violation.\n  I have a letter from former Congressman and WTO appellate judge Jim \nBaucus to Congress concerning the WTO risk posed by this catfish \noffice. He says, ``There was, and still is no meaningful evidence that \ncatfish, domestic or imported, posed a significant health hazard when \nCongress acted in 2008 to shift [catfish] jurisdiction from FDA to \nUSDA, in essence singling out catfish from all other seafood \nproducts.'' He goes on to say, ``the United States would face a \ndaunting challenge in defending the catfish rule . . . it will be \ngiving other nations an opening to enact `copycat legislation' which \nwill disadvantage our exports.'' This is ``particularly inopportune'' \nin the face of Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, negations that are \nimportant to American exporters.\n  The trade concern is that USDA catfish office is a de facto trade \nbarrier on foreign imports. It is meant to enrich the domestic catfish \nindustry. The USDA would ban catfish imports for 5-7 years while USDA \nduplicates FDA's rules for foreign catfish farms. During that time, \nAmerican farmers, dairymen, cattle growers risk WTO retaliation against \na $20 billion export market for American soybean, pork, beef, dairy, \nand poultry exports.\n  Is it worth sacrificing the export markets of our American beef \nproducers, wheat and soy farmers just because southern catfish farmers \ndon't want to compete? Absolutely not.\n  USDA catfish office serves no public health purpose and duplicates \nFDA work in inspecting catfish. It wastes millions of tax dollars just \nso that southern catfish farmers will have less competition. My \namendment would eliminate the USDA catfish office just as GAO \nrecommends.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n[[Page S3932]]\n\n  I also wish to say to the distinguished managers of the bill that \nthere are a number of amendments--my colleague from Oklahoma has them--\nand it is going to be regrettable if we are not able to take up and \naddress these amendments. It is not really what we had agreed to when \nwe took up the bill. So I hope there will be another opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I do not like at all objecting to the \nMcCain amendment, but I am compelled to because I have been literally \ntrying for several weeks now--not just on this bill but the previous \nbill--to get a vote, just a vote. I will even take a 60-vote threshold. \nI am not asking for a 53-vote threshold; I will accept a 60-vote \nthreshold on an amendment that will make it clear that we could \ngrandfather in flood insurance rates until an affordability study that \nwas supposed to be done is done.\n  The interesting thing about this is that my amendment has no score. \nIt wouldn't cost the Federal Government anything if this amendment were \nto pass. It is a zero score. It simply delays for 3 years a certain \ncategory of flood insurance premium until an affordability study can be \nconducted. It is a zero score.\n  Unfortunately, the Senator from Pennsylvania, to my knowledge, is \nstill holding up this amendment. So I know there are other Republicans \nwho would like to offer amendments, but I am going to object to the \noffering or voting on any Republican amendments until the Senator from \nPennsylvania allows me to have a vote on my amendment.\n  I hate to be here because I don't like being in this position, but I \nhave no choice because I can't even get the Republicans to vote on the \nflood insurance amendment. They can vote no. The amendment may not \npass. I think I have the 60 votes to pass it. I hope it will. We have \nexplained it. It is important not just to Louisiana but to New York, \nCalifornia, New Jersey, and even Virginia has some issues.\n  Please understand, because I have a lot of respect for Senator \nCoburn--he and I work together on the Homeland Security Committee. I \nknow this program has to be self-sustaining over time. No one depends \non it to be self-sustaining more than the people in Florida and \nLouisiana and California. But there is a right way to get it self-\nsustaining and there is a wrong way. The wrong way is going to blow up \nthe dreams of people who built their homes according to official flood \nmaps, who did everything they were supposed to do under the official \nflood maps, and then when those maps changed, their rates then can go \nup 25 percent, compounded for the next 5 years, not only pricing them \nout of the market but making their homes unsellable, and it affects \nbanks in these communities.\n  This is not just a Louisiana issue. I am proud to advocate so much \nfor my State that when people come here and see me, they say: Oh, there \nshe goes again, advocating for Louisiana. I wear that as a badge of \nhonor. Let me be clear. My State has the 32 lowest kinds of rates of \ninsurance on these claims. I am not even in the top three. This is \naffecting States--and I read them out earlier. Let me just say for the \nrecord that the top 10 States affected are Rhode Island, Connecticut, \nMassachusetts, Vermont, New York, Maine, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, \nAlaska, New Hampshire, Illinois, Michigan, West Virginia, Missouri, \nIndiana, Iowa, California, and Ohio. These are the States with the \nhighest premiums now, and they could double or triple--actually almost \ntriple--in the next 5 years.\n  Maybe some of these rates need to go up. Interestingly, when the \nrecalculations are done, some of the rates around the country will go \ndown. I am not disagreeing with that. What I am disagreeing with is the \nrapid rate in which it is going to happen, and it is going to have \ncatastrophic effects on many communities--not all but many--and I \nhappen to represent some of those on which it will. So my realtors have \nasked me to stand up for this. My homebuilders have called with \nconcerns. My community bankers are very concerned.\n  I wish to thank the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from \nMississippi. I know they are doing their very best job to move this \nbill forward. I think they have been quite fair, giving people on both \nsides an opportunity for amendments. I have been very patient. I have \nnot objected to many amendments. The irony of this is that even the \nToomey amendment--the Senator from Pennsylvania, my friend, who was \ngoing to end a program that was vitally important to my State, I even \nallowed him to have a vote on that. I mean, it is a terrible amendment \nfor Louisiana. We were happy we beat the amendment, but I even allowed \nhim to have a debate. I could have stopped it. I am one Senator here. \nOne Senator can stop anything. But I am not trying to stop this, I am \njust trying to advance a vote on flood insurance.\n  So maybe Senator Coburn and Senator McCain can be more convincing to \ntheir colleague from Pennsylvania than I have been. But I will just say \nfor the record that if I have to stay on the floor until the end of the \nweek, I will have to stay here, but I will object to any Republican \namendment until we get a vote on the Landrieu-Vitter, et al., Schumer, \nGillibrand, Menendez--and our good friend Senator Lautenberg who just \npassed was also a supporter. I would like to keep his name on it, if I \ncould.\n  I yield the floor, and I am very sorry, I say to my colleague from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I somewhat associate myself with the \nremarks of the Senator from Louisiana. We have unwound because we don't \nwant to have real debates and real votes. We just fixed the flood \ninsurance program. We didn't fix it well enough, and if Senator \nLandrieu is allowed her amendment, I will vote against it, but I think \nshe ought to be able to have her amendment.\n  The reason the Senate isn't working is because we want to use a \nprocedure that has never before been used except in the last 2 or 3 \nyears in this body, and that is to limit the rights of Senators to \noffer amendments.\n  The fact is that Senator Landrieu may, in fact, win her amendment, \nbut there is another chance. The House may not go along with it. There \nwill be a conference committee. It may not go anywhere. She didn't win \nthis when we fixed the flood insurance. She wasn't for us raising it to \nthe extent we did. We didn't raise it nearly enough to make it healthy \nyet. And delaying the 3 years will markedly hurt the Flood Insurance \nProgram, which is operated through FEMA, and I am the ranking member on \nthat subcommittee. But the fact is that she ought to be able to offer \nher amendment. I agree with that.\n  So what I am going to do is painfully go through and talk about every \namendment I have for the farm bill. I understand there will be \nobjections. If there are objections to mine--and even if the Landrieu \namendment gets cleared, I am going to object to everybody else's until \nmine are cleared.\n  So we can either keep going around in this circle or we can start \nacting like grownups and have debate. Even if a Member doesn't like an \namendment, we can vote on it. And if a Member is not capable of \ndefending their vote on any issue, they don't have any business being \nhere in the first place.\n  But to not vote, to not allow the managers of the bill to operate the \nbill the way they want to operate it and put it on the table--because \nthe majority leader is going to file cloture, and so all of these \namendments are going to fall, which may be pleasing to the managers--I \ndon't know--and only the germane amendments are going to be available, \nand they are going to be under a time constraint. So the American \npeople are actually going to get cheated out of a full and rigorous \ndebate on what ought to be changed in this bill.\n\n  So I am going to act as though the amendments are approved even \nthough they are not, and I am going to debate the amendments. I am \ngoing to propose every one of them, and I am going to let the Senator \nfrom Louisiana object, and then she can explain to her constituents the \ndysfunction of the Senate. It does not just happen on the Republican \nside, I would remind my colleague from Louisiana. There are plenty of \nunilateral objections on the other side. And if we are going to operate \nthis way, then nothing is going to happen in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S3933]]\n\n  With that, I will begin.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my friend. Before the Senator \nproceeds with his unanimous consent request, I would ask the Senator if \nhe would agree that when we brought the farm bill to the floor the last \ntime, we had 73 votes and it was done in a large agreement, but we \nworked through every one of them. I agree. My preference is--as I know \nour distinguished ranking member's preference is--to be able to work \nthrough amendments and to have votes and so on. Would the Senator agree \nthat process worked last time--and I know my friend did not end up \nvoting for the final bill, but we did work through a process of 73 \nvotes; it was a very long day or 2 days, I think, actually--and that \nwould be a good way to proceed on this bill?\n  Mr. COBURN. I agree.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I certainly yield back to my friend, but \nI just want to indicate that is what we have been working on doing, and \nwe do, in fact, have objections from various Members for various \nreasons. But we have been spending our time hoping to come up with--\neven postcloture it would be our desire to come up with a finite list \nof amendments that we could then move forward and get an agreement to \nvote on because I am very happy to have additional votes on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and Coburn amendment No. 1003 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am going to talk about this amendment. \nThis is an amendment that prohibits--let me set the stage for it. We \nare going to have somewhere between a $500 billion and $700 billion \ndeficit. We have $17.5 trillion worth of debt today. What this \namendment does is it prohibits people who are tax evaders from \nreceiving government assistance, including grants, contracts, loans, \nand tax credits provided in the farm bill, with the exception of SNAP. \nSo we are still going to take care of the food provision. Even if they \nrefuse to pay their taxes, we are going to still provide them food. But \nwe are not going to allow them, with this amendment, to take advantage \nof other programs within the farm bill or any other area that is \nassociated with direct grants or associated with the Agriculture bill.\n  The most critical issues facing our country today--and everybody \nknows how to solve it. We know what has to be done to save Medicare. We \nknow what has to be done to save Social Security. We know we need to \nreform the Tax Code so we generate more jobs, we generate more income \nto the Federal Government. We know all that. But we have billions of \ndollars that are owed--it is not being contested; it is owed--and then \nwe turn around to those same people who owe us billions of dollars and \ngive them programs and benefits. Whether it be conservation payments or \nwhether it be crop insurance or whatever it is, we turn around and give \nthem money. I think the average tax-paying American does not agree with \nthat.\n  Part of being a responsible citizen is paying the taxes you owe. We \nare not talking about things that are in dispute. We are talking about \nsettled agreements that are not paid, and they continue to not be paid, \nand it is billions of dollars.\n  This provision would not apply if the individual is currently paying \nthe taxes, interest, and penalties that are owed to the IRS: if the \nindividual and the IRS have worked out a compromise on the amount of \ntaxes, interest, and penalties and it is in the process of being \nrepaid; if the individual has not exhausted his or her right to due \nprocess under the law; if the individual has filed a joint return and \nsuccessfully contends that he or she should not be fully liable for the \ntaxes in a joint return because of something the other party to the \nreturn did or did not do. Further, this provision would not apply to \nSNAP payments provided in the bill.\n  Farm income is subject to very little scrutiny and reporting \nrequirements. In fact, there was a 78-percent reporting gap in farm \nincome reported to the IRS just last year--a 78-percent gap. This is by \nfar the largest gap in individual income reporting to the IRS.\n  In a time of strict budgets and when many in Washington are calling \nfor an increase in revenue, it is inappropriate for us to continue to \nprovide funding to individuals who owe back taxes and are not in \ncompliance with their obligations. Total taxes owed in the United \nStates in 2006 were $2.66 trillion. The gross tax gap for that year--\ntaxes owed but not collected--was $450 billion. The net tax gap in \n2006--taxes still not paid after late payments enforced--was still $385 \nbillion. Now the President wants another $600 billion or $800 billion. \nWhat we have to do is start figuring out ways to collect the taxes that \nare owed.\n  According to the Internal Revenue Service, the difference between the \namount legally owed in taxes and the amount actually collected was this \n$385 billion. That is the most recent year the IRS can give us--5-year-\nold data. Mr. President, $28 billion that was owed was because people \nfailed to file. Underpayment was $46 billion, and intentional \nunderreporting of income was $376 billion.\n  So what this amendment does is it just puts a prohibition in place. \nIt says: You cannot have this money if you owe X money and it is \nsettled, it is not under dispute. So it is not about not giving people \ntheir rights. It has already been adjudicated. Why would we not want to \ndo that with the farm bill? Can you think of a reason why we would not \nwant the people who owe taxes, who already have agreed they owe the \ntaxes--that we are going to give them money, and they are not going to \npay the taxes they owe the Federal Government?\n\n  It is a commonsense amendment. We are not going to get a vote on \nthat, and we are not going to get a vote on it because we have cowardly \nMembers of the Senate--and I am not talking about the Senator from \nLouisiana--who refuse to come down here and voice their objections to \nbills and refuse to debate why they will not allow an amendment that \ndoes something for the future, that actually will make a difference in \na kid's life in the future, that will actually increase some income so \nwe can afford the Flood Insurance Program we have. They will not come \ndown and debate it and express an opinion why they will not allow a \nvote on it. It dishonors the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside and amendment No. 1004 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I object to that as well, but I know the \nSenator wants to speak about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this amendment ends conservation payments \nto millionaires--people who make a million bucks a year.\n  We have a rule at the USDA that says people making $1 million a year \nare not supposed to get these payments. But guess what the USDA does. \nThey waive the rule. What this amendment would do is say you cannot \nwaive the rule.\n  If you, again, are talking about our debt, the very well-heeled, the \nvery well-connected are getting a majority of the conservation payments \nin this country. They are the ones most capable of doing conservation \non their own land, and do, but now they do it with the assistance of my \nor the President pro tempore's grandchildren because what we are \nactually doing is paying them dollars that our grandkids are going to \nhave to pay back. What we are doing with this program is incentivizing \npeople to do what they are already going to do in their best interests.\n  All I am saying is, enforce the rule, the law today. Do not give the \nDepartment of Agriculture the ability to waive. If somebody is making \n$1 million a year, they do not need our help right now. Our kids need \nthat help, our grandkids need that help, our schools need that help. \nThey do not need that help.\n\n[[Page S3934]]\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for actually a \nquestion and a clarification?\n  Mr. COBURN. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I have good news for the Senator. On page 309 of the \nbill, based on the fact that we took the amendments from last time, his \nlanguage is in the bill. It was part of the 73 amendments that were \noffered. As I indicated earlier, we included everything that was, in \nfact, passed by the Senate on the floor last time so that people would \nknow that their amendments were included in the bill. There was one \nexception to that, which was the Coburn-Durbin amendment, which was, in \nfact, revoted on and is now a part of the bill. But I refer the Senator \nto page 309, section 2610, ``Adjusted Gross Income Limitation For \nConservation Programs.'' So the Senator is correct. It was passed last \ntime. And the good news is that it is in the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Well, Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the \ncommittee. I will double-check that with my staff. This excludes \nsomething that was in the bill, so I will have to look at what the old \nbill said to be able to concur with that. If that is the case, then \nthere should not be any problem with accepting this amendment if, in \nfact, it is not complete because it is the intent of the authors--both \nthe chair and the ranking member--that this limitation be a part of \nthis farm bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, if I might, I say to the Senator, we \nwill work with you and look at the intent, and it is the intent. I \nwould also just in passing indicate that hopefully we will have an \nopportunity, as we come to a universe of amendments, as we did last \nyear, to have the Senator's previous amendment that he talked about, \nwhich is also one that I support.\n  So as we work through this, again, what we need to do is what we did \nlast time: to come up with a universe--it can be large or small--and in \nthe interest of time make sure a variety of Senators have the \nopportunity to offer different amendments as well--not just one or two \nSenators but that a number of Senators have the opportunity to--and \nhopefully Members will be willing to come together and put together a \nlist that includes Senator Landrieu's flood insurance amendment, which \nis absolutely critical. We have other amendments. Senator Grassley has \nan amendment we have been working on to pair with Senator Landrieu's \nthat we would like very much to put together. I would be very \ninterested in including Senator Coburn's amendment No. 1003, which he \ntalked about previously, because I think it makes sense.\n  So right now we are at a point where we just have to get people \npositively working together on a list that we can move through \ntogether. But the good news is, I say to Senator Coburn, the one you \nare speaking about, I believe, is as you had offered it last time. But \nwe will be happy to work with the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside and amendment No. 1005 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, 3\\1/2\\ years ago, with the debt limit \nincrease, my colleagues and I overwhelmingly voted to ask the GAO to \nstudy duplicative programs in the Federal Government. This last April \nthey gave the third in what will be a continuing rollout of the \nprograms in the Federal Government.\n  I will say that the Director of the OMB followed another amendment \nthat I offered directing that all the programs of the Federal \nGovernment be published. They made their first stab at that. This was \nlast week. Director Burwell, in whom I have the utmost confidence at \nOMB--a stellar individual--made the first attempt. The problem is, what \nis a program in the Federal Government? There is no definition. So we \nhave a rough start in an attempt to do that.\n  But what the GAO has done--and they are magnificent employees--over \nthe last 3\\1/2\\ years is identified at least $250 billion of waste and \nduplication that we ought to be getting rid of.\n  Here is an amendment that is not highly prescriptive but recognizes \nwhat GAO told us about food assistance programs--domestic food \nassistance programs. We did not make any attempt in this bill to \nstreamline those or consolidate them or put metrics on them. So this \namendment tries to bring that together through the USDA to put, No. 1, \nmetrics on them; and, No. 2, combine the ones that are duplicative so \nwe can actually be effective in what we intend them to be, but also be \nefficient.\n  Those are two words that hardly ever happen in Washington, \n``efficiency'' and ``effectiveness.'' GAO found signs of overlap and \ninefficient use of the resources within the 18 different programs. Now, \nwe have 18 different programs. Three of them are outside of the \nDepartment of Agriculture. One of them is in Homeland Security.\n  First of all, there should not be a food assistance program in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Two of them are at HHS. We should not \nhave duplicative bureaucracies in those other two departments when we \nhave a bureaucracy in Agriculture. But of those 18 programs, what they \nfound was the following: In 11 of the 18 programs, there was not enough \nresearch to even determine whether the programs were effective.\n  We do not know if what we are doing is working because never when we \npass these programs do we require a metric or some type of method to \nassess their effectiveness. So that is one of the things this amendment \nwill do. It allows the Department of Agriculture to do that. As a \nmatter of fact, it mandates it. Is it effective? What parameters are \nyou using to say it is effective? In other words, if the American \ntaxpayers are going to spend money on this program, ought they to know \nwhether it works? I mean, only in Washington do we do programs and not \nknow whether they work and not ask whether they work.\n  So in 11 of the 18 programs there is not enough knowledge even at the \nDepartment of Agriculture to know whether they are working. This \namendment requires the Department of Agriculture to evaluate the \nfollowing 10 programs: Child and Adult Care Food Program, the Community \nFood Projects Competitive Grant Program, the Emergency Food and Shelter \nNational Board Program, the Grants to the American Indian, Alaska \nNative, and Native Hawaiian Program, the Organizations for Nutrition \nand Support Services Program, the Food Distribution Program on Indian \nReservations, the Fresh Fruit and Vegetables Program, the Senior Farmer \nMarket Nutrition Program, the Summer Food Service Program, the \nEmergency Food Assistance Program, and the WIC Farmers Nutritional \nProgram.\n  Now, let me just mention one of these. The Summer Food Service \nProgram, as announced by KOTV in Tulsa, OK, just last night, no matter \nwho you are they are going to feed you two meals a day in the summer, \nwhether you make $100,000 a year or whether you are in need of a meal. \nSo, first of all, we have a problem with that program. We ought to be \nsupplying food for people who need food, not for people who do not need \nfood. Smart people are going to take advantage of that and say: Man, I \ncan get two meals a day. I am not in need, but since it is free I am \ngoing to take it.\n  Last summer we served 180,000 meals in Tulsa. A large proportion of \nthose were not people in need. So I have no objection to helping people \nwho have need, but here is a program that has no limits on it and no \nmetrics on it. It is a wide open program--well intentioned, but there \nis not a metric and there is not a limitation.\n  So here is all we are saying with this amendment: Here are 10 \nprograms, Department of Agriculture. Determine whether they are \neffective. And, by the way, how did you determine that? What were the \nparameters you used to do that?\n  That is just common sense. Why would we not want to know if the \nprograms are working? Why would we not want to know if they are \nefficient and\n\n[[Page S3935]]\n\neffective? Why shouldn't we look at it when we are running--we are down \nto 24 cents on the dollar that we are just borrowing against our kids' \nfuture from 48. That is because of the economy growing last year to the \ntune of $360 billion coming in, and $620 billion over the next 10 years \nin tax increases on the very wealthy in this country. So we are down to \n24 cents, but we are still borrowing 24 cents out of every dollar we \nspend. Why would we not want to spend the time to make sure these \nprograms are effective and efficient?\n  It is very straightforward. This amendment also eliminates one \nprogram, the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, and moves any \nincomplete or ongoing projects to the appropriate USDA programs. USDA \nproposed eliminating this program which targets low-income pregnant \nwomen, children, persons age 60 or over, but Congress continued to fund \nthe program. The reason they wanted to get rid of it is because there \nare already programs that duplicate this one. Yet here we find it is \nstill going to get funded. It is going to get authorized. Even USDA \nsays we do not need this program.\n  It is the only program we have--in 2012, the program was funded at \n$177 million, and it duplicates SNAP, Grants to Native Americans, the \nHome Delivered Nutrition Program. In other words, USDA already \nrecognizes it is a duplicative program. They have asked for it to be \neliminated. We did not eliminate it. So this amendment would eliminate \nit.\n  This amendment also eliminates the Senior Farmers Market Nutrition \nProgram and moves the nonduplicate function to the WIC Farmers \nNutrition Program. Both of these programs do exactly the same thing. \nThey provide grants to participating States to offer vouchers and \ncoupons and electronic benefit cards to low-income participants that \nmay be used in farmers' markets, roadside stands, and other approved \nvenues to purchase fresh produce.\n  They provide exactly the same assistance to women, children, and \nseniors and should be combined. GAO says they should be combined. USDA \nsays they should be combined. But they are not combined in the bill. \nAll cost savings from the elimination of those consolidations and three \neliminations are directed toward providing food assistance. In other \nwords, none of the money comes back out. It goes back into programs \nthat have proven to be effective.\n  This amendment also directs the USDA to coordinate with the Health \nand Human Services Administration on Aging to identify and address \nfragmentation, overlap, and duplication between the programs providing \nfood services on Indian reservations where we have a real need. So we \nare not just looking for duplication, we are looking for gaps in \nservice.\n  It also requires them to report their recommendations back to \nCongress. Since I do not want to use my big slides today I will use my \nsmall slides.\n  Here are the food assistance programs, all 18 of them. Fifteen are \nrun at the Department of Agriculture, two are run through HHS, and one \nthrough Homeland Security. Yet GAO says we can collapse these 18 into \n10 and be more effective and get better nutrition to the people in at-\nrisk groups. We have not done it. So it is like we asked GAO to do all \nof this work, and then we did not pay any attention to it.\n  I ask that the pending amendment be set aside and amendment No. 1006 \nbe called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I object. May I say something? First of all----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will yield for a question, but I will not yield the \nfloor. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would ask the Senator, does he know that some of us \nare very sympathetic with the amendments he is offering, and does he \nknow some of us would actually really like to vote on some of those \namendments? I am sure he is aware. Is he aware that I am sorry that I \nhave to object, but it is the only way I can get my amendment up.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would respond to the Senator from Louisiana, I have no \nill will toward her objection. I stated it plainly before. I believe \nthe Senate ought to have any and all amendments prior to cloture. I \nthink Senators have the right to offer anything they think is pertinent \nto this country on any bill that is going through here. I used that \ntactic for the first 3 years I was in the Senate. Nobody objected. Now \nthat we have become so partisan and so cowardly that we are afraid to \nvote on issues, and that we abuse the rights in the Senate to the \ndetriment of the whole body, I hold no ill will against the Senator for \nobjecting.\n  The point is, is the country worse off for it? I am sure some of my \ncolleagues do not want to have to vote on some of my amendments. I \nunderstand that. There are amendments I do not like voting on either, \nbut I have no problem going home and taking a stand. The fact is we can \nfigure out what we are for and what we are against. You know, the fact \nis, when it goes through here it does not mean it is law. What it means \nis it has to be conferenced with the House. We ought to let it roll. We \nought to open the spigot and let things roll in the Senate, have the \nvotes.\n  We used to have 10 and 12 votes at a time. We used to do bills. Come \ndown and all morning long we would be offering amendments. We would \nhave committee hearings and other things in the afternoon. At 4 o'clock \nwe would come down and vote, 9, 10, 8 amendments. The next day we would \ndo the same thing. The next day we would do the same thing.\n  So the fact is, if we really want to get our country back, if we \nreally want the confidence of the American people to return to those \nwho represent them in Washington, we have to start saying, you know, \nyou cannot win everything. I am going to try. If I lose, I lose. But I \ntried hard. That is how we ought to play the game.\n  The fact that we have people abusing the process on both sides, not \njust one side--I will never forget, former Senator Akaka, one of the \nloveliest men I have ever met in my life, when I first came to the \nSenate and offered an amendment that was not germane, he objected to \nit. One of my colleagues stood up and said: Senator Akaka, do you \nreally mean that? You have to understand where that starts. If you \nobject to his amendment, that means in the future I am going to be \nobjecting to your amendment, and we have not done that. What we \nactually want is a free-wheeling, open amendment process so people can \nbe heard.\n  The fact is I represent 4 million people. The Senators from \nCalifornia represent 37 million. Everybody's voice ought to be heard. \nWe each ought to be able to have our voice heard. We each ought to be \nable to offer amendments. We ought to be able to get votes on those \namendments. What are we afraid of? Is the next election really that \nimportant that we do not want to allow people to offer their ideas, in \nwhat used to be the greatest deliberative body? It certainly is not \nnow. It is not anywhere close. Do we really not want ideas to be \noffered and debated and the American people to understand what is at \nstake?\n  I mean, what I have offered today maybe not everybody would agree \nwith, but you cannot disagree that it does not make sense; that it is \nnot common sense; that we should not be more efficient and more \neffective; that we should worry about the future as we worry about the \npresent; that we ought not to be spending 24 cents out of every dollar \nby borrowing it from other people in the world or having Ben Bernanke \nprint it at the Federal Reserve.\n  We can solve these problems. The grown-ups need to stand and say we \nare going to have debate, we are going to have amendments, even if we \ndo not like them.\n  So I have no ill will toward the Senator from Louisiana. I have ill \nwill for the process that has devolved. I think the shame is that the \nAmerican people are being shortchanged by the lack of debate and lack \nof votes.\n  I think this amendment, even though objected to, is another critical \narea where we do not have our eye on the ball. This is an amendment \nthat relates to the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program. What it does is \nin this bill it has been increased, the amount of money has been \nincreased to $70 million a year. It was at $55 million in 2012. There \nis nothing wrong with having this block grant program, but I want to \nshow you how we can save $75 million over the next 5 years. And $75 \nmillion is not chump change, it is $75 million.\n\n[[Page S3936]]\n\n  The amendment freezes spending for the specialty crop block grant at \n$55 million authorized by the bill. The amendment prioritizes food \nsafety and access to affordable foods for schoolchildren and low-income \nfamilies. One-third of the projects funded by the Specialty Crop Block \nGrant Program last year were for marketing and promotion. They were not \nfor kids, they were not for seniors, they were spending money to \npromote.\n  Let me show you who got the money. Let's see. We spent money to \npromote the emotional benefits of real flowers and plants in the home. \nThat has to be a priority right now; is it not? We are going to borrow \n$500 billion this year. We are going to spend money to make sure \neveryone in America knows the emotional value of having real flowers \nand plants in the home. That is a priority right now. How about grant \nfunds for floats that travel to fairs and festivals and encourage \npeople to eat more fruits and vegetables? That has to be a priority. We \nare going to pay for a float that goes around to all these festivals so \nwe can promote eating. People know about eating properly. Could we \nspend that dollar in a better way and get a better effect?\n\n  How about wine receptions and tasting? By the way, the Market Access \nProgram already covers it, but we take money from this block grant \nprogram and promote wines in China and in Taiwan. We do it also with \nthe Market Access Program. Here is an absolute direct duplication. We \nare spending millions of dollars promoting something that another \nprogram is designed to promote, and we didn't do anything about that.\n  How about a short video showcasing pear growers and promoting State \nwines in Mexico and in India? Again, duplication of what the Market \nAccess Program does, but we take from the Specialty Crop Block Grant \nProgram. We have one program for market access and promotion and then \nwe take a different program and use it for exactly the same thing.\n  Specifically, the amendment requires that no less than 80 percent of \nthe total funding appropriated for the Specialty Crop Block Grant \nProgram be spent on the following: increasing access, availability and \naffordability of specialty crops for children, youth, families and \nothers at risk, including but not limited to specialty crops for meals \nserved at schools and food banks; ensuring food safety; protecting \ncrops from plant pests and disease; and production of specialty crops.\n  That is what it was originally set up for, by the way. It wasn't set \nup to promote wines in India or China or Taiwan or Brazil or Mexico. So \npart of it is the way we wrote the bill that allows USDA to give grants \nthat go outside the original purposes of it. Funds could still be spent \non marketing promotion but not at the expense of crops and consumers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and \nCoburn amendment No. 1007 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, may I ask the good \nSenator from Oklahoma, since he has talked about three amendments, may \nI ask unanimous consent for my amendment, to see if anybody would \nobject to it?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would be happy to yield a limited time for the Senator \nto ask for unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Louisiana \nis recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will try to do this in less than 3 minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and \nthe following amendments be made pending en bloc: Landrieu No. 1113, \nJohnson No. 1117, Cardin No. 1159, and Grassley No. 1097; that the time \nuntil 5 p.m. today be equally divided and controlled in the usual form \nand that at 5 p.m. the Senate proceed to vote on the amendments listed; \nthat there be 2 minutes of debate prior to each vote; that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order to any of the amendments prior to the \nvotes and that the amendments be subject to a 60-affirmative-vote \nthreshold.\n  I would also like to add that I would not object personally to having \none of Senator Coburn's amendments added to this list, but this is the \nlist I was given to ask unanimous consent for--just four amendments, \ntwo on flood insurance and the Grassley amendment on freedom of \ninformation regarding EPA.\n  So we would have votes, all of them requiring a 60-vote threshold, \nwith both sides having a side-by-side, which we sometimes do in this \nbody so if someone wants to vote no they can then have something to \nvote yes for. This is the most reasonable way I could present this list \nto help us get a vote on flood insurance and another important \namendment to Senator Grassley, a Republican. I am a Democrat, Senator \nGrassley is a Republican, so it is very balanced on each side.\n  So I am asking unanimous consent to try to get a vote this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the Senator \nfrom Louisiana is proposing an amendment that I strongly disagree with \nthe substance on. Despite that, I don't object to her having a vote on \nher amendment. What I object to is the fact there are only four \nSenators who get to have amendments.\n  We have a list of maybe a dozen, maybe it is 15 amendments, that \nSenators from our side have been requesting to have considered and they \nhave been objected to all week long. Now we are told that soon we can \nexpect the majority leader to file a cloture motion on the bill which \nwill lead to shutting off this bill entirely. This seems to me a clear \nstrategy to block amendments.\n  So far we have had 10 rollcall votes on amendments on this bill. Of \nthose, three have been Republican. Last year, the farm bill had 42 \nrollcall votes. What I would like to do is work this out right now, and \nwe can do that, as far as I am concerned, if these amendments could be \nmade in order. Maybe there are others on your side, and I would welcome \nthem.\n  I have no objection to the Senator from Louisiana having a vote on \nher amendment, but I don't think we should be doing just these four or \nsome subset thereof and continuing to shut out all the other Senators \nwho have been trying to get their amendments agreed to.\n  So, for that reason, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would respond to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, then I will relinquish the floor to the managers of the \nbill because it is their responsibility and they have been doing a \ngreat job trying to help us get through the farm bill.\n  I wish to thank the Senator from Pennsylvania because this is real \nprogress. He said he will not object to a vote on our amendment on \nflood insurance. I appreciate that because I know he has strong \nobjections to it. I may not win the vote, but the people in my State \nhave asked me to do everything I can to fight for them. This is a very \nserious issue in the State of Louisiana, in Texas, in Florida, in Rhode \nIsland, in Maine, in Massachusetts, in Vermont, and even in \nPennsylvania.\n\n  So I thank the Senator. Let me yield the floor back to the chairman \nof the committee to see what could potentially be worked out, but I am \nso happy the Senator will not object to a flood insurance amendment if \nwe can ever get to one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Does the Senator from Oklahoma yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I yield to the chairman of the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I realize the Senator from Oklahoma has the floor and \nhe wishes to continue with his amendments.\n  I wish to speak to all the Members who are on the floor as well as \nthose who are in their offices, because, as everyone knows--again, to \nhearken back to the last time around we did this--we had 73 amendments. \nNot all of them took a recorded vote, but we did come up with a finite \nlist. It was 73. It was a big list, but we came up with a list.\n  That is what we are trying to do now. We have been working with \ncolleagues. We want that list. No one wants that more than I and \nSenator Cochran--to come up with a group of amendments,\n\n[[Page S3937]]\n\nso everyone knows what we will be voting on so we can begin to move \nthrough that.\n  I indicated we had included in the bill the amendments we had voted \non the floor the last time. I did make one error that my staff reminded \nme of. There was one we did vote on that is not in here, which was the \namendment of Senator McCain on catfish. That was not included, in \ndeference to those who had objected. But everything else that was of \nsubstance, as I understand, is in the underlying bill.\n  I also do want to note the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma did \nhave a significant amendment that came very early in this process. In \nfact, it was one I did not support, but he won his amendment. We could \nhave blocked it. I could have objected, because I don't support the \npolicy, but I did not do that. So the Senator's amendment did pass, \neven though I voted no and do not support it. So from my perspective, \nas the chair of the committee, I am happy to have debate. I am happier \nwhen I win than when I lose, but I am happy to have debate.\n  We want to put together a universe of amendments. Right now we don't, \nat this point, have time to go through 150 amendments. So we have to \nfind out what is a priority for everyone, put together a finite list, \nand we are going to continue to work on that. If the majority leader \nfiles cloture, we can still continue to do that. We can put together a \nfinite list, vitiate the cloture vote, and move to a vote on a group of \namendments.\n  That would be my preference. I know it would be the preference of \nSenator Cochran as well. So we are going to continue to work on that, \nwhether cloture is filed or not--see if we can't come together with a \ngroup of amendments and, hopefully, we will be able to get that done. \nThat is my preference on how to do a bill. We will continue to attempt \nto make that happen.\n  I appreciate the time allotted, with the Senator from Oklahoma \nyielding to me, and we will continue to work with him as well as all \nMembers to move to a place where we can have an opportunity for \namendments to be offered in a timely manner to get the bill done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Oklahoma to set aside the pending amendment?\n  Ms. STABENOW. On behalf of Senator Landrieu, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I think I am starting to hear the Senate \nstarting to work the way it should, and so I am going to offer a \nunanimous consent request that the list she presently has, with the \nranking member, the Senator from Mississippi, of a large number of \namendments be considered as read and in order; that the list the \nSenator proffered, which went through both cloakrooms this afternoon, I \nask unanimous consent that be agreed to and those be filed and \nconsidered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Reserving the right to object, that is, unfortunately, \nan unrealistic motion from my perspective. We have to work with \nMembers. Many Members, including the Senator who is speaking, have \nmultiple amendments and we need to get a list of priorities from people \nso we have a smaller list we can work with to get this done in a timely \nmanner.\n  So I object at this point. I would like very much to see us get \ntogether a list but to do this in a way where some Members have many \namendments and others have very few----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Since objection is heard, it was my understanding the \nSenator from Michigan had an agreed-upon list that was sent to both \ncloakrooms.\n  Ms. STABENOW. No. I wish I did.\n  Mr. COBURN. Failing that, what I would propose, based on what I have \nheard out here this afternoon, is that the chairman put it together and \nlet's try it and let's ask unanimous consent.\n  The fact is the chairman and ranking member of this committee have \nworked hard to get this bill. We can do this bill. But one thing the \nSenator said in her statement is she wants a finite list. That is fine. \nWhat we want to do is have an open amendment process. So as the Senator \nconsiders that, let's move it.\n  Here is what will happen, and here is what used to happen in the \nSenate, for my colleagues who are new. People file all sorts of \namendments, including me, and about half of them we wouldn't bring up. \nSo we don't know in this universe of 150 how many are truly serious, \nhow many are done filing an amendment and made a statement, such as I \ndid on one amendment changing the name of SNAP. I have no intention of \ncalling that up, but I wished to make a statement about whether it is \nreally nutrition--the Supplemental Nutrition Access Program. So I would \nsuggest the chairman and ranking member put that out there. Give it to \nme and let me offer a unanimous consent request on the floor live. We \nhave had a great debate. We understand what the problems are. Let's \nstart voting. Let's start debating and voting.\n  When we consider all the time huddled in a group of staffers, we \ndon't do anything. We don't debate the bill, we don't vote the bill, \nand so, consequently, the American people get shortchanged. So I will \noffer that unanimous consent request. I will not even participate in \nwhat is in the mix. I believe the process ought to move forward, \nwhether I win or not. The fact is it is selfishness on the part of our \ncolleagues, because they do not want to vote on something, that keeps \nus from doing the country's work.\n  I believe we are at a seminal moment right now in the Senate where we \ncan change what is happening in this body if, in fact, we will lead in \ndoing that. I know the President pro tempore wants to see that happen. \nI believe my colleague from Michigan wants to see that happen. I know \nthe ranking member has had that philosophy for years in the Senate. He \ntaught it to me. I learned that from him.\n  I offered a lot of amendments that he opposed and didn't like, some \nof them affecting Mississippi, and he beat me every time. But he never \nsaid, You can't offer the amendment.\n  I think we are at a seminal moment. Let's start moving things. What I \nwill do is call on the ranking member and the chairman: Give me that \nlist. Let me go fight for it. Let's break this beaver dam in the \nSenate, and let's start acting like grownups here.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Would the Senator be willing to yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would be willing to yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Let me first say that if I am hearing the Senator \nright, he will work with us to move forward on a unanimous consent \nrequest on a list of amendments. I certainly would welcome his doing \nthat.\n  I also do need to indicate we spent last week and this week moving \namendments. We started moving amendments. The Senator's was one of the \nvery first ones we did vote on. We have been working together today, \ntrying to move in small groups amendments to be able to get things \nmoving, now facing objections as we do that. But we did have the \nopportunity to do a number of amendments last week and have moved \nforward to vote on some. We will continue to do that with colleagues. \nThat is our intent.\n  Again, if my friend will remember, this is the second time around for \nus. We have already done this once. We are back doing it again. We want \nto get it done. We want to have the opportunity for people to offer \nmore amendments.\n  Mr. COBURN. I know there is a question in there somewhere.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes, there is a question. If I might say to my friend I \nam hearing that he is desiring to work with us in order to get together \na list. Is that correct?\n  Mr. COBURN. That is correct.\n  Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent, and I want to preface this \nunanimous consent. There are 150 amendments, I think the chairman said, \nor thereabouts. A lot of those aren't going to require votes; some are. \nI ask unanimous consent that every amendment that has been filed at \nthis point be considered as read and considered debatable and votable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. There is objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. If an objection is heard--I retain my time.\n\n[[Page S3938]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would appreciate my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Let me make this point. If the Senator from Michigan \nwouldn't have objected, we could start voting tonight, we could vote \ntomorrow, we could get through those. Half of those will be pulled, and \nwe would be almost to the same number of votes you would have had, that \nyou did have, the last time the bill came to the floor. So do we really \nwant to break this logjam? Let me offer it again. We can move this \nthing. Let's just do it. Let's go out and vote. Let's take the tough \nvotes. Some of us are going to get bruised. Big deal. We are all \ngrownups. Let's have the votes. Let's move amendments. Let's debate in \nthe Senate. Let's do the country's business. Instead, we are not going \nto do it.\n  There is a compromise. More than half of those will be withdrawn. My \ncolleagues know that. Let's put them all in order. Let's vote them, \nlet's take care of it, and let's be grown up and get the Senate back to \nwhere it is supposed to be.\n  I am going to offer my unanimous consent one more time, that every \namendment that has been filed today as of now be considered as read and \npending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Reserving the right to object, let me indicate, as the \nmanager of this bill, I appreciate the advice we are receiving from the \nSenator from Oklahoma, and we will certainly look forward to working \nwith him and receiving his advice. We are managing the bill on the \nfloor. We appreciate very much the efforts of the Senator to come down \nand move things in the direction he wishes. We will continue to manage \nthis bill in a way that is fair and open and work with all of our \ncolleagues and look forward to getting this done.\n  I would--also reserving the right to object--indicate we have a bill \nin front of us that affects 16 million people and their jobs. We have a \nbill that is $24 billion in deficit reduction, unlike any other bill \nthat has come before us in bipartisan deficit reduction. We have a bill \nin front of us that has eliminated 100 different authorizations or \nprograms because of duplication, which I know is near and dear to the \nheart of the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  We have a bill right now worthy of voting on and passing. We will \ncontinue to work with all of our colleagues to move this forward to get \nthis done on behalf of the 16 million men and women who work in \nagriculture. We will certainly take his ideas under consideration as we \nmove forward to manage this bill.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, fair and balanced consideration to our \ncolleagues is allowing them to have amendments, and the Senator just \nobjected to that. So that is where we are. That doesn't keep her from \nmanaging the bill. The Senator still gets to set the priorities of what \ncomes up when. But here lies the problem in the Senate: There are \nobviously some amendments in there they don't want to vote on; \notherwise, we would not have heard an objection. So it is not just \nSenator Toomey, who has now said he would not object to Senator \nLandrieu's amendment, it is other objections of people who won't come \ndown here to the floor and show their constituency what they are \nobjecting to. In other words, it is darkness. It is not light, it is \nnot transparency, it is not of good character, it is not of good moral \nfiber. What it is, is the least of these, the lowest of these, who \nrefuse to participate in an open and honest debate about what is going \nto happen in our country.\n  I call on all my colleagues, Republican and Democrat alike. We know \nwhat has to happen to open the Senate. Let's vote. Let's vote. For my \ncolleagues on the Republican side objecting, I disagree. Go ahead and \nvote. For my colleagues on the Democratic side, let's vote. Let the \nchips fall. The American people decide who is to come up here. Gaming \nthis system by hiding behind an anonymous objection, putting it through \nthe chairman--I am proud to see the Senator from Louisiana. She came \ndown here, she showed courage and said, Here is why I am doing it. She \nspoke honestly to her constituents back home and also to the Members of \nthis body. We don't have enough of that.\n  We had an opportunity just then to move this bill, restore the Senate \nto the way it should function, and we chose not to do it. The American \npeople have got to be shaking their head right now in disgust, because \nhad the time been spent, instead of figuring out what is OK and what is \nnot OK, actually debating and then voting amendments, we could have \nvoted 30 or 40 amendments by now on this bill. But we chose not to do \nit. Some of us chose not to do it.\n  Kindergarten is out around most of the rest of the country, except in \nthe Senate, and it is still in session here. We ought to be disgusted \nwith ourselves, and the American people ought to be disgusted with us \nas well, because we are not allowing this body to do what our Founders \nintended it to do. I am going to spend a minute talking about that.\n  This place is very different than the House. No matter who is in \ncharge, the tendency is to overuse the power of the majority. But what \nour Founders intended was the Senate to be totally different than the \nHouse. The reason 6-year terms were put there was so you wouldn't be \nsusceptible to the political influence of reelection, so you would \nbecome a long-term thinker, and that your motivation would be primarily \na motivation for the best will of this country and not your State or \nyour political career.\n  The assessment of the Senate today is that we have lost our focus. It \nis about politics, not our country. It is about the short term, not the \nlong term. It is about anything but the best interests of the country.\n  Here we have commonsense amendments. I appreciate the fact that the \nchairman and ranking member have included some of mine in what they \nwere proffering, but let's include them all. What is so bad about \nvoting on a stupid amendment? If it is really stupid, they are either \ngoing to withdraw it or lose big. If it is really controversial, the \nAmerican people want to see us debate and vote on controversial topics. \nThey do not want to see us duck our responsibilities.\n  We have met the enemy. The enemy is us.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, since I have an objection to that \namendment 1007, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 1008 be \ncalled up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Landrieu, I would \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, even though the amendment has been \nobjected to, I am going to talk about it.\n  The amendment is to require the Rural Utilities Service of the \nDepartment of Agriculture to ensure that the grants and loans it makes \nto provide access to broadband telecommunications services in rural \nareas are made to rural areas that don't already have access to \nbroadband.\n  Wait a minute. Why would we want an amendment to do that? This is an \namendment to tell them to do what they are supposed to be doing.\n  Over the years, the rural broadband program has seen a large amount \nof Federal funding. In 2009, the Department of Agriculture broadband \nprogram received $2.5 billion from the stimulus bill. The inspector \ngeneral examined the Rural Utilities Service broadband loan and \nguarantee program, and what he found was that a large majority of the \nfunds went to areas that already had broadband services. In other \nwords, they didn't spend the money where we don't have broadband; they \nspent the money where we already do.\n  Specifically, this inspector general found that 148 communities that \nreceived broadband service funded by this program were within 30 miles \nof cities with more than 200,000 people--including the cities of \nChicago and Las Vegas.\n  Some of the Federal funds going to broadband programs originate from \nthe Department of Commerce as well. So we have the Department of \nAgriculture\n\n[[Page S3939]]\n\nand the Department of Commerce both doing the same thing.\n  The issue is highlighted by the problems with the broadband program \nthat occurred in West Virginia, the President pro tempore's State. \nSpecifically, the State could not handle nor had the use for the \nrouters that were delivered to them. Put simply, the libraries and \nschools didn't have the need for the powerful stuff that was sent to \nthem. So we wasted the money. It was a $24 million error.\n  You get to $1 billion $1 million at a time, and you get to $1 \ntrillion $1 billion at a time.\n  What this amendment does is make them spend the money where we don't \nhave broadband, not where we do. In other words, it prioritizes--which \nmost of us would agree to--that broadband funds through this grant \nprogram go to areas that don't have broadband rather than areas that \nalready do. So let's wire the whole country first before we upgrade \neverybody else.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside, and amendment No. 1010 be brought up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. There is objection. On behalf of Senator Landrieu, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this amendment is very controversial, I \nknow, amongst my colleagues. But I have practiced medicine for 25 \nyears, and before that I ran a pretty successful business.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services delayed the \nimplementation of ICD-10. Let me explain what that is. ICD-10 is a new \ndiagnostic code book. Why is that important? Well, we use ICD-9 now, \nwhich helps us write the diagnostic codes. Whether you are in a \nhospital, a clinic, a doctor's office, an outpatient surgery center, a \nhome health, whatever it is, those diagnostic codes categorize what we \nactually did for you. Well-intentioned public health experts thought we \naren't broad enough in what we do with the ICD-9, International \nClassification of Diseases, so as a part of the Affordable Care Act, \nICD-10 was implemented.\n  There is nothing wrong with updating it, but let me explain to you \nwhat we did. We went from 18,000 codes of diseases to 140,000 codes, \nthe cost of which, at a minimum, in the health care system under \nvarious studies will be at least $5 billion a year in added costs.\n  Will there be some benefit? Yes, to the public health experts who \nstudy disease patterns there will be some limited benefit. The question \nwe have to ask is, What is our biggest problem with health care? Our \nbiggest problem with health care is it costs too much. What we have \ndone with ICD-10 is, just the implementation--I am talking $5 billion a \nyear from here on. The implementation is going to cost $10 to $15 \nbillion to put it in. What this amendment would do is make a \nsignificant delay in the implementation of ICD-10.\n  The implementation of the Affordable Care Act is going to cost enough \nas it is. This would refocus us on what is important. It is important \nthat providers spend time with patients, not spend time trying to \nfigure out how they fill out a disease code. For any of you who doubt \nthe significance of this now, if there are 18,000 codes now--most \ndoctors write the disease code. They don't have a staff to do that. \nWhen you go from 18,000 to 140,000, what are your doctors going to be \ndoing? They are not going to take care of you, they are going to be \nspending time looking at a book that has 140,000 diagnostic codes and \nlisting that. So we are going to take time away from patient care.\n  Why is it important that the doctors get it right? Because the \npenalties under Medicare for mislabeling are severe and the sanctions \nare severe--penalties of 1 percent to 2 percent payment per year on \nyour total billing to Medicare or Medicaid. So the costs associated \nwith ICD-10 are enormous. So it is not only hard and costly to \nimplement it, but it takes people away, the very doctors we want \nspending time with patients. It limits that because they are going to \nbe spending more time filling out paperwork for the Federal Government.\n  The other thing it will do is it will not improve health care \noutcomes at all. It does nothing to improve health care outcomes. It \nwill not improve the first patient, so there is no positive benefit in \nthe short run or medium term to the patient. The only limited benefit \nwould be to long-term studies of public health.\n  Let me give some diagnostic codes to think about how foolish this is.\n  The new codes account for injury sites ranging from opera houses to \nchicken coops to squash courts. Not only do you have to list what an \ninjury was, you then have to go through this book and find out where it \nwas. Was it on a ranch? Was it in the coral? Was it in the chicken \ncoop? If you mislabel it, you are under threat of penalty from CMS.\n  How about nine different codes where you got hurt around a mobile \nhome? How about a burn due to water skis? How about walking into a lamp \npost? If you hit your head it is important for public health officials \nto know that you walked into a lamp post.\n  It includes 300 different codes related to every different animal. So \nif you got a bite from a rat or a chipmunk or a squirrel, there are 312 \ndifferent codes around each one of those animals.\n  It has 72 codes pertaining to birds. You got pooped on, you got \npecked at, you got bit--72 separate codes.\n  How about bitten by a turtle or, the second one, struck by a turtle? \nOr walked on a turtle? Or kicked a turtle? That is how much foolishness \nis in ICD-10. We are going to ask our doctors to spend time figuring \nout 160,000 different codes, disease related, when 18,000 does it just \nfine right now. What this would do would forego the implementation of \nICD-10.\n  I ask the present amendment be set aside and amendment No. 1076 be \ncalled up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. On behalf of Senator Landrieu, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. I understand the objection. I have no ill will toward my \nchairman or ranking member for their objection.\n  What this amendment does is during sequester, it prohibits \nperformance awards in the Senior Executive Service. We are paying \nperformance bonuses right now during sequester. The Office of \nManagement and Budget has ordered a freeze on most bonuses for Federal \nworkers during sequestration, but the current law provides an exemption \nfor members of the Senior Executive Service who are among the most \nhighly paid Federal Government employees. This amendment closes that \nexemption loophole. If we are all going to suffer, everybody is going \nto suffer. Just because you work in the Senior Executive Service \ndoesn't mean you should not have to participate and lead on the \nsacrifice this country is going to have to be making and is making. \nThis treats SES personnel just like every other Federal employee.\n  I ask the pending amendment be set aside--actually, I think I will \nstop with that--one other.\n  Mr. President, I ask amendment No. 1152 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Reserving the right to object, I will object, Mr. \nPresident, but I would like to ask my friend, given all the amendments, \nif we were able to accept all of his amendments would he be supporting \nthe bill?\n  Mr. COBURN. I have not made that decision.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I object on behalf of Senator Landrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will tell you how I go through looking at the farm \nbill. I believe farmers ought to farm. I don't believe they ought to \nfarm the government. I think you all, over the last few years, have \ndone a good job changing that scenario.\n  I believe food security is an important part of what America can do \nfor both our country and our world. I also know our farmers are some of \nour hardest working people.\n  Having said all of that, there are a ton of programs in here that do \nnot directly benefit food security in this country or the American \npublic. When we still have the well-heeled, well-connected in this \ncountry taking advantage of farm programs, from pro athletes to \neverything else, who use the\n\n[[Page S3940]]\n\nfarm program as a method, as a tax hedge, and use the supplemental \nsystems, by eliminating direct payments, you have done a great deal.\n  I am all for crop insurance. I think it ought to be a little more \ncostly and spread around. I think crop insurance in terms of the \ncommissions paid to the people who sell it are a little too rich. There \nare a lot of people who would like to have that book of business for a \nwhole lot less money. We have not done that. It will be a balance to me \nas I look at improvements.\n  I congratulate the chairman and ranking member for making progress on \nthe farm bill. We have a long way to go. This amendment relates to one \nof those, which is how do we I make sure, if we are going to take \ntaxpayer money and help people with their needs under the Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program, how do we make sure we are doing it in a \nway that actually gives them nutritious food?\n\n  As a physician who has cared for obesity and heart disease and cancer \nand high blood pressure for years, diet is a big factor on that. \nSenator Harkin and I have an amendment together, this amendment, which \nwould create a pilot project in two States to allow States to use a \nnutrition assessment for setting what can be brought with SNAP. That is \nwhat this amendment does.\n  A lot of the companies do not like it. A lot of people say: How can \nyou do that? But I remind our colleagues, for many of the people who do \nnot buy nutritious food when we are helping them, we are paying for it \ntwice. That is because when they make poor choices with our money to \nbuy their food, they are creating disease categories that we are going \nto pay for in the future, with our money, for their disease.\n  So the idea of trying a pilot project in two States where they use \nnutritional value to make a determination of what food products are \neligible and what are not for the SNAP program, this is a try that most \npeople out in the country would like to see.\n  Most Americans want to help anybody who needs help, but I hear it all \nthe time when people say: I see people buying stuff I don't buy or I \ncan't afford to buy with their SNAP card.\n  There is no good way to do that other than do it on a nutritional \nbasis. That is the only way we should look at that. If we are going to \nhelp somebody we ought to help them.\n  There is a great book by Marvin Olasky. It is called ``The Tragedy of \nAmerican Compassion.'' He talks about how to help people. You do not \nhelp people by giving them a blank check. You help people in short \nterm. You help them as long as they have a need. But you help them in a \nway that they get to help themselves and by that they get to help \nthemselves and get their dignity back.\n  Senator Harkin and I have agreed that this is a pilot project that \nwill have to be evaluated at the end of 2 years. All the costs of it \nhave to be borne by the States. We have checked out all the computer \ncompanies. There is no problem in putting limitations on UPC codes or \nanything on all the checkout items. It is not an issue. We have done \nall the homework on it.\n  It would be interesting to see, once we do a nutritional evaluation \nand a limitation on SNAP products, what would happen to the health of \nthe people we are helping. That is the amendment he and I have worked \non together. We would love to see it go. We think it is time for that \nto happen. It certainty will be good.\n  The key is, can we help people get back to being self-reliant? I \ndon't want us to be a big brother, but I also want to make sure the \nmoney we are stealing from our kids, from their future, actually does \nhelp somebody and doesn't hurt them.\n  With that, I again congratulate both the chairman and ranking member \nfor the bill they brought. It has marked improvements. I thank them for \ntheir patience dealing with me today on the floor. I very much regret \nthat you have objected to a way to move this bill forward because it \ndoesn't just have implications for this bill. The courage to stand up \nand say let's do that will have great implications for how this body \nfunctions for the next 16 months. I think we are going to miss a big \nopportunity if we do not do that.\n  I would love to see the Senate go back to operating the way it did \nwhen I first came here. My hopes were dashed, however, with that \nobjection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                    Remembering Frank R. Lautenberg\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I have been listening to this debate \nwith my colleagues, but I came to share a few thoughts about the \npassing of our dear friend Senator Frank Lautenberg. He was a dear \nfriend, a colleague. When I originally sat in the Senate, he sat right \nbehind me. We shared seats together on the Commerce Committee. I can \ntell you Frank's wit was as quick as his downhill slalom skiing. He \nalways had something funny to say.\n  We knew him as somebody who had been in one of the largest computer \nservices companies, ADP, and helped get that company started, and as \nsomebody who represented veterans as one of the last World War II \nveterans in this body. He served here for almost 30 years.\n  What always amazed me about Frank is that he brought that business \nattitude to the Senate when it came to legislating; that is, results \nmatter. Because of that, he had a long list of legislative \naccomplishments.\n  I don't know if everybody, because of the turnover in the Senate, \nrealized how many things Frank accomplished: banning smoking on \nairplanes, lowering the threshold for drunk driving, better protection \nagainst toxic chemicals, helping to improve the everyday safety of \nAmericans, improving the quality of our environmental laws in the \nUnited States. He also had an amendment that helped allow for better \nrefugee status, for members of historically persecuted groups to easily \nget refugee status in the United States.\n  He did many different things while he was in the Senate, and he \nworked very hard because of that experience in World War II and being a \nveteran and going to school on the GI bill--somebody who lost his \nfather at a very early age. He used that GI bill to get the education \nhe needed to do these incredible things.\n  When Frank had a victory, he didn't stop at that victory, he kept \ngoing. After he and Dick Durbin helped ban smoking on commercial \nflights, he followed that with a provision to the Transportation \nappropriations bill that extended the ban to include all Federal \nbuildings.\n  In the same kind of fervor, once he helped make our drunk driving \nlaws stronger, he continued to try to implement stronger measures as a \nkey player in establishing a national blood alcohol level at 0.08 \npercent. At the time, many States decided to do otherwise, but Frank \nworked to try to champion this at the Federal level, and as a result he \nhelped to save tens of thousands of lives.\n  He was also a huge champion of our environment. He championed ocean \nacidification issues before they were probably really known by a lot of \npeople in America. He understood that this was a looming disaster and \nthat we needed to do more research for marine life, our economy, and \nour way of life.\n  He also knew and understood that Americans needed protection from \ntoxic pollutants. Well, that is something most of us would say: Yes, we \ndon't like toxic pollutants. Back in 1986 he wrote a bill that created \na public database about toxins released in the United States. That was \ncertainly brave for somebody from New Jersey because it was a leading \nchemical-producing State. The fact that Frank took that on showed a lot \nof tenacity and a lot of courage, and just as he did on the other \nthings, he followed that up.\n  Recently, he introduced the Safe Chemicals Act to improve the \nunderstanding and reporting of chemicals found in products that make \ntheir way into the hands of Americans every single day.\n  He also championed improving our transportation system. I asked him: \nFrank, how did you already get a train station named for you on the \nJersey line? Anyone who has taken the Amtrak up to New York has had a \nchance to see that one of the stops in Secaucus is named the Frank R. \nLautenberg Station. He had been a great champion for Amtrak, but he was \nalso a great champion for freight and freight mobility. He knew it was \nimportant to New Jersey as a major port in our country, and he wanted \nto make sure that not\n\n[[Page S3941]]\n\nonly people but products got to where they needed to go and got there \non time.\n  We all like to think we are remembered by the American people for the \naccomplishments we have, and I am not sure whether they will remember \nall of the things Frank Lautenberg did to contribute to their way of \nlife. One thing I can say is that when I think about his advocacy for a \nmodernized GI bill or banning smoking on planes, he touched the lives \nof millions of Americans.\n  He also had tenacity. He had the tenacity once to help a boy from New \nJersey who had been involved in a domestic dispute where the father had \nlost custody. The young boy at that time, Sean Goldman, who was from \nNew Jersey, had been taken by a family member and was in Brazil. His \nfather tried going through the Brazilian courts for years to get him \nback. He really wasn't successful until Frank Lautenberg joined the \nfight. Frank brought the same tenacity he had shown in the past and \nheld up a generalized system of preferences bill--which remove tariffs \non $2.7 billion worth of Brazilian goods--here in the Senate. He knew \nthat threatening to hold up that bill would get their attention, and he \nwas right. He literally got them to do something and return this young \nboy, Sean Goldman, to his father. Frank really cared about results. He \nknew it was important to get that father and son reunited, and he knew \nthe importance of getting results for his constituency in New Jersey.\n  We will miss Frank. We will miss all of his legislative actions, his \nstanding on the Senate floor and giving a speech or, as he would say, \ngiving heck to somebody. Oftentimes it was somebody on the other side \nor somebody he thought was a big giant doing too many things that \nneeded to be challenged. He will be remembered as part of a great \ngeneration of Americans who were successful in so many ways. He lived \nthe American dream, came to the Senate and was a contributor. He will \nbe remembered for his tenacity and standing and fighting for people.\n  We are going to miss you, Frank.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Iran Elections\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise to speak about S. Res. 154. S. \nRes. 154 is a resolution I submitted last month with Senator \nBlumenthal. It calls for fair and free elections in Iran and points out \nthat the Iranian regime is fundamentally illegitimate.\n  Americans believe in the power of elections. We believe voting means \nsomething. The rest of the world also understands and respects that \nelections are powerful events. Most countries that hold elections want \nto channel the will of their people into the governing of their \ncountry.\n  The Supreme Leader of Iran believes in the power of elections too, \nbut he does not respect them. He himself has never been elected, and he \nknows a free election might threaten his power base. So he ensures that \na truly free election is impossible for the Iranian people.\n  In past elections fraud has been rampant. The government has cracked \ndown on public dissent and moved against media sources that are not \nofficially sanctioned.\n  But most of all, Iran's Supreme Leader has developed the unfortunate \nhabit of selecting which candidates may be permitted to run for office.\n  Hundreds of candidates were prohibited from running for Parliament \nlast year and hundreds more were denied the right to run for President \nthis year. Apparently, the Supreme Leader believes there is too much at \nstake to risk anyone other than a handpicked candidate to prevail at \nthe voting booth.\n  The restrictions on candidates are so strict it almost seems it would \nbe easier for the Supreme Leader to cancel the elections altogether and \njust appoint a President. But the Supreme Leader wants the legitimacy \nconferred by elections as badly as he wants to retain full control of \nthe Iranian regime.\n  There are lots of analysts in the United States and elsewhere who \nattempt to understand which way Iran is going based on which candidates \nstand for election and which ones prevail. Some candidates are judged \nto be reformers, others conservatives, and so forth.\n  But this analysis gives the Iranian regime more legitimacy than it \ndeserves. Because dissent is stifled, because candidates are blocked \nfor political reasons, and, most of all, because the Supreme Leader \nholds all of the levers of power, Iran's regime cannot be seen to have \nlegitimacy.\n  Consider that the current Supreme Leader came to power in 1989. He \nhas never been held accountable to the people of Iran, but he is in \nfull control of the country. He controls the defense and foreign policy \noutright.\n  He has the power to veto anything that comes from Parliament. He vets \ncandidates for Parliament, and he helps choose the members of the \nAssembly of Experts and the Guardian Council--the very governing bodies \nthat formally oversee the Supreme Leader. Simply put, power in Iran \nbegins and ends with the Supreme Leader.\n  On June 14, Iran will elect a new President. While much will be said \nabout who wins that election, we already know what the outcome will be. \nThe Supreme Leader will continue to dominate Iran, run roughshod over \nthe rights of the people of Iran, and deny the Iranian people the \nability to chart their own future.\n  For this reason I urge my colleagues to join Senator Blumenthal and \nmyself in supporting S. Res. 154. Our resolution points out, first, \nthat Iran has a terrible track record of fraudulent and illegitimate \nelections; two, that Iran crushes the right to free speech and to a \nfree press; and, three, that true power in Iran remains firmly in the \ngrip of the Supreme Leader.\n  Our resolution calls on Iran to correct these injustices. It makes \nclear that the United States will not view Iran's regime as a \nlegitimate expression of the will of its people unless and until its \nelections are free and truly fair, until those at the highest level of \npower are made accountable.\n  Holding autocracy responsible is important not only to the Iranian \npeople but to the people of the world at large.\n  We face an enormous challenge in trying to get Iran to abandon its \nnuclear program, and we would be dangerously mistaken if we believed \nthat the winner of the June 14 election will somehow represent the \nIranian people.\n  We must remember--and remind the world--that if Iran continues to \nwork toward a nuclear weapon, it will be because that is the course \nplotted and pursued by the Supreme Leader. The June 14 elections, \nunfortunately, will not change that reality.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in standing with the Iranian people \nand against an unelected and illegitimate regime bent on a dangerous \ncourse of action.\n  I hope we can adopt this resolution to demonstrate that we are not \nfooled by elections that give voters false choices and install leaders \ndetermined to threaten the security of other nations.\n  Only true and fair elections that hold Iran's leaders accountable to \nthe Iranian people will produce a government that deserves to be seen \nby the world as legitimate. I call on my Senate colleagues to send that \nmessage loud and clear to Tehran.\n  I now yield the floor to my esteemed colleague from the State of \nConnecticut who is joining me in this resolution, Senator Blumenthal. I \nwish to thank him for his support of this resolution and for his \nwillingness to not only speak up but to stand up for the people of \nIran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I thank my colleague Senator Hoeven \nfor his leadership on this issue, for his dedication to this cause, his \nperseverance and persistence in support of democracy.\n  This resolution, in fact, is all about democracy in a land that has \nbeen deprived of it for far too long. Unless Americans think this cause \nof democracy is far removed and inconsequential to their lives, \nAmericans know elections have consequences. In this instance, the \nconsequences have ramifications across the world because it is\n\n[[Page S3942]]\n\nthe authoritarian, undemocratic regime of Iran that is pursuing nuclear \nweapons without regard to the well-being of its people.\n  If it does not answer to its people, if it is undemocratic and \nauthoritarian, it can continue to pursue this nonsensical, thoughtless, \nlawless course of seeking to arm itself with nuclear weapons. That is \nbad not only for the Iranian people but for the American people and for \nthe people of the world.\n  I rise today in support of the Hoeven-Blumenthal resolution calling \nfor free and fair elections in Iran and condemning the Government of \nthe Islamic Republic of Iran for its ongoing violation of human rights.\n  On June 14, Iran will hold what looks to be yet another round of \nelections that are not fair, not free, and certainly not democratic--a \nsham, a charade that demeans even the pretense of democracy. On June 14 \nIranians will elect a new president, but they will do so in an \nenvironment filled with systematic fraud and manipulation. They will be \nfaced with a ballot hand-selected by the Supreme Leader, because he and \nhis aides have prohibited literally hundreds of candidates from \nrunning. They have accepted only eight candidates for this election.\n  They are doing so in a country with severe restrictions on freedom of \nexpression and assembly and without media freedom. We ought to note \nand, as my colleague Senator Hoeven says so well, remind the world that \nthe real power in Iran continues to rest with the Supreme Leader who \ncontrols foreign policy and defense and can veto any decision made by \nthe President or the Parliament. The Supreme Leader has been in power \nsince 1989. He has never been subject to an election or popular \nreferendum of any kind. That is why Senator Hoeven and I are again \noffering this resolution supporting political reform and freedom in \nIran, and strongly siding with the Iranian people on behalf of the \nAmerican people in the struggle for democracy. I thank Senator Hoeven \nand so many of my colleagues who worked with us before when we \nsponsored a similar resolution last year condemning the 2012 elections \nwhich were neither free nor fair.\n  We rise again to speak this truth to power. The Iranian people are \ndenied basic and fundamental universal human rights and continue to \nsuffer a repressive leadership that denies the validity of their views. \nAs a global leader on human rights and a beacon to the world on \ndemocratic values, this body has an obligation to stand with the people \nof Iran and demand accountability from their leaders.\n  Other countries around the world are struggling for democracy, and \nour ally in the Middle East, Israel, exemplifies it as a shining model. \nI am reminded of how many people in that region are denied rights and \nfreedoms. But we should reaffirm at every opportunity our commitment to \ndemocracy and urge the Iranian Government to hold free elections, end \narbitrary detentions, stop harassing people who fight for basic rights \nand freedoms, and reform their political process.\n  I also want to commend President Obama for tightening sanctions on \nIran's currency and auto industry, which should prevent the government \nfrom procuring some equipment used in nuclear programs. I support \ncontinuing efforts to show Iran that we are serious when we say they \nmust halt their nuclear weapons development program. People look to the \nUnited States for democracy and freedom. They watch what we do and what \nwe say on this floor of the greatest deliberative body in the world.\n  We must be unequivocal and remind the world how important it is to \nstand with the people of Iran, which is what the Hoeven-Blumenthal \nresolution does. I thank again my colleague Senator Hoeven.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Ohio, Mr. Brown, speak after me for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor today as millions \nof students in high school and colleges across the country have \nrecently graduated. I had an opportunity to attend a number of \ncommencements across Wyoming to speak to a number of students who were \ngraduating. I note that President Obama has also been out giving \ngraduation speeches this year. At Ohio State University, the President \ncriticized those of us who warn that government does not always have \nthe best answer. The President suggested that anyone who thinks \nWashington has grown too inefficient or too ineffective is somehow \nopposed to democracy entirely. That is what President Obama told new \ncollege graduates. It is absurd, but that is exactly what he had to \nsay. He told them he wants to give everyone, as he says, ``a fair \nshake.'' What he did not tell these young people, these young men and \nwoman, is that his policies--the policies he has been promoting and \npassing--have actually been hurting them and millions of other young \nAmericans.\n  He made no mention of the heavy burdens he has heaped on their backs, \nor the damage his policies have done to our economy. President Obama \ndid not say anything about it, but those graduates are actually going \nto figure it out very quickly. They are going to see what they are \ngetting from President Obama is not at all a fair shake.\n  The first thing they will notice is how difficult it is for them to \nfind a good job in the Obama economy. One of the things the Wall Street \nJournal had to say in an article by Dan Henninger:\n\n       In Campaign 2012, Barack Obama promised the youth vote a \n     rose garden. What they've got instead, as far as the eye can \n     see, is an employment wasteland.\n\n  According to a report by the Center for American Progress, the \nunemployment rate for Americans under age 24 is 16.2 percent. Their \nstudy estimated that even when this group eventually starts earning a \npaycheck, these young Americans, they will collectively suffer reduced \nearnings of about $20 billion over the next decade. It works out to \nabout $22,000 for each one of those young men and young women.\n  The Center for American Progress, which did this study and did this \nreport, is actually a very liberal think tank. Here is what else they \nsaid: ``Employment prospects for young Americans are dismal.'' This is \nwhat the liberal think tank is saying. ``The employment prospects for \nyoung Americans are dismal by both historical and by international \ncomparisons.''\n  We know young people who do find jobs are often stuck with part-time \nwork. What they are looking for is a career. It has been nearly 4 years \nsince the recession ended. Since then we have had a much weaker \neconomic recovery than we should have. In the first quarter of this \nyear alone, the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.4 percent. Wages \nhave continued to stagnate. The average work week continues to shrink.\n  Why would that be? Why would we see wages stagnating? Why would the \naverage work week shrink? Why are employment prospects so dismal for \nyoung Americans? One big reason is the weight of government regulations \non our economy. Businesses want to grow. They want to hire. But they \nhave been buried under a mountain of new rules and Washington mandates.\n  So far in 2013, the Obama administration has released more than \n32,000 pages of new regulations. All of that new redtape is strangling \nour economy and making it tougher for businesses to create jobs for \nthese young graduates.\n  One part of this--and I have warned about it before--is the new \nmandate in the President's health care law. It says businesses with 50 \nor more full-time workers have to provide expensive government-approved \nhealth insurance. The law does not say ``expensive'' government-\napproved health insurance, but the government-approved health insurance \nis turning out to be expensive.\n  A lot of us on this side of the aisle predicted the President's \nmandates\n\n[[Page S3943]]\n\nwere going to do terrible things to the economy. Well, that is exactly \nwhat happened. That is exactly what happened. It is one of the reasons \nwe have had such weak job creation. The new jobs we do get, well, they \nare concentrated in businesses that basically use hourly workers.\n\n  I have come to the floor and talked about one small business after \nanother that is saying they are keeping workers to less than 30 hours. \nThat usually hits people without work experience. It hits people like \nnew graduates, just starting out, especially hard. Of course, the \nPresident didn't mention any of that at his graduation speeches.\n  There is another thing the President hasn't told young people. It has \nto do with the sticker shock a lot of them are going to have when they \ntry to buy health insurance. One reason is because the health care law \nforces young healthy people to pay more so that older sicker people can \npay less. Another reason is because the Obama administration has come \nup with a long list of things insurance policies have to cover. \nRemember, none of these extras is free; they are just prepaid at higher \npremiums. Young people won't be able to just get the insurance they \nwant that is right for them or that they can afford. No. Now they will \nhave to pay for the Obama administration mandated and approved health \ninsurance. It is going to be much more expensive, and it may actually \ndo them no medical good.\n  Why should Washington tell a single 23-year-old woman she has to pay \nfor prostate cancer screening? Why should a 22-year-old man with no \nchildren have to pay for a plan that covers pediatric eye exams? Young \npeople don't need many of these mandated services, they do not want \nthem, and they don't want to pay for them. Yet they are mandated to buy \nthem. Again, President Obama is making young people pay more for health \ninsurance so that someone else might pay less.\n  How much more are they going to have to pay? Well, according to one \nsurvey of insurance companies, younger and healthier people can expect \naverage premium increases of 169 percent next year. While some people \nare going to get government subsidies to help cover part of this extra \ncost, not everyone will. Even with the subsidies, a lot of young people \nare still going to pay much more than they would have without the \nPresident's health care law. We haven't heard the President talk much \nabout that during his graduation speeches.\n  Young people and future generations have already been saddled with $6 \ntrillion in new debt since President Obama took office. Washington's \ndebt is now more than $53,000 for every man, woman, and child in the \nUnited States. These are people who will end up spending the rest of \ntheir lives paying higher taxes to cover that debt and the interest on \nthe debt. President Obama's latest budget called for young people to \npay even more by increasing the debt another $7 trillion over the next \ndecade. That is something else he didn't happen to tell young people \nduring his graduation speeches.\n  That doesn't mean Washington Democrats are keeping quiet. According \nto an article by Bloomberg, they are trying hard to sell the \nPresident's health care law. Here is how they put it in the article by \nBloomberg:\n\n       The White House has told all cabinet members and senior \n     officials to use commencement speeches to drive home for \n     graduating college students and their parents the benefits \n     they gain from a provision of the law that allows young \n     adults to stay on their families' insurance plans until they \n     turn 26.\n\n  Other Democrats are trying to say the same thing. Nancy Pelosi sent \nout a 78-page booklet telling Democrats in the House how to spin this \nunpopular health care law. I have a copy of it here. It is astonishing. \nRoll Call wrote about it the other day. The article is entitled \n``Democrats Unleash a Binder Full of Obamacare Messaging.'' One of the \nsuggestions was to find one or two young adults in your district who \nare now on their parents' plan because of the new law. That is what \nNancy Pelosi is recommending to the Democrats. That is the sales pitch. \nThe President wants young people to believe they are getting free \ninsurance. He doesn't want them to see all the ways the health care law \nis going to hurt them. That is what the President is telling young \npeople. That is his message. That is what he wants other Washington \nDemocrats to tell everyone too.\n  Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is leading the \ncheers. She says she plans to travel around the country to spread the \nword about enrollment. The enrollment she is talking about is trying to \nget people to sign up for the health care law's insurance exchanges. \nShe especially needs young healthy people to sign up for the exchanges, \nsuch as these new graduates. In the Wall Street Journal, Dr. Ezekiel \nEmanuel spelled out why in an op-ed. Remember, he was one of the \nPresident's top advisers in creating the health care law. He is also \nthe brother of former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. This is \nwhat he had to say. He wrote that young people ``are bewildered about \nthe health care reform in general and exchanges in particular.'' The \ntitle is ``Health Care Exchanges Will Need the Young Invincibles.''\n  Just yesterday the Los Angeles Times front page read ``Young adults a \nhurdle for health act.'' Dr. Emanuel is concerned these young people \nwon't see the Obama exchanges as being in their best interest. Well, of \ncourse they won't see it as being in their best interest, and that is \nbecause the exchanges are not in their best interest. That is why the \nLos Angeles Times is right--``Young adults a hurdle for health act.'' \nThe solution, Ezekiel Emanuel writes, is that ``every commencement \naddress by an administration official should encourage young graduates \nto get health insurance.''\n  That is not going to be an easy sell for this administration. A \nrecent Harvard poll of 18-to-24-year-old college students found that \nonly 42 percent approve of how the President has handled health care. \nYoung people are skeptical about the health care law. They are being \ntold they have to buy expensive insurance that they may not need or may \nnot want and that is not right for them because if they do not, the \nonly people in the exchanges will be the old and the sick, and the \nwhole thing will collapse under its own weight. For the President, that \nwould be a terrible political disaster, and apparently this \nadministration is willing to do whatever it takes to avoid that \ndisaster.\n  According to the Washington Post, Secretary Sebelius is now going hat \nin hand to health industry officials asking them to donate to nonprofit \ngroups in trying to enroll more people in the exchanges. At best, the \nSebelius shakedown is a conflict of interest. And this latest scandal \nwill only make young people more skeptical of the President's sales job \non his health care law.\n  Young people understand they will have to pay more for health \ncoverage so that older people will pay less. Young people understand \nthey are being told to do something that is not in their best interest, \nand the reason they are being told to do it is to give the President a \npolitical win--not because they will get better health care but to give \nthe President a political win. They understand the President's bad \neconomy means they may not find a job, but they are supposed to be OK \nwith that because mom and dad are allowed to pay their bills for a \ncouple more years. Young people know a Cabinet Secretary shouldn't \npressure businesses to support organizations that share the President's \npolitical agenda. They understand all of that even if the President \nwon't say it to them during commencement speeches. If the President \nreally wants to give young people a speech they will remember, he will \ntell them the truth about how terrible these policies are for them.\n  The President should leave the spin for the campaign trail and then \ncome back to Washington and be ready to sit down and work with \nRepublicans on policies that work for our economy, that work for young \npeople, that work for future generations, and that work for all \nAmericans.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his unanimous consent \nrequest, and I ask unanimous consent that after I conclude my remarks, \nthe Senator from Rhode Island Mr. Whitehouse be recognized for up to 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3944]]\n\n                        U.S.-China Trade Deficit\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, today new U.S.-China trade deficit \nfigures from April show a 34-percent increase since March. Last month \nour trade deficit with the world's second largest economy was more than \n$24 billion. I remember about a dozen years ago when the Senate and the \nHouse approved PNTR--permanent normal trade relations--with China. \nAround that time the bilateral yearly trade deficit with China was \nbarely $10 billion. Today, just for last month, it was $24 billion. It \nhas persistently and consistently been over $200 billion a year in \nrecent history.\n  This kind of trade deficit keeps our domestic companies on the \ndefensive. It means workers in Ohio, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, \nthroughout the Midwest, and across America are prevented from unlocking \ntheir potential. Our manufacturers are still the most productive in the \nworld. Our workers are the most skilled and the most productive in the \nworld. Their productivity continues to go up and up and up, in part \nbecause of globalization; however, their wages have been stagnant. That \nis part of the price our country has paid for globalization.\n  Our workers can't compete when China cheats. How can we win the \nfuture when our manufacturers can't win contracts because China doesn't \nplay fair? In many ways China and so many of our trading partners \npractice trade according to their national interest. Yet we in the \nUnited States practice trade according to some economics textbook that \nhas been out of print for the last 20 years.\n  Despite universal agreement that China continues to manipulate its \ncurrency to gain an artificial advantage over American-made goods, no \naction has been taken down the hall by the House of Representatives and \nno action has been taken down the street at the White House. No action \nhas been taken by the House despite widespread support for legislation \nthis Chamber passed in October 2011. That legislation, worked on by \nmany of my colleagues, would establish new criteria for the Treasury \nDepartment to identify countries that misalign their currency. The bill \nwould trigger tough consequences for those countries which engage in \nsuch unfair trade practices. It would allow for industries harmed by \ncurrency manipulation to seek relief, the way they do for other export \nsubsidies, which several industries in my State have sought, such as \nsteel pipe producers in Lorain, where I visited last week, in \nYoungstown.\n  We can solve this problem. The major reason there have been new \ninvestments in the Lorain U.S. Steel plant, at V Star in Youngstown, \nat Wheatland Tube, also in the Mahoning Valley, stabilization in jobs, \nand growth in jobs is because we have enforced trade laws. We can solve \nthis problem further with currency reform. That is why Senator \nSessions, a Republican from Alabama, and I will join our colleagues, \nincluding Senators Schumer, Collins, Stabenow, and Burr, tomorrow when \nwe reintroduce this bill. Why? Because more nations are engaged in this \npractice, and it is clear we don't have the tools to address it.\n  It is no longer just China manipulating its currency. There are a \nnumber of other countries--especially in East Asia--that are engaging \nin this practice, and, as I said, we don't have the tools to address \nit.\n  In 2009, as nations were seeking to restore stability to financial \nmarkets and respond to the global financial crisis, G-20 leaders met in \nPittsburgh to set a framework that would better promote more evenly \nbalanced trade. Among the steps to be taken would be a more market-\noriented exchange rate--something China obviously isn't familiar with--\nand a move away from the practice of adopting artificial, manipulated \nexchange rates not based on market forces.\n  While this appeared to be a step in the right direction, there has \nbeen too little to show for the good intentions stated back in 2009. \nHere is what we know. Workers and manufacturers still face an unfair \nadvantage from currency manipulation. By keeping the value of the RMB--\nthe Chinese currency--artificially low, China drives foreign \ncorporations to shift production there because it makes exports to \nChina more expensive and it makes Chinese exports back into the United \nStates cheaper.\n  It has only been in recent history that business after business after \nbusiness, as we have seen in the United States, has developed a \nbusiness plan that involves shutting down production in Lima, OH, move \nthat production to Beijing, and then sell back to the United States of \nAmerica. Never really in history has that been a widely adopted \nbusiness plan in a country--shut down production in Springfield, MA, or \nSpringfield, OH, move that production to Shihan, China, or Wuhan, \nChina, get tax breaks for doing it, and then sell those products back \ninto the United States. Part of the reason for that is currency \nmanipulation.\n  This continued undervaluation has caused serious harm for this \neconomy. It has cost American jobs. The first President Bush said in \nthe 1980s that $1 billion in trade surplus or trade deficit could \ntranslate into some 12,000 jobs--meaning that if there is a trade \ndeficit with a country, it costs this country 12,000 jobs. Multiply \nthat by a $500 billion, $600 billion, or $700 billion trade deficit, \nand see what we get.\n  A December 2012 report by the Peterson Institute for International \nEconomics found that currency manipulation by foreign governments had \ncost the U.S. from 1 to 5 million jobs and increased the U.S. trade \ndeficit by $200 billion to $500 billion per year.\n  Think of that. By addressing currency manipulation now, we could \ncreate up to 5 million jobs and reduce our trade deficit by tens of \nbillions of dollars, and doing so wouldn't cost taxpayers a cent.\n  But let's look for a moment beyond the numbers. Workers in my home \nState who work hard and play by the rules at Titan Tire in Bryan, OH, \nAmerican Aluminum Extrusions in Stark County, Wheatland Tube in \nTrumbull County, the people who make coated paper and lightweight \nthermal paper in southern Ohio, the Ohioans who forge steel into \nproducts we all use--these women and men deserve a chance to earn a \nliving without companies in other countries illegally dumping goods--or \nlegally if we don't do anything about currency--on our markets. We \ncan't afford to sit idly by while our trade deficit grows and our \ndomestic manufacturing base erodes.\n  By addressing currency manipulation and other unfair trade practices, \nwe create American jobs and position ourselves to meet the challenges \nand opportunities of globalization.\n  I look forward to continued debate and action on finally penalizing \nthe countries that cheat on trade.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I would like to yield 5 minutes to \nmy friend Senator Blunt and then reclaim the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I appreciate my good friend Senator Whitehouse yielding \nthe time for me.\n\n\n                    Remembering Frank R. Lautenberg\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. I would like to talk for a few minutes about Senator \nLautenberg and what he brought to this body and what he brought to \npublic service.\n  I represent Missouri in the Senate, and in the House I represented \nsouthwest Missouri. Many times in the last 2\\1/2\\ years, Senator \nLautenberg wanted to talk about going to basic training at Camp Crowder \nnear Neosho, MO, as a young man barely on the edge of his twenties--I \nam not sure which edge of his twenties it was, but he was serving in \nWorld War II, first as a teenager and then as a man barely in his \ntwenties--and what it was like to be surrounded by small communities, \nall of which were smaller than the camp at which the enlisted men were \ntraining, and what it was like when they had some free time and could \ngo to any of these communities where they probably outnumbered the \ncommunity. He always remembered that part of his training with some \npleasure. The story was always different from the story before, but I \nam sure all the stories happened.\n  But what he was really talking about to me every time was that \ncommitment to service that particularly our World War II veterans \nbrought to this body. And we all know, after the reflections of the \nlast 2 days, that he was the\n\n[[Page S3945]]\n\nlast of the World War II veterans to serve here and likely to be the \nlast of the World War II veterans to ever serve here, and the spirit of \nservice they all brought was reflected in Senator Lautenberg in lots of \nways.\n  All you would have to do is look at our voting record to know there \nwere lots of areas at the end of the day we didn't agree on, but \nsomehow we managed to do that and still appreciate the commitment to \npublic service that he reflected, and I think he appreciated that in \nme.\n  One of the chances I missed here was the opportunity to serve with \nhim on the surface subcommittee in Commerce. He was going to be the \nchairman of that committee for this Congress, and I was going to be the \nleading Republican and was looking forward to that because this was one \narea where I thought we were going to find and would have found a lot \nof common ground. Senator Lautenberg's understanding of transportation, \nhis understanding beyond most of us of the importance of passenger rail \nand rail generally and how you need to integrate this system so that it \nworks the best and the most efficiently, was clearly one of the areas \nwhere he had spent a lot of time over the years.\n  Remember, Senator Lautenberg was here as a Senator, and then he \ndecided to retire and then called back into public service. At a time \nwhen most people would have made that decision and moved on, he came \nback and served here, as it turned out, for the rest of his life of \nservice.\n  It was an honor for us to get to serve with him. It was an honor for \nme to get to serve with him. It is a disappointment for me that I \ndidn't get to learn more about this issue he and I were about to join \nhands on together.\n  But there is a lot we should learn from his service and the service \nof that World War II generation. I hope that is one of the things we \nwill be reflecting on over the next few days as we reflect on his \ncareer of service and that whole generation of service. We really do \nsee that moment pass with Senator Inouye and Senator Lautenberg and \nothers who have served here just in recent years, all gone. But if we \ncould look at the times they could come together in that spirit of \nWorld War II to make things happen, we would all learn an important \nlesson.\n  I join his family and his friends and his colleagues in missing him \nand missing his service.\n  I am pleased to yield the time back to my good friend Mr. Whitehouse, \nwho gave me the time to say these words.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                              Gaspee Days\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, American summertime is when we \ncelebrate and commemorate the patriots who fought to establish and \nprotect this great Republic. From Memorial Day through Independence Day \nand on to Veterans Day, communities across this country turn out star-\nspangled bunting and gather for parades, cookouts, and wreath layings \nto reflect on the heroes and events that embody our Nation's great \nspirit.\n  June in Rhode Island is marked by the annual celebration of Gaspee \nDays, when we recognize and celebrate one of the earliest acts of \ndefiance against the British Crown in our American struggle for \nindependence. Most Americans remember and I know the Presiding Senator \nfrom Massachusetts certainly is well aware of the Boston Tea Party \nwhen, in fact, literally spirited Bostonians clamored onto the decks of \nthe East India Company's ships and dumped tea bags into Boston Harbor \nto protest British taxation without representation.\n  I am sure throwing tea bags into the harbor is a very big deal, but \nthere was another milestone in the path to the Revolutionary War that \nis too often overlooked. It is the story of 60 brave Rhode Islanders \nwho, more than a year before the Tea Party in Boston, risked their \nlives in defiance of oppression more than 240 years ago and drew the \nfirst blood in what became the revolutionary conflict.\n  In the years before the Revolutionary War, one of the most notorious \nof the armed customs vessels patrolling Rhode Island's Narragansett \nBay, imposing the authority of the British Crown, was Her Majesty's \nship Gaspee. The ship and its captain, Lieutenant William Dudingston, \nwere known for destroying fishing vessels, seizing cargo, and flagging \ndown ships only to harass, humiliate, and interrogate the colonials.\n  A 100-year-old report says:\n\n       This unprincipled ruffian had ruthlessly ravaged the Rhode \n     Island coast for several months, destroying unoffending \n     fishing vessels, and confiscating everything he could lay \n     hands on. The attack on the ``Gaspe' '' caused the first \n     bloodshed in the struggle for American independence, and was \n     the first resistance to the British navy.\n\n  How did it come about? Well, on June 9, 1772, Rhode Island ship \ncaptain Benjamin Lindsey was en route to Providence from Newport, \nsailing in his packet sloop the Hannah, when he was accosted and \nordered to yield for inspection by the Gaspee. Captain Lindsey had had \nenough of the Gaspee. He ignored the command and raced up Narragansett \nBay, ignoring warning shots fired at him by the Gaspee. As the Gaspee \ngave chase, Captain Lindsey--who was a wily Rhode Island ship captain--\nrealized that his ship was lighter and drew less water than the Gaspee, \nso he sped north toward Pawtuxet Cove, toward the shallows off of \nNamquid Point. The Hannah shot over these shallows, but the heavier \nGaspee grounded and stuck firm. The British ship and her crew were \ncaught stranded in a falling tide and would need to wait many hours for \na rising tide to free the hulking Gaspee.\n  Captain Lindsey continued on his way to Providence and rallied a \ngroup of Rhode Island patriots at Sabin's Tavern. Together, the group \nresolved to put an end to the Gaspee's menace to Rhode Island waters. \nThey may have shared one thing with their Boston compatriots: They may \nhave been spirited themselves.\n  That night the men embarked down Narragansett Bay in eight longboats \nwith muffled oars. They encircled the stranded Gaspee and called on \nLieutenant Dudingston to surrender his ship. Dudingston refused and \nordered his men to fire on anyone who tried to board. The Rhode \nIslanders forced their way onto the Gaspee's deck, and in the struggle \nLieutenant Dudingston was wounded, shot with a musket ball. Right there \nin the waters off Warwick, RI, the very first blood in the conflict \nthat was to become the American Revolution thus was drawn.\n  The brave patriots took the captive Englishmen ashore and returned to \nthe Gaspee to rid Narragansett Bay of her noxious presence once and for \nall. Near daylight on June 10, they set her afire. The blaze spread to \nthe ship's powder magazine, and the resulting blast echoed across \nNarragansett Bay as airborne fragments of this former ship splashed \ndown into the water.\n  The incident prompted a special commission instructed by King George \nIII to deliver any persons indicted in the burning of the Gaspee to the \nRoyal Navy for transport to England for trial and execution.\n  Samuel Adams, in a letter published in the Newport Mercury on \nDecember 21, 1772, and reprinted in the Providence Gazette on December \n26, called it ``a court of inquisition, more horrid than that of Spain \nor Portugal. The persons who are the commissioners of this new-fangled \ncourt are vested with most exorbitant and unconstitutional power.'' A \nfew days later he wrote that ``an Attack upon the Liberties of one \nColony is an Attack upon the Liberties of all; and therefore in this \nInstance all should be ready to yield Assistance to Rhode Island.''\n  In a letter to a friend in Rhode Island, John Adams, the future \nPresident, summed up the tension felt across the Colonies:\n\n       ``We are all in a fury here about . . . the Commission for \n     trying the Rhode Islanders for Burning the Gaspee. I wonder \n     how your Colony happens to sleep so securely in a whole skin, \n     when her sisters are so worried and tormented.''\n\n  King George III offered a handsome reward for information leading to \nthe arrest of those responsible for the burning and destruction of his \nrevenue cutter. But Rhode Islanders are a loyal bunch--the reward went \nunclaimed.\n  The site of Rhode Island's opening salvo in the American Revolution \nis now named Gaspee Point. The annual Gaspee Days celebration has grown \nto span several weeks each June and includes an arts and crafts \nfestival, a walking tour with students playing the roles of \nColonialists, an encampment of local militia, a parade down \nNarragansett Parkway in Warwick, and, of\n\n[[Page S3946]]\n\ncourse, a mock burning of the HMS Gaspee.\n  My friend, State Representative Joe McNamara, and the Gaspee Days \nCommittee work each year to make these events the best they can be and \nto remind our State and Nation of the bravery of those few dozen souls. \nIndeed, this year another Rhode Islander Mark Tracy, a pediatric \nneurologist at Hasbro Children's Hospital, was able to acquire original \nnews stories from 1772 that related this incident and gave them to the \nGaspee Committee. I will note that he was able to get them rather \ninexpensively because ``the auction house concentrated on describing \nthe batches of newspapers--from the estate of an unnamed Providence \ncollector--in terms of the coming Boston Tea Party and other events,'' \npaying no attention to the fact that Rhode Island's greater act and \nprior act was actually enclosed and described in these newspapers.\n  This summer will also mark another historic anniversary for Rhode \nIsland because it was in July of 1663--350 years ago this summer--that \nKing Charles II granted a royal charter establishing the Colony of \nRhode Island and Providence Plantations.\n  ``To hold forth a lively experiment,'' it declared ``that a most \nflourishing civil state may stand and best be maintained . . . with a \nfull liberty in religious concernments.''\n  This charter provided in Rhode Island the world's first formal \nestablishment of freedom of religion, distinguishing us from the rigid \ntheocracy of Massachusetts, I am sorry to say, where ideological \nconformity was enforced by the gallows and the lash.\n  This charter has been called America's Magna Carta, for it is the \nfirst formal document in all of history granting the separation of \nchurch and state, along with extraordinary freedoms of speech, to a \npolitical entity. This ``lively experiment'' in Rhode Island blazed a \npath for American freedom of religion, one of our greatest national \nblessings. And, more practically, this liberty also allowed trading \nnetworks of Quakers and Baptists and Jews to connect in Newport and \ncreated their abundant wealth and commerce.\n  That freedom of religion, that freedom of conscience was the great \nlegacy of Rhode Island's founder Roger Williams, who had been banished \nfrom Massachusetts for his beliefs about religious tolerance. Williams \nestablished his new colony as ``a shelter for persons,'' as he said, \n``distressed for conscience.'' His battle for freedom of conscience, \nwon and reflected in the King Charles Charter, is the reason his statue \nstands right out there, outside the Chamber of the Senate.\n  I know these events and the patriots whose efforts allowed for their \nsuccess are not forgotten in my home State. This summer we will gather \nin these ways to celebrate Rhode Island's independent streak. We will \nrecall the courage and zeal of these men and women who embodied those \nmost American values--freedom of conscience and freedom from tyranny, \nvalues that ignited a revolution in the summer of 1776.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with Senator Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Monsanto Protection Act\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to talk about an issue that is \nimportant to many Oregonians, section 735 of the continuing resolution, \nalso known as the Monsanto Protection Act. I appreciate this \nopportunity to engage in a dialog about it with Senator Stabenow, who, \nas the chair of the committee, is doing a magnificent job of guiding \nthis farm bill through the Senate.\n  The Monsanto Protection Act refers to a policy rider the House \nslipped into the recently passed continuing resolution and sent over to \nthe Senate. Because of the time-urgent consideration of this must-pass \nlegislation--necessary to avert a government shutdown--this policy \nrider slipped through without examination or debate.\n  That outcome is unfortunate and unacceptable because the content of \nthe policy rider is nothing short of astounding. It allows the \nunrestricted sale and planting of new variants of genetically modified \nseeds that a court ruled have not been properly examined for their \neffect on other farmers, the environment, and human health.\n  The impact on other farmers can be significant. The current situation \nin Oregon of GMO wheat escaping a field test--resulting in several \nnations suspending the import of white wheat from the United States--\nunderscores the fact that poorly regulated GMO cultivation can pose a \nsignificant threat to farmers who are not cultivating GMO crops.\n  Equally troubling to the policy rider's allowance of unrestricted \nsale and planting of GMO seeds is the fact that the Monsanto Protection \nAct instructs the seed producers to ignore a ruling of the court, \nthereby raising profound questions about the constitutional separation \nof powers and the ability of our courts to hold agencies accountable.\n  Moreover, while there is undoubtedly some difference in this \nlegislative body on the wisdom of the core policy, there should be \noutrage on all sides about the manner in which this policy rider was \nadopted. I have certainly heard that outrage from my constituents in \nOregon. They have come to my townhalls to protest, and more than 2,200 \nhave written to me.\n  In an accountable and transparent legislative system, the Monsanto \nProtection Act would have had to be considered by the Agriculture \nCommittee, complete with testimony by relevant parties. If the \ncommittee had approved the act, there would have been a subsequent \nopportunity to debate it on the floor of this Chamber. Complete \ntransparency with a full opportunity for the public to weigh in is \nessential.\n  Since these features of an accountable and transparent legislative \nsystem were not honored and because I think the policy itself is \nunacceptable, I have offered an amendment to the farm bill which would \nrepeal this rider in its entirety. To this point, my efforts to \nintroduce that amendment have been objected to, and it takes unanimous \nconsent. This type of rider has no place in an appropriations bill to \nfund the Federal Government, and a bill that interferes with our system \nof checks and balances should never have become law.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I absolutely understand Senator \nMerkley's concerns about the issue and the concerns of many people \nabout this issue. There has been a long-running understanding that we \nshould not be legislating on appropriations, and I share the concern of \nmy colleague that the Agriculture Committee and other appropriate \ncommittees didn't have an opportunity to engage in this debate.\n  As the Senator from Oregon knows, this language was included in the \ncontinuing resolution, the bill that funds the government, and that \nbill will expire on September 30 of this year. I agree with my \ncolleague; we should not extend that provision through the \nappropriations process. We should have the same type of full and \ntransparent process that both Senator Merkley and I have talked about \ntoday.\n  I wish to assure my friend that I think it would be inappropriate for \nthat language to be adopted in a conference committee or otherwise \nadopted in a manner designed to bypass open debate in the relevant \ncommittees and this Chamber.\n  I will do my best to oppose any effort to add this kind of extension \nin the conference committee on this farm bill or to otherwise extend it \nwithout appropriate legislative examination.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I thank Senator Stabenow. I deeply \nappreciate the commitment of my colleague to ensure that the Monsanto \nProtection Act is not tucked into subsequent legislation in a manner \nthat bypasses full committee examination and Senate debate.\n  The farm bill is extremely important to our Nation. The Senator from \nMichigan has worked with me to incorporate a number of provisions that \nare important to the farmers in Oregon, including disaster programs, \nresponding to forest fires, specialty crop research\n\n[[Page S3947]]\n\nprograms, improvements in insurance for organic farmers, and low-cost \nloans offered through rural electrical co-ops for energy-saving home \nand business renovations.\n  It has been a real pleasure to work with Senator Stabenow on those \nprovisions and, again, I thank the Senator for her support for them and \nfor advocating responsible legislative examination of measures such as \nthe Monsanto Protection Act.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for \nhis advocacy on so many important policies in this legislation. We \nworked together closely on forest fires. Senator Merkley and I have \nbeen on the phone many times. He wanted to make sure I was aware of \nwhat has happened to farmers, homeowners, and landowners in Oregon.\n  We share a great interest in so many areas as it relates to our \norganic growers and rural development as well as what is happening in \nterms of energy efficiency, and, as my friend mentioned, rural electric \nco-ops.\n  I thank Senator Merkley for his leadership in many areas, and I look \nforward to working with the Senator from Oregon as we bring the farm \nbill to a final vote.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, again, I thank the chair for her \nleadership. I know how much she looks forward to the conclusion of this \nprocess as we try to enable folks to have various amendments which are \nappropriate for the farm bill debated on the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, the last week we were here, I gave \nmy weekly ``Time To Wake Up'' speech, as usual. It is a speech I wrote \nwell earlier. In a truly and, unfortunately, almost eerie coincidence, \nin my speech last week I spoke about a variety of natural disasters, \nincluding--and I will quote my own speech--``cyclones in Oklahoma.'' I \nsaid that in the same hour the cyclone touched down in Moore, OK.\n  When people are suffering in the wake of a calamity such as that, \nthey need to hear one thing from Washington; that is, how can we help. \nThat is all they need to hear. No one likes to be chided when what they \nneed is help and comfort.\n  J.E. Reynolds of the Daily Oklahoman wrote: ``Victims and survivors \nneed help, not a sermon in the first hours following a storm.'' I \nagree. I agree very much. My thoughts are with the victims of those \nOklahoma storms and with everyone who is working to pick up the pieces.\n  Far from seeking to exploit their tragedy, I had no idea of the \nweather in Oklahoma that was happening virtually at the time I gave the \nspeech, mentioning Oklahoma cyclones among other examples of extreme \nweather. But the eerie timing was what it was, and it did not send that \nsingle simple message: How can we help? So I am sorry. I have \napologized to my Oklahoma colleagues for the unfortunate coincidence of \ntiming of my earlier remarks, and I, of course, stand ready to help \nthem speed relief to their State.\n  It is, of course, impossible to say that any single weather event is \ncaused by climate change, and that is not something I have ever said. \nWhat is true is that climate change is altering weather patterns. \nScientists have studied these changes in weather patterns, and they \nhave modeled what is to come. Most are convinced that increases in the \nfrequency and intensity of extreme weather will be a result of the \nmegatons of carbon pollution we continue to emit.\n  The way I have described it is that climate change ``loads the dice'' \nfor extreme weather. We might not know which roll is caused by the \nloaded dice. We are going to get a 6 or a 7 or a 12 or a 2 sooner or \nlater anyway, but the extreme weather will come more often because of \nthis. We cannot pretend this isn't happening. We just hit 400 parts per \nmillion of carbon in the atmosphere, measured at the NOAA observatory \non Mauna Loa in Hawaii.\n  What does 400 parts per million mean? Well, look at it this way: For \nat least 800,000 years, and perhaps millions, we have been in a range \non Earth between 170 and 300 parts per million of carbon in our \natmosphere--800,000 years, minimum. Homo sapiens as a species have only \nbeen around for about 200,000 years, but just since the industrial \nrevolution and the ``Great Carbon Dump'' began, we have blown out of \nthe 170- to 300-parts-per-million range and have now hit 400.\n  This is very serious. We already see the effects. In Alaska, \npermafrost is melting and native villages once protected by winter ice \nare being eroded into the sea. In the Carolinas, roads to the Outer \nBanks have to be raised as seas rise and storms worsen. Coral reefs are \nfading off in Florida and in the Caribbean. In Rhode Island, we have \nmeasured almost 10 inches of sea level rise since the 1930s. Rhode \nIsland fishermen going out to sea from Point Judith are reporting \n``real anomalies . . . things just aren't making sense.''\n  All of these effects from climate change hit our farmers too. Since \nbefore the founding of this Republic, our farmers have relied on the \nSun, the rain, and the land to provide us their bounty. In 2011, \nfarming and the industries that rely directly on agriculture accounted \nfor almost 5 percent of the entire U.S. economy. But growing conditions \nin the United States are changing. More and more of our rainfall is \ncoming in heavy downpours. Since 1991, the amount of rain falling in \nwhat scientists call ``extreme precipitation events''--the amount of \nrain falling in extreme precipitation events has been above the 1901-\nto-1960 average in every region of the country.\n  In the Northeast where I am from extreme precipitation has increased \n74 percent just between 1958 and 2010. That matters to our farmers. The \nvery seasons are shifting. During the last two decades, the average \nfrost-free season was about 10 days longer than during that period \nbetween 1901 and 1960. In the Southwest it is an astonishing 3 weeks \nlonger. That matters to our farmers.\n  Average temperature in the contiguous United States has increased by \nabout 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since records began in 1895. Most of that \nincrease occurred since the 1980s, and 2012 was the warmest year ever. \nThat matters to our farmers.\n  This chart shows the extent of the U.S. drought in August of 2012. \nThe red and the dark areas indicate extreme and exceptional drought. \nThese conditions lasted most of the year. That matters to our farmers.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture Chief Economist Joseph Glauber \ntestified before the Agriculture Committee that ``the heat and rainfall \ndeficit conditions that characterized the summer of 2012 were well \noutside the range of normal weather variation.'' That is precisely what \nscientists mean when they say climate change ``loads the dice'' for \nextreme weather.\n  Climate change doesn't cause specific heat waves but the average \ntemperature shifts to warmer weather and the extremes move with it.\n  The New York Botanical Garden has seen apricot trees blossom in \nFebruary. The Audubon Society of Rhode Island has reported cherry trees \nin Providence blooming as early as December. This could affect farmers \ntoo.\n  Jeff Send, a Michigan cherry farmer, explained to the Agriculture \nCommittee that the record warm March temperatures brought his region's \ncherry trees out of dormancy early and exposed them to later freezes. \nIn Michigan he said:\n\n       We have the capacity to produce 275 million pounds of tart \n     cherries. In 2012, our total was 11.6 million pounds.\n\n  A potential of 275 million pounds; actual crop, 11.6 million pounds, \nless than one-twentieth, all because of that early warming and that \nearly bloom and the freezes that then killed them.\n  These changes I keep speaking about will continue if we go on \npolluting our atmosphere with greenhouse gases. As the harmful effects \nof climate change become more prevalent, our agricultural policies \nshould reflect the threat\n\n[[Page S3948]]\n\nposed to farming and food production by these changes. Yet in the farm \nbill climate change and extreme weather are not mentioned once.\n  Well, let me correct myself. They are mentioned once. The bill makes \nreference to an earlier law from 1990, and in the title of that 1990 \nlaw the words ``climate change'' appear. So by referring to the 1990 \nlaw, the farm bill once mentions climate change. But with all of this \ngoing on, that is the only reference. And the reason is that our \nRepublican colleagues will oppose legislation if it even mentions the \nwords ``climate change.''\n  We can't get around using the name of a statute that passed 20-plus \nyears ago, if ``climate change'' is in the name, so that one had to go \nin. But, otherwise, climate change is not mentioned in the farm bill, \ndespite all of this activity and effect on farming.\n  It is not that there aren't things we could do. The Bicameral Task \nForce on Climate Change, which I cochair with Representative Waxman, \nSenator Cardin, and Representative Markey, asked stakeholders in the \nagriculture economy about carbon pollution and our resiliency to \nclimate change.\n  The National Farmers Union, which represents more than 200,000 family \nfarmers, ranchers, and rural members, responded--this is the National \nFarmers Union:\n\n       Mitigating and adapting to climate change is of significant \n     concern to our membership and will be a defining trend that \n     shapes the world.\n\n  That is the National Farmers Union on climate change. It will be ``a \ndefining trend that shapes the world.''\n  Cap-and-trade legislation, the Farmers Union said, would provide a \nboon to farming and forest lands that take the lead on reducing \ngreenhouse gases. The National Sustainable Agricultural Coalition \nencouraged a comprehensive approach. An effective policy to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions, wrote the group, ``should have as its \ncornerstone the support and promotion of sustainable organic cultural \nsystems throughout USDA's programs and initiatives.''\n  Even the American Farm Bureau Federation, which has at times opposed \nclimate change legislation, expressed clear support for farming \npractices that keep carbon out of the atmosphere and for investments in \nbiofuels and in renewable energy.\n  We are grateful to all of the scientific and industry leaders who \nhave shared their ideas with the Bicameral Task Force on Climate \nChange. We need active and willing partners in the effort to ensure our \nfarms can meet the needs of a strong nation.\n  They are not alone. Responsible people across the spectrum want us to \nact on carbon and climate. Responsible people such as the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff of the United States of America, the U.S. Conference of \nCatholic Bishops, and dozens of major scientific societies--virtually \nevery major one--and the folks in the corporate sector who run Apple \nand Ford and Nike and Coca Cola--get it. Republicans such as Ronald \nReagan's Secretary of State George Schultz, former House Science \nCommittee chair Sherry Boehlert, former Utah Governor and GOP \nPresidential candidate John Huntsman--responsible people across the \nspectrum get it. The scientists at NASA get it, and they are telling us \nto get serious. They are the ones who took a robot the size of an SUV \nand sent it millions of miles to Mars where they landed it safely on \nthe surface of Mars and now they are driving it around. Do we think \nthey might know what they are talking about? They get it. All across \nthe spectrum, people get it. They are on one side getting something \ndone about climate change.\n  On the other side are the polluters with their familiar retinue of \ncranks, extremists, and front organizations. That is basically it. And \nfor some reason, the Republican Party--the great American Republican \nParty--has chosen to hitch its wagon to the polluters. I do not get it. \nI do not see how that works out for them.\n\n  Every day the pollution gets worse, and every day the evidence that \nthis is serious gets stronger. I do not know why the Republican Party \nof Theodore Roosevelt wants to paint itself as the party that went with \nthe polluters and not the scientists; that went with the fringe extreme \nagainst the responsible center. It has to be a bad bet. It is a crazy \nbet.\n  To make that bet you have to believe God will intervene and perform \nsome magic, in violation of His own laws of physics and chemistry. Is \nthat a bet you want to take? You have to believe that the market will \nwork, even though the market is flagrantly skewed. Is that a bet you \nwant to make? And you have to believe the people who have a vested \ninterest to lie and disbelieve the people who have no conflict of \ninterest, unless you are prepared to think that the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff and the Catholic bishops and all the major scientific \norganizations all have a conflict of interest. Does that sound very \nsensible? Does that sound like where you want to hitch the wagon of one \nof America's great political parties?\n  Let me close, as we talk about climate change in the context of the \nfarm bill, by quoting our friend Senator Tester, who recently spelled \nout the crisis facing our farmers in an op-ed in USA Today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that op-ed be printed at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  Senator Tester and his wife Sharla have been farming for almost 40 \nyears--the same land that his grandparents homesteaded. This is how our \nfriend from Montana described the changes he sees:\n\n       When I was younger, frequent bone-chilling winds whipped \n     snow off the Rocky Mountain Front and brought bitterly cold \n     days that reached -30 degrees. Today, we have only a handful \n     of days that even reach 0 degrees. Changes in the weather are \n     forcing Sharla and I to change how we operate our farm. It's \n     now more difficult to know when to plant to take advantage of \n     the rains.\n       Some might say the end of bitter winters will be a boon for \n     Montana's economy. But with milder winters, we've seen the \n     sawfly come out earlier to destroy our crops before they can \n     be harvested. Montana's deep freezes also used to kill off \n     the pine bark beetle, which today kills millions of acres of \n     trees across the American West.\n\n  He writes:\n\n       Montanans already understand that climate change is \n     affecting our daily lives. The argument isn't whether the \n     world is changing, it's how to respond.\n\n  I will say, once again, it is time--it is well past time--for us in \nCongress to wake up to the urgent challenge of our time. There is a lot \nat stake. There is a lot at stake for all of us. There is a lot at \nstake for every State, and there is a lot at stake for every \ngeneration, particularly for the generations that are to follow.\n  So often I hear my Republican colleagues expressing concern about \nwhat our debt will do to future generations. Fine. What will a ruined \nclimate do to future generations? What will acidified seas do to future \ngenerations? What will worse extreme weather and rising seas do to \nfuture generations?\n  There is indeed a lot at stake, and it is time to wake up. It is time \nto take action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From USA Today, Apr. 5, 2013]\n\n                 Climate Change Already Felt by Farmers\n\n       Montanans already understand that climate change is \n     affecting our daily lives. The argument isn't whether the \n     world is changing, it's how to respond.\n       I am a third-generation farmer from north-central Montana. \n     My wife, Sharla, and I farm the same land homesteaded by my \n     grandparents a century ago, continuing a Montana tradition of \n     making a living off the land. We've farmed this land for \n     nearly 40 years.\n       For the average American, particularly those of us from \n     rural America, the political conversation about climate \n     change seems worlds away. For us, warmer winters and extreme \n     weather events are already presenting new challenges for our \n     way of life.\n       It's an experience with climate change that too often goes \n     unreported and overlooked. But as a nation we must start \n     paying attention, because the experiences of America's \n     farmers, ranchers, and sportsmen and women will change the \n     debate if policymakers start listening.\n       Scientists tell us that climate change will bring shorter, \n     warmer and drier winters to Montana. I see it every time I \n     get on my tractor.\n       When I was younger, frequent bone-chilling winds whipped \n     snow off the Rocky Mountain Front and brought bitterly cold \n     days that reached -30 degrees. Today, we have only a handful \n     of days that even reach 0 degrees. Changes in the weather are \n     forcing Sharla and I to change how we operate our farm. It's \n     now more difficult to know when to plant to take advantage of \n     the rains.\n       Some might say the end of bitter winters will be a boon for \n     Montana's economy. But\n\n[[Page S3949]]\n\n     with milder winters, we've seen the sawfly come out earlier \n     to destroy our crops before they can be harvested. Montana's \n     deep freezes also used to kill off the pine bark beetle, \n     which today kills millions of acres of trees across the \n     American West.\n       Those dead trees--many of which litter our National \n     Forests--combined with historic drought to make 2012's \n     record-setting wildfires possible. Last year's blazes, which \n     burned Colorado suburbs, National Parks and more than 1 \n     million acres in Montana, will become commonplace as the West \n     continues to heat up. And I fear that epic droughts and \n     floods will continue to be regular stories in the national \n     news.\n       Montana's economy depends in part on the natural beauty of \n     our state. Our outdoor economy generates nearly $6 billion \n     each year. But decimated forests, wildfires and lost wildlife \n     habitat put our outdoor economy at risk.\n       Our economy also depends on our state's number one \n     industry: agriculture. Montana's farmers and ranchers feed \n     our state and our nation, but back-to-back years of record \n     flooding and drought are testing even the hardiest of our \n     producers.\n       Montanans already understand that climate change is \n     affecting our daily lives. The argument isn't whether the \n     world is changing, it's how to respond.\n       History will judge us based on what we do next. In the \n     Senate, I am pushing to develop more sources of renewable \n     energy. I still fill up my tractor with diesel fuel because \n     there are no better options available, but by encouraging the \n     development of wind, water, next-generation biofuels and \n     other renewables, we will create new jobs as we cut the \n     emissions that warm our planet and increase our energy \n     options. That's why I introduced my Public Lands Renewable \n     Energy Development Act (http://www.wildlifemanagement\n     institute.org/index.php?option=com_content\n     =article=562:bipartisan-senate-bill-\n     would-establish-renewable-energy-leasing-\n     process=34:ONB%20Articles\n     =54) to streamline the permitting for renewable energy \n     projects on public lands.\n       I've also proposed my Forest Jobs and Recreation Act \n     (http://www.tester.senate.gov\n     /?p=issue=70). For decades, conservationists and loggers \n     fought to control Montana's forests while our trees became \n     fodder for fire and infestation. My bill brought Montanans \n     together to set aside some lands for recreation while \n     requiring logging in others. By better taking care of our \n     forests, we will reduce the growing threat of wildfire.\n       These are important steps, but achieving a comprehensive \n     solution to climate change and energy development and use \n     will require all Americans to work together before it's too \n     late. Last year was the hottest year on record (http://\narticles.washingtonpost.com/\n2013-01-08/national/36207396_1_noaa-analysis-\nclimate-change-thomas-r-karl) in the United States. We are \n     increasingly victims of strong and frequent natural disasters \n     that leave us struggling to pay for both prevention and \n     recovery efforts.\n       Folks in rural America are already adapting to the new \n     realities brought by climate change. For farmers like me, it \n     means erratic weather is putting my ability to make a living \n     off the land and produce food at risk.\n       But for folks devastated by Hurricane Sandy or picking up \n     the pieces from last year's wildfires, the ongoing political \n     debate over climate change is even more frustrating. They \n     know action is needed. They're calling for change. The only \n     question is when we are going to listen.\n       Jon Tester is the junior Senator from Montana. He and his \n     wife, Sharla, still farm the 1,800 acres his grandparents \n     homesteaded in 1912.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend leaves the floor, I \nappreciate very much him doing his utmost to keep our eye on the \nproblem we have facing this country.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the leadership of \nKrys Bart, the president and CEO of the Reno-Tahoe Airport Authority. \nKrys has worked at the airport authority for 14 years and transformed \nthe airport into a modern facility that welcomes visitors from across \nthe United States and the world to Northern Nevada.\n  Krys arrived in Northern Nevada in 1998 at a turning point for the \nairport.\n\n[[Page S3950]]\n\nDecisions by the previous management team had negatively impacted \nemployee morale and hurt the airport authority's reputation in the \ncommunity. With her steady leadership, Krys focused on achievable goals \nto deliver results for airport passengers and improve the airport \nauthority's reputation. Krys helped direct more than $500 million in \ninfrastructure upgrades at the airport, including upgrading runways, \ntaxiways, safety systems, and noise mitigation programs. I worked with \nKrys to secure more than $250 million in Federal funding for Reno-\nTahoe, including a new $27 million air traffic control tower. These \ninfrastructure upgrades not only created jobs in Northern Nevada, but \nthey also improved the passenger experience for flyers. In fact, the \nReno-Tahoe Airport was recognized as one of the top five most efficient \nairports in North America three times under Krys' leadership.\n  Krys' reputation as an innovative Nevada leader has been recognized \non a national scale by major industry groups and associations. She was \nselected by her peers to serve as the chair of the board of the \nAmerican Association of Airport Executives, the largest airport \nassociation in the world. Krys is a frequent lecturer at international \naviation conferences, sharing the best management practices from her \ntime as an airport executive. In 2011, Krys received the Distinguished \nService Award from the American Association of Airport Executives. In \n2008, she was chair of the American Association of Airport Executives, \nand the Airport Revenue News named her the 2006 Airport Manager of the \nYear. These are just a few of the many awards and accomplishments that \nhave followed Krys throughout her career, and it is a testament to the \nrespect she has earned as one of the Nation's great airport managers.\n  Later this year, Krys will step down as the president of the Reno-\nTahoe Airport Authority after a long and distinguished career in the \naviation industry. While Krys' departure is a loss for the greater Reno \ncommunity, her work to improve the airport and the greater community \nwill benefit Nevadans for decades to come. I am pleased to recognize \nKrys' accomplishments before the Senate today and I wish her all the \nbest in her retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/04/senate-section/article/S3950-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

LOEBLEIN\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I honor a superb leader, liaison, \nand warrior. After more than 3 years of service as Director of the Navy \nSenate Liaison Office, CAPT James T. Loeblein is very deservedly moving \non and moving up to assume the responsibilities of a rear admiral, \nlower half. On this occasion, I believe it is fitting to recognize \nCaptain Loeblein's distinguished service and dedication to fostering \nthe relationship between the U.S. Navy and this Chamber.\n  The captain is a 1985 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy. In addition \nto serving as the executive officer of the USS John S. McCain DDG 56, \nhe has held both command-at-sea and major command. Captain Loeblein has \nalso served as executive assistant to commander, U.S. Third Fleet, and \nas chief of staff and Maritime Operations Center (MOC) director, U.S. \nNaval Forces Central Command/U.S. Fifth Fleet in Manama, Bahrain. \nCaptain Loeblein reported as director, Navy Senate Liaison, in May \n2010.\n  Over the course of the last 3 years, Captain Loeblein has led 37 \ncongressional delegations to 47 different countries. He has escorted 44 \nMembers of Congress, 48 personal and professional staff members, and I \nhave had the pleasure of traveling with Captain Loeblein on many of \nthese trips. He has distinguished himself by going above and beyond the \ncall of duty to facilitate and successfully execute each and every \ntrip, despite any number of weather, aircraft, and diplomatic \ncomplications.\n  This Chamber will feel Captain Loeblein's absence. I join many past \nand present Members of Congress in my gratitude and appreciation to \nCaptain Loeblein for his outstanding leadership and his unwavering \nsupport of the missions of the U.S. Navy, the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senate Select Committee \non Intelligence, and others. I wish him and his wife CAPT Carol \nLoeblein ``fair winds and following seas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/04/senate-section/article/S3950-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3950-S3951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OBSERVING PRIDE MONTH\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, when Governor Christine Gregoire signed \nthe Washington State marriage equality bill into law last year, it was \na day of joy for all of the loving, committed LGBT couples of \nWashington--and for all who love, respect, and support them. And when \nvoters approved the law in a referendum last November, we showed the \nNation once again that we can change the course of history and give \ntrue voice and meaning to the idea that all are created equal. This law \ntakes us one important step closer towards true equality for LGBT \nfamilies across Washington State. It is proof of the incredible power a \ncommunity can have when we come together to fight for equality. \nWashington is now 1 of 12 States to have affirmed the right for LGBT \ncouples to marry--an amazing sign of progress in our Nation.\n  I am proud to work with my colleagues in the Senate to achieve equal \nrights for LGBT Americans in Washington State and across the country. \nEarlier this year, I joined 172 Members of the House of Representatives \nand 39 Senators in filing an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court in \nUnited States v. Windsor, arguing the Defense of Marriage Act is \nunconstitutional and should be struck down. And, as a senior member of \nthe Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I led a letter to Veterans \nAffairs Secretary Eric Shinseki calling for an expedited waiver process \nto grant every same-sex spouse of a veteran burial rights in our \nnational cemeteries.\n  There is much to celebrate today, but still so much more to be done \nto ensure equal rights for LGBT Americans. As we look back upon our \nrecent victories, we must also recommit to our efforts and harness the \nenergy we used to achieve marriage equality last year to continue this \nfight. From our immigration and employment laws to our policies for \nveterans and military families, there is still plenty of work to be \ndone to ensure all Americans, including members of our LGBT community, \nare treated equally.\n  Equal protection under the law is a fundamental right in our country. \nNo one should suffer discrimination because of their race, religion, \nnational origin, age, sex, disability, sexual orientation, or gender \nidentity. Whether applying for a job, finding a home, eating in a \nrestaurant, seeking credit, serving in our military, or attending \nschool, we must ensure all citizens are treated fairly and equally. To \nme, the fight for equality for the LGBT community is a fight for what \nit means to be American. That is why Pride Month is so important.\n  Each June, Pride Month brings our community together to honor \ndiversity, equality, and love. And this year, we can celebrate some \ntruly historic gains as LGBT couples are finally able to express their \ncommitment to each other in the same way so many other Washingtonians \nhave throughout our State's history--by joining in marriage and saying \n``I do.''\n  Pride Month is a time to commemorate our accomplishments and recharge \nfor the fight ahead. We have many more opportunities to advance our \nefforts in the coming months and years, and we will not give up until \nwe have\n\n[[Page S3951]]\n\nachieved full equality under the law for all Washingtonians and all \nAmericans. I wish to thank the countless organizations that have led us \nto the victories and accomplishments we celebrate in June. When we \ngather together in moments such as this, we speak with one unified \nvoice for the cause of equality and give true meaning to our Founders' \nbelief that all are created equal. I am proud to fight for the LGBT \ncommunity in Washington and across the country, and I will continue to \nensure the voices of LGBT Americans and their allies are heard in the \nUnited States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/04/senate-section/article/S3951-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     RECOGNIZING COLORADO EXPORTERS\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate four \noutstanding businesses that have won the President's ``E'' Award for \ntheir role in advancing Colorado's export industry. The ``E'' Award was \ncreated by President John F. Kennedy in 1961 to recognize companies \nthat have made significant contributions to increasing American \nexports. It is one of the highest honors an export company can receive.\n  Many of these companies are small- and medium-sized firms--the \nlifeblood of our economy--and we can proudly say that of the 57 \nbusinesses honored, 4 were from our home State of Colorado: Frederick \nExports, World Trade Center Denver, Geotech Environmental Equipment, \nand Lightning Eliminators. These innovative companies are strengthening \nour State's economy, creating jobs, and paving the way for other \nbusinesses in the State interested in exporting their products and \nservices overseas.\n  In 2012, American exports hit an all-time record high of $2.2 \ntrillion and Colorado exports increased by more than 10 percent growing \nto $8.1 billion. These businesses are a perfect example of how \ncompanies across the State can take advantage of this trend by tapping \nthe growing international market. These achievements not only benefit \nthese individual businesses, but they increase economic development for \nour State.\n  The World Trade Center Denver and Frederick Export, both based in \nDenver, were honored for assisting and facilitating export activities. \nThe World Trade Center Denver educates businesses throughout the Rocky \nMountain region about international trade and connects these businesses \nto the more than 300 World Trade Centers located in 100 countries. With \nover 250 members locally, the World Trade Center Denver has helped \ncountless local businesses expand their markets and build strategic \npartnerships.\n  Frederick Export is an export management company that has \nsuccessfully helped more businesses in Colorado export their products \nand services abroad and grow their customer base. Companies represented \nby Frederick Export have seen growth of 20 percent or more each year.\n  Denver-based Geotech Environmental Equipment and Boulder-based \nLightening Eliminators were recognized for showing sustained export \ngrowth. Lightning Eliminators, a leading supplier of lightning \nprotection and prevention products and services, has grown its exports \nby nearly 200 percent over the past 4 years. Lightning Eliminators \nexports its innovative, patented lightning protection technology to \nsuch faraway places as Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Taiwan.\n  Geotech Environment Equipment provides quality environmental \nequipment to more than 20,000 companies worldwide and employs almost \n100 people. Its exports have grown 40 percent over the past 4 years.\n  The pioneering spirit and innovative nature of Coloradans like these \nare spurring new job growth, driving our economy, and moving our State \nforward. I join the White House in honoring the contributions these \ncompanies have made to both Colorado and the country. I look forward to \nseeing their future progress and thank them for the vital part they \nhave played in helping our State thrive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/04/senate-section/article/S3951-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING EXCEPTIONAL NEVADA STUDENTS\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize three of \nNevada's brightest students--Caolinn Mejza, Sharon Fang, and Justin \nJoseph--for earning the prestigious title of Presidential Scholar from \nthe U.S. Department of Education. Presidential scholars are chosen for \noutstanding test scores, essays, grades, and community service \ncommitments.\n  The White House Commission on Presidential Scholars named only 141 \nscholars throughout the United States this year. Caolinn Mejza, who \nattends the Las Vegas Academy of International Studies, Performing & \nVisual Arts, Sharon Fang of Clark High School, and Justin Joseph of \nValley High School will represent Nevada as our State's winners. Each \nPresidential scholar will receive a medallion at a ceremony on June 16 \nin Washington, DC.\n  While honoring these students' academic achievements, it is also \nimportant to recognize the value and importance of education in our \nState. We must continue to support teachers and to improve our \neducation system for students at all stages. I am dedicated to \nincreasing the quality of education and ensuring that every student \ngraduates prepared to enter college or the workforce.\n  On behalf of the residents of the Silver State, I am proud to \nrecognize Caolinn, Sharon, and Justin for their accomplishments and \ntheir contributions to our State.

Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Ceasar \nSalicchi for being named a Distinguished Nevadan by the Nevada System \nof Higher Education Board of Regents during the commencement ceremony \nat the University of Nevada, Reno, UNR. Mr. Salicchi is a military \nveteran and advocate for people with disabilities. He is truly \ndeserving of this prestigious honor, which is awarded to current and \nformer Nevadans who have made significant contributions to the \ncultural, economic, and scientific or social advancement of Nevada and \nits people.\n  Mr. Salicchi served in the U.S. Army from 1946 to 1947. After he \ncontracted polio at the age of 25 in 1952, he became an advocate for \nothers with disabilities. He is a founding member of the Elko \nAssociation for Retarded Children, established in 1969, and served as \nthe office manager for Elko General Hospital from 1962 to 1970. Mr. \nSalicchi went on to serve four different Nevada Governors as a \ncommittee member for the Developmental Disabilities Act as well as the \nEmploy the Handicapped Act. His lifetime dedication to serving those \nwith disabilities is inspiring.\n  Not only is Mr. Salicchi a strong advocate and proponent for those \nwith disabilities, but he is also a dedicated public servant. He has \nserved the people and community of Elko County with dignity and honor \nas the county treasurer from 1971 to 2006.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Ceasar \nSalicchi for his accomplishments and contributions to Nevada. I hope \nMr. Salicchi's example of public service and advocacy will be an \nexample to all of us of the power that one individual can have on the \npositive progression of the Silver State and its people.

WILSON\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise to ask that this body pay \nhigh tribute to an outstanding leader and trusted advocate for our \nnation's injured and ill veterans, their families, and survivors. I am \nreferring to Arthur H. Wilson, the chief executive officer and national \nadjutant of the Disabled American Veterans. Mr. Wilson, after \ndedicating 47 years of service to our nation's veterans, is retiring as \nleader of that august group of 1.2 million veterans. His steadfast \ndevotion and dedication in leading DAV has made the organization the \nNation's premier veterans service organization offering assistance, \ncompassion, and support to our injured heroes.\n  DAV is a service organization representing the brave men and women\n\n[[Page S3952]]\n\nwho have suffered and survived wartime military service. Founded in \n1920 by those wounded in World War I, DAV has been a devoted advocate \nfor 92 years on behalf of those who have sacrificed for our freedom.\n  Mr. Wilson served with distinction in the U.S. Air Force as a runway \nconstruction specialist from 1962 to 1966, including service in \nSoutheast Asia. He joined DAV as a national service officer trainee in \nAtlanta following his honorable discharge in 1966. He was subsequently \nassigned as a national service officer in Buffalo, NY, and \nPhiladelphia, PA, and later held supervisory positions in DAV's \nnational appeals office at the Department of Veterans Affairs' Board of \nVeterans Appeals in Washington, DC, in 1974.\n  In 1976, Mr. Wilson was promoted to management duties at DAV's \nNational Service and Legislative Headquarters in Washington, DC, \nserving for 12 years as national service director before being \nappointed Executive Director of the Washington headquarters in 1993.\n  For the past 19 years, Mr. Wilson has served as national adjutant and \nchief executive Officer of DAV.\n  He is retiring from his distinguished career as only the sixth \nnational adjutant in the history of the organization. He also serves as \npresident of the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation working to \nbuild the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial in Washington, \nDC, and is a member of the board of trustees of the USS Intrepid Museum \nFoundation.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in extending our nation's thanks to \nArthur Wilson for his dedication and commitment to our nation's \nveterans and his leadership of DAV. His devotion to America's wartime \nheroes serves as a brilliant example to all citizens of our \nnation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/04/senate-section/article/S3952-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/04/senate-section/article/S3952-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/04/senate-section/article/S3952-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:25 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 126.

A bill to provide for a prescription drug take-back program \nfor members of the Armed Forces and veterans, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nServicemembers and Veterans Prescription Drug Safety Act of 2013, with \nmy colleagues Senators Blumenthal, Boxer, Manchin, Murkowski, and \nBoozman. This bill would require the Attorney General to establish drug \ntake-back programs in coordination with both the Department of Defense \nand the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  The number of reported suicide deaths in the U.S. military surged to \na record 349 in 2012, which is more than the number of servicemembers \nwho lost their lives in combat while serving our nation in Afghanistan \nduring the same period of time. According to the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, the number of suicides among veterans has reached an \nastounding rate of 22 each day based on data collected from more than \n21 states.\n  These losses are unacceptable. We are losing dozens of America's \nfinest each month, squandering precious talent that our nation needs \nand depriving families of their loved ones. Today's soldiers are \ntomorrow's veterans; their mental health needs must be met now to avoid \nfuture suicides.\n  There is substantial evidence that prescription drug abuse is a major \nfactor in military and veteran suicides. In its January 2012 report, \nArmy 2020: Generating Health and Discipline in the Force, the Army \nfound that 29 percent of suicides involved individuals with a known \nhistory of psychotropic medication use, including anti-depressants, \nanti-anxiety medicine, anti-psychotics, and other controlled substances \nsuch as opioids.\n  This report recommended the establishment of a military drug take-\nback program to help combat prescription drug abuse in the ranks. Given \nthat more than 49,000 soldiers were issued three or more psychotropic \nor controlled substance prescriptions last year, and an estimated 3,500 \nsoldiers illicitly used prescription drugs, it is past time we act on \nthis recommendation and implement a military drug take-back program.\n  In Afghanistan, we have invested billions of dollars and devoted some \nof the military's best minds to protect our soldiers and give them the \ntools they need to reduce the threat of an improvised explosive devise \nattack. Unfortunately, we have not focused sufficient resources or \ncreativity to suicide prevention. While I applaud the military's, and \nespecially the Army's, and VA's efforts to address this threat \nseriously, we must do more.\n  At present, only the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, has the \ninherent authority to conduct a drug take-back program. Three years \nago, the Congress passed the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act \nof 2010, which provided the Attorney General the flexibility necessary \nto delegate similar authority to other agencies for the collection and \ndisposal of controlled substances. Since that time, the Attorney \nGeneral has not sufficiently exercised his existing authority to \nprovide this much needed assistance to the Department of Defense and \nthe VA. The DEA recently proposed new regulations to expand the options \navailable to collect controlled substances for purposes of disposal. \nUnfortunately, the proposed regulations fall short because they fail to \nauthorize the Department of Defense or the VA to collect controlled \nsubstances through appropriate mechanisms.\n  DEA has concerns that DOD and VA cannot maintain the same strict \naccountability of drugs to prevent the misuse, abuse, or sales in the \nblack market. I am confident, however, that the DOD--the institution \nthat has developed and implemented programs for the handling of nuclear \nweapons and classified information--and the VA are capable of \nconducting drug take-back programs with the utmost accountability and \nhighest of standards.\n  Excluding the DOD and VA from conducting drug take-back programs is \ndetrimental to efforts to reduce controlled substance abuse, decrease \nnon-medical use of prescription drugs, prevent diversion of controlled \nsubstances, and limit the possibility for accidental overdose and death \nfor our servicemembers and veterans, or their family members. This \nlegislation will provide the necessary authority to give both \ndepartments an effective drug-take back program that will help address \nthe scourge of suicide.\n  The loss of even one servicemember or veteran to a potentially \npreventable suicide involving controlled substance abuse or misuse is \nunacceptable. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this \nimportant, life-saving legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Sanders, Mr. Casey, Mrs. Hagan, Mr. Franken, Mr. Bennet, Mr. \n        Whitehouse, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Murphy, and Ms. Warren):\n  S. 1094. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, throughout my career in public service I \nhave been committed to ensuring that all children in this country \nreceive a quality education. Today, I join my Democratic colleagues on \nthe Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which I \nchair, in introducing a bill to reauthorize the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965, ESEA, which has become better known in \nrecent years as the No Child Left Behind Act, NCLB. In my view, our \nbill will appropriately redefine the Federal role in education in this \ncountry and will focus our collective efforts to improve the lives of \nour most vulnerable children.\n  I want to start with a few words about the Federal role in education, \nsince ESEA, in large measure, determines that role. While it is \ncertainly true that education is primarily a State and local function, \nthe Federal Government also plays an important role, and a well-\neducated citizenry is clearly in the national interest. A cardinal \nFederal role is to ensure all Americans, regardless of race, gender, \nnational origin, religion and disability have the same equal \nopportunity to a good education. Likewise, the Constitution expressly \nstates that our national government was formed to ``promote the general \nwelfare, and secure the blessings of liberty.'' The general welfare is \ngreatly endangered when the populace is not adequately educated. And, \neducation is critical to liberty.\n  ESEA was first passed in 1965 in order to provide aid to States and \nschool districts to improve education for children from low-income \nfamilies. And in 1975, Congress passed the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, later renamed the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act, to assist States and districts in educating \nchildren with disabilities. For more than 40 years, the Federal \ngovernment has trained its focus on the mission that all children \nshould have the chance to fulfill their full potential.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act represented a departure from previous \nreauthorizations of ESEA. Lawmakers felt compelled to be more \nprescriptive with States to ensure that they improved their low-\nperforming schools and focused on closing pernicious student \nachievement gaps. NCLB defined ``adequate yearly progress'' for schools \nand districts; it required districts to put aside money to implement \npublic school choice and tutoring in schools identified for \nimprovement; it included a list of rigorous interventions for low-\nperforming schools and an additional category of ``restructuring'' for \nthe most chronically low-performing schools with even more severe \nconsequences. NCLB reflected good intentions. However, as we have seen \nover the course of the past 12 years, those good intentions did not \ntranslate to good policy on-the-ground. Many States lowered \nexpectations for students with the standards and assessments they \ndeveloped. Many local\n\n[[Page S3958]]\n\nschools and teachers were branded failing when some of their students \ndid not meet the rigid benchmarks the Federal Government had set--even \nthough in many instances students had made substantial progress. \nDistricts felt hamstrung by the requirement to spend money on reforms \nthat simply did not meet the needs of many students.\n  The Secretary of Education has given schools a reprieve from these \nonerous requirements through a flexibility agreement that States have \nundertaken voluntarily. While this reflects a positive change for the \ntime being, it is no substitute for a new law. The actions of the \nSecretary, while laudable, may only last as long as this \nadministration. What will happen in 2016? Will the flexibility \nagreements stay in place or will States be forced to revert to the \nrequirements of what will then be a 15-year-old law that reflects old \nthinking?\n  The bill I am introducing along with HELP Committee Democrats follows \na different course than NCLB, and one similar to the flexibility \nagreements instituted by the U.S. Department of Education. We ask for a \nsystem of shared responsibility with States and school districts. I \nbelieve that we are entering an era in which the Federal Government can \nwork in partnership with States to improve our Nation's schools, while \ncontinuing to provide a backstop to avoid returning to old ways. Our \nbill gets rid of AYP, but sets Federal parameters for State-and \nlocally-designed accountability systems. These systems must: cover all \nstudents, including students with disabilities and English learners; \ncontinue to measure and report on the performance of all schools; \nexpect sufficient progress for all schools and subgroups of students; \nand provide for local interventions in low-performing schools or \nschools with low-achieving student subgroups beyond the lowest \nperforming 5 percent. States that have received a waiver from the \nSecretary in the past two years can continue to operate under the \nagreements they made. States without a waiver will develop \naccountability plans that set schools on a path to attain the same \nlevels of student achievement as the top 10 percent of schools in their \nState. However, if States have a different accountability system in \nmind, they can develop one that is equally ambitious to the ones above, \nsubject to approval by the Secretary of Education, an important \nsafeguard on the quality and integrity of these systems.\n  Our bill sets the high bar of ensuring that students who graduate \nfrom high school are college- and career-ready. It narrows the Federal \nfocus to turning around persistently low-achieving schools and our \nNation's dropout factories--those schools that graduate less than 60 \npercent of their students--as well as schools with significant student \nachievement gaps.\n  Our bill also asks States to put greater emphasis on the learning of \nchildren in the early years because we know that so many of our \nchildren, particularly children from low-income families, have gaps in \nlearning before they even enter the school door. I have often said that \nlearning begins at birth and the preparation for learning begins before \nbirth. For the first time in the law's history, it is a purpose of \nTitle I to provide children access to high-quality early learning \nexperiences so that they come to school ready to learn. Our bill also \nencourages States to begin providing full-day kindergarten if they do \nnot do so already. It also asks States to have, or establish, early \nlearning and development guidelines that describe what children should \nknow and be able to do before they enter kindergarten so that States \ncan address gaps in learning as early as possible.\n  Our bill also takes the significant step of closing the \n``comparability loophole'' so that funds provided through Title I of \nESEA will finally serve as additional dollars for our neediest \nstudents, and Title I schools will get their fair share of Federal \nresources. It also provides districts with more flexibility in how \nStates and districts spend their Federal funds while ensuring that the \nresources designated to serve our most disadvantaged students get to \nthose students. The bill creates a Professional Growth and Improvement \nSystem that requires the development of rigorous and fair teacher and \nprincipal evaluations, and provides these critical school staff with \nthe support they need to continually improve teaching and learning. It \nalso leverages opportunities for more children to access high quality \nearly learning programs and adds new protections for some of our most \nvulnerable children--homeless students and students in foster care--so \nthat they will be better served by schools.\n  Our bill strategically consolidates programs and focuses grant funds \non a smaller number of programs to allow for greater flexibility, and \nsupports districts in extending the school day and year, strengthening \ntheir literacy, science, math or technology programs, fostering safe \nand healthy students, and offering a more well-rounded curriculum that \nincludes the arts and physical education. It invests in effective \nprograms to train and support principals and teachers for high-need \nschools. And, it fosters innovation through new programs like Race to \nthe Top, Investing in Innovation, and Promise Neighborhoods.\n  I believe this is a very good bill and I am proud of our efforts. We \nowe it to our kids and our nation to produce a law that provides States \nand districts with the certainty, support and resources they need to \nmake meaningful strides in improving our educational system. To that \nend, I would note that historically, education policy in Congress has \nbeen done in a bipartisan fashion. I want to give appropriate credit to \nthe Ranking Member of the HELP Committee, the distinguished senior \nSenator from Tennessee, Senator Alexander. We worked in good faith for \nmany months to attempt to forge an agreement on a path forward. \nHowever, in the end, there were certain fundamental issues on which we \ncould not agree. That is why, along with other HELP Committee \nDemocrats, I have decided to move forward with a Democratic bill. It is \nmy strong hope that Senate Republicans will recognize the significant \nchanges that we have made in this bill to address their concerns, and \nwill work with us to reconcile remaining disagreements so that together \nwe can pass a law that provides children with a greater chance at \nreaching their full potential. It is the duty and responsibility of \nmembers of Congress in both houses to replace the No Child Left Behind \nAct with a new and better law.\n  This bill represents significant change, and change is difficult. We \nmust work to together to move from a culture of minimal compliance with \nFederal requirements to one of shared innovation, shared responsibility \nand success for all students. I look forward to working towards this \nnew partnership and to the next chapter of an effective Federal role in \npromoting educational excellence and equity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 1096. A bill to establish an Office of Rural Education Policy in \nthe Department of Education; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in 1865, Horace Greeley wrote in the New \nYork Tribune, ``Go West, young man, and grow up with the country.''\n  For decades, Greeley's words captured the imagination of a country, \nand millions of families flocked to the West for a glimpse of the \nAmerican dream. Rural America continues to thrive, and places like my \nhome State of Montana offer an excellent place to raise a family. But \nthere is a no question that rural and frontier America present unique \ncircumstances that differ substantially from our more urban neighbors.\n  While rural education is becoming an increasingly large and important \npart of the U.S. public school system, the unique challenges and \nopportunities within rural communities are often misunderstood or \noverlooked. According to the Digest of Education Statistics reported \nannually by the National Center for Education Statistics, the number of \nstudents attending rural schools increased by over 11 percent, from \n10.5 million in 2004 to nearly 11.7 million by 2008. Rural students now \ncomprise almost one fourth of the Nation's public school enrollment. \nAnd nearly one-third of all schools in the nation are located in rural \nareas.\n  Yet despite the significant percentage enrolled in rural schools, the \nimportance of rural education is often obscured by the fact that rural \nstudents\n\n[[Page S3959]]\n\nare--naturally--widely-dispersed, located in small, geographically \nisolated school districts. The size, diversity, and complexity of rural \neducation support a greater policy focus on the unique challenges and \nsolutions for rural education.\n  Montana is the fourth largest State by land mass, totaling over \n147,000 square miles. More than half of Montana's 830 schools enroll \nless than 100 students. From Eureka to Ekalaka, from Scobey to Darby, \nthese small schools dot the landscape, providing not only a learning \nenvironment but often a thriving community center.\n  Montana's rural communities are doing an excellent job educating our \nnext generation. Overall, Montana graduation rates are higher than the \nnational average. Montana students taking the National Assessment of \nEducational Progress, NAEP, in 2011 scored higher than the national \naverage in both reading and math.\n  But despite the success of Montana's rural schools, they also face a \nunique set of challenges that their urban-centric peers may not even \ncomprehend.\n  For example, rural schools report greater difficulties in recruiting \nand retaining qualified teachers, due to inability to offer competitive \nsalaries, geographic isolation, and for some, severe weather. Rural \ndistricts often have fewer personnel. The district superintendent is \noften also the high school principal. He or she may also be the Title I \ncoordinator, the math curriculum specialist, and sometimes also the bus \ndriver. In isolated areas, schools face challenges in providing \nprofessional development and training for teachers and principals. \nSmall rural districts are often located long distances from other \ndistricts, towns, and universities, drastically reducing opportunities \nto partner or collaborate. Additionally, the long distances students \nmust travel between school and home make it more difficult to \nparticipate in traditional remedial services, mentoring, and after-\nschool programs.\n  And while Horace Greeley encouraged us to ``Go West'', many of the \nDepartment of Education's recent initiatives have failed to do just \nthat. In the first two rounds of the Race to the Top competitive grant, \nonly one State west of the Mississippi received funding.\n  And in some cases, even good intentions have created adverse \nconsequences. The first round of the Investing in Innovation, i3, \ncompetitive grant program provided ``competitive preference points'' \nfor applicants serving at least one rural district, in an effort to \nencourage and support rural applicants. However, the Department's lack \nof guidance and independent scorers' lack of understanding of rural \nareas still left authentically rural programs at a clear disadvantage. \nThe Rural School & Community Trust highlighted in its report Taking \nAdvantage that this ``rural preference'' instead had the effect of \ninducing urban applicants to include minimal rural participation merely \nin order to gain the additional scoring points for primarily urban \nprojects. While the Department has made strides to improve the \ncompetitive chances of rural applicants, funding under the I3 grant \ncontinues to be directed to more urban school districts.\n  I am joined today by my colleagues Senator Rockefeller of West \nVirginia and Senator Collins of Maine in reintroducing the Office of \nRural Education Policy Act. This bipartisan bill will establish the \nOffice of Rural Education Policy, housed at the Department of \nEducation's Office of Elementary & Secondary Education. This Office and \nits Director will be tasked with coordinating the activities related to \nrural education and advising the Secretary on issues important to rural \nschools and districts. The legislation requires the Department to \nconsider the impact of proposed rules and regulations on rural \neducation and to produce an annual report on the condition of rural \neducation. The goal of this bill is to allow rural schools to focus \ntheir time and resources on students in the classroom rather than red \ntape in the bureaucracy.\n  The Office of Rural Education Policy will be tasked with establishing \na clearinghouse for collecting and disseminating information related to \nthe unique challenges of rural areas, as well as, the innovative \nefforts underway in rural schools to tackle these challenges.\n  We have received strong support from dozens of organizations, \nincluding: American Association of Community Colleges, American \nAssociation of School Administrators, Alliance for Excellent Education, \nCenter for Rural Affairs, Coalition for Community Schools, Council for \nOpportunity in Education, Montana School Board Association, Montana \nState Superintendents Association, Montana Rural Education Association, \nNational Association of Development Organizations, National Education \nAssociation, National Farmers Union, National School Board Association, \nOrganizations Concerned about Rural Education, Rural School and \nCommunity Trust, and Save the Children. I want to thank all the \nsupporters of the bill, and want to particularly thank the efforts of \nthe Rural School and Community Trust for its steadfast commitment to \nthis proposal.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues here in the Senate to \nmove this legislation, to ensure our rural students and schools across \nthe country are given a fair shake.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1096\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Office of Rural Education \n     Policy Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Secretary of Education has recognized that \n     ``[r]ural schools have unique challenges and benefits'', but \n     a recent report by the Rural School and Community Trust \n     refers to the ``paucity of rural education research in the \n     United States''.\n       (2) Rural education is becoming an increasingly large and \n     important part of the United States public school system. \n     According to the Digest of Education Statistics reported \n     annually by the National Center for Education Statistics, the \n     number of students attending rural schools increased by more \n     than 11 percent, from 10,500,000 to nearly 11,700,000, \n     between the 2004-2005 and 2008-2009 school years. The share \n     of the Nation's public school enrollment attending rural \n     schools increased from 21.6 percent to 23.8 percent. In \n     school year 2008-2009, these students attended 31,635 rural \n     schools, nearly one-third of all schools in the United \n     States.\n       (3) Despite the overall growth of rural education, rural \n     students represent a demographic minority in all but 3 \n     States, according to the National Center for Education \n     Statistics.\n       (4) Rural education is becoming increasingly diverse. \n     According to the National Center for Education Statistics, \n     the increase in rural enrollment between the 2004-2005 and \n     2008-2009 school years was disproportionally among students \n     of color. Enrollment of children of color in rural schools \n     increased by 31 percent, and the proportion of students \n     enrolled in rural schools who are children of color increased \n     from 23.0 to 26.5 percent. More than one-third of rural \n     students in 12 States are children of color, according to \n     research by the Rural School and Community Trust (Why Rural \n     Matters 2009).\n       (5) Rural education is varied and diverse across the \n     Nation. In school year 2007-2008, the national average rate \n     of student poverty in rural school districts, as measured by \n     the rate of participation in federally subsidized meals \n     programs, was 39.1 percent, but ranged from 9.7 percent in \n     Connecticut to 71.9 percent in New Mexico, according to the \n     National Center for Education Statistics.\n       (6) Even policy measures intended to help rural schools can \n     have unintended consequences. In awarding competitive grants \n     under the Investing in Innovation Fund program under section \n     14007 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 \n     (Public Law 111-5), the Secretary of Education attempted to \n     encourage and support rural applicants by providing \n     additional points for proposals to serve at least 1 rural \n     local educational agency. But according to research by the \n     Rural School and Community Trust (Taking Advantage, 2010), \n     this ``rural preference'' mainly had the effect of inducing \n     urban applicants to include rural participation merely in \n     order to gain additional scoring points for primarily urban \n     projects.\n       (7) Rural schools generally utilize distance education more \n     often for both students and teachers. A fall 2008 survey of \n     public schools by the National Center for Education \n     Statistics found that rural schools were 1\\1/2\\ times more \n     likely to provide students access for online distance \n     learning than schools in cities.

Res. 159\n\n       Whereas it is a well-founded principle that the power to \n     tax involves the power to destroy;\n       Whereas employees of the Internal Revenue Service (commonly \n     known as the ``IRS'') have publicly admitted that the IRS \n     targeted Tea Party groups in a manner that infringes on the \n     free association rights and free speech rights of those \n     groups;\n       Whereas the IRS admitted that employees of the IRS engaged \n     in politically discriminatory actions;\n       Whereas the IRS used the taxing power as a political tool \n     to intimidate Tea Party groups from engaging in free speech;\n       Whereas, according to media reports, as early as in 2010, \n     the IRS was targeting Tea Party groups;\n       Whereas President Obama is aware that a Federal agency \n     under his control has admitted to targeting Tea Party groups;\n       Whereas, according to media reports, a report by the \n     Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration indicates \n     that some Tea Party groups withdrew applications for tax-\n     exempt status as a result of the discriminatory actions of \n     the IRS;\n       Whereas, according to the Washington Post, in late June \n     2011, employees of the IRS discussed giving special attention \n     to case files in which groups made statements that \n     ``criticize[d] how the country is being run'' and educated \n     the people of the United States ``on the Constitution and \n     Bill of Rights'' and targeting groups interested in limiting \n     government; and\n       Whereas the discriminatory actions of the IRS impacted the \n     free speech rights of the groups targeted by the IRS: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Internal Revenue Service engaged in discriminatory \n     behavior;\n       (2) Congress should use existing authority--\n       (A) to investigate potential criminal wrongdoing by \n     individuals who authorized or were involved in targeting \n     people of the United States based on their political views; \n     and\n       (B) to determine if other entities in the administration of \n     President Obama were involved in or were aware of the \n     discrimination and did not take action to stop the actions of \n     the Internal Revenue Service;\n       (3) President Obama should terminate the individuals \n     responsible for targeting and willfully discriminating \n     against Tea Party groups and other conservative groups; and\n       (4) the Senate condemns the actions of all individuals and \n     entities involved in the infringement of the First Amendment \n     rights of members of the Tea Party and other affected groups.\n\n[[Page S3961]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/04/senate-section/article/S3961-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 160--RELATIVE TO THE MEMORIAL OBSERVANCES OF THE \n  HONORABLE FRANK R.
