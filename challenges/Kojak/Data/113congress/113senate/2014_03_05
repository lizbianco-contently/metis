Mr. President, because of the inclement weather we have had \nto rearrange things. Senator McConnell and I have been directing our \nstaffs to help us get through what we need to do. We should be able to \nfinish this week's work tomorrow, but that is not assured. So we are \ngoing to be working throughout the day to move forward as quickly as we \ncan. Everyone should be aware that we could have some votes into the \nevening tonight and tomorrow. We may have to be here on Friday.\n  Following my remarks and those of the Republican leader, the Senate \nwill proceed to executive session with the time until 11:45 equally \ndivided and controlled. At 11:45 there will be up to three rollcall \nvotes. We expect to recess following those votes to allow for the \nweekly caucus meetings and work through the remaining nominations this \nafternoon. Senators will be notified when the votes are scheduled.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER: The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                          Adegbile Nomination\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Department of Justice and this \nadministration have too often put politics ahead of the law. The record \nof the nominee before us to head the Civil Rights Division strongly \nindicates that if he were confirmed, the politicization of the Justice \nDepartment would increase even further. He has a long record of \nleftwing advocacy marked by ideologically driven positions and very \npoor judgment.\n  In the District of Columbia v. Heller he argued in the Supreme Court \nthat it would be ``radical'' to recognize ``an individual right to keep \nand bear arms.'' In fact, before the Supreme Court he repeatedly \ndescribed the principle of individual liberty protected by the Second \nAmendment as a ``radical'' proposition. It was the position advocated \nby the nominee, however, that the Supreme Court rule was woefully at \nodds with the Constitution and individual liberty.\n  He also called the requirement to present identification before \nvoting a ``modern poll tax.'' Americans strongly support this basic \nsafeguard for the integrity of our elections. It has been endorsed by \nliberal Democrats such as President Carter. Not surprisingly, in \nCrawford v. Marion County the Supreme Court rejected the nominee's \nviews on that subject as well.\n  In Hosanna-Tabor v. EEOC he took the position in the Supreme Court \nthat a church did not have the First Amendment right to hire or fire \nindividuals who were responsible for conveying the church's message and \nimplementing its mission. The position the nominee advocated would \ngreatly infringe on the free exercise of rights of religious \ninstitutions. The Supreme Court rejected his views there too, this time \n9 to 0.\n  But it is his advocacy on behalf of the Nation's most notorious cop \nkiller that most calls into question his fitness for the powerful \ngovernment position he seeks. Back in December of 1981, 25-year-old \nofficer Daniel Faulkner was conducting a routine traffic stop when \nWesley Cook, also known as Mumia Abu-Jamal, shot him in the back. He \nthen stood over Officer Faulkner and shot him several more times in the \nchest. As Officer Faulkner laid dying in the streets defenseless, Abu-\nJamal shot him in the face, killing him. At the hospital Abu-Jamal \nbragged that he had shot Officer Faulkner and expressed his hope that \nhe would die.\n\n[[Page S1286]]\n\n  At trial he was remorseless. He turned the trial into political \ntheater, interrupting the proceedings, insulting the judge, and even \nsmirking at Officer Faulkner's widow when the blood-stained shirt was \nheld up in court as evidence. Four eyewitnesses saw Abu-Jamal gun down \nOfficer Faulkner--four eyewitnesses. Three more witnesses at the \nhospital heard him confess to the crime. Ballistics evidence proved \nthat Officer Faulkner had been shot with a handgun that was registered \nto Abu-Jamal, which was found at the scene of the murder, along with \nthe shell casings.\n  Based on this overwhelming evidence, Abu-Jamal was tried, convicted, \nand sentenced to death. What followed was a 30-year effort by the far \nleft to glorify Abu-Jamal and to exonerate him. This effort was taken \nup by law professors, leftwing activists, and in 2009 by the \norganization which the nominee before us led for several years, the \nNAACP Legal Defense Fund.\n  When the Legal Defense Fund became Abu-Jamal's cocounsel in 2011, its \npress release called him a ``symbol'' of ``racial injustice.'' It said: \n``Abu-Jamal's conviction and death sentence are relics of a time and \nplace that was notorious for police abuse and racial discrimination.'' \nAn LDF lawyer attended rallies for Abu-Jamal. She said it was \nabsolutely an ``honor'' to represent him and that doing so was her \n``pleasure.'' She said: ``There is no question in the mind of anyone at \nthe Legal Defense Fund that the justice system has completely and \nutterly failed Mumia Abu-Jamal.'' This demagoguery of the murder of a \ndefenseless police officer has shocked and offended law enforcement \nofficers from across the country. Current District Attorney of \nPhiladelphia Seth Williams wrote the Judiciary Committee last month to \noppose this nominee's confirmation. Here is what he had to say:\n\n       Apart from being patently false, moreover, these claims are \n     personally insulting to me. As an African-American, I know \n     all too well the grievous consequences of racial \n     discrimination and prejudice. I also know that Abu-Jamal was \n     convicted and sentenced because of the evidence, not because \n     of his race. And I have continued to fight for the jury's \n     verdict because it was the just result.\n\n  District Attorney Williams notes that, given all the cases in which \nthe Legal Defense Fund could be involved, it was ``telling'' that the \nnominee would go out of his way to inject himself and his organization \ninto this one. ``His decision to champion the cause of an extremist \ncop-killer . . . sends a message of contempt to police officers.''\n  The national Fraternal Order of Police wrote President Obama to \nexpress its ``vehement opposition to the nomination.'' The FOP wrote \nthat ``as word of this nomination spreads through the law enforcement \ncommunity, reactions range from anger to incredulity,'' and that it \n``can be interpreted in only one way: It is a thumb in the eye of our \nnation's law enforcement officers.''\n  The Kentucky Narcotics Officers' Association wrote me a powerful \nletter in opposition to the nomination as well. In it they note: ``The \nthought that [the nominee] would be rewarded, in part, for the work he \ndid for Officer Faulkner's killer is revolting.''\n  The nominee has acknowledged that as the director of litigation for \nthe Legal Defense Fund, he ``supervised [its' entire legal staff.'' \nAccording to LDF's own Web site, the director is responsible for \ncoordinating ``the selection of cases'' the LDF chooses to get involved \nin. He manages ``all aspects of the legal docket.'' He oversees ``all \naspects of discovery, motion practice, briefs, trials, appellate work \nand amicus briefing.''\n  As director of litigation he is responsible for advocacy both in the \ncourts of law and in the court of public opinion.\n  Let me repeat. He is responsible for advocacy both in the courts of \nlaw and in the court of public opinion. As the head of the Civil Rights \nDivision, the nominee now would be responsible for fulfilling the \nDivision's mission of upholding the civil and constitutional rights of \nall individuals. He would have powerful resources at his disposal as \nwell as the discretion to determine how and on whose behalf to use \nthem.\n  As the junior Senator from Pennsylvania has noted, the head of the \nCivil Rights Division must have an absolute commitment to truth and \njustice. My friend from Pennsylvania goes on to observe that, while \nthere are many highly qualified Americans who could carry out this \ncritical mission, the nominee's record creates serious doubts that he \nis one of them.\n  I might point out that the senior Senator from Pennsylvania also \nopposes this nominee. So I could not say it any better. Everyone \ndeserves a fair trial and a zealous legal defense. Lawyers are not \npersonally responsible for the actions of their clients. But lawyers \nare responsible for their own actions. In this case the nominee \ninserted his office in an effort to turn reality on its head, impugn \nhonorable and selfless law enforcement officers, and glorify an \nunrepentant cop killer.\n  This is not required by our legal system. On the contrary, it is \nnoxious to it. I therefore will oppose the nomination and strongly urge \nmy colleagues to do so as well.\n  Finally, I would like to note the manner in which this nomination may \ncome to an up-or-down vote. Last fall the majority chose to break the \nrules of the Senate in order to change the rules of the Senate. In so \ndoing, they violated the right of the minority under the rules to \nrequire extended debate on controversial nominees to powerful Federal \npositions. This serious breach of the rules is an ongoing violation. It \nis highlighted again today by the majority's effort to muscle through \nthe current nominee under a procedure they came up with in the majority \nleader's conference room, not through the rules committee and regular \norder as was promised.\n  Members of the majority who voted for this heavyhanded procedure last \nfall will be responsible for the nominee's confirmation today--if that \noccurs--regardless of how they vote on the nomination itself. And they \nshould not be heard to complain that the nomination process is not as \nproductive as it was only a few months ago--before they threw caution \nto the wind and violated our rights under the Standing Rules of the \nSenate.\n\n\n                                Ukraine\n\n  Mr. President, last week's military intervention by Russian forces \ninto Crimea makes it clear that President Putin is determined to \nmaintain the Russian sphere of influence there--and at a cost to his \ncountry. That is why Washington and its allies will now be of such \ncritical importance in Ukraine.\n  According to the Budapest agreement, Russia has an obligation to \nrespect the sovereignty of its neighbor, and the West should stand \nunited in holding President Putin to that agreement.\n  The United States, NATO, and the EU should also work together to \nsupport the interim government in Kiev by supporting free and fair \nelections. And Members of Congress are already discussing loan \nguarantees and additional sanctions against Russia.\n  But if there is one thing Russia's military intervention into Crimea \nalso makes absolutely clear, despite the best hopes of some, it is \nthis: The foundation of the international system is governed by force, \ncapability, and interest. Let me say that again. The foundation of the \ninternational system is governed by force, capability, and interest. \nThat is the reality by which we should be guided in approaching this \nconflict, and it is a reality by which we should be guided when it \ncomes to American power more generally.\n  As I have argued before, this President has eroded American \ncredibility in the world:\n\n       [It starts] with the arbitrary deadlines for military \n     withdrawal . . . and the triumph and declaration that \n     Guantanamo would be closed within a year, without any plan \n     for what to do with its detainees. . . . there were the \n     executive orders that ended the Central Intelligence Agency's \n     detention and interrogation programs . . .\n       We all saw the so-called reset with Russia, and how the \n     President's stated commitment to a world without nuclear \n     weapons led him to hastily sign an arms treaty with Russia \n     that did nothing to substantially reduce its stockpile, or \n     its tactical nuclear weapons.\n       We saw the President announce a strategic pivot to the \n     Asia-Pacific, without any real plan to fund it, and an effort \n     to end the capture, interrogation, and detention of \n     terrorists, as well as the return of the old idea that \n     terrorism should be treated as a law enforcement matter.\n       After a decade-long counterinsurgency in Afghanistan, we've \n     seen the President's failure to invest in the kind of \n     strategic modernization that's needed to make his pivot into \n     Asia meaningful.\n       Specifically, his failure to make the kind of investments \n     that are needed to maintain our dominance in the Asia Pacific \n     theater, in the kind of naval, air, and Marine Corps\n\n[[Page S1287]]\n\n     forces that we'll need there in the years ahead, could have \n     tragic consequences down the road.\n\n  Let's be clear. Whether it is recent reports suggesting the Obama \nadministration knew for years about potential Russian violations of the \ntreaty that regulates medium-range missiles or whether it is Russia's \nrefusal to negotiate a reduction in tactical nuclear weapons, its \nshipment of arms to the Syrian Government, or its invasion of Crimea, \nwe can now put to rest for good any notion that the relationship with \nRussia has been reset.\n  President Putin sees himself as the authoritarian ruler of a great \npower--and one who is determined to preserve his regime. That is how we \nshould understand him.\n  In invading Crimea he clearly concluded that protecting Russia's \nsphere of influence there was worth the risk of Russian lives and of \nany response on the part of the United States and Europe. We and our \nallies pay a price when our capabilities diminish. That is why I have \ncontinually advocated for investments in the modernization of our \nforces, for marrying our commitments to our capabilities, and for a \nrecognition that receding from the world comes with consequences--\nmainly bad ones.\n  We remain a member of NATO and have treaty commitments to our fellow \nmembers. We also know that in Asia, China has pursued a policy of \ncoercing its neighbors and exploiting territorial disputes. American \nmilitary might is the backbone of the international order, but when we \ndiminish our capabilities, we must understand that regional powers will \nfill the void.\n  Our President is still the leader of the free world. We will support \nhim however we can to ensure a satisfactory outcome for the Ukrainian \npeople and to prevent this conflict from escalating into a wider war. \nUkrainians deserve our support. But this is a moment when President \nObama is going to have to lead.\n\n\n                       Honoring our Armed Forces\n\n                  Chief Petty Officer Collin T. Thomas\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak in tribute to a brave Kentuckian who \nhas given his life in service to his country. CPO Collin T. Thomas, a \nhighly distinguished and decorated Navy SEAL, was killed in his final \nmission on August 18, 2010, in eastern Afghanistan in direct combat \nwith the enemy. In his final act, he killed a Taliban fighter who had \nshot him and other members of his team, thus saving his teammates. For \nthese acts of valor, he received the Silver Star Medal. He was 33 years \nold.\n  Chief Petty Officer Thomas held a rating of chief special warfare \noperator, was a Navy SEAL for 10 years, and served in the Navy for 13. \nIn that time he received many awards, medals, and decorations, \nincluding the Silver Star Medal for the actions I have described, three \nBronze Star Medals with combat ``V'' distinguishing device, a Purple \nHeart, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, two Joint Service \nCommendation Medals with combat ``V'' distinguishing device, a Navy and \nMarine Corps Commendation Medal, six Marine Corps and Navy Achievement \nMedals, two Combat Action Ribbons, four Good Conduct Medals, the \nNational Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medals with two \ncampaign stars, the Iraq Campaign Medal, Marksmanship Medals with \n``expert'' service device for both rifle and pistol, and a multitude of \npersonal, unit and campaign awards.\n  On September 11, 2001, Collin Thomas's cousin, Navy weatherman AG1 \nEdward Earhart, was the first identified military casualty of the \nterrorist attack that struck the Pentagon. Sadly, this was not the \nfirst time terrorism had directly struck Collin's family. His uncle, \nMaj. John Macroglou, was the senior marine killed in the Beirut \nbarracks bombing in 1983.\n  Then a Navy SEAL for a little over 1 year, Collin vowed to his family \nto make amends for the death of his uncle and his cousin. Collin's \nfather Clayton says:\n\n       When asked by his grandfather why he continued to be a \n     SEAL, Collin would say that he was going to be the one to \n     capture or kill bin Laden.\n\n  Collin was born in San Diego, and by high school he had lived in \nseven States and two countries. But he always considered himself a \nKentuckian.\n  After his father's retirement from the U.S. Marine Corps, the Thomas \nfamily settled in Morehead, where Collin attended Rowan County Senior \nHigh School. He ran track and played varsity football. Collin enjoyed \ncamping and hunting. He liked to shoot and was good at it. His \ngrandmother would prepare squirrel gravy from the spoils of Collin's \nhunting expeditions reluctantly because as much as she wanted to \ncelebrate her grandson's marksmanship, squirrel was not a favored \ndelicacy in her household.\n  A story from Collin's high school years demonstrates that the \nmotivation to help others that was the driving force behind his Navy \nSEAL career was present at a young age. At age 14 Collin stood up for \nsome younger children to bullies on the schoolbus. ``He didn't even \nknow these children, but he knew they were being bullied and denied a \nbus seat by bigger and older children,'' Clayton remembers. He ``gave \nthem his seat and told the bullies they would have to answer to him if \nhe ever saw them bullying these or any other children again. . . . The \ncharacter and sense of fairness he demonstrated taking on bullies he \ndid not know to protect others would be repeated throughout his life.''\n  Collin was very driven and focused from a young age on his life's \ngoal--becoming a Navy SEAL. He began his unofficial training at age 15 \nafter talking with a Navy master chief at the Naval Academy, who gave \nhim an idea of the physical, academic, and psychological training \nCollin would need to undergo to follow his dream. By the time he \nreceived his driver's license, Collin had also completed his SCUBA open \nwater dive certification.\n  Collin graduated from high school in 1995, and at Morehead State \nUniversity he took every ROTC class available. The summer after his \nfirst year of college, Collin was selected for basic airborne training \nby his ROTC commander. He met many Active-Duty Navy SEALs there and \ncame away convinced he was ready.\n  Collin enlisted in the Navy on February 20, 1997, and his oath was \nadministered by his father Clayton, a retired marine lieutenant \ncolonel.\n  Collin completed basic training, was an honor graduate at the \nhospital corpsman school, and trained in basic underwater demolition. \nHe was then assigned to a SEAL team to develop his skills as a special \nwarfare operator. He became a SEAL on June 9, 2000, and was sent on his \nfirst deployment to South America.\n  Chief Petty Officer Thomas was a highly skilled and capable SEAL, and \nhis constant training took him around the world. He became certified as \na paramedic and a lead climber, able to scale near-vertical cliffs. He \nwas a master parachutist specializing in nighttime high-altitude \noperations. He mastered underwater diving and was able to stay \nunderwater for over 4 hours. He won inter-unit shooting competitions \nwith both longbarrelled and shortbarrelled weapons. He excelled in snow \nskiing and skied the most difficult airdrop courses in South America, \nEurope, and America.\n  In April 2010 Collin achieved a lifetime goal when he and two of his \nSEAL teammates climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, the highest \nfreestanding mountain in the world at 19,341 feet above sea level. They \nmade most of the climb in speedy time. Near the summit, however, Collin \nencountered two women from California who were ill from altitude \nsickness. Against his guide's advice, Collin stopped to give them \nmedical attention, delaying his final ascent. Collin's father recalled, \n``Somehow, one of the women found out that Collin had been killed, and \nshe sent a letter telling the family how kind he was to them, and she \nfelt he had saved their lives.'' Once again, the same young man who had \nstood up to bullies on a schoolbus had set his own interests aside to \nsave others.\n  Collin was buried with full military honors at Forest Lawn Memorial \nGardens in Rowan County, KY.\n  We are thinking of his loved ones today, including his parents \nClayton and Paul; his sister Meghan; his fiancee Sarah Saunders, and \nmany other beloved family members and friends.\n  To his father Clayton I say ``Semper fidelis''--your son was always \nfaithful.\n  One of Collin's senior officers, engaged in many highly sensitive and \nconsequential missions, was unable to give his name for attribution on \nthe Senate floor. However, he was able to\n\n[[Page S1288]]\n\nsay these words about Collin, which I will share with all of you. This \nunnamed officer said:\n\n       Collin Thomas was a brave American patriot and an \n     incredibly gifted Navy SEAL. His tireless professionalism, \n     inspiring passion for life, and humble demeanor made him a \n     role model for all who knew him. We are deeply saddened by \n     this tremendous loss of a brother in arms.\n\n  I know my colleagues share these sentiments, and we mourn the loss of \nCPO Collin T. Thomas. We extend our deepest condolences to his family. \nNo words spoken in this Chamber can take away the sadness and loss \nCollin's family must feel, but I do want them to know this Nation and \nthis Senate are deeply grateful for CPO Collin T. Thomas's service and \nsacrifice. We are humbled to pay tribute to his life and legacy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/05/senate-section/article/S1288-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ADEGBILE TO BE AN ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Debo P. Adegbile, of New \nYork, to be an Assistant Attorney General.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 11:45 \na.m. will be equally divided between the Senator from Vermont and the \nSenator from Iowa or their designees.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, similar to my Republican leader, I come \nto the floor to share my concerns about Mr. Adegbile's nomination, and \nI will explain my voting no today.\n  I begin by saying I believe the nominee possesses high moral \ncharacter and personal integrity. I have met him. I am also aware he \nhas been working on the chairman's staff of the Judiciary Committee for \nthe last few months. Unfortunately, I have reached the conclusion that \nthis nominee isn't the right pick to lead the Civil Rights Division.\n  First of all, it is no secret that I believe the last individual to \nlead this office, the current Secretary of Labor, was very political \nand extremely committed to a host of political causes. Of course, I \ndon't expect President Obama to nominate conservatives to his political \nappointments, but as we all know, these are very important and powerful \njobs. The individual who holds them wields a tremendous amount of power \non behalf of the Department of Justice.\n  I expect the President's nominees to be liberal, maybe even very \nliberal, and in the vast majority of cases the President is entitled to \nhave people of his own choosing serving in these important positions, \nbut the Senate must provide its advice and consent, which is what we \nare doing today.\n  In my view the President's nominees can't be so committed to \npolitical causes and so devoted to political ideology that it clouds \nhis or her judgment. This is particularly important here, given that \nthis office, under the leadership of the last Assistant Attorney \nGeneral, was marked by controversy, and those controversies, in my \nview, were directly linked to that individual's deep commitment to a \nhost of liberal causes, regardless of how well held they were. At the \nend of the day I believe it clouded his judgment.\n  With that brief bit of background, I would first note there is \nbipartisan opposition to this nomination. As I will discuss in a few \nminutes, there is also widespread opposition from the law enforcement \ncommunity.\n  Seth Williams, a Democrat and Philadelphia's district attorney, \nopposes this nomination. Many of the largest national law enforcement \norganizations, including the Fraternal Order of Police and the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations, vigorously oppose this nomination \nas well. This opposition is based upon the nominee's record--and the \nnominee's record, in my view, demonstrates that the nominee has a long \nhistory of advocating legal positions far outside the mainstream. I \nbelieve it is a record which demonstrates he is simply too deeply \ncommitted to these causes to be an effective and fair leader of this \nvery important Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice.\n  I am not going to mention every aspect of the nominee's record I find \ntroubling but a few will be mentioned.\n  His record on First Amendment issues should give us all pause. For \nexample, in the Hosanna-Tabor case before the Supreme Court, the \nnominee advocated for a position which would have infringed on the \nfree-exercise rights of religious organizations. Specifically, he \nargued that a church didn't have the right to freely hire or fire \nindividuals who were responsible for conveying the church's message and \ncarrying out its religious mission. This is at the core of what \nreligious freedom means under our Constitution. The nominee's view was \na dramatic departure from established First Amendment jurisprudence. In \nfact, it was so outside the mainstream that the Supreme Court \nunanimously rejected it 9 to 0.\n  Likewise, the nominee's views on the Second Amendment to our Federal \nConstitution are out of step with the law. In Heller he argued, ``The \nSecond Amendment does not protect an individual's right to keep and \nbear arms for purely private purposes.'' He also argued that ``the \nright protected by the Second Amendment are ones that exist only in the \ncontext of a lawfully organized militia.''\n\n  The Supreme Court, of course, rejected that view, as we all know, and \nthe Supreme Court's decision very much strengthened the right of \nindividuals to bear arms.\n  I have also been disappointed by the answers the nominee provided to \na number of my questions. For example, I asked whether he believed \nvoter-ID requirements--which have been upheld by the Supreme Court in \nthe Crawford case--are the modern-day equivalent of a poll tax. I asked \nthis question for several reasons.\n  First of all, according to press reports, this nominee said as much \nin 2005 during a discussion in Georgia regarding voter-ID laws. \nAccording to press reports, he called voter-ID cards ``a modern poll \ntax.'' But the Supreme Court upheld Indiana's voter-ID law as \nconstitutional in the Crawford case in 2008.\n  So, if the nominee continues to believe that voter-ID laws are the \nmodern-day equivalent of a poll tax and is firmly committed to that \nprinciple, I am concerned--we all ought to be concerned--that he would \nlook for creative ways to undermine and challenge those laws, \nnotwithstanding the Crawford case upholding Indiana's voter-ID law.\n  It goes without saying, of course, a significant part of this job is \nthe enforcement of voting-rights laws, and that enforcement power \nshould be entrusted only to someone we are confident will apply the law \nin an evenhanded way and, obviously, uphold what the Supreme Court has \nalready said was constitutional.\n  I have also repeatedly asked the nominee whether, if confirmed, he \nwould commit to implementing the recommendations made by the Department \nof Justice's Inspector General regarding the hiring process in the \nCivil Rights Division. The IG's report exposed a hiring process in that \ndivision which was structured in a way that systematically screened out \nconservative applicants. So, evidently, only one point of view is \nwelcomed in that division. But the nominee will not commit to \nimplementing the recommendations the IG's report has put out which \naddressed those issues so the office has the benefit of an \nideologically diverse group of lawyers. This concerns me, and it ought \nto concern my colleagues. Again, this is a division in the Department \nof Justice which needs a clean break from the political partisanship \nwhich plagued the office under the last Assistant Attorney General.\n  Finally, I wish to address the nominee's involvement with and \nrepresentation of Mumia Abu-Jamal. To understand why the nominee's \ninvolvement in this case is so concerning to many of us, a bit of \nhistory is in order.\n  Mr. Abu-Jamal is this country's most notorious cop-killer. The facts \nof the Abu-Jamal case are well known and cannot be seriously disputed.\n\n[[Page S1289]]\n\n  Back in December of 1981 Abu-Jamal--then known as Wesley Cook--gunned \ndown Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner. Abu-Jamal first shot \nOfficer Faulkner in the back and then several more times in his chest \nat close range. As Officer Faulkner lay dying in the street, Abu-Jamal \nstood over him and shot him in the face. At the hospital a short while \nlater, Abu-Jamal actually boasted he had shot a police officer and said \nhe hoped the officer would die. Ballistics evidence proved Officer \nFaulkner had been shot with a .38-caliber revolver registered to Abu-\nJamal and found at the scene, along with spent shell casings.\n  No serious observer of this case can question the overwhelming \nevidence of his guilt. Based on the evidence, he was tried. A jury--\nincluding white and African-American jurors--convicted him and \nsentenced him to death.\n  Nonetheless, over the course of the next 25 years, opponents of \ncapital punishment and other critics of our justice system have \nelevated Mr. Abu-Jamal to celebrity status. Those critics have charged \nthat the conviction was tainted by racial discrimination. They \nslandered police officers and prosecutors and they have leveled \naccusations of police abuse. They have even organized rallies which \nportrayed this murderer as the victim.\n  Amazingly, Mr. Abu-Jamal's campaign has been somewhat successful. He \nhas actually convinced a lot of people he is a political prisoner--if \nyou can imagine that--and his fame isn't confined to the borders of \nthis country. The French went so far as to name a street after him in \nthe suburbs of Paris. In fact, it became such a high-profile issue that \nin 2006 the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan \nresolution 368 to 31 condemning the murder of Officer Faulkner and \nurging the French town to change the name of its street.\n  I must say the disgust with Mr. Abu-Jamal's celebrity status isn't \ndefined by partisanship. In fact, five of today's Senate Democrats were \nin the House of Representatives in 2006 when that resolution was \npassed. Four of those five voted in favor of that resolution, rejecting \nthe political celebrity of a murderer.\n  In short, this case is about much more than hyper-technical legal \nchallenges to the imposition of the death penalty. It has become, quite \nplainly, a cause. So it is with that background that I would like to \ndiscuss the nominee's involvement in that matter.\n  In 2009, Mr. Adegbile was Director of Litigation for the NAACP's \nlegal defense fund, and it was in that role that he worked as an \nadvocate on Abu-Jamal's behalf. The nominee and the legal defense fund \nfirst got involved when they volunteered as an amicus and then later as \nlead counsel for Abu-Jamal's post-conviction proceedings.\n  In this first phase, the legal defense fund alleged that Philadelphia \nprosecutors discriminated against African-American jurors in the jury-\nselection process during the trial. After the Third Circuit rejected \nthat argument, the nominee submitted an amicus brief to the U.S. \nSupreme Court urging the Court to take the case and hear the same \narguments. The Court declined to hear that case.\n  After this effort failed, in 2011 the legal defense fund signed on as \nAbu-Jamal's lead counsel for his post-conviction challenges. It was at \nthis point the nominee again challenged the conviction in the Third \nCircuit but this time under a different theory.\n  The nominee argued that the jury instructions were constitutionally \ninfirm. The Third Circuit agreed, and the Supreme Court refused to hear \nfurther argument.\n  Now, keep in mind that Abu-Jamal never ran the risk of lacking \nadequate legal counsel. Highly motivated attorneys, highly motivated \nlaw professors, and legions of activists have represented him for \nyears. They have filed literally hundreds of motions and briefs on his \nbehalf. So this isn't a case of the nominee and the legal defense fund \nintervening to vindicate the rights of an indigent defendant who has \nbeen denied due process, nor is this a case of a lawyer stepping in to \ndefend an unpopular client who couldn't otherwise find a lawyer. Abu-\nJamal has enjoyed the zealous representation of some of the country's \nbest lawyers for almost three decades.\n  In short, this is not John Adams defending the British soldiers after \nthe Boston Massacre. That is not what is happening. The first attempt \nto challenge the conviction was unsuccessful, so the nominee and the \nlegal defense fund redoubled their efforts and mounted a second \nchallenge under a different theory. This was a cause in search of a \nlegal justification.\n  We know this, of course, because the statements and press releases \nthat the legal defense fund made at the time confirmed the \nunderstanding that this was a cause.\n  The nominee's colleagues and co-counsels explained the legal defense \nfund's motivations for getting involved in this case at a rally for \nAbu-Jamal in 2011. A lawyer with the legal defense fund said:\n\n       There is no question in the mind of anyone at the legal \n     defense fund that the justice system has completely and \n     utterly failed Mumia Abu-Jamal, and in our view, that has \n     everything to do with race, and that is why the legal defense \n     fund is in this case.\n\n  In fact, when the legal defense fund signed on as lead counsel in \n2011, their press release declared:\n\n       Abu-Jamal's conviction and death sentence are relics of a \n     time and place that was notorious for police abuse and racial \n     discrimination.\n\n  Again, this is, in fact, a cause. It was a cause premised on the \nnotion that this country's most notorious cop killer, Mumia Abu-Jamal, \nwas a victim rather than a murderer, and the police officers and \nprosecutors and the entire judicial system were to blame, not the \nperson who did the killing.\n  At bottom, this is why the law-enforcement community is so staunchly \nopposed to this nomination. That is why the Fraternal Order of Police \ncalls this nomination a ``thumb in the eye of our Nation's law \nenforcement officers.''\n  That is why Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams wrote this \nin his letter of opposition:\n\n       Despite the overwhelming evidence of guilt, his lawyers \n     have consistently attempted to turn reality on its head, \n     arguing that Abu-Jamal was framed, and that it was he, rather \n     than Officer Faulkner, who was the victim of racism.\n\n  District Attorney Williams went on to say:\n\n       Aside from being patently false, moreover, these claims are \n     personally insulting to me. As an African-American, I know \n     all too well the grievous consequences of racial \n     discrimination and prejudice. I also know that Abu-Jamal was \n     convicted and sentenced because of the evidence, not because \n     of his race.\n\n  Finally, that is why Maureen Faulkner, whose husband was murdered by \nAbu-Jamal, wrote two letters to the Judiciary Committee, and why she \nwrote this:\n\n       Officers who knew Danny and who, like him, put their lives \n     on the line every day, must now witness Adegbile, a man proud \n     to have chosen to aid the murderer of their friend, singled \n     out for honors and high office by the Government of the \n     United States. It is an abomination to now reward Adegbile as \n     if he had done something wonderful.\n\n  So to my colleagues and to the President of this body, for the \nreasons I have outlined here, I cannot support this nomination. I don't \nbelieve he is the right nominee to lead this office at this time. I \nwill oppose this nominee, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Madam President, I would suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The clerk will call the role.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the time spent in quorum \ncalls this morning be divided equally between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S1290]]\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I rise this morning to speak on the \nnomination of Debo P. Adegbile as the candidate to serve as the \nDirector of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department. He \nwould be the assistant attorney general in the Justice Department if he \nwere to be confirmed.\n  It was 3:55 a.m. on December 9, 1981, when 25-year-old Philadelphia \npolice officer Daniel Faulkner was brutally murdered in the line of \nduty.\n  A few weeks ago, Officer Faulkner's widow Maureen Faulkner pleaded \nwith the Senate Judiciary Committee to listen to her story. It is a \nheartbreaking story. It is a story about how 32 years ago a coldblooded \nkiller murdered her husband and how political opportunists then seized \nthe chance to deny her justice and propagate a very pernicious set of \nlies.\n  It is also a story about how President Obama's current nominee to \nhead the Civil Rights Department, this fellow, Debo Adegbile, joined in \nthis gross abuse of our legal system. Unfortunately, our colleagues on \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee--our Democratic colleagues--did not \nallow Maureen Faulkner to testify when the committee was considering \nthis nominee. I think Maureen Faulkner deserves to be heard. I think \nshe has a right to be heard. We have heard a lot of voices and a lot of \narguments in this discussion. I think Maureen Faulkner's voice deserves \nto be heard.\n\n  Since she was not permitted to testify before the committee, I wish \nto read to my colleagues in the Senate the letter she sent to all of \nus, and I will begin now. Maureen Faulkner writes:\n\n       Dear Senators, while I would have preferred to do so \n     personally, I'm writing this letter appealing to your sense \n     of right and wrong, good and evil, as you consider the \n     nomination of Debo Adegbile to be the next head of the Civil \n     Rights Division of the Department of Justice.\n       Thirty-three years ago my husband, Philadelphia Police \n     Officer Daniel Faulkner, was violently murdered by a self-\n     professed ``revolutionary'' named Mumia Abu-Jamal.\n       I was 24 years old.\n       While most of my friends spent their summer at the Jersey \n     Shore, I sat in a hot steamy courtroom and watched in horror \n     and disbelief as the man who murdered my husband tried to \n     turn the courtroom into a political stage where he could spew \n     his hatred and contempt for this country and our judicial \n     system.\n       At the moment my husband's blood stained shirt was \n     displayed by the evidence handler, Mumia Abu-Jamal turned in \n     his chair and smirked at me; demonstrating his contempt for \n     law enforcement.\n       Thankfully, a racially mixed jury that was selected by Abu-\n     Jamal while representing himself, found him guilty.\n       The following day they sentenced him to death for the \n     brutal act he committed.\n       That's when my second nightmare began.\n       For three decades, my family and I endured appeal after \n     appeal, each rooted in lies, distortions, and allegations of \n     civil rights violations.\n       And year after year, judge after judge, the conviction and \n     sentence were unanimously upheld.\n       Then, thirty years after the fact, my family, society and I \n     were denied justice when three Federal District Court judges \n     who have found error in every capital case that has come \n     before them, overturned the death sentence.\n       Today, as my husband lies thirty-three years in the grave, \n     his killer has become a wealthy celebrity.\n       He pens books and social commentaries critical of our \n     country.\n       He regularly uses his nearly unlimited access to the prison \n     telephone to do radio programs, has cable TV in his cell and \n     is permitted to hold his wife, children and grandchildren in \n     his arms when they visit.\n       Old wounds have once again been ripped open and additional \n     insult is brought upon our law enforcement community in this \n     country by President Obama's nomination of Debo Adegbile.\n       While publicly demonstrating that he doesn't even know my \n     husband's name, Mr. Adegbile feigns sympathy and caring for \n     my family and me.\n       In reality, Mr. Adegbile was a willing and enthusiastic \n     accomplice in Mumia Abu-Jamal's bid to cheat us of the \n     justice we had waited so many years for.\n       Mr. Adegbile freely chose to throw the weight of his \n     organization behind Mumia Abu-Jamal, and he has publicly \n     stated that he would get Mumia Abu-Jamal off death row.\n       Mr. Adegbile holds Mumia Abu-Jamal, a remorseless \n     unrepentant cop killer, in high esteem.\n       We know this because attorneys working under Mr. Adegbile \n     stood before public rallies held in support of my husband's \n     killer and openly professed that it was ``an extreme honor'' \n     to represent the man who put a hollow based bullet into my \n     husband's brain as he lay on the ground, wounded, unarmed and \n     defenseless.\n       And while Mr. Adegbile and those who support his nomination \n     will undoubtedly argue that he did not personally make such \n     statements, he did nothing to counter or stop them.\n       In the end, like so many attorneys before him, Mr. \n     Adegbile's allegations of civil rights abuse rang hollow.\n       Mumia Abu-Jamal's death sentence was overturned not because \n     of civil rights abuse as alleged by Mr. Adegbile, but because \n     three judges with a personal dislike for capital punishment \n     conveniently determined that the wording in a standard form \n     given to a jury might have confused them.\n       While Debo Adegbile may be a well-qualified and competent \n     litigator, through his words, his decisions and his actions \n     he has clearly and repeatedly demonstrated that he is not the \n     best person to fill this important position.\n       Certainly there are others with similar qualifications that \n     would be better choices.\n       I would argue that Mr. Adegbile's decision to defend a cop \n     killer should preclude him from holding any public position.\n       Your decision means a lot to me personally.\n       The thought that Mr. Adegbile will be rewarded, in part, \n     for the work he did for my husband's killer is revolting.\n       Throughout my long ordeal I have frequently been labeled a \n     racist by many who support my husband's killer simply because \n     he is black and I white.\n       I have also been asked to throw my name, my voice and my \n     support behind political candidates from both parties.\n       In each case I have declined.\n       I have always believed that my husband's death and my quest \n     for justice transcends politics and race.\n       From my heart, I'm asking you to do the same thing.\n       Set aside any partisan feelings you have and do the right \n     thing today when you vote on Mr. Adegbile's confirmation.\n       Please spare my family and me from further pain.\n       Sincerely,\n       Maureen Faulkner.\n\n  To conclude, as the Justice Department's Web site explains, the Civil \nRights Division ``fulfills a critical mission in upholding the civil \nand constitutional rights of all individuals.'' This requires the head \nof the Civil Rights Division to have an absolute commitment to truth \nand justice.\n  There are many highly qualified Americans who can carry out this \ncritical mission--and it is a critical mission. Mr. Adegbile's record \nand what he actually has done create serious doubt that he is one of \nthem.\n  For these reasons I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture on the \nnomination of Mr. Adegbile to serve as Assistant Attorney General for \nthe Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the nomination of \nDebo Adegbile to serve as Assistant Attorney General for the Civil \nRights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. As a representative \nof the city of Philadelphia, the Philadelphia police, and the family of \nslain officer Daniel Faulkner, I feel compelled to voice my concerns \nabout this nomination for the record.\n  In 2009, while Mr. Adegbile was serving as director of litigation for \nthe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Legal \nDefense and Education Fund, that organization took on the defense of \nMumia Abu-Jamal. Mr. Abu-Jamal had 27 years earlier been convicted of \nthe first-degree murder of Daniel Faulkner, a Philadelphia police \nofficer. The political theatrics surrounding this case have deprived \nOfficer Faulkner's widow Maureen Faulkner and others of the orderly \nprocess of justice they should have received as victims of a heinous \ncrime.\n  I believe strongly that people should have the right to criminal \ndefense no matter what the circumstances. However, I am troubled by the \nlegal defense fund's involvement in Mr. Abu-Jamal's defense at a time \nwhen he was ably represented by other counsel. The facts in the murder \nof Officer Daniel Faulkner while in the line of duty are not in \ndispute. The events and theatrics that surrounded this trial and that \nwere fueled by the defense team here took an incredible toll on the \nFaulkner family, the law enforcement community, and the city of \nPhiladelphia. From as early as the pretrial stage, Mr. Abu-Jamal \ndisrupted the court proceedings by demanding representation by a \nnonattorney, refusing to accept judicial rulings on his motions and \nreportedly threatening the judge with violence. Since his conviction, \nMr. Abu-Jamal and his supporters have engaged in an effort to discredit \nthe judges, the Philadelphia police, Maureen Faulkner, and Officer \nFaulkner in this case.\n\n[[Page S1291]]\n\nFor many of my constituents, a vote for this nominee would have \nvalidated the activities of the supporters of Mr. Abu Jamal.\n  Mr. Adegbile has had a long and accomplished career as a civil rights \nadvocate, including arguing twice before the Supreme Court in defense \nof the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a landmark piece of civil rights \nlegislation. For years he has been actively working to defend voting \nrights and recently has been engaged in efforts to restore the \nprotections of the Voting Rights Act for millions of Americans \nfollowing the Supreme Court's ruling in Shelby County v. Holder. Mr. \nAdegbile's work on the Voting Rights Act is commendable, and all \nAmericans benefit from his commitment to ensuring equal access to the \nballot. I take very seriously my duty to advise and consent, and I have \nconsidered Mr. Adegbile's history of public service as well as my \nconcerns about his involvement in the Abu-Jamal case.\n  Pennsylvanians and citizens across the country deserve to have full \nconfidence in their public representatives--both elected and appointed. \nThe Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights is one of the top law \nenforcement positions in our Nation, and the full faith and confidence \nof the law enforcement community is an important consideration for a \nnominee for this position. The vicious murder of Officer Faulkner in \nthe line of duty and the events that followed in the 30 years since his \ndeath have left open wounds for Maureen Faulkner and her family as well \nas the city of Philadelphia. After careful consideration and having met \nwith Mr. Adegbile as well as the Fraternal Order of Police, I decided \nto vote against this nomination.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, Debo Adegbile has the keen intellect, \nlife experience, and knowledge sufficient to be an excellent assistant \nattorney general. What an American story we find in his life.\n  The son of Nigerian and Irish immigrants, he worked his way up from \npoverty--including periods of homelessness and reliance on welfare--to \nthe top of the legal profession. He graduated from Connecticut College \nand NYU Law School and spent the early years of his career in one of \nthe most highly regarded law firms in New York. Then he decided to \nstart working at the NAACP legal defense fund, ultimately becoming the \norganization's acting president and directing counsel. For those who \ndon't know the NAACP legal defense fund, I would commend to them a book \ncalled ``Devil in the Grove.'' It is a Pulitzer Prize-winning story of \nthe work of Thurgood Marshall in the 1940s and 1950s when the fund was \nliterally the only voice for those who were poor and Black in America. \nTime and again, Thurgood Marshall would journey to parts of America and \nrisk his life to defend someone accused of a crime. They were the only \nones who would stand and speak for the poor and those who were in \nminority status.\n  Mr. Adegbile joined the NAACP legal defense fund, and during his 20-\nyear career he has gained experience and perspective on a wide range of \nissues, certainly qualifying him for this job with the Civil Rights \nDivision. He has widespread enthusiastic support from a broad spectrum \nof civil rights groups, law enforcement organizations, police officers, \nprosecutors, business leaders, government officials, and prominent \nmembers of both political parties.\n  Mr. Adegbile has twice been called on to defend the constitutionality \nof the Voting Rights Act in oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. In the year 2013, he was the only--only--African-American \nattorney to argue before the Supreme Court. There is no question about \nhis competency.\n  He led the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund's legislative \noutreach and public education efforts on the Voting Rights \nReauthorization Act of 2006 which was passed by a unanimous 98-0 vote \nin the Senate and 390-33 in the House.\n  He has represented minorities in case after case involving employment \ndiscrimination. He led the efforts to repeal the proposition 36 \ninitiative, California's overly punitive three strikes law, and it \npassed with 70 percent of the votes of Californians.\n  In his private practice he has successfully represented pro bono \nclients. His is an extraordinary legal resume.\n  As these select career highlights demonstrate, he is an effective \nadvocate who can lead the Civil Rights Division. Don't take my word for \nit though.\n  The Bush administration Solicitor General Paul Clement stated:\n\n       I've litigated both with and against Debo and have heard \n     him argue in the Supreme Court. I have always found him to be \n     a formidable advocate of the highest intellect, skills and \n     integrity.\n\n  Mr. Adegbile's representation of Mumia-Abu-Jamal does not mean he \nlacks respect for the rule of law, and it certainly should not \ndisqualify him from this important civil rights job.\n  In fact, his willingness to represent an unpopular defendant in an \nemotionally charged case demonstrates his appreciation for the rule of \nlaw, as well as his respect for the criminal justice system.\n  His critics have attempted to characterize him as someone who \nactively sought out this case, someone who disparaged the officer who \nwas cut down in the line of duty, Officer Faulkner, and someone who is \nresponsible for Abu-Jamal's death sentence being overturned.\n  Each of these characterizations is wrong, inaccurate, and unfair.\n  The NAACP legal defense fund was not involved in the Abu-Jamal case \nuntil 2006, nearly 25 years after the trial of this individual and his \nconviction and 5 years after the death sentence was overturned, being \nconverted to life in prison.\n  LDF's president, not Mr. Adegbile, made the decision for the \norganization to be involved in the case. Moreover, as Adegbile stated \nbefore the committee, the briefs he signed ``made no negative comments \n[whatsoever] about the tragic loss of Officer Faulkner.''\n  I see the chairman of the committee is in the Chamber, and I know my \ntime is short. Let me just say this. Time and again in the history of \nthe United States people have stood, understanding the Constitution and \nthe responsibility of the bar, to represent unpopular defendants.\n  John Adams set the standard when he made the unpopular decision to \nrepresent British soldiers on the eve of the Revolutionary War.\n  The Senate recalled that example in 2003 when it confirmed John \nRoberts to the DC Circuit. At the time, not one single Senator raised a \nconcern about then-Judge Roberts providing pro bono representation to a \nman who had been convicted of killing eight people and was awaiting \nexecution on Florida's death row.\n  What John Roberts did--now the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court--\nwas entirely consistent with our Constitution and the responsibility of \nthose of us in the legal profession.\n  I would say at this point we have an extraordinary man, with an \nextraordinary background, who has offered his services to this \ngovernment in an important division where he can serve in a capacity \nthat few can match.\n  The full scope of his life experience and his distinguished record \nmake him well qualified, and I will support his nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I so strongly concur with the statement \nof the senior Senator from Illinois, the deputy majority leader. It is \nsimilar to statements he has made not only here but in private and in \npublic. He has been one of Mr. Adegbile's strongest supporters \nthroughout this matter.\n  Both he and I know this nominee well. We know he is qualified to be \nthe Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division in the \nDepartment of Justice. More than that, we know Debo Patrick Adegbile as \na real person and not as the caricature we have heard from some on the \nother side. I think all of us have a responsibility to vote yes or no \non any issue, and at least to deal with the facts as they are, not with \ndistortions like some of the ones we have heard about this wonderful \nperson.\n  The Civil Rights Division was created in 1957 in the wake of the \nlandmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education,\n\n[[Page S1292]]\n\nand is charged with enforcing Federal laws prohibiting discrimination, \nand upholding the civil and constitutional rights of the most \nvulnerable members of our society. From protecting voting rights to \ncombating human trafficking to protecting against religious or racial \ndiscrimination, we all know that more work needs to be done. The Civil \nRights Division plays a pivotal role in protecting the civil rights of \nall Americans.\n  Debo is a man of the highest character and the utmost integrity. He \nis the kind of proven leader we need at the Civil Rights Division. He \nis a superb lawyer, to begin with. He has a compelling personal story \nof triumph over adversity.\n  He is the son of immigrants from Ireland and Nigeria. He was born in \nthe Bronx. He grew up in poverty, amidst periods of homelessness, but \nhe overcame all these obstacles to attend Connecticut College and the \nNew York University School of Law. He then litigated for 7 years at one \nof the Nation's top law firms--picked because he was the best of the \nbest of the best.\n  He then served as legal director of the NAACP Legal Defense and \nEducational Fund, the LDF. This is a civil rights organization founded \nnearly 70 years ago by the great Thurgood Marshall, who recognized the \nneed for people to stand up for the constitutional right of all \nAmericans to fair, honest, and competent legal representation. During \nhis time at LDF, Debo argued two landmark cases on voting rights before \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. The nominee is widely regarded as an expert on \ncivil rights law. He has received an outpouring of support from the \ncivil rights community.\n  Think of some of the people who support him. Congressman John Lewis \nhas expressed his ``unwavering support'' for Debo's nomination, stating \nthat his ``intelligence, legal acumen, experience, and commitment to \nhis craft, reflect deeply on his ability to offer the Civil Rights \nDivision outstanding leadership into the future.''\n  The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and 83 other \ncivil rights organizations called Debo ``a tireless advocate, a skilled \nlitigator, and a well-respected member of the legal community who is \nextraordinarily qualified for and suited to this position.''\n  And the Congressional Black Caucus stated that he is ``one of the \npreeminent civil rights litigators of his generation,'' and ``offers \nprecisely the type of experience, professionalism, and leadership \nskills necessary to run the Division.''\n  Support for Debo's nomination extends from the civil rights community \nto supporters business and law enforcement. Kenneth Chenault, chairman \nand chief executive officer of American Express, wrote that he has been \n``continually impressed by his skills and professionalism--along with \nhis steadfast commitment to upholding civil rights.''\n  The National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives gave \nits ``unwavering support'' to his nomination. We have letters of \nsupport from Detective Terrance Daniels, a retired member of the New \nYork City Police Department; the New York State Attorney General; and \nseveral district attorneys and Federal prosecutors.\n  Paul Clement, the Solicitor General under President George W. Bush, \nsaid: ``I have litigated both with and against Debo and have heard him \nargue in the Supreme Court. I have always found him to be a formidable \nadvocate of the highest intellect, skills and integrity.''\n  We have a huge list of his supporters, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat the whole list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nLetters of Support for the Nomination of Debo Adegbile to Be Assistant \n                Attorney General, Civil Rights Division\n\n                         (As of March 5, 2014)\n\n\n                  Current and Former Public Officials\n\n       Drew S.

I have been privileged to work in civil practice, where I \ndefended people, and also to have spent 8 years as a prosecutor. I \nstand behind nobody in my support of law enforcement. I was picked as \none of the three outstanding prosecutors in this country when I was a \nprosecutor. But I believed throughout all that time that everybody who \nwas prosecuted deserved the best of representation.\n  Despite Debo's expertise, some are opposing his nomination based on a \nsingle case: Mumia Abu-Jamal's appeal of his death sentence for the \n1981 murder of Officer Daniel Faulkner. I condemn that murder. I \ncondemn the murderer for it. But, just as the British in the Boston \nMassacre deserved representation, and got it from John Adams; just as \nthe man who murdered a number of people, including a couple of \nteenagers, deserved representation from John Roberts, a Republican who \nis now Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court; so, too, did Mumia Abu-\nJamal deserve legal representation.\n  The murder of Officer Faulkner was a horrific tragedy, and my heart \ngoes out to Mrs. Faulkner and all family members who have lost a loved \none in the line of duty. Officer Faulkner served bravely to protect our \ncommunity and to defend our system of justice and our Constitution. We \nare trying to defend it too.\n  It is officers like Officer Faulkner that drive many of us to support \nprograms like the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant program. I might \npoint out to some of my friends who stand here in righteous indignation \nagainst this nomination, saying they are standing up for law \nenforcement, that former Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell and I began a \nbulletproof vest program that has bought bulletproof vests for officers \nall over this country. It is up for reauthorization. It has saved the \nlives of police officers. Not a single Republican has joined me in the \neffort to reauthorize what was a bipartisan piece of legislation that \nactually saves the lives of police officers. But, they will come down \nhere and wax eloquently and misleadingly against this good nominee.\n  If you listen to them or you listen to FOX News, you might think the \nnominee himself is a criminal. Of course he is not. These attacks \nlaunched against this nominee demonstrate a fundamental \nmisunderstanding of the role of a lawyer and the very constitutional \nsystem of justice that law enforcement officers all swear an oath to \nprotect. It is time to clear the record.\n  First, the assertion that Debo made the decision for LDF to take on \nAbu-Jamal's case is simply not accurate. That decision was made by the \nprevious president of LDF. The nominee we are considering today has \ntestified under oath that it was not his decision. But once the \ndecision was made, and he was appointed to do it, he had a duty, as an \nofficer of the court, to do his best to represent his client, no matter \nhow distasteful or unpopular.\n  Debo's role in the Abu-Jamal case was limited to two Supreme Court \nbriefs and one Third Circuit brief. Attempts to attribute more to Debo, \nincluding the out-of-court statements by other LDF attorneys, are \nunfounded. These remind me of the attacks that were made against \nThurgood Marshall when he was nominated to the Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals. At the time, Republican Senator Keating provided an articulate \nresponse of why such attacks are unreasonable and unfair:\n\n       If counsel is suggesting something that Judge Marshall must \n     have the responsibility for every little action that is taken \n     by any lawyer who has been appearing in an NAACP case, he is \n     imposing a standard of responsibility which certainly goes \n     beyond any point of reasonableness. Judge Marshall's conduct \n     and his ethical standards have not been questioned in these \n     hearings. It is ridiculous to suggest that he may be \n     disqualified for judicial service because some other lawyers \n     who appeared in an NAACP case may or may not have done things \n     which counsel considers questionable and where there is \n     absolutely no showing that Judge Marshall has anything to do \n     with the conduct at issue.\n\n  Second, and perhaps more importantly, even if it had been Debo's \ndecision to represent Mr. Abu-Jamal, that should not disqualify him \nfrom public service. Our legal system is an adversary system, \npredicated upon advocacy for both sides. Without this, our justice \nsystem would be a sham. We do not criticize John Adams; we do not \ncriticize John Roberts. Now-Chief Justice Roberts said at his \nconfirmation hearing in 2005:\n\n       [I]t's a tradition of the American Bar that goes back \n     before the founding of the country that lawyers are not \n     identified with the positions of their clients. The most \n     famous example probably was John Adams, who represented the \n     British soldiers charged in the Boston Massacre. He did that \n     for a reason, because he wanted to show that the Revolution \n     in which he was involved was not about overturning the rule \n     of law, it was about vindicating the rule of law . . . [T]hat \n     you don't identify the lawyer with the particular views of \n     the client, or the views that the lawyer advances on behalf \n     of the client, is critical to the fair administration of \n     justice.\n\n  It is for this reason that as a nominee before the Senate John \nRoberts was not criticized for choosing to provide pro bono assistance \nto John Errol Ferguson, a prisoner in Florida who had been sentenced to \ndeath for killing eight people, including two teenagers, in the late \n1970s.\n  I agree with what John Adams did. I agree with what John Roberts did. \nI agree with what Debo did, too. Whether it is John Adams or John \nRoberts, the principle that all sides deserve an effective counsel is \nat the bedrock of our constitutional system. We cannot equate the \nlawyer with the conduct of those we represent if we want our justice \nsystem to endure. After Debo's confirmation hearing in early January, \nthe ranking member of the Judiciary Committee himself expressed the \nsame sentiment when he said: ``You always have to take into \nconsideration that everybody under our constitution is entitled to a \ndefense.''\n  Some have argued that the Abu-Jamal case is somehow different because \nit became a ``political cause'' and was no longer just a case about \ndefending an unpopular client. But regardless of who the defendant \nmight be, the constitutional right to a fair trial has nothing to do \nwith politics and cannot be dismissed as merely a ``political cause.'' \nIn 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to accept the district \nattorney's appeal of the lower court decisions, thereby affirming the \ndecisions to vacate the death sentence. However unpopular LDF's \ndecision to represent Abu-Jamal might be, these decisions by \nindependent Federal judges affirm that this case was about defending \nthe rights guaranteed by our Constitution and not merely some political \nstunt.\n  Finally, while criticism of a nominee's qualifications is certainly \npart of the appointment process, some attacks are--by any measure--out \nof bounds. Last month, while Debo's nomination was still in the \nJudiciary Committee, the Washington Times published an editorial \ncaricature of Debo that was racially-tinged, offensive, and beyond the \npale. I have spoken out against the insulting attempts to defame the \nnominees of Democratic and Republican Presidents, and I do so again \ntoday. I would also hope that those who are opposing Debo's nomination \nwould similarly distance themselves from them.\n  Debo Adegbile is one of the Nation's leading civil rights lawyers. \nThose of us who have worked with him cannot recognize the caricature \nthat some are trying to paint. I have seen him testify before a crowded \nSenate hearing room. I have heard him quietly give counsel in a private \nmeeting room. I know him to be a thoughtful, respectful, and competent \nperson, a good family man, a good husband and father.\n  I regret these attacks. I have been here 40 years. I do not know if I \nhave ever heard a time in those 40 years when a person was so \nmisrepresented in the attacks against him. I hope now some of those who \nattack him, saying they are standing up for law enforcement, would do \nthings like join on the bulletproof vest bill and others they refuse \nto.\n\n[[Page S1294]]\n\n  I see the majority leader. I ask unanimous consent that the majority \nleader have whatever time he needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Debo Adegbile is the President's nominee \nto lead the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. He is a \nman who renews my faith in the American dream. He is the son of Irish \nand Nigerian immigrants.\n  To say he grew up in poverty is an understatement. There were times \nwhen he and his mom--he was raised mostly by a single mom--were \nhomeless. Despite these challenges, he worked his way through the \neducational system and to the top of the legal profession.\n  He graduated from prestigious New York University Law School. He \nargued two of the most important civil rights cases of his generation \nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court. He has received numerous awards for his \nlegal prowess and his commitment to civil rights.\n  He is one of the Nation's foremost civil rights attorneys. He is \neminently qualified to lead the office that enforces Federal laws \nprohibiting every type of discrimination, including discriminatory \nvoting practices.\n  His job--the job of that person who is in the Civil Rights Division--\nis to do everything they can do to make sure people have the \nopportunity to vote. We know what has happened around the country. We \nknow how Republican Governors and other Republican officials have done \neverything they can to stop voting. Early voting they eliminate or they \nshorten the time period. They take away voting places that make it \neasier for people to vote.\n  This is an important position. The person that is best qualified to \ndo that is going to have a vote in just a few minutes. Despite all this \nnominee has achieved, Republicans have not given this man a fair shot \nat confirmation. His time at the NAACP, where he worked for 12 years, \ninvolved many different things. But one of the things he did not do, he \ndid not step foot into a courtroom representing that violent murderer \nin Philadelphia that occurred in 1981 when he was 13 years old.\n  Although the condemned man was undoubtedly a very bad man, as I \nunderstand the facts: 3 o'clock, 3:30 in the morning a cab is stopped; \nthe murderer's brother is in the cab, just by coincidence. So there \nwere a lot of problems in Philadelphia at the time. The murderer gets \nout of the car and shoots a police officer viciously and wantonly, for \nno reason, in the head--terrible murder.\n  He was a bad man who was convicted of a heinous crime and given the \ndeath sentence. When the nominee got into this case, the murder had \ntaken place 25 years earlier. Five years before he got into the case, \nthe death penalty had already been overturned, was already gone. Where \ndid the death penalty overturn come from? That is pretty interesting. \nIt came from a Reagan appointee. Then the circuit court affirmed what \nthe district court had done. They got rid of the death penalty. That \ndistrict court decision was upheld by President Bush's appointees. I am \nsorry. The district court opinion was issued by an appointee of the \nfirst President Bush, H.W. Bush. The Third Circuit opinion that upheld \nit was composed of two Ronald Reagan appointees, including one of the \nmost famous jurists of all time, John Sirica.\n  It is interesting. A person who wrote an op-ed piece in the Wall \nStreet Journal not long ago--who is the district attorney--chose not to \nreseek the death penalty even though he is writing op-ed pieces about \nwhat a bad guy this is, a man who had nothing to do with the case.\n  The defendant in 2001 was resentenced to life in prison without \nparole. The death penalty was gone. How can we engage in guilt by \nassociation? I repeat, the nominee did not step into a courtroom, a \ncourtroom for the murderer. He did not write one word in a brief for \nthe murderer. He worked at the NAACP and oversaw the litigation and \nsigned the brief third down the row. He had nothing to do with the \nappeal as far as arguing it.\n  Even the Philadelphia Inquirer, the hometown newspaper where this \nmurder of the police officer who was so tragically slain took place, \nsaid: ``It would be hard to find a better candidate for the position.'' \nI agree with that.\n\n       To argue that [the nominee], one of the country's foremost \n     legal scholars--especially when it comes to civil rights \n     law--should be disqualified from the Justice post because he \n     participated in [these] appeals is an affront to what it \n     means to live in America. This country allows every convict \n     to exhaustively appeal a verdict, even when all the prior \n     evidence appears to have assured his guilt.\n\n  I have met with this man on several occasions. I spent the morning in \nmy office with him. He is a fine man. What a story of the American \ndream. He has devoted his life to public service. He could be like a \nlot of other lawyers--nothing wrong with that--go out and see how much \nmoney he can make, but he decided not to do that. He believes in public \nservice. He is married, has two beautiful girls.\n  But I am afraid he is treated by the Republicans kind of like \nCongressman Watt, Mel Watt, Jeh Johnson, Todd Jones, Circuit Court \nJudge Wilkins. They have distorted this man's good name in an attempt \nto score points politically and block confirmation of a faithful \ndefender of voting rights, which the Republicans do everything they can \nto not prevent. They want fewer people voting. They do not want people \nto vote. They especially do not want poor people to vote.\n  The NAACP, we know their record. So much has changed in America \nbecause of their legal defense fund. Thurgood Marshall is the most \nfamous of all, but there have been great lawyers who have been part of \nthat program. The organization stands for the constitutional right of \nevery American to a fair trial regardless of the nature of the crime or \nthe content of their character. I think that is what the legal \nprofession is all about. That is what I thought it was about when I \npracticed law.\n  I represented some very bad people. I did it a lot of time for no \npay. The NAACP also advances the cause of civic engagement, economic \nopportunity, education, health care, freedom from discrimination. That \nis for all Americans. They are not out representing just African \nAmericans--all Americans. But there is no question Mr. Adegbile \nactually specializes in voting rights issues.\n  He has worked for years at the NAACP and every other thing he has \ndone to safeguard the right of every American to cast a ballot without \ndiscrimination or intimidation. That is how the legal defense fund got \ninvolved in this case. He did not step into a courtroom. He did not \nwrite one single word of any brief. He did not make the decision to \nrepresent the Philadelphia defendant, who was a very bad guy, nor did \nhe appear in court or write a word in this case.\n  They have attempted to paint him as sympathetic to the convict. The \nman is still in jail. That is where he should be. The truth is \nlawyers--not all of them but lawyers represent unpopular clients at \nsome point in their cause and in their careers. John Roberts, he is not \nknown as a great trial lawyer, but he is known as a great lawyer. Chief \nJustice Roberts provided pro bono assistance, for example, to the \ndefense of a prisoner on Florida's death row who was convicted of \nkilling eight people. That was not brought up during his confirmation \nhearing by us because he had a job to do.\n  As he said, advocacy on behalf of a client is not about overturning \nthe rule of law, but it is vindicating the rule of law. This nominee \nhas strong support from groups all over America. I cannot express \nstrongly enough what a fine man he is. The President of the American \nBar Association wrote the Judiciary Committee. Here is what he said to \nChairman Leahy and other members of the committee. He was ``alarmed to \nlearn . . . [about] opposition to [his] nomination based solely on his \nefforts to protect the fundamental rights of an unpopular client.''\n  That is all it was about this murderer. He was a bad guy, but he is \nentitled to a lawyer. I repeat for the fourth time: The nominee did not \nstep into a courtroom for this guy. He did not write a word of any \nbrief. He has constantly--this nominee stood for the constitutional \nrights as well as Americans' fundamental right to participate in our \ndemocracy. He is exceptionally well qualified for the job for which he \nis nominated.\n\n  Opponents have used his defense of the Constitution as a political \nweapon\n\n[[Page S1295]]\n\nagainst him. He deserves an affirmative vote, to be judged on the body \nof his work and the admirable qualities of his character. I thought \nthat is what we did here. It is a real shame that people are \nquestioning whether he deserves this vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the cloture vote on the \nHernandez nomination, the Senate recess until 2:15 p.m. for the weekly \ncaucus meetings; that at 2:15 p.m. the Senate proceed to legislative \nsession and a period of morning business until 3:30 p.m. with Senators \npermitted to speak up to 10 minutes each; that at 3:30 p.m. the Senate \nresume executive session and the consideration of the Hernandez \nnomination with the time until 4 p.m. equally divided between the \nchairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee; that at 4 p.m. \nall remaining postcloture time be yielded back on the Hernandez \nnomination and the Senate proceed to vote on the confirmation of the \nHernandez nomination; that upon disposition of the Hernandez \nnomination, the Senate proceed to the votes on the remaining motions to \ninvoke cloture which were filed Thursday, February 27, on Executive \nCalendar Nos. 569, 565, 571, and 636; that if cloture is invoked on any \nof the nominees, with the exception of the Gottemoeller nomination, all \npostcloture time be yielded back and the Senate proceed to vote on the \nconfirmation of the nominations; that there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided in the usual form prior to each cloture vote; finally, all \nafter the first vote be 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I would close by saying I sure hope we get enough votes for \nthis good man. If we do not, maybe it is time America had a good \ndiscussion on civil rights. If this man who is defending the right of \nthe Constitution--that is what he has done. Does the Constitution mean \nanything? Should a man who has had nothing to do with the case of a \nviolent murderer be used as a scapegoat for the Republicans to try to \nstop people from voting?

Mr. President, Sunday was a perfect Chicago afternoon--\nnot in terms of weather, which has not been too kind to us lately, but \nin terms of my events and schedule.\n  My first stop was at Navy Pier for the Lithuanian Independence Day \ncelebration, an event which is important to me personally because my \nmother was born there. I happened to be on hand for the latest round of \nindependence in Lithuania when the Soviet Union was finally dispelled \nand this country was allowed to stand on its feet. It was a great \ncelebration with regional food people might expect, dancing and music.\n  I left there to go over to a section of Chicago known as Ukrainian \nVillage. I asked, after church on Sunday, if my friends in the \nUkrainian-American community would come gather and we would invite a \ntelephone call from Kiev from the American Ambassador, Geoffrey Pyatt. \nI expected a nice crowd. I didn't expect an overflowing crowd, but that \nis what I found.\n  The concern of Ukrainian-Americans and many others about the \nsituation in that country is very tense and very personal. Many of them \nhave family members there and strong cultural family ties, and they are \nvery worried. So the Ambassador called in and gave a few moments of \nremarks and then answered questions. Then we met later to talk about \nsome of the possibilities as we consider the future of Ukraine.\n  I looked through the audience and found many of my Polish friends, \nmany of my Lithuanian friends--friends from all of the different ethnic \ngroups which had endured some form of Soviet Union or Russian \naggression in the past. They felt bonded with the people of Ukraine, \nthe Ukrainian-Americans, as we discussed this.\n  I had hoped a few weeks ago that we had turned a corner in Ukraine--\nthat the difficult events of the last few months were coming to an \nend--but that didn't happen. We saw horrific violence in Maidan Square \nand sadly many innocent people were killed. Just as Ukraine seemed to \nbe emerging from this difficult period with the departure of President \nYanukovych, the Russians moved into Crimea. I think that situation has \nmoderated somewhat, although I don't know because it changes by the \nhour, but their decision to have a show of force in Crimea is one we \ncannot ignore.\n  The operation in Crimea was so well orchestrated that it had to have \nbeen planned by Russian President Vladimir Putin during the 22nd Winter \nOlympic Games hosted in Sochi, Russia. Can anyone imagine anything so \ncrass or brazen as to lavishly try to present Russia to the world as a \npeaceful and moderate nation while secretly planning the military \noccupation of another neighboring country? The Russian taxpayers should \nget their $51 billion back they paid to set up the Olympics. It was \nmoney wasted by Vladimir Putin to try to create an impression of Russia \nwhich sadly does not exist.\n  The former Ukraine President, Viktor Yanukovych, freely elected, also \nsquandered a historic opportunity to further modernize Ukraine, to \novercome corruption, and to lift the aspirations of his people. He \nunnecessarily and cynically divided his Nation. Instead of \nstrengthening economic and political ties with Europe, reforming his \neconomy, and respecting Ukraine's historical ties to Russia, he set off \nto become a pawn in Moscow. He saw his survival politically teaming up \nwith Vladimir Putin. As the emerging pictures from Yanukovych's opulent \npalace illustrate, he enriched himself personally and his enablers \nwhile allowing the country's promising yet troubled economy to \ndeteriorate. Ultimately, his government led the bloody assault on his \nown people using heavily armed snipers to massacre the Ukrainian people \non the streets of Kiev.\n  I met with Mr. Yanukovych and many in his government just a year and \na half ago. Yanukovych said he truly saw his country's future with \ngreater ties to the West. But under enormous Russian pressure and \nunable to let go of his own political grudges and terrified of the \ntransparency that an Association Agreement with the European Union \nwould mean for his corrupt regime, he ultimately put his own political \nfuture ahead of the good and the needs of the Ukrainian people.\n  We all know the likely tragic consequences of such self-serving \npolitical calculations. Look at President Assad in Syria and President \nMaduro in Venezuela. The Ukraine will be no different.\n  I understand the Crimea region of Ukraine has a long and complicated \nhistory. I understand that then-Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev \nactually gave Crimea to Ukraine in 1954, probably never imagining the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union and an independent Ukraine to follow.\n  Let's be clear about what happened. Ukraine wasn't joining NATO. \nUkraine wasn't joining the European Union. Ukraine wasn't proposing \ncutting off its economic and political ties with Russia. Ukraine was \nsimply contemplating signing a long-negotiated trade agreement with the \nEuropean Union. For that rationale alone, Vladimir Putin decided to \nmilitarily invade and occupy Ukraine.\n\n  I know Mr. Putin says he was protecting Russian citizens, but there \nhave been no credible examples of threats to any Russian citizens in \nUkraine. In fact, the New York Times reported this week that Russian \ntourists have been sent to eastern Ukraine, where they are stirring up \nanger and resentment against the Ukrainian Government in Kiev. Arguing \nthat Russia can militarily invade another country any time to protect \nthe Russian people is an ominous suggestion that raises alarms for \nindependent sovereign nations all along the Russian borders, and it \nalso raises the chapters of history back in the middle of the 20th \ncentury which we need not recount in detail.\n  One need only look at the two regions of Georgia--South Ossetia and \nAbkhazia--that have been militarily occupied by Russia since 2008. \nRussia continues to illegally occupy these areas and has erected fences \nalong administrative lines and permanent military bases in violation of \nthe cease-fire agreement negotiated with the European Union. I have \nbeen there myself, and I have seen the deeply troubling permanent bases \nand boundary fences in Georgia.\n  The Prime Minister of the Republic of Georgia came to see me the day \nafter the final Olympic ceremonies at Sochi, and he said there was a \nreport that morning after the final ceremony that the Russians were \nstringing barbed wire around the perimeters of the places they were \noccupying in Georgia. Russia even stopped some of the demarcation \nduring the Olympics but started again, as I have said, after the games' \nconclusion. Russian actions in Ukraine and Georgia are a clear \nviolation of international obligations and treaties.\n  For example, Russia was a signatory to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum \nthat\n\n[[Page S1297]]\n\nreaffirmed its commitment to Ukraine to respect the independence and \nsovereignty and existing borders of that nation, to refrain from the \nthreat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political \nindependence of Ukraine, to refrain from economic coercion to \nsubordinate Ukraine to Russia's interests, and to consult in the event \na situation arises that raises a question concerning these commitments.\n  Remember why the Budapest Memorandum was entered into by Russia, the \nUnited States, and the United Kingdom as well as Ukraine. It was \nentered into because the Ukrainians were surrendering their nuclear \nweapons. They had decided to give up their nuclear arsenal as long as \nthey had an assurance they would be protected and their sovereignty \nwould be respected. Russia signed on and then summarily ignored it by \nbasically an act of aggression in Crimea in this last week.\n  In 1997, the Russian Federation and Ukraine signed a friendship \ntreaty. It was during that time that Russian President Boris Yeltsin \nsaid in Kiev, ``We respect and honor the territorial integrity of \nUkraine.'' As a participating state in the Final Act of the Conference \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe in 1975, Russia committed to \nrespect the sovereign equality and individuality of other participating \nStates.\n  It is clear that in many respects Russia has violated the very \nagreements it signed. It has shown an act of aggression in the \nsovereign nation of Ukraine.\n  I will concede the situation is complicated because of the basic \nagreement between Russia and Ukraine when it comes to that critical \npiece of real estate in the Black Sea, but it still does not warrant \nthe efforts that have been made by Putin to destabilize an effort for a \npeaceful government.\n  Mr. Putin has argued that the change in government in Ukraine was \njust the mob in the street. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nThe change in government in Ukraine occurred through its Parliament, \nthrough its Constitution, and with the promise of an open and free \nelection on May 25. It is up to us in the West and all countries that \nbelieve Ukraine deserves our assistance and support to make sure that \nelection is carefully monitored, is totally legal and free, and the \npeople of Ukraine have the last word about their future and their \nleadership.\n  Mr. Putin ought to be part of the observation team--at least his \nrepresentatives--so that there is no argument about a free and fair \nelection in Ukraine.\n  We also need to help this country that is going through some \nextremely difficult economic times. A recent article I read suggested \nUkraine needs our assistance--way beyond the $1 billion Secretary Kerry \nhas talked about in his visit. But in order to achieve that, they are \ngoing to have to make some significant and maybe unpopular reforms in \ntheir economy, in their gas program, and the like. It is tricky. To do \nthat runs the risk of an unpopular backlash against these reformers. \nBut without the reforms there can be no meaningful aid package. We need \nto stand with Ukraine, and Ukraine needs to stand for the reforms \nnecessary to strengthen their economy.\n  This week I am working with Senators Brown, Shaheen, Wicker, Murphy, \nKaine, Collins, and Warner to construct a resolution condemning the \nRussian action in Crimea. There is more to be done. Senator Menendez, \nat our luncheon, spoke today about the need to discuss aid, as well as \nsanctions, that may be necessary. I sincerely hope the sanctions will \nnot be necessary. I hope Vladimir Putin and the Russians understand \nthey cannot show this kind of aggression toward Crimea without a cost, \nbut I hope they will do it soon so we can see the return of stability \nto Ukraine.\n  Ukraine is a critically important country, the second largest country \nin Europe today. It was a major part of the Soviet Union, and its \nindependence, I am sure, has rankled Mr. Putin and his dreams of \nRussian empire. But the people of Ukraine should decide their future, \nnot Vladimir Putin. We need to work with those people in Ukraine to \ngive them that chance of self-governance, to give them a chance to \npursue those values which we share here in the United States.\n  I hope my colleagues on a bipartisan basis will join us in this \neffort condemning this Russian aggression and standing by the people of \nUkraine.\n  I see another colleague in the Chamber.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/05/senate-section/article/S1297-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1297-S1298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           INCREASED EXPORTS\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, a few years ago--actually in 2010--\nPresident Obama announced something he called the National Export \nInitiative. The goal of the initiative was to double American exports \nin 5 years. That is right, double American exports in 5 years--\nsomething certainly I support. It has been more than 4 years now, and \nit is pretty clear we are going to fall way short of the President's \ngoal.\n  During his State of the Union Address this January, the President \npledged once again to open new markets to American goods. The President \nspecifically requested trade promotion authority. The very next day the \nDemocrats' majority leader rejected the request. I come to the floor \ntoday to discuss how President Obama can increase American exports \ndespite the opposition from his own party.\n  The President should focus on energy, and the President should take \nthe steps needed to increase exports of American natural gas, oil, and \ncoal. Energy exports are going to create good jobs here in America and \nreduce our Nation's trade deficit. American natural gas, our oil, and \nour coal exports will also reap important foreign policy benefits, such \nas helping nations in Europe such as Ukraine free themselves from \nRussian manipulation. That is what it is--Russian manipulation.\n  Last month the magazine The Economist published an article with the \nheadline ``The petro-state of America: The energy boom is good for \nAmerica and the world. It would be nice if Barack Obama helped a bit.'' \nThat is from The Economist last month. The article explained that the \nUnited States may already have surpassed Russia as the world's largest \noil and natural gas producer. The Economist went on to discuss the \nbenefits of liquefied natural gas exports from the United States. It \nsaid that natural gas exports ``could generate tanker loads of cash''--\n``tanker loads of cash''--for America.\n  However, The Economist also pointed out that the process for \nobtaining the permits--the permits needed to export that American \nnatural gas--is ``insanely slow.'' This is not an exaggeration. Over \nthe past 3\\1/2\\ years the Department of Energy has used its discretion \nto approve only six applications to export liquefied natural gas. \nMeanwhile, the Department of Energy is sitting on 24 other \napplications. Fourteen of those have been pending for more than 1 year, \nand two of them have been pending for more than 2 years. To put this in \ncontext, the United States has approved only two-thirds of the amount \nof liquefied natural gas exports that Canada has.\n  Last year I introduced a piece of legislation, S. 192, the Expedited \nLNG for American Allies Act. It is a bipartisan bill, with supporters \non both sides of the aisle, cosponsors on both sides of the aisle. This \nwould require the Department of Energy to approve applications to \nexport natural gas to members of NATO, to Japan, and to any other \ncountry where gas exports would promote U.S. national security \ninterests. Think about the country of Ukraine. As Congress considers \nthis legislation, President Obama should direct his Energy Department \nto expedite the existing permitting process. He should set firm \ndeadlines for the Department in acting on pending applications.\n  These exports are going to create jobs all across this country--from \nnatural gas fields in Wyoming, to steel mills in the Midwest, to ports \nalong our coasts.\n  Liquefied natural gas exports will also help reduce our Nation's \ntrade deficit, which stood at nearly $39 billion in December.\n  Finally, natural gas exports will help our allies in Europe. Ukraine \nimports about 60 percent of its natural gas from Russia. So what is \nRussia's position on this? Well, we know that Vladimir Putin--Russia \nhad actually cut off natural gas supplies to Ukraine twice before--in \n2006 and in 2009. Earlier this\n\n[[Page S1298]]\n\nweek the Wall Street Journal reported that Russia's state-owned energy \ngiant, Gazprom, is now threatening to raise gas prices in the Ukraine. \nAmerican natural gas exports could help Ukraine and other European \ncountries reduce their dependence on Russia.\n  President Obama can also increase American exports by lifting the ban \non exporting crude oil. The International Energy Agency estimates that \nthe United States is going to overtake Saudi Arabia as the world's \nlargest producer of crude oil by 2020. This really is a remarkable \ndevelopment, and it has happened because of hydraulic fracturing and \nunconventional oil and gas production. It is estimated that \nunconventional oil and gas production is going to create up to 1.7 \nmillion new jobs in this country by 2020. But in January the \nInternational Energy Agency warned that the ban on crude oil exports--\nthe ban that exists on those exports--could impede American crude oil \nproduction.\n  If the President does not lift the export ban, he is going to put \nAmerican oil production and thousands of jobs at risk. He will also \npass up on an incredible opportunity--an opportunity to reshape the \nglobal oil market. For generations, Americans have been subject to the \nwhims of the global oil market. Americans pay more at the pump when oil \nproduction goes offline, wherever it is located. American crude oil \nexports would boost the world's oil supply and help stabilize prices \nfor American consumers.\n\n  American exports would also undermine the influence of oil-rich \ncountries that do not like us very much. For years the United States \nhas asked Japan and India to reduce their imports of Iranian oil. These \nare two of the world's largest oil importers--Japan and India. In 2012 \nJapan imported more than 4 percent of its oil from Iran. India imported \nabout 8 percent of its oil from Iran. American crude oil exports could \nhelp cut off a vital supply of funding to the Iranian regime. If my \ncolleagues are serious about ensuring that countries abide by U.S. \nsanctions on Iran, they should support American crude oil exports, not \noppose them.\n  Finally, President Obama needs to promote exports of American coal. \nLike natural gas and oil, coal exports are going to create good jobs \nall across the country.\n  Over the last several years the Environmental Protection Agency has \ntaken steps to block American coal exports. The EPA is asking the Army \nCorps of Engineers to radically expand the environmental review process \nfor new export terminals. It wants the Corps to consider the carbon \nemissions that would be produced by exports after they leave the United \nStates. I want to repeat that. The EPA wants to block exports because \nof the carbon emissions the exports would produce when they are used \nafter they leave the United States.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers says the EPA's actions \nwould set ``a very dangerous precedent that could be used to block \nexports of all types.'' That includes exports of American automobiles, \nexports of civilian aircraft, exports of heavy equipment that we \nmanufacture here in the United States.\n  To its credit, the Army Corps of Engineers has said it will not \nexpand the environmental review process for new export terminals. \nPresident Obama should ensure that the Corps will complete its work in \na timely manner and do so without interference from the EPA or any \nother agency.\n  President Obama is fond of saying he has a pen and he has a phone. He \nhas boasted about ignoring the will of Congress. He seems to take \ndelight in finding legal authority where he has none. President Obama \nshould stop using his so-called authority that is authority he does not \nhave, and he should start using authority he does have. He needs to use \nhis authority to promote American exports. President Obama needs to \nlift restrictions on exports of natural gas and on oil and coal so \nAmericans can get back to work and our country can regain its stature \nin the world.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  I also want to speak very briefly about another area where I think \nthe President's administration is really not doing enough.\n  Yesterday the White House finally released the President's budget. \nThis budget included no evidence of leadership and no sign that the \nPresident is ready to make a single responsible decision when it comes \nto Washington's out-of-control debt. The budget increases spending by \n$791 billion over the next 10 years. It is a 63-percent increase over \nwhere we are today--63 percent. It adds another $8.3 trillion of debt \nover the next decade. That is on top of $6.8 trillion in debt the \nPresident has already racked up. The President has never submitted a \nbalanced budget in his life, and this one is no exception.\n  President Obama is now a lameduck President. That becomes more \nobvious every time he puts out a partisan political agenda such as this \none instead of putting out a serious plan for how government should \nspend taxpayers' money. The President's budget does nothing to reform \nWashington's entitlement spending. Is this really the legacy the \nPresident wants to leave for America's young people?\n  The White House has called this plan ``Opportunity for All.'' There \nis no opportunity in this budget. It is just more debt, more taxes, \nmore accounting gimmicks, budget tricks so the President does not have \nto make the tough, responsible decisions one would expect of the \nPresident of the United States.\n  On energy exports and on the budget, the President should be taking \nopportunities to solve some of the real challenges facing our country, \nnot letting them pass him by.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/05/senate-section/article/S1298-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1298-S1300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to offer some remarks on President \nObama's fiscal year 2015 budget proposal, some of which was released \nyesterday. As we all know, the release of the President's budget is an \nannual event here in Washington. It sets in motion a chain of processes \nand events that drive much of what we do right here in Congress.\n  Unfortunately, with President Obama's budgets in particular, this \nannual chain of events, for the most part, becomes an empty, almost \nmeaningless exercise. The first problem with this year's budget is that \nwe received it just yesterday, a full month past the statutory \ndeadline.\n  What budget information we did receive yesterday is certainly \nincomplete. For example, when you look at the appendix of the budget, \nthere is often reference to a section called ``analytical \nperspectives.'' But those perspectives are nowhere to be found. I \nassume the rest of the budget information is forthcoming. Still, we can \nonly wonder why it is being released a few pieces at a time.\n  Of course, the problems with this budget go well beyond the delays \nand the sporadic release of information. Put simply, no one in their \nright mind would say the substance of this budget was worth the wait. \nDespite the fact that they took an extra month to put this budget \ntogether, the most striking thing about it is how little there is in \nthe way of new ideas and proposals.\n  Indeed, when you look for the substance of the budget, you will see \nthe administration appears to be short on new ideas. President Obama's \nnew budget consists largely of proposals from his past budgets, which \nis surprising, given that none of them have received a single \naffirmative vote in Congress. Let me repeat that. None of his past \nbudgets have received a single affirmative vote in Congress.\n  These proposals center on three familiar themes, all of which we have \nseen in past budgets, and in virtually every policy proposal from this \nPresident. First, we see the administration's continued insistence that \nwe can tax and spend our way into prosperity, and that growing the \nFederal Government is the same as growing our economy.\n  Second, there is the effort to further redistribute income and the \nnotion that this will, on its own, somehow lead to economic growth and \njob creation.\n\n[[Page S1299]]\n\n  Finally, we see another attempt to define ``tax reform'' as a process \nof closing whatever the administration deems to be a ``loophole'' in \nthe Tax Code, and using the resulting revenue not to reduce the deficit \nor lower tax rates but to fuel even more Federal spending.\n  Using overly optimistic economic assumptions, the administration \nclaims this budget will reduce our high debt-to-GDP ratio. However, to \nget there, and to help fulfill its tax-and-spend objectives, the budget \nenvisions well over $1 trillion of additional taxes in the face of a \npersistently sluggish economy.\n  That bears repeating. President Obama's latest budget contains more \nthan $1 trillion in proposed tax hikes.\n  No one should mistake the President's intentions. Indeed, this budget \nis the outline of his domestic policy priorities for the future. Once \nagain, chief among those priorities is another massive tax increase \nwhich, if the President had his way, would come on top of all of the \ntax increases we have seen already under this administration. This is \nhardly what our struggling economy needs.\n  Let's talk about the economy for a moment. Someone certainly should, \nso I will. If this economy is any indication, President Obama certainly \nis not interested in that conversation. Currently we have an economy in \nwhich labor force participation has fallen from around 66 percent, \nprior to the financial crisis, to 63 percent with no recovery in sight. \nThis is the lowest labor force participation rate we have seen since \nthe Carter administration, and it is holding back our country's \neconomic growth.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has noted that a decline \nin the growth of the labor force is a principal reason that potential \ngrowth in the economy will decline in the coming decade. No one \nseriously disputes that there is a problem except, of course, when such \ndeclines can be attributed to ObamaCare.\n  We all remember last month when the CBO found that, as a result of \nthe generous subsidies and the not-so-generous taxes in ObamaCare, \nmillions of workers would either reduce their hours or leave the \nworkforce entirely.\n  Virtually every objective observer saw this as a bad thing. Yet in \nresponse to these numbers, the administration and its supporters took \nto the airwaves to applaud the fact that ObamaCare would ``free'' \npeople from their jobs and allow them to, in the words of the White \nHouse Press Secretary, ``pursue their dreams,'' courtesy of their \nfellow taxpayers.\n  While the economists in the administration and liberal pundits might \napplaud the reduced labor supply resulting from ObamaCare, it is, to \nsay the least, difficult for me to find merit in the resulting \nreduction in economic growth. Of course, there is nothing in the \nPresident's budget that would address this issue. If anything, the \npolicies contained in this new round of proposals would make all of \nthis worse.\n  Returning to the latest call for well over $1 trillion of new \nrevenue, the administration claims--as it has for years now--that these \ntax hikes are needed to restore fiscal responsibility and reduce the \ndeficit as part of a ``balanced approach.''\n  However, we need to look at the facts. If we look at the deficit \nreduction that has taken place over the past 5 years, we will see just \nhow unbalanced this approach is.\n  In fiscal year 2009, we achieved a high deficit watermark of $1.4 \ntrillion. That number fell to a still high $680 billion in fiscal year \n2013. Of the $736 billion of deficit reduction over that 5-year span, \n$670 billion came from increased revenue or taxes and only $66 billion \ncame from reduced outlays.\n  In terms of budget realizations, rather than promises for the future, \nless than 9 percent of the deficit reduction between 2009 and 2013 came \nfrom reductions in spending. The vast majority came from increased \nrevenue.\n  Yet the mantra from the administration continues--more revenues and \nhigher taxes, along with ever more spending. One can only wonder where \njob creation falls into the mix, if it does at all.\n  Since President Obama came into office, we have heard a lot of talk \nabout his laser-like focus on job creation. However, the record of this \nadministration suggests that his focus is more on growing government \nthan on growing our economy.\n  We have seen the failed stimulus, ObamaCare, and initiatives such as \nDodd-Frank, all of which have expanded the size and scope of the \nFederal Government without laying any foundation for economic growth.\n  Sadly, the budget offered this week does not present a vision for \nsuch growth in the future. This budget is, instead, a political \ndocument. Its purpose is to galvanize support from the President's \nleft-leaning base in an election year. Nothing more; nothing less.\n  This is disappointing, to say the least, particularly when we look at \nthe challenges our Nation is currently undergoing and facing. One such \nchallenge is our Nation's broken Tax Code. While this budget comes \nclose to acknowledging that the Tax Code is a problem, it misses an \nopportunity to actually do something about it. Tax reform, if it is \ndone correctly, would promote growth and competitiveness in jobs, the \neconomy, and provide greater economic efficiency, simplicity, and \nfairness.\n  However--as I said earlier--in the administration's review, tax \nreform is guided primarily by a desire to obtain more tax revenue to \nfund yet more expansion of the Federal Government, along with an \ninsistence on unilaterally picking winners and losers. The ``tax \nreform'' outlined in the President's budget uses a corporate-only \napproach.\n  In other words, it would amend the business tax system and leave the \nindividual Tax Code largely as it is. That approach is different from \nthe ideas outlined by the two chairmen of the tax-writing committees, \nboth of whom have proposed detailed comprehensive tax reform plans.\n  While I haven't endorsed either Chairman Camp's or Chairman Wyden's \nplan, they both recognize that the noncorporate business sector, which \nmakes up over half of all U.S. businesses, is also in need of tax \nreform.\n  This sets them apart from President Obama and the proposals in his \nlatest budget. Of course, let's not forget hardworking individual \nAmericans, far too many of whom need assistance in filling out their \ntax returns. These people would be left behind under the President's \nproposal.\n  The President's proposal looks to raise tax revenue largely to \nincrease more spending in what it calls ``investments'' in \ninfrastructure. That sounds wonderful.\n  However, what is taken to be infrastructure in the minds of the \nFederal bureaucrats--who the President would empower to spend hard-\nearned taxpayer money--is sure to be guided more by politics than by \neconomic efficiency. The so-called infrastructure bank or \ninfrastructure finance authority--or whatever is the label of the day--\nthat the President has continually called for would surely become the \nnext Fannie and Freddie, putting innocent taxpayers on the hook for any \nlosses resulting from the large Federal contractors rolling the dice on \nbuilding projects.\n  As I said, our Nation and our economy face a number of challenges. \nOngoing sluggishness threatens to become a permanent fixture on our \nlong-term economic path. Indeed, as I referred to earlier, the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has already ratcheted down its \nestimate of the long-run growth path of the economy--partly because of \nthe negative effects of the ever-evolving health care law that \nDemocrats unilaterally enacted and that the President seems intent on \nunilaterally implementing.\n  I don't think that any Member of this body would argue that the \nstatus quo in our economy is acceptable. We have a lot of work to do \nwhen it comes to creating jobs, economic growth, prosperity, and \nopportunity in this country.\n  Unfortunately, the President's recent budget does not, in my view, \nadd to the intelligent discussion. Rather, it returns to already-\nrejected ideas and appears to be aimed at the politics more than the \nneed for proven private-sector jobs.\n  At this critical time in our Nation's history, the American people \nare demanding leadership. Sadly, they aren't getting it with President \nObama's latest budget, and I think that is a catastrophe.\n  We need to change it in Congress. Of course, the Senate seems to be \nslow in\n\n[[Page S1300]]\n\nwanting to make any changes for the better. In fact, we hardly ever \nreally debate legislation anymore--and, by the way, we will probably be \nvoting on eight different votes this evening on various judges, all of \nwhom would have been passed by unanimous consent in December had it not \nbeen for the majority breaking the rules to change the rules.\n  It is pathetic, really. It is pathetic what this body hasn't done, \nand it is time for us to bring it into account.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DELGADO HERNANDEZ TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                      THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume executive session to resume consideration of the Pedro A. \nDelgado Hernandez nomination.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 4 p.m. will be equally \ndivided between the Chair and ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, to use part of my time, we are finally \ngoing to vote to end the filibusters of four judicial nominees to the \nFederal district court in Arkansas, Puerto Rico, Tennessee, and \nCalifornia.\n  None of these nominees is controversial. Timothy Brooks is to fill a \nvacancy in the Western District of Arkansas; Pedro Delgado Hernandez is \nto fill a vacancy in the District of Puerto Rico; Pamela Reeves is to \nfill a vacancy in the Eastern District of Tennessee; and Vince Chhabria \nis to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in the Northern District of \nCalifornia. They were voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee with \nbipartisan support from both the Republicans and Democrats.\n  Incidentally, all of them have the highest rating by the ABA Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary--a ``well-qualified'' rating. It is \nrare to have all four nominees with that high rating.\n  I mentioned this because nominees who would normally have just gone \nthrough in a matter of weeks have been held up, and held up, and held \nup, and held up, for no good reason. Pamela Reeves was originally \nnominated in May of last year--almost 1 year ago. Timothy Brooks and \nPedro Delgado Hernandez were originally nominated last June. Vince \nChhabria was nominated last July. Everybody knows they all could have \nbeen confirmed last year. They all had strong Republican and Democratic \nsupport in the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead Republicans \nblocked their confirmation all year long until they had to be returned \nto the President at the end of the year. These nominees then had to be \nrenominated and reprocessed. People who had already gone through the \nwhole procedure had to go through it all over again.\n  After they had been voted out with strong support by the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senate Republicans again forced us to file cloture to end \nthe filibusters of these nominations. It will have taken the Senate 8, \n9, and 10 months to bring these nominees up for a vote, and that is \nshameful.\n  What this does to the nominees is outrageous. These are people with \ndistinguished careers, and all of a sudden, they have to put it on \nhold. Once they are nominated to be a judge, everything in their life \nis put on hold. Most of them have to take a big cut in pay to take the \njob to begin with, and then they sit there month after month after \nmonth.\n  Everybody has told them there is no controversy to their nomination, \nand that when their nomination does come to a vote, they will be easily \nconfirmed. At some point they have to say: When is this when? It was \nnot last year when it should have been, and we are well into this year \nwhen it comes before the Senate.\n  I have heard some Republican Senators say the filibuster is dead now \nthat the rules have changed. That is simply wrong. The Senate \nRepublicans are just filibustering nominees for the sake of \nfilibustering them under different rules. They refuse to consent to \nvote on dozens of pending noncontroversial judicial nominees, and that \nmeans these nominees sit on the floor for months, and months, and \nmonths before we have to overcome unnecessary procedural hurdles. The \nresult is that precious time and resources better devoted to other \ncritical business is wasted on overcoming the dilatory tactics of \nSenate Republicans.\n  We could be done with this, and debating and voting on things that \nare critically important to this country--everything from rebuilding \nthe decaying bridges and roads of this Nation, to health care for the \nelderly, to health research and all the things we need. Instead we \nspend time on the pettifoggery and, I would say, total balderdash in \nthe arguments from the other side holding up these nominees.\n  These are the same people who shut down the Federal Government last \nyear. This government shutdown cost the taxpayers of this country tens \nof billions of dollars and cost the private industry tens of billions \nof dollars more. They caught so much grief for this disruption that, I \nsuppose, they do not want to have a complete shutdown of the Federal \njudiciary. Instead, they do it by a sort of water torture--drip, by \ndrip, by drip. They are doing the same thing to the Federal judiciary \nthat they did to the Federal Government, trying to close it down. It \nmay be the case that Republicans cannot stop a noncontroversial \njudicial nominee from eventually receiving an up-or-down vote, but they \nhave done a pretty darn good job of delaying five judicial nominees \nfrom filling longstanding vacancies. This kind of needless delay only \nhurts the American people. It is hurting the Federal judiciary. It is \none of the reasons so many people in this country are angry at what \nhappens here, when they see one thing after another delayed and slowed \nup.\n  I hope we can overcome the filibusters on the qualified judicial \nnominees before us, and I hope the Senate Republicans will not continue \nto try to shut down the Federal judiciary. I hope they have learned how \nmuch the American people are angry at them for shutting down the \nFederal Government last year, which cost the taxpayers tens of billions \nof dollars.\n  Timothy Brooks is nominated to fill a judicial vacancy in the Western \nDistrict of Arkansas. He has worked in private practice at Taylor Law \nPartners LLP for approximately 25 years, first as an associate (1989-\n1993) and subsequently as a partner (1993-current). He has extensive \nexperience as a litigator before both State and Federal courts, and in \nboth civil and criminal cases. Mr. Brooks earned his J.D. with honors \nin 1989 from the University of Arkansas School of Law, where he served \nas an editor on the University of Arkansas Law Review. The ABA Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Mr. Brooks well \nqualified to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Western District \nof Arkansas, its highest rating. He received the support of both of his \nhome State senators, Senator Boozman and Senator Pryor. The Judiciary \nCommittee reported him by voice vote to the full Senate on October 31, \n2013, and again by voice vote on January 16, 2014.\n  Pedro Delgado Hernandez has worked in private practice at O'Neill & \nBorges LLC for nearly 15 years, first as an associate (1986-1990) and \nthen as a partner (1990-current). From 1995 to 1996, he served as a \njudge on the Circuit Court of Appeals of Puerto Rico. He previously \nserved as solicitor general for Puerto Rico's Department of Justice by \nappointment from 1993 to 1995. Following law school, he clerked for \nJudge Juan Torruella, of the U.S. District Court for the District of \nPuerto Rico and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, from \n1984 to 1986. He served in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1979 to 1985. He \nearned his B.S. from the University of Puerto Rico in 1979. He earned \nhis J.D., magna cum laude, from the University of Puerto Rico School of \nLaw in 1983. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary \nunanimously rated Mr. Hernandez well qualified to serve on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Puerto\n\n[[Page S1301]]\n\nRico, its highest rating. He received the support of Representative \nPedro Pierluisi of Puerto Rico. The Judiciary Committee reported him by \nvoice vote to the full Senate on October 31, 2013, and again by voice \nvote on January 16, 2014.\n\n  Pamela Reeves has worked in private practice since 2002 at Reeves, \nHerbert & Anderson, P.A., as an attorney and managing attorney. She \npreviously worked as a partner at Watson, Hollow & Reeves, P.L.C. from \n1988 to 2002. She also served as an adjunct professor for trial \npractice at the University of Tennessee Law School (1991-1996). \nFollowing graduation from law school, she worked as an associate at \nGriffin, Burkhalter, Cooper & Reeves from 1979 to 1985. She earned her \nJ.D. from the University of Tennessee College of Law in 1979. She has \nbeen named one of the Best Lawyers in America, and one of the Top 100 \nLawyers in Tennessee, from 2006 to 2012. If confirmed, she would be the \nfirst woman to serve as a Federal judge in the Eastern District of \nTennessee. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary \nunanimously rated Ms. Reeves well qualified to serve on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, its highest \nrating. She received the support of her home State senators, Senator \nAlexander and Senator Corker. The Judiciary Committee reported her by \nvoice vote to the full Senate on November 14, 2013, and again by voice \nvote on January 16, 2014.\n  Vince Chhabria has served as a San Francisco deputy city attorney for \ngovernment litigation since 2005, and has served as the co-chief of \nappellate litigation since 2011. He previously worked in private \npractice as an associate at Covington & Burling LLP from 2002 to 2004, \nand as an associate at Keker & Van Nest LLP in 2001. Upon graduating \nfrom law school, Mr. Chhabria served as a law clerk to three \ndistinguished Federal judges: Judge Charles Breyer of the U.S. District \nCourt for the Northern District of California from 1998 to 1999; Judge \nJames Browning on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals from 1999 to 2000; \nand Associate Justice Stephen G. Breyer of the U.S. Supreme Court from \n2001 to 2002. Mr. Chhabria earned his J.D., Order of the Coif, in 1998 \nfrom Berkeley Law School. If confirmed, he would serve as California's \nfirst Article III judge of South Asian descent. The ABA Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Mr. Chhabria well \nqualified to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District \nof California, its highest rating. He received the support of his home \nState senators, Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer. The Judiciary \nCommittee reported him favorably with bipartisan support to the full \nSenate on November 14, 2013, and again with bipartisan support on \nJanuary 16, 2014.\n  I thank the majority leader for filing cloture petitions to end the \nfilibusters of these much needed trial court judges. And I continue to \nhope that Senate Republicans will change course so that we can work \ntogether to confirm without further delay noncontroversial nominees to \nlongstanding judicial vacancies.\n  At some time reality has to catch up with the rhetoric around this \nplace. I heard speeches earlier today on how people want to stand up \nfor law enforcement. I would remind everybody that one of the things we \nhave actually done in this body and the U.S. House of Representatives \nto help law enforcement was the bulletproof vest program.\n  This is a bipartisan program that was started by the former \nRepublican Senator from Colorado, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, and myself \nto provide bulletproof vests to police departments that could not \nafford them. We have had some of the most gripping testimony before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer may recall one police officer \nfrom a northern State who came to testify before us. He told us how \nmuch he loved being a police officer. He said the only thing he loves \nmore than being a police officer are his parents, his wife, and his \nchildren. He said: ``If it were not for this,'' and he reached under \nthe table and pulled up a bulletproof vest. You could see two bullets \nstuck in it. He said, ``If I had not been wearing this, I never would \nhave seen my parents or my wife or my children,'' all of whom were \nsitting behind him.\n  He said, ``Please keep this program going.'' His family got to visit \nhim in the hospital where he had a couple of cracked ribs. If he had \nnot been wearing his bulletproof vest, he said they would have been \nvisiting him in the morgue instead.\n  I only mentioned this story because every single Democrat has agreed \nto the reauthorization of the bulletproof vest bill. We have not had a \nsingle Republican step forward to say: We will stand up to protect the \nmen and women in uniform of this country who protect us. Having served \n8 years in law enforcement, I find that shameful.\n  I say, stop trying to shut down the Federal judiciary, but also stand \nup for the protection of the men and women in uniform in the police \ndepartments throughout this country.\n  From the time Senator Campbell and I first started working on this \nbill decades ago, this bill has always been a bipartisan bill. Decades \nago, we heard testimony from a police officer talking about seeing his \nparents, wife, and children when he has had to face gunfire in the line \nof duty.\n  Do not let us hear from the same parents, spouses, or children about \nwhy we did not protect their husband or wife, son or daughter, when we \ncould have. Why did we play silly games when not one single Republican \nwould step forward and say: Let's pass this bulletproof vest bill. \nLet's stand up for the men and women in uniform in this country.\n  Mr. President, what is the present parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time \nremaining be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Earlier today a vote was taken in the Senate that, to \nthis Senator, marked about the lowest point that I think this Senate \nhas descended in my 30 years here. I don't say that lightly. I was in \nCongress during the impeachment process trial for President Clinton. I \nthought that was a low, but it didn't compare to what happened today.\n  The vote on Debo Adegbile to be Assistant Attorney General for the \nCivil Rights Division at the Department of Justice sent a strong \nmessage. This is the message we sent today and, young people, listen \nup.\n  If you are a young White person working for a law firm and have a \nchance to defend someone who has done something wrong--even a heinous \ncrime--my advice from what happened today is you should feel free to go \nahead and do your job as a lawyer. Who knows? You might wind up as the \nChief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court one day.\n  However, if you are a young Black person working on civil rights \nissues at the NAACP legal defense fund and you--under your obligations \nas an attorney--are called upon to handle an appeal for someone who \ncommitted a heinous crime, the message sent today is you're putting \nyour career on the line.\n  If you fulfill your duty as a lawyer, you will be denied by the \nSenate from being an assistant attorney general in the U.S. Department \nof Justice. We have a double standard, a terrible double standard.\n  While in private practice, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court \ndefended a mass murderer in Florida who committed eight murders. He is \nthe Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Did we hear one peep from the \nRepublican side? I didn't hear anyone on this Senate floor at that time \nraising it as any issue at all for his qualifications to be a judge on \nthe appeals court or to be the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and \nrightfully so. It should have never been an issue. He was fulfilling \nhis legal obligations and his moral duty as a lawyer.\n  Debo Adegbile, working as an attorney for the NAACP legal defense \nfund, did nothing different. He was only asked to work on an appeal. \nAnd because of that, and only because of that, he was excoriated on the \nSenate floor and denied his opportunity to be an Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for Civil Rights.\n  Did anyone raise an issue of his qualifications? No. He is eminently \nqualified. But person after person spoke about the heinous murder that \ntook place in Philadelphia, the murder of a police officer by a young \nBlack man who had bragged about it--a heinous crime, a horrible crime. \nDebo Adegbile didn't defend him at trial. He only filed appeals aimed \nat protecting the defendant's civil rights and the civil rights of all \nAmericans.\n  I listened to the Senator from Pennsylvania this morning. He had a \nbig poster with a picture of the police officer and his wife on their \nwedding day. He was talking about how horrible a crime this was, how \nthe murderer had bragged about it, and all that is terrible.\n  But it had nothing to do with Debo Adegbile. The Senator from \nPennsylvania said it is why Mr. Adegbile should not be approved to be \nan assistant attorney general, because he worked as a lawyer on a \ndefendant's appeal.\n  What about the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court? He defended a \nperson who killed eight people. I don't see my friends on the \nRepublican side of the aisle clamoring to institute an impeachment \nprocess. Maybe they did not know that John Roberts defended a mass \nmurderer. But now that they do, are they going to try to impeach the \nChief Justice because he fulfilled his legal obligation to defend a \nmurderer?\n  I hope you see the ridiculousness of that argument and how unfair it \nwas for Debo Adegbile to be denied--not on the basis of any \nqualifications but because he was fulfilling his duty as a lawyer. I \nhave not heard one person say he is unqualified or he has done \nsomething that would disqualify him. No. He did what he was supposed to \ndo within his legal profession--and he was denied.\n  Shame. Shame on this Senate. Shame on every Senator who claims to be \na lawyer, who went to law school, raised their hand and was sworn into \nthe bar. Shame on every lawyer who voted against Mr. Adegbile because \nhe worked on an appeal.\n  If somebody had some question about his qualifications or felt that \nMr. Adegbile is totally unqualified, that is a different story. I \nchallenge anyone to come forward with anything remotely connected to \nhis qualifications that would show him to be unqualified.\n  I wish to read--and I will close shortly--a quote from James \nSilkenat, the president of the American Bar Association. Listen up, \nlawyers.\n  He said:\n\n       A fundamental tenet of our justice system and our \n     Constitution is that anyone who faces loss of liberty has a \n     right to legal counsel. Lawyers have an ethical obligation to \n     uphold that principle and provide zealous representation to \n     people who otherwise would stand alone against the power and \n     resources of the government--even to those accused or \n     convicted of terrible crimes.\n\n  Continuing:\n\n       I was alarmed to learn that there is some opposition to Mr. \n     Adegbile's nomination based solely on his efforts to protect \n     the fundamental rights of an unpopular client while working \n     at the legal defense fund. His work, like the work of ABA \n     members who provide thousands of hours of pro bono legal \n     services every year, is consistent with the finest tradition \n     of this country's legal profession and should be commended, \n     not condemned.\n\n  Shameful. It was a shameful vote today, a rush to judgment based upon \nemotion.\n  I will not name any names, but I had one Senator say: My head tells \nme he should be confirmed, but my guts, my emotion, say no.\n  We make our decisions based on that around here? God help us. Maybe \nwe ought to all go back and think about ``To Kill a Mockingbird.'' Read \nthe book, watch the movie, and know what it is to stand against the \npowers of government and defend someone who is unpopular.\n  Mr. Adegbile wasn't even the defense attorney. He only worked on an \nappeal relating directly to legal issues particularly important to the \ncivil rights community.\n  Shame on the Fraternal Order of Police. Shame on them. I have been \none of their strong supporters for my 30 years, but shame on them for \ndoing this. Shame on them. They mounted a campaign against Mr. Adegbile \njust on that one thing. Shame on all of us here, especially the \nlawyers--especially the lawyers. It was a rush to judgment and a \nshameful episode in the history of the Senate.\n  I know Senator Reid filed a motion to reconsider. I hope he will, and \nI hope people will pray on this and think back, especially the lawyers \nwho are in the Senate. Think about it. Think about the ethical \nobligation, the ethical obligation to do what he did--and he did \nnothing wrong. Hopefully Mr. Adegbile, on a motion to reconsider, will \nhave the votes to take his position as Assistant Attorney General for \nCivil Rights in the Justice Department.\n  It is a shameful day for the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n\n[[Page S1306]]\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California for \nallowing me to precede her in speaking on the Senate floor this \nevening. I very much appreciate her courtesy.\n  (The remarks of Senator Collins pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2081 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was very interested in listening to both \nmy colleagues, Tom Harkin, who I thought was very passionate about the \nneed to understand that when people do pro bono work, as Justice \nRoberts did, or they work for an organization, as our nominee did \nmaking the case a jury was perhaps tainted, that that not be used \nagainst them. I think he was passionate. I think Senator Collins makes \na good point. I do wish to say she is totally right. The IRS should \nnever, ever be used politically. We have gone through that in our \nlifetime, and it is absolutely wrong. I agree. But I also wish to point \nout that any organization taking big tax deductions which cost people \nmoney, but they are political--whether they are on the left, the right \nor the center--have to stop what they are doing too. I think she points \nout it is a careful balance.\n  We also don't want Members of Congress to intimidate and harass the \nIRS. That is wrong and a very careful balance. I look forward to \nlooking at her bill to see if this oversight commission is something \nfree from politics. That, to me, is the key. IRS should never be used \npolitically.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/05/senate-section/article/S1306-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1306-S1309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MILITARY JUSTICE IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I rise in strong support of the Military Justice \nImprovement Act. I am so proud to stand with 17 of the 20 women Members \nof this Senate on both sides of the aisle and with a large number of \ncolleagues from both sides--a majority--to fight for real change in the \nway our military addresses the epidemic of military sexual assault.\n  When one is in Washington for a while--and I have been in Washington \nfor a while. Thanks to the good people of California, I was elected to \nthe House in 1982 and took my seat in 1983. I have seen this issue get \nworse and worse. The issue of sexual assault in the military is not \nnew. Unfortunately, it is decades old.\n  It was 23 years ago that dozens of women and men were sexually \nharassed and assaulted in the halls of a Las Vegas hotel during the \nTailhook Association's annual convention. The 1991 Tailhook scandal \nfocused a national spotlight on the issue of military sexual assault, \nand then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney declared after it was over a \nzero tolerance policy.\n  I have to be completely blunt with everybody who may be listening to \nthis. The fact is, after Tailhook and all of these promises from \neverybody, I thought we would never see this epidemic grow as it has. I \nthought we stopped the epidemic of sexual assault in the military \nbecause it was heinous to see what they did when everyone said it would \nbe over.\n  Let's take a look at how many Secretaries of Defense made a pledge. \nWe will start from the bottom and work our way up to the top.\n  Secretary Cheney in 1993 said:\n\n       Well, we've got a major effort underway to try to educate \n     everybody, to let them know that we've got a zero-tolerance \n     policy where sexual harassment's involved.\n\n  So a real commitment from then Defense Secretary Cheney.\n  The next year it was Secretary William Perry. In 1996, he said:\n\n       For all reasons, therefore, we have zero tolerance for \n     sexual harassment.\n\n  Then it was Secretary William Cohen. In 1997, he said:\n\n       I intend to enforce a strict policy of zero tolerance of \n     hazing, of sexual harassment, and of racism.\n\n  Now we move to Donald Rumsfeld in 2004:\n\n       Sexual assault will not be tolerated in the Department of \n     Defense.\n\n  These are beautiful words. But I say to those listening: Nothing has \nstopped this epidemic--Democratic or Republican Secretaries of Defense, \nit doesn't matter.\n  Then Robert Gates, who served both Republican and Democratic \nPresidents, what did he say.\n\n       This is a matter of grave concern. I have zero tolerance \n     for sexual assault.\n\n  Leon Panetta, under President Obama:\n\n       We have absolutely no tolerance for any form of sexual \n     assault.\n       I take sexual assault allegations very seriously. We have \n     no place in the military for sexual assault.\n\n  Currently, Secretary Chuck Hagel, under President Obama:\n\n       It's not good enough to say we have a zero tolerance \n     policy. We do.\n\n  But what does it mean? How does it translate into changing anything? \nI want to know.\n\n       These crimes have no place--no place--in the greatest \n     military on earth.\n\n  We all agree with that. But here is what this shows you: Seven \nSecretaries of Defense, Republicans and Democrats, all these years--the \nfirst one being Dick Cheney in 1992--have all promised zero tolerance, \nand the problem of sexual assault in the military gets worse.\n  So Senator Gillibrand has issued a call to action. She has written a \nterrific bill, working with Republicans and Democrats, and we are \ngetting a vote on the bill tomorrow--assuming we can break a \nfilibuster, because there is a filibuster and we have to file cloture \nand we need a supermajority of 60 in order to get to an up-or-down \nvote.\n  So these promises to me ring hollow. I like so many of these people. \nI have worked with so many of them. They are good people. They care. \nBut these words are hollow. We have to change the way we deal with \nsexual assault in the military, and that is what this vote is about \ntomorrow. But we have to break a filibuster.\n  Here is what has happened to those who have come forward: Instead of \njustice, sexual assault survivors have faced retaliation, \nrevictimization, and further abuse. Instead of justice, survivors have \nbeen kicked out of the military while their attackers go unpunished.\n  I will share some deeply troubling statistics which speak to the \nscope of this problem: 26,000 cases of sexual assault occurred in the \nU.S. military in 2012 and 1.2 percent were prosecuted.\n  Mr. President, I know how deeply you care about this. You were \nresponsible for protecting justice for the people of Connecticut. What \nif you had a range of cases and only 1.2 percent were prosecuted? I am \nsure you would admit that something was very wrong. Of course, your \nrecord speaks for itself.\n  The point I am making is this: How can anyone defend the status quo? \nYet we have a group of people here in the Senate who are defending the \nstatus quo. Yes, they are making changes around the edges. I give them \nthat, and I am very happy with that. But they are not getting to the \nroot cause of the problem, which is who decides whether these cases go \nforward. Who is the decider? That is why the Gillibrand amendment is so \ncritical.\n  So I want people to keep this chart in their minds. These are all the \nassaults. The number prosecuted is 1.2 percent. That means that of the \nestimated 26,000 sexual assaults, only 302 were prosecuted. Keep that \nin mind--26,000 sexual assaults in the military and only 302 were \nprosecuted.\n  Let me give another troubling figure. One in five female \nservicemembers reported experiencing unwanted sexual contact while \nserving in the military. One in five female servicemembers reported \nexperiencing unwanted sexual contact while serving in the military. \nThere is something wrong with the culture there. These women are \nputting their lives on the line, and what do they get for it? One in \nfive is experiencing unwanted sexual contact. And by the way, many of \nthe men are too. But we have this statistic we wanted to share.\n  What is this misconduct that these women--one out of five women--in \nthe military are facing, unwanted sexual contact? This means they are \nexperiencing rape, sexual assault, and unwanted sexual contact while \nserving in the military. But they don't report it because they are too \nscared, and that is why the Gillibrand bill is so critical, and that is \nwhy we need to make sure we defeat that filibuster--because you cannot \nand should not filibuster justice. Let's get an up-or-down vote. How \nmany more women and men will become victims of these heinous crimes\n\n[[Page S1307]]\n\nbefore we take action? For 20 years the military has had to deal with \nthis.\n  I am a fairly patient person. Before I got into politics, I was not a \npatient person. When I got into politics, I realized, yes, change takes \ntime. You have to be patient, you have to work hard, and you have to \nmake the case. You have to pile up your statistics. You have to make \nsure you have the facts and then take action.\n  But 20 years of doing nothing, 20 years of commitment from all of \nthese people--Richard Cheney, William Perry, William Cohen, Donald \nRumsfeld, Secretary Gates, Secretary Panetta, Chuck Hagel; it doesn't \nmatter whether they are Republican or Democratic--all saying the same \nthing; they are going to stop this heinous situation. And they don't \nbecause they cannot.\n  We need to listen to survivors--survivors who are going to solve the \ncrisis of sexual assault in the military because they are going to \nspeak up, and they have. Survivors are telling us that the only way to \nstop this horrible epidemic of sexual assault is to take the decision \nabout whether to prosecute serious crimes such as sexual assault out of \nthe hands of the commanders. Give it to the professional, trained \nmilitary prosecutors outside the chain of command.\n  There are many people who misconstrue this. They think we are going \nto take it completely outside the military structure. That is not what \nwe do. What we do is we say the professionals should deal with this. \nRight now you have to report to your commander. We never would allow a \nCEO of a corporation to make the decision about whether one of his or \nher employees should be prosecuted for rape. If something happened in \nour office and someone came to the Presiding Officer or to me and said: \nSomething horrible has happened upstairs, and we think somebody raped \nsomeone else. We wouldn't decide whether to prosecute. We would go \nright to the police--right to the police. And that is what we are \nsaying when supporting the Gillibrand amendment. We are saying these \nlegal decisions should be made by independent, experienced legal \nexperts so the decision to go to trial is a fair one, objective, and \nbased on the evidence.\n  By the way, that helps all sides--the accuser and the accused. As a \nmatter of fact, we have some people who are worried that the accused \nmay not get a fair trial if we don't change things because there has \nbeen so much publicity about this.\n  There has been a defense advisory committee on women in the services \nthat has advised the Secretary of Defense for over 60 years. That \ncommission overwhelmingly supports this reform, arguing that the \nauthority of commanders to decide whether to prosecute these cases \n``poses an inherent conflict of interest.'' It is obvious. Of course it \nis a conflict of interest. If the commander is faced with a situation--\nremember, we are talking about people who put their lives on the line. \nIf the commander is in a circumstance where he does not want to lose \none of these guys who is, let's say, a very good fighter, he has a \nconflict right there. He may be friends with the guy or the gal, \nwhoever the accused is. We have to take this away from the commander \nand let them focus on what they need to do.\n  We have been told by many commanders that they would welcome this \neven though the top brass is quashing it and fighting hard against \nthem. Why? Why are they fighting against this when for 20 years they \nhave claimed they want to solve the problem? Let's listen to retired \nmilitary officers such as LTG Claudia Kennedy, the first female three-\nstar general in the Army. This is what she said:\n\n       If military leadership hasn't fixed the problem in my \n     lifetime, it is not going to be fixed without a change from \n     the status quo. The imbalance of power and authority in \n     commanders dealing with sexual assaults has to be corrected. \n     There has to be independent oversight over what is happening.\n\n  Then we have a situation where a woman was put up for a position. \nThis is amazing. Dr. Jo Ann Rooney was nominated to be the Under \nSecretary of the Navy. She was asked:\n\n       In your view, what would be the impact of requiring a judge \n     advocate outside the chain of command to determine whether \n     allegations of sexual assaults should be prosecuted?\n\n  Mr. President, do you know what she said? This is what she said would \nhappen if the Gillibrand bill passed:\n\n       I believe the impact would be decisions based on evidence \n     rather than the interest of preserving good order and \n     discipline.\n\n  And she is against the Gillibrand bill because she put good order and \ndiscipline over justice.\n  Then she said:\n\n       I believe this will result in fewer prosecutions and \n     therefore defeat the very problem I understand it seeks to \n     address.\n\n  Many of us have said we are not going to let a vote come up on this. \nWe have been very open about it. She is complaining that if we pass the \nGillibrand bill, the decision will be based on the evidence rather than \non the good old boy system. I don't get it.\n  We need to listen to our allies, such as Israel, Canada, the United \nKingdom, Australia. They have successfully made this change.\n  I want to say very clearly that none of us in this body should \nfilibuster justice. And I have a very strong chart here. I am going to \nkeep this up: ``Don't filibuster justice.'' That is what we are facing. \nWe have people who are going to filibuster the Gillibrand bill and not \nallow a vote on it, while they would vote not to filibuster the \nMcCaskill bill. I say don't filibuster either of these bills. Vote yes \non both. Both are good. But it is only the Gillibrand bill that will \nmake sure the system that is resulting in a disastrous record of \nprosecutions and a disastrous record of people--90 percent of the \npeople don't report. Isn't that true? Ninety percent of the people \ndon't report because they are scared. These are men and women. If you \ndon't report, you cannot have justice.\n  For over a year survivors of military sexual assault have been \nwalking the halls of Congress and calling for these vicious crimes to \nbe decided outside the chain of command. In other words, they support \nS. 1752. They don't want us to filibuster S. 1752. They don't want us \nto filibuster justice. These brave men and women deserve an up-or-down \nvote on the Gillibrand bill. They don't deserve the filibuster. That is \nwrong. They don't deserve two more decades of broken promises. We \nshould be humble in their presence--humble in their presence.\n  You know, I hear people stand and say: Oh, this is terrible. It would \nbe terrible. It would be awful.\n  Wait a minute. Why not ask the people who have been raped? Why not \nask the people who survived that? Why not ask the people who did not \nreport because they are frightened to death of the commander? We need \nto give these brave survivors what they deserve--an up-or-down vote on \nlegislation that will fix our broken military justice system.\n  I want to tell a couple of stories if the numbers are not convincing \nenough. I want to put a face on it. This is the story of Stacey \nThompson, who is a Californian. I stood next to her, and I literally \nheld her hand when she first told the story publicly.\n  Stacey was drugged and brutally raped by a male sergeant in December \n1999 while she was stationed in Okinawa, Japan. She did what she was \nsupposed to do: She reported the rape to her superior. Her allegations \nwere swept under the rug. Her attacker was allowed to leave the Marine \nCorps without ever facing trial. Do you hear what I am saying? He was \nallowed to leave the Marine Corps, where he went home and probably \ncontinued his activities of raping.\n  But what happened to Stacey? She became the target of a drug \ninvestigation, extending from the night of her rape because her \nattacker drugged her--drugged her that night and molested her on the \nground. She was forced out of the Marine Corps with an other-than-\nhonorable discharge. Stacey told me she still struggles with the \nemotional and psychological effects of being raped. She is fighting to \nhave her discharge upgraded so she can access the benefits she earned.\n  So let me just synthesize this story. Here she is. She was raped. She \nwas drugged. She was left on the ground. As a result of the drugging by \nher attacker, they began an investigation and she was drummed out of \nthe military and denied any benefits. She is appealing, and she hopes \nto make progress on that appeal. Her accuser gets out of the military \nscot-free. Right?\n\n[[Page S1308]]\n\n  I want to point out that half of the estimated 26,000 victims of \nmilitary sexual assault are men, so I would like to share the story of \nAmando Javier.\n  Amando was serving in the Marine Corps in 1993 when he was raped and \nassaulted by a group of fellow marines. Ashamed and fearing for his \nlife, he kept his rape a secret for 15 years.\n  When Amando finally found the courage to share his story with a \nfriend, he decided to write it down. I would like to read some of his \nwords at this time.\n\n       My experience left me torn apart physically, mentally, and \n     spiritually. I was dehumanized and treated with ultimate \n     cruelty, by my perpetrators. . . . I was embarrassed and \n     ashamed and didn't know what to do. I was young at that time. \n     And being part of an elite organization that values \n     brotherhood, integrity and faithfulness made it hard to come \n     forward and reveal what happened.\n\n  Now it is two decades later and no one has been held accountable for \nthis heinous crime. The perpetrators are still out there able to commit \nthese crimes again and again.\n  Ninety percent of the assaults are not reported. We think 26,000 is a \nconservative number. Think of how many perpetrators there are in the \nmilitary, and then when they get out of the military they continue to \ncommit these crimes.\n  I also want to share the story of Ariana Clay. Ariana graduated from \nthe U.S. Naval Academy and joined the Marine Corps. She deployed to \nIraq in 2008. Following her return Ariana was selected to serve at the \nMarine Barracks in Washington, DC, which is a very prestigious post \ndown the street.\n  At the Marine Barracks Ariana was subjected to constant sexual \nassault, and when she tried to report it to her chain of command, she \nwas told to ``deal with it.''\n  In August 2010, Ariana was gang raped by a senior Marine officer and \nhis friend at her home. Ariana bravely reported the assault, but a \nMarine Corps investigation determined she had welcomed the harassment \nbecause she wore makeup and exercised in shorts and tank tops.\n  Finally, the Marine Corps did court-martial one of her rapists but \nfailed to convict him of rape. Instead, he was convicted only of \nadultery and indecent language.\n  Ariana's husband is a former Marine Corps officer. He joined her at \nthe recent press conference about the importance of changing how the \nmilitary handles sexual assault. Here is what Ariana's husband said:\n\n       The first step to addressing sexual assault in the military \n     is to remove its prosecution from the chain of command. It is \n     unfair to expect commanders to be able to maintain good order \n     and discipline as long as their justice system incentivizes \n     and empowers them to deny their units' worst disciplinary \n     failures ever happened.\n\n  That was from a former Marine Corps officer who said that the first \nstep is to remove the prosecution of these crimes from the chain of \ncommand. So we now see the whole story, and we are going to go through \nthese charts again.\n  Sadly, Senator Gillibrand's bill--which will finally take the \nprosecution of these assaults outside the chain of command, keep it in \nthe military, and give it to the trained prosecutors--is being \nfilibustered by my colleagues. Don't you think we should have a vote on \njustice without having to set up a 60-vote threshold?\n  I say to my colleagues--none of whom are here now, and I understand \nsince it is very late--don't filibuster justice. If you want to vote \nagainst the Gillibrand approach, vote against it but allow us an up-or-\ndown vote. Don't filibuster justice. That is wrong. Frankly, anyone who \ndoes that ought to lose some sleep over it. I will tell you, if we get \nvery close--somewhere in the high fifties--this change is coming, so \nwhy not make the change now.\n  I will put these charts back up to remind everyone of what I said. \nThese magnificent men and women in the military are innocent. They \njoined the military out of love and devotion to country. They put their \nlives on the line. One in five women is either getting assaulted or \nharassed and many men--50 percent of the 26,000 cases are men. Men have \nan even harder time of stepping to the plate and admitting this \nhappened.\n  The commanders are making these decisions. They are choosing between \ntwo people in their unit. It is akin to a CEO determining whether he or \nshe is going to prosecute a case for a Senator and saying: You know \nwhat. It is a he said, she said, and I will decide who is telling the \ntruth. Wrong. That is not justice in America. That should not be \njustice anywhere on our streets, and it should not be justice in the \nmilitary.\n  Look at that face. This is a woman who was destroyed. I stood next to \nher and had to hold her hand so she could actually get the words out. \nBecause of Senator Gillibrand's bill, she is empowered to speak out. \nBecause of a movie called ``Invisible War,'' which focused on people \ncoming forward and telling the truth, she is empowered.\n  We have to change the way the military handles this or we are just a \nbunch of folks who come out here and sound great. No, it is time to \nchange.\n  There were 26,000 cases of sexual assault in 2012. Of those 26,000 \ncases, 1.2 percent were prosecuted. This is an absolute disgrace on its \nface and anyone who will not make the changes required is accepting \nthis because all they are doing is tinkering around the edges. It \ndoesn't help because that is all we have done for years.\n  The moment of truth is coming in the Senate--and it is coming \ntomorrow around 2 p.m.--and Senators will have to stand here and decide \nif they are going to filibuster the Gillibrand bill and filibuster \njustice. They are going to have to decide that.\n  We have been listening to words and promises and baloney for 20-odd \nyears. I was here all that time, so I know. I was here after Tailhook. \nOh, this will never happen. Dick Cheney said: it will not happen. Then \nwe heard from William Perry, William Cohen, Gates, Panetta, Chuck \nHagel. I think they meant it when they said no more and zero tolerance, \nbut they will not step up and support the change that needs to be made.\n  We made a lot of changes in the military. Many years ago they would \nnot allow Blacks and Whites to fight side by side. Those days, thank \nGod, are over. Gays in the military--oh, my God, that was going to be \nhorrific and hurt morale. Thank God that is over. The military fought \ntooth and nail, day in and day out, and this is just part of the \npattern. They protect the status quo.\n  Put this in your mind: There is no place for a filibuster when it \ncomes to justice. If you don't like the Gillibrand bill, then vote no \non it, but give us a chance to vote up or down. I am going to vote to \nallow a vote on the Gillibrand bill, and I am going to vote to allow a \nvote on McCaskill's bill.\n  I ask that the McCaskill people please join us. Let us have an up-or-\ndown vote. Honestly, I know in my heart that these opportunities to \nmake change don't come along very often, and this is our moment. We \nhave all the facts on our side. We have every victims' rights group and \nevery survivor group on our side. We know status quo is dangerous.\n  I just want to say about my colleague Senator Gillibrand how proud I \nam to stand with her. What an amazing Senator she is. She listens to \nadvice from both sides of the aisle. Her bill reflects comments that \nwere made by myself, Senator Paul, Senator Hirono, as well as other \nSenators on both sides of the aisle. People were so happy to sit and \nwork with her and her staff.\n  Now we are down to the wire. To have people tell me to my face: Oh, \nyes. I am going to filibuster this because I don't like it--if you \ndon't like it, then vote no, but give us a chance to vote up or down.\n  It is interesting because many of the same people who are going to \nfilibuster this tell me they want to do away with the filibuster \naltogether. It is odd. They want to do away with it but not on this \none.\n  We are at the moment of truth, and tomorrow Senator Gillibrand will \nlead us in the hour of time that we have. Senator McCaskill will offer \nher views of negativity on the Gillibrand bill. Senator Gillibrand will \nsupport both bills, as will I.\n  I truly pray tonight that people will think about this and will think \nabout Stacey and the men and women who have come forward in such a \ndifficult situation to open their hearts to talk about things that have \nbeen kept a secret for so long because they honestly think it will help \nbring about change.\n  If we don't allow a vote on that change, then I am afraid this Senate \nwill not look very good when we awaken the next morning.\n\n[[Page S1309]]\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, yield the floor, and note the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich).

Mr. President, we are all painfully aware of the many \nresource rich countries whose leaders care far more about maintaining \ntheir grip on power and enriching themselves than addressing the needs \nof their people. The departed Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych was \na good example, and in this hemisphere Venezuela's late President Hugo \nChavez and his successor President Nicolas Maduro stand out.\n  President Chavez, a former army officer who was swept into power in a \nwave of popular discontent after decades of corrupt, elitist \ngovernments, mastered the art of deception. He was a cult personality \nand virulently anti-United States, who dished out favors to poor \ncommunities as he ruined the country's economy, destroyed any semblance \nof an independent judiciary, changed the constitution so he could hold \nonto power indefinitely, and used the police to intimidate the press.\n  In the year since Chavez' death, President Maduro has tried to fill \nhis shoes. He has adopted Chavez' divisive, anti-U.S. rhetoric, but he \nlacks Chavez' charisma, and the prognosis for positive change in \nVenezuela is increasingly bleak.\n  Early last month a few student demonstrations quickly spiraled into \nthe largest public protests against President Maduro since he came to \npower. Having been elected by a razor-thin margin, the smallest in \nnearly half a century, many Venezuelans hoped the stultifying reality \nof widespread unemployment and economic stagnation would inspire \nreforms. Regrettably, President Maduro did not heed the people's \nmessage.\n  Instead, inflation has skyrocketed in the oil-rich country and food \nshortages have plagued local markets. Additionally, the World Economic \nForum's Global Competitiveness Report for 2013-2014 ranks Venezuela \nnumber three on its list of economies damaged by high crime rates and \nviolence, contributing to the resolve of the thousands of Venezuelans \nwho took to the streets in protest. From San Cristobal, to Maracaibo, \nto the capital city of Caracas, the demonstrations have attracted \nstudents, merchants, and middle-class professionals in a challenge to \ngovernment repression and mismanagement.\n  For several weeks images of the protests trickled out of Venezuela \nthrough various social media platforms, offering a limited, unfiltered \nperspective amidst the state-run media's censorship of impartial \ncoverage. Because of the fog caused by this lack of objective \ninformation, it took nearly 2 weeks for many major U.S. news sources to \narrive in country to begin coverage.\n  The distorted, self-serving portrayal of the protestors as treasonous \nfascists by the Maduro administration and the state-run media has been \ncompounded by the deaths of some 18 people and the arbitrary arrests of \nhundreds, and risks inciting a further crackdown against the \nopposition. Additionally, there have been reports that foreign \njournalists have been detained while trying to cover the protests, with \nup to 20 having been physically assaulted, according to a Colombian \nnews source that has since been banned from Venezuela for covering the \nprotests.\n  The U.S. State Department's recently released Country Reports on \nHuman Rights Practices for 2013 describes the Maduro government's \nefforts to impede freedom of expression. The increasingly heavy-handed \nand violent actions over the last few weeks have exacerbated the \nsituation.\n  As one of Venezuela's most important trading partners, and as a \nnation whose people take note of the well-being and basic rights of \nother peoples in our hemisphere and beyond, the United States has an \ninterest in ensuring that human rights are not violated with impunity. \nI hope President Maduro will not continue to make the mistake of other \nmessianic, autocratic leaders who demonize their opponents. In \nVenezuela they represent roughly half of the population. He would do \nfar better to work with all Venezuelans to reduce tensions and find \nreal solutions to the country's problems. The people of his country \ndeserve nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/05/senate-section/article/S1309-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SHERIFF DOUG GILLESPIE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Lucas Award for Sheriff of the Year is awarded to \nrecognize an outstanding sheriff for contributions made to improve the \noffice of sheriff at the local, State, and national levels, and for \ninvolvement in the community above and beyond the responsibilities \nrequired. By this measure, I can think of no one more deserving than \nSheriff Gillespie. His tireless service as sheriff has made the Las \nVegas metropolitan area a safer and better place to live, work, and \nraise a family.\n  Sheriff Gillespie has diligently served the Las Vegas community for \n33 years as a metropolitan police officer, the last 7 as sheriff. Under \nSheriff Gillespie's leadership, metro has become one of only 72 \nintelligence-gathering fusion centers in the country. It has won the \nWebber Seavey Award, given for quality in law enforcement by the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, for an outreach effort \nto strengthen police relations in the Las Vegas area. Metro is also one \nof only 32 departments to achieve the highest standard of accreditation \nfrom the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies.\n  In addition to his position as sheriff, he has served in many \nleadership roles in other law enforcement organizations, such as board \ndirector of the National Sheriff's Association Executive Committee, \nchair of the Homeland Security Committee for the Major City Chiefs \nAssociation, vice chair of the Nevada High Intensity Drug Trafficking \nArea Task Force, finance committee chair for the Nevada Commission for \nHomeland Security, and president of the Major County Sheriff's \nAssociation.\n  On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I congratulate Sheriff Doug Gillespie \non receiving the Ferris E. Lucas Award for Sheriff of the Year and look \nforward to the continuation of a career that has already made Nevada \nvery proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/05/senate-section/article/S1309-4", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1309-S1310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SIMMONS COLLEGE OF KENTUCKY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of the oldest \neducational institutions in my home State of Kentucky. Recently, the \nSimmons College of Kentucky announced its accreditation from the \nAssociation of Biblical Higher Learning. It is the college's first \nnational accreditation.\n  The story of Simmons College is one of success. After the Civil War \ncame to an end in 1865, there was no place in my home State where \nAfrican Americans could obtain a college degree. That changed in 1879 \nwhen the Kentucky Normal Theological Institute opened its doors on the \ncorner of 8th and Kentucky Street in Louisville. The school's second \npresident, Dr. W.J. Simmons, transformed the nascent school into a \nfull-fledged university that offered a wide array of liberal arts and \ntheological programs. Simmons increased the school's enrollment from 13 \nto over 200 during his 10-year tenure. In 1918, Charles Parrish assumed \nthe role of president of the university and aptly renamed the school \nSimmons University.\n  Simmons flourished into the 1920s, when enrollment peaked at over 500 \nstudents, but this success could not\n\n[[Page S1310]]\n\nshield the school from the devastation that sprang out of the Great \nDepression. The school was forced to sell its property in 1930 and \ndrastically scale back its academic offerings. Simmons was down, but in \nno way, shape, or form was it out. In 1935 its leaders obtained a new \nlocation at 1811 Dumesnil Street. At this location, Simmons continued \nto provide Christian education, and in 1982 the school was renamed \nSimmons Bible College in order to reflect this focused mission.\n  In 2007 the school, now bearing its current name of ``Simmons College \nof Kentucky,'' returned to its old location at the corner of 8th and \nKentucky. The property was purchased in 2005 by the Reverend Dr. Kevin \nW. Cosby--himself the grandson of a Simmons College alumnus. Dr. \nCosby's immense respect for the history and mission of the school led \nhim to launch a campaign to return Simmons to its original location. \nDr. Cosby also took on the role of president of the university and \nworked to once again expand Simmons's educational offerings.\n  Dr. Cosby was helped in this endeavor by University of Louisville \npresident James Ramsey. The two developed a friendship, and in 2010 \nthey signed an agreement that made it easier to transfer credits \nbetween the schools. President Ramsey called the deal ``historic'' as \nwell as a ``testament to Reverend Cosby's persistence in seeking \npartnerships and opportunities for the less fortunate.''\n  Simmons's recent accreditation by the Association for Biblical Higher \nEducation is another enormous step forward for this venerable \ninstitution. The school continues to fulfill its mission of producing \n``productive citizens and agents of change in society.''\n  Accreditation inherently brings increased credibility and prestige to \nthe university, but it also provides more tangible benefits. With this \nformal recognition, Simmons is now eligible to receive government \nsubsidies designated for historical Black colleges and universities. \nThis money, coupled with a $2-million private donation from the Gheens \nFoundation, will undoubtedly lead to even brighter days ahead for \nSimmons College. Cole states that the university has plans to increase \ntheir enrollment from 130 to 350 students, as well as expand the range \nof programs offered.\n  Through thick and thin, Simmons has weathered the storms of history \nto arrive at this moment stronger than ever. President Cosby believes \nthat the school's past trials mustn't be forgotten but, rather, \nharnessed as source of strength to spur on future successes. I extend \nmy gratitude and congratulations to the president of Simmons College, \nthe Reverend Dr. Kevin W. Cosby, for his extraordinary success in \nleading the renaissance of this historic school.\n  Simmons College is a truly remarkable institution, and their recent \naccreditation serves as testament to its perseverance and the good it \ncontinues to accomplish today. I ask that my Senate colleagues join me \nin honoring President Cosby and this admirable school.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/05/senate-section/article/S1310-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1310-S1311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING PFC WILLIAM T. CARNEAL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this April 25, PFC William T. Carneal \nwill be laid to rest in his hometown of Paducah, KY. Private First \nClass Carneal made the ultimate sacrifice in giving his life in service \nof his country. I rise today to honor him and to share the remarkable \nstory that culminates in his forthcoming burial--70 years after he was \nkilled on the island of Saipan during the Second World War.\n  William T. Carneal, known to his family as ``Teetum,'' was the \nyoungest of Plummer and Johnnie Ella Hite Carneal's 10 children. Raised \nin McCracken County, KY, William's childhood was marked by tragedy and \nloss. His mother passed away when he was 18 months old and his father \nwhen he was 7, leaving the responsibility to raise William to his older \nsister, Ruth Anderson, and her husband, L.O.\n  William graduated from Heath High School in 1939 and, like so many \nmembers of the ``greatest generation,'' answered his country's call of \nduty and joined the U.S. Army in 1941. In January of the following year \nhe was sent to Hawaii in preparation for deployment into the Pacific \ntheater.\n  On July 7, 1944, his company in the 105th infantry regiment, 27th \ninfantry division was engaged in hostilities with Japanese forces on \nthe island of Saipan. When the enemy counterattacked, his company was \nforced to withdrawal--but William was never seen again. That day he was \nreported as missing in action, and a year later he was reported dead at \nthe age of 24. Soon the war ended. Yet William's remains were never \nfound--still buried somewhere in the Saipan soil.\n  His remains stayed lost for nearly 70 years--the chances of ever \nfinding them no better than finding a needle in a haystack. In March of \n2013, however, an unlikely source happened upon that needle. Keuntai, a \nJapanese nonprofit dedicated to finding the remains of Japanese \nsoldiers killed during the war, was conducting an excavation on Saipan \nwhen they discovered the remains of five American soldiers--one of whom \nbore a 1939 Heath High School class ring. Carneal's dog tags were \nfound, too, along with some loose change and a pocket-watch.\n  To confirm the identity of the remains, Keuntai passed them along to \nthe Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command for DNA testing. On December 4 of \nlast year, the tests confirmed what Carneal's surviving family members \nalready knew--the class ring and the remains belonged to William T. \nCarneal.\n  William's family--nephews J.T. and Carlton, niece Mary Carneal \nChristian, great-nephew Jimmy Fields, and great nieces Carol Ann Fields \nLindley and Beverly Fields Swift--were given the option of a burial at \nArlington Cemetery. But after 70 years they thought it was time for \nWilliam to come home to Kentucky, where he will be buried next to his \nsister Ruth.\n  The military believes that a grenade blast, possibly part of a \nsuicide attack, killed William and the four other soldiers he was found \nburied with under 3 feet of clay. On April 25 of this year, William's \nbirthday, he will be laid to his final resting place. He will receive \nthe full honors of a military burial, including a 21-gun salute and a \nflag ceremony. Military personnel from Fort Campbell will preside over \nthe funeral, and local World War II veteran Edward ``Earl'' Gidcumb \nwill play taps.\n  As of December 19, 2013, there remain 73,640 U.S. personnel whose \nbodies have not been recovered from the Second World War. Most never \nwill. But in this story, Sandy Hart, curator of the Kentucky Veteran \nand Patriot Museum in Wickliffe, KY, finds solace for the families of \nall the missing. ``When Teetum is brought home,'' she said, ``a part of \nthem are all going to be brought home.''\n  I ask that my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in honoring PFC William \nT. Carneal's service to this country and all those who played a role in \nthe incredible story of returning his remains, at last, to his old \nKentucky home.\n  Mr. President, the Paducah Sun recently published an article \nregarding the incredible discovery and return of William's remains. I \nask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Paducah Sun, Feb. 26, 2014]\n\n             Family Gets World War II Casualty's Belongings\n\n                           (By Laurel Black)\n\n       Most people wouldn't choke up at the sight of a \n     deteriorated poncho, a rust-eaten key or a decades-old pocket \n     knife. But tears rose to the eyes of several members of \n     Private First Class William T. Carneal's family on Tuesday as \n     they perused the items found with the World War II veteran's \n     remains.\n       The belongings, which included Carneal's dog tags, belt \n     buckle and a 1939 class ring from Heath High School, were \n     recovered on the Japanese island of Saipan, where Carneal was \n     killed in July 1944. After nearly seven decades without news \n     of their relative, Carneal's descendants had little reason to \n     believe they'd ever recover his possessions or remains.\n       But Carneal's possessions finally crossed the ocean and \n     arrived in his family's hands. During a brief presentation at \n     Reidland Clothing Company, U.S. Army Sergeant Tyler Holt \n     unpacked a brown cardboard box and returned the objects, one \n     by one.\n       ``We kind of feel like now he's home with us,'' nephew J.T. \n     Carneal said after the presentation.\n       J.T. Carneal added that the family has also found closure \n     because of a recent investigation that revealed the cause of \n     his uncle's death. The military believes that William \n     Carneal, whose body was found with four others under more \n     than three feet of clay, was killed by a grenade blast during \n     a suicide attack by enemy forces, his nephew said.\n\n[[Page S1311]]\n\n       ``It's a blessing to us that the whole family now can know \n     what happened and put it to rest,'' Carneal said. ``He gave \n     his life for his country.''\n       Except for a dog tag that will be given to the Veterans \n     Museum in Wickliffe, the belongings will remain in the hands \n     of Carneal's descendants. Carneal is also survived by nephew \n     Carlton M. Carneal, niece Mary Carneal Christian, great-\n     nephew Jimmy Fields, and great-nieces Carol Ann Fields \n     Lindley and Beverly Fields Swift.\n       The process of finding and returning Carneal's possessions \n     and remains was hardly straightforward. Japanese non-profit \n     Keuntai, which searches for the bodies of Japanese soldiers \n     killed in World War II, discovered Carneal's remains a year \n     ago and turned them over to the Joint POW/MIA Accounting \n     Command. The class ring gave the family hope that their \n     ancestor had at last been found, but DNA testing was required \n     to confirm Carneal's identity. The results arrived in \n     December.\n       After Tuesday's presentation, the family gathered to make \n     plans for Carneal's interment, scheduled for April 25, his \n     birthday. Although Carneal could have been buried at \n     Arlington National Cemetery, the family agreed that he should \n     be laid to rest next to sister Ruth Anderson at Palestine \n     United Methodist Church in West Paducah. Following a brief \n     ceremony at 1 p.m. at Milner & Orr, Carneal will receive full \n     military honors at the cemetery, including a 21-gun salute \n     and flag ceremony. The military personnel of Fort Campbell \n     will preside over the funeral. Local World War II veteran \n     Edward ``Earl'' Gidcumb has offered to play taps.\n       ``So many families exist that don't have any idea where \n     their loved ones are,'' said Gidcumb, who also served in the \n     Pacific theater, ``and it's an honor to be involved in this \n     whole thing.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/05/senate-section/article/S1311-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EL PASO DIOCESE CENTENNIAL\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the centennial \nanniversary of the Roman Catholic Diocese of El Paso, which took place \non March 3, 2014.\n  For nearly 400 years, the Catholic Church has served the needs of \npeople in the El Paso area, beginning with the arrival of Franciscan \nmissionaries in the late 1600s. By the time Pope Pius X founded the \nDiocese of El Paso on March 3, 1914, the Church had established a \nnetwork of parochial schools and private sanatoriums to treat \ntuberculosis patients. The ministries, parishes, and schools were \nfounded with a desire to share Catholic life and give witness to \nChrist. Today, under the leadership of its 6th bishop, Mark J. Seitz, \nthe Diocese includes 64 parishes and missions, 11 schools, and a \nseminary that serve more than 600,000 Catholics.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in celebrating the Diocese's legacy \nof service and faith in El Paso. I ask God's continued blessing on the \nleaders and members of the Diocese as they carry on their good work in \nproviding health care, education, and spiritual care to the people of \nWest Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/05/senate-section/article/S1311-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             2014 OLYMPIANS\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate athletes with \nstrong Idaho ties who competed in the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics and \ncontributed to three of the U.S. Olympic team's 28 total medals. Their \ndedication is inspiring.\n  Idaho-connected Olympians earned two gold medals and one silver medal \nin the Olympic Games in Sochi. Kaitlyn Farrington, who was raised on a \nranch in Bellevue, Idaho, earned a gold medal competing for the first \ntime as an Olympic snowboarder in the halfpipe competition. Hilary \nKnight of Sun Valley competed once again in women's hockey in the 2014 \nWinter Olympics where the team earned a silver medal. Additionally, \nSage Kotsenburg, a Coeur d'Alene native, took home the first-ever gold \nmedal in the new men's slope style event and the first U.S. gold medal \nin the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n  Six other remarkable athletes also represented our state and nation \nwell on the U.S. Olympic team. Nick Cunningham, a graduate of Boise \nState University and Sergeant in the New York National Guard, earned \n12th place in both the two-man bobsled and four-man bobsled \ncompetitions. Erik Fisher, an alpine skier from Middleton, Idaho, went \nto Sochi as part of the U.S. Olympic team. Simi Hamilton, a Sun Valley \nskier, competed in cross country skiing, and he placed 6th in the men's \nteam sprint classic and 11th in the men's 4x10k relay. Nate Holland, \nwho grew up in Sandpoint, Idaho, placed 25th in men's snowboardcross in \nSochi. Jessika Jenson of Rigby competed in the first Olympic snowboard \nslopestyle competition in Sochi where she finished 13th. Sara \nStudebaker from Boise competed in her second Olympics in biathlon \ncompetitions at Sochi where she helped earn a 7th place finish in the \nWomen's 4x6k Relay Biathlon.\n  These athletes, like their fellow Olympic athletes from communities \nacross the country and around the world, inspire us to push beyond the \nlimits of what we may think is possible. They commit themselves to \nsignificant training and turn that preparation into achievements. \nCongratulations to Idaho and American Olympians for their extraordinary \nefforts leading up to and during these Olympics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/05/senate-section/article/S1311-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      COOK INLET HOUSING AUTHORITY\n\n Mr. BEGICH.

In 1943, he \nwas called to active duty and commissioned as a first lieutenant.\n  As a battalion surgeon and combat medic in World War II, Dr. Kerner \nserved with great distinction on the battlefields of Omaha Beach, \nSaint-Lo, and Bastogne. Shortly after landing in Normandy, he delivered \na breech baby at a combat aid station, saving the mother and her child. \nOn another occasion, when a group of U.S. soldiers was nearly \nsurrounded by German SS troops, Dr. Kerner and one of his medics drove \nstraight through the lines to deliver medical supplies and care to the \nwounded.\n  For his valiant service in World War II, Dr. Kerner was awarded the \nCombat Medic Badge, two Bronze Stars, five Battle Stars, and a \nPresidential Unit Citation. In 2007, he was awarded the Legion of Honor \nby French President Nicolas Sarkozy. He later recounted his experiences \nin a stirring memoir, ``A Combat Medic Comes Home.''\n  After the war, Dr. Kerner returned home to California, where he \nserved\n\n[[Page S1312]]\n\nthe women and families of the San Francisco Bay area as an outstanding \nOB/GYN and the medical community as a teacher and administrator. During \nhis residency studies at UC San Francisco, he worked closely with Dr. \nHerbert F. Traut, who had helped to develop the Pap smear. Along with \nTraut, Kerner was instrumental in ensuring that women in the community \nhad access to these critical screenings, which drastically reduced the \ninstances of cervical cancer. To honor Dr. Kerner and his \ngroundbreaking work, UC San Francisco established the John A. Kerner \nDistinguished Professorship in Gynecologic Oncology focusing on cancer \nresearch and patient care for women.\n  Dr. Kerner later became the founding director of the OB/GYN \nDepartment at Mt. Zion Hospital, where he taught the next generation of \nphysicians and served as chief of staff before establishing his own \nprivate practice. My children are among the more than 2,000 babies that \nhe delivered over the course of his career.\n  Dr. John Kerner has enriched the lives of so many, from the wounded \nof World War II who made it home thanks to his exceptional care and \ncourage, to the women whose health he protected and whose babies he \nbrought into the world, to the many doctors who now do the same because \nhe taught them how. I am honored to salute him today in the \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/05/senate-section/article/S1312-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO ANN WAYT\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, when we think of those who provide \ntreatment to our loved ones, we think of registered nurses like Ann \nWayt--a long-time staff member of Affinity Medical Center in Massillon, \nOH. Ms. Wayt has earned both the Affinity Medical Center Nurse \nExcellence Award and the esteemed Cameos of Caring award from the \nUniversity of Akron's College of Nursing. Patients and fellow nurses in \nthe hospital's orthopedic unit, were touched daily by Ms. Wayt's \nprofessionalism and care. Several of Ms. Wayt's coworkers have referred \nto her as a role model.\n  It does not come as a surprise that a nurse who cares so much about \nher patients also cares about her fellow workers and their working \nconditions. Collective bargaining in health care isn't just about a \npaycheck. It is about staffing levels, patient safety, and ensuring \nhealth care quality. For years, joining a union was a ticket to the \nmiddle class and ensured that those who work hard and take \nresponsibility can still get ahead.\n  However, on September 26, 2012, Ann was fired by Community Health \nSystems, the hospital's parent company, shortly after she rallied with \nco-workers to organize a collective voice for better, safer workplace \nconditions and patient care. In fact, Ms. Wayt was fired by the \nhospital the day before the nurses voted to form a collective \nbargaining unit. Though other grounds were given, both the National \nLabor Relations Board, NLRB, and the Federal Court ruled Ms. Wayt was \nfired because she was a lead organizer for her fellow nurses.\n  We have seen too many attacks on workers' rights in recent years. We \nhave seen too many efforts to hamstring the NLRB and its ability to \nprotect the rights of workers, and we have seen too many people fired \nfor engaging in collective activity.\n  Fortunately, the NLRB stepped in and held a hearing last year, and \nthe findings speak for themselves: Community Health Systems was ordered \nto reinstate Ms. Wayt and to recognize the nurses' union. Community \nHealth Systems refused to comply.\n  In January 2014, Federal Judge John Adams ordered Ann's \nreinstatement, the recognition of the nurses' collective bargaining \nunit and for the hospital to stop harassing the nurses because they \nwant a voice at work.\n  Nurses are on the front lines of patient care and deserve to have \ntheir voices heard on important, common sense issues such as:\n  Minimum staffing levels based on patient acuity;\n  the right to refuse unsafe assignments;\n  the right to advocate for patients; and\n  lift equipment safety protections for RNs and patients.\n  A 2013 study by the American Nurses Association shows that when \nworkplaces collaborate and listen to worker input, nurses are able to \nprovide care more effectively, and hospitals gain better overall \npatient outcomes.\n  Welcome back, Ann, and congratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/05/senate-section/article/S1312-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO COREY TAYLOR\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor an \nexceptional Nevadan, Corey Taylor.\n  Corey is a sophomore at Las Vegas' Northwest Career and Technical \nAcademy and the host of her own radio show, which focuses on bullying \nissues in high schools. She is on a mission to end the senselessness \nthat is bullying. Championing a safe environment through activism of \nacceptance, even at a young age, Corey has embraced diversity by \ndefending individual expression.\n  Overcoming her own situation of adversity is just one example of \ncharacter Corey stands upon as a leader in her community. The hard-\nearned money she saves goes to her radio show, where she reaches an \naudience through her words in addition to her actions. She encourages \npeople of all ages to surround themselves with positive influences and \nto embrace their unique qualities.\n  Through her community outreach, Corey encourages her peers to be true \nto themselves despite any type of social pressure. She refuses to let \nher spirits be diminished by bullying, and her work has inspired others \nto do the same.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and congratulating Corey \nfor her service and contributions to Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/05/senate-section/article/S1312-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1312-S1313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               KCAM RADIO\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wish to honor Alaska radio \nstation KCAM on its 50th anniversary on the air.\n  KCAM, is a radio station located in Glennallen, AK and it literally \nhad an earth-shattering start. That is because KCAM signed onto the air \nunder emergency orders late on the day of the Great Alaskan earthquake, \non March 27, 1964. While the station had been planned and in \npreparation for going on air, its broadcast air date was advanced under \nemergency orders by the Federal Communications Commission so it could \nprovide lifesaving information and aid in disaster relief \ncommunications following the largest earthquake ever recorded in North \nAmerica.\n  At 5:36 p.m. Alaska Standard Time on Good Friday, nearly 50 years \nago, an earthquake struck deep beneath Miners Lake in northern Prince \nWilliam Sound, just 90 miles southwest of Glennallen. The quake, which \nthen measured 8.6 on the Richter Scale but which has since been revised \nupwards to 9.2, sent shockwaves up to 700 miles away. The earthquake \nand resulting tsunami killed 131 people, 115 in Alaska and others in \nCalifornia and on the west coast. Amazingly only 12 people were killed \nby collapsing buildings and the quake itself, 119 in the tsunami that \nfollowed.\n  The earthquake, which lasted more than 4 minutes, released 10 million \ntimes more energy than the atomic bomb that devastated Hiroshima, \nJapan, according to a story in The Alaska Almanac. The quake devastated \nSouthcentral Alaska, inundating Valdez and other coastal villages, \ndestroying whole blocks in downtown Anchorage, the State's now largest \ncity, but causing significant damage even north of the Chugach Mountain \nRange, where Glennallen is nestled.\n  KCAM, found at 790 on the AM radio dial, signed on in a part of east \ncentral Alaska, in the Center of the Copper River Valley, that then and \neven now is underserved by broadcast communication outlets. Then as now \nthe station provides vital weather information, travel reports--valued \nby motorists on the Alaska Highway, the only surface route between \nInterior Alaska and the Lower 48 States--plus news, sports and music. \nThe relative isolation of the region is highlighted by the fact that \nCaribou Clatters, the station's on air community bulletin board, is a \nvalued way for area residents to get personal news to friends who live \noff the highway, in remote cabins not served by the array of \ntelecommunication devices that many\n\n[[Page S1313]]\n\nAmericans today take for granted. It is a real ``News from Lake \nWobegon'' feature, far different than radio in urban America today.\n  It was no small feat for KCAM to sign onto the air--having \nelectricity and a broadcast antenna still standing--in the hours just \nafter the great earthquake, broadcasting a signal to warn drivers on \nthe highway heading toward the Anchorage area of the damage ahead and \ndangers they were to face and to give vital information to Interior \nAlaskans to help them survive the late winter when normal supply \ndeliveries were largely impossible.\n  The station today, while operating in less challenging times, serves \nas a ministry of the 40-year-old Alaska Bible College. It is staffed by \nbroadcast professionals ``who love the Lord and are committed to \nbringing excellence in radio'' to the community of about 600 residents \nplus visitors. It also now offers an all-music station, 88.7 FM, which \nis staffed by Alaska Bible College students who are involved as board \noperators, broadcasters, office workers, and reporters--many receiving \ntraining in broadcasting through an introductory course offered each \nfall semester by station manager Scott Yahr.\n  The station, as I know firsthand from my appearances on it, provides \nresidents of the Copper River Valley State political news that allows \nthem to make informed ballot choices and to know how to dress for the \nday ahead through its weather updates. It is a great pleasure to \ncongratulate Scott, program director Michelle Eastty, and special \nprojects director Roger Bovee on the station's 50th anniversary. I know \nthe station will be formally celebrating its golden anniversary during \na celebration banquet to be held on Saturday, April 12, but I wanted in \nadvance to wish everyone connected to the station and all of its \ncommitted listeners a happy anniversary and a wish that the station \ncontinue to broadcast vital weather bulletins, important State and \ncommunity news, and music and entertainment features for many decades \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/05/senate-section/article/S1313-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REGULATORY UTILITY COMMISSIONERS\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nmilestone 125th anniversary of the National Association of Regulatory \nUtility Commissioners, the national association representing our \nNation's State utility economic regulators.\n  The work of our Nation's public utility regulators often goes \nunnoticed and unheralded until the lights go out or our utility rates \nincrease. But, rest assured, the work these officials do on a daily \nbasis impacts every single one of us in the country.\n  State utility regulators ensure the rates we pay for utility services \nare fair, just, and reasonable. They help make sure the utilities \ndeliver these services--electricity, natural gas, water, and \ntelecommunications--in a safe and reliable manner.\n  NARUC offers its members countless opportunities for education, \nsharing of best practices, advocacy, and much more. Since March of \n1889, the Association has provided countless resources aimed at \nimproving regulatory practices. Since just about all of us pay utility \nbills in some way or another, we have all benefited from NARUC's work \nover the last century and a quarter.\n  Think about it: in 1889, the electricity industry was in its infancy. \nAlexander Graham Bell was still perfecting his groundbreaking invention \ncalled the telephone. We were still learning how best to transport \nwater and natural gas.\n  What a difference 125 years makes. We can now electrify our homes \nfrom solar rooftops. We can carry our personal computers in our pockets \non our smartphones. We are using new technologies to find abundant \nresources of natural gas.\n  The one constant has been NARUC and the quality utility regulation it \npromotes. I thank NARUC and congratulate it on this 125th year \nanniversary.\n  Congratulations NARUC!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/05/senate-section/article/S1313-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CENTRAL LOUISIANA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the Central \nLouisiana Chamber of Commerce.\n  The Central Louisiana Chamber of Commerce was originally founded as \nthe Alexandria Chamber of Commerce by 250 men from all walks of life on \nMarch 30, 1914, in the Italian Room of the Hotel Bentley. Their intent \nwas to promote the city and the region in order to attract business and \nfacilitate growth, and they have been continuing this work for 100 \nyears.\n  Over the next few decades, the Alexandria chamber would see many \naccomplishments toward this goal, with railroad companies like Missouri \nPacific and Texas and Pacific opening terminal and repair facilities. \nLikewise, in 1923 RoyOMartin would open a forestry and wood products \nmanufacturing facility. The U.S. military established a presence with \nCamp Beauregard, and the Alexandra VA Hospital opened to train and care \nfor our men during World Wars I and II. Fort Polk was opened in 1941 to \nsupport our engagement in World War II, and the Fort Polk and the Joint \nReadiness Training Center continues to train men and women defending \nthe United States today.\n  In 1956, the Alexandria chamber would merge with its neighboring \nchamber in Pineville, LA, to establish the Greater Alexandria-Pineville \nChamber of Commerce to expand economic development initiatives across \nthe region. During the next 30 years, LSU opened a campus in \nAlexandria; commercial airlines offered flights from Esler Field; and \ncompanies such as Proctor & Gamble and Manning, Maxwell & Moore opened \nmanufacturing plants, all in part due to the efforts of Greater \nAlexandria-Pineville Chamber.\n  In 1986, the chamber would adopt its current name, with a mission and \nvision to advocate for pro-business policies and provide programs that \nfoster an environment for economic growth across the 11 parish region \nthat it now represents, leveraging partnerships with many other \norganizations in the area to promote the region. The central Louisiana \nchamber has also prioritized helping young people in the community. The \nChamber's Young Professionals Group is one such example of efforts to \nengage, retain, and involve Louisiana's future leaders. Also, its Work \nReady Network is a partnership with the Rapides Foundation, the Orchard \nFoundation, and the Central Louisiana Economic Development Alliance to \nlink education, workforce development efforts, and the region's \neconomic needs.\n  Since its founding the Central Louisiana Chamber of Commerce has gone \non to become the largest chamber in the region with more than 1,100 \nmember businesses representing more than 28,000 employees. The chamber \nbeen an economic, social, and political leader for central Louisiana, \nand I am pleased to congratulate them on a century of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/05/senate-section/article/S1313-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1313-S1314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 23.

A bill to conserve fish and aquatic communities in the \nUnited States through partnerships that foster fish habitat \nconservation, improve the quality of life for the people of the United \nStates, enhance fish and wildlife-dependent recreation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a bill I am \nintroducing with the Senior Senator from Idaho, that will help improve \nthe long term health and abundance of United States' fish populations. \nOur bill takes a comprehensive approach to stopping the single greatest \nthreat declining fish populations, by stemming the decline of healthy \naquatic ecosystem habitats that are critical to all fish species.\n  Improving the quality of fish habitat provides benefits beyond \nimproving the health and abundance of fish populations. Healthier \naquatic ecosystems means healthier habitats for waterfowl and other \nwildlife as well as safer recreational waters for Americans to swim, \nboat and fish in.\n  North America is home to nearly 700 native fish species. This \nabundance of fish species is one of many natural treasures we must work \nto protect and maintain. Much like other precious natural resources in \nthis country our wild fish populations face unfortunate anthropogenic \nthreats. Forty percent of our native fish populations are in decline. \nThis is due in large part to the impairment of more than half of our \nnation's waters including the waters of my state's, and the mid-\nAtlantic region's greatest treasure, the Chesapeake Bay. Deliberate and \ntargeted action is needed to stem the loss of our precious fish \nresources by ensuring that these important aquatic habitats are better \npreserved.\n  State, federal and private efforts to address this challenge of \nimproving and protecting critical fish habitat are underway in many \nstates and in local communities. However, too many of these efforts are \nuncoordinated with one another which is leading to fragmented and less \neffective results than if these efforts carried out in a more networked \nand comprehensive fashion.\n  Under the National Fish Habitat Conservation Act, Federal Government \nagencies will work in careful coordination with state and local \ngovernments, as well as stakeholder organizations and industries like \nconservation groups, fisherman, and companies in the outdoor recreation \nindustry to collaboratively execute the scientifically most effective \nfish and aquatic habitat conservation projects possible.\n  Our legislation leverages funds from Federal and State natural \nresource agencies and private funds to build regional partnerships \nfocused on improving critical aquatic habitats across the country. \nTargeting these financial resources, through government and private \npartnership, towards projects in regional watersheds that will make the \ngreatest improvements to the health of aquatic habitats will improve \nthe health and abundance of native fish populations, improve the \nquality of life for surrounding communities, and improve recreational \nopportunities which is a boost to our national and local economies. The \ngoal of this effort is to foster landscape scale starting at the local \nlevel through multi-state aquatic habitat improvement projects. The \ngoal is also to engage stakeholders like commercial fisherman, anglers, \noutfitters and other angling and sportsmen industries to participate in \nthis effort to make lasting improvements to the health and \nsustainability of our fisheries resources.\n  The National Fish Habitat Conservation Act authorizes $7.2 million \nannually for fish habitat restoration and protection projects that are \nsupported by regional Fish Habitat Partnerships the bill also \nestablishes. Based on the successful North American Wetlands \nConservation Act model, the National Fish Habitat Conservation Act \nestablishes a multi-stakeholder National Fish Habitat Board to \nrecommend projects to the Secretary of Interior for funding. Regional \nFish Habitat Partnerships are responsible for implementing habitat \nprotection and restoration projects in the watersheds that will enhance \nfish habitats and fish populations.\n  The National Fish Habitat Conservation Act applies a proven and \neffective model for habitat conservation to protect and restore \ndeclining quality fish habitat. Our legislation ensures collaboration \nbetween expert stakeholders and state and regional fisheries resource \nmanagers to ensure the effectiveness of the work that is done.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2080\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) healthy populations of fish depend on the conservation, \n     protection, restoration, and enhancement of fish habitats in \n     the United States;\n       (2) fish habitats (including wetlands, streams, rivers, \n     lakes, estuaries, and coastal and marine habitats) perform \n     numerous valuable environmental functions that sustain \n     environmental, social, and cultural values, including \n     recycling nutrients, purifying water, attenuating floods, \n     augmenting and maintaining stream flows, recharging ground \n     water, acting as primary producers in the food chain, and \n     providing essential and significant habitat for plants, fish, \n     wildlife, and other dependent species;\n       (3) the extensive and diverse fish habitat resources of the \n     United States are of enormous significance to the economy of \n     the United States, providing--\n       (A) recreation for 60,000,000 anglers;\n       (B) more than 828,000 jobs and approximately \n     $115,000,000,000 in economic impact each year relating to \n     recreational fishing; and\n       (C) approximately 575,000 jobs and an additional \n     $36,000,000,000 in economic impact each year relating to \n     commercial fishing;\n       (4) at least 40 percent of all threatened species and \n     endangered species in the United States are directly \n     dependent on fish habitats;\n       (5) certain fish species are considered to be ecological \n     indicators of fish habitat quality, such that the presence of \n     those species reflects high-quality habitat for fish species;\n       (6) loss and degradation of fish habitat, riparian habitat, \n     water quality, and water volume caused by activities such as \n     alteration of watercourses, stream blockages, water \n     withdrawals and diversions, erosion, pollution, \n     sedimentation, and destruction or modification of wetlands \n     have--\n       (A) caused significant declines in fish populations \n     throughout the United States, especially declines in native \n     fish populations; and\n       (B) resulted in economic losses to the United States;\n       (7)(A) providing for the conservation and sustainability of \n     fish populations has not been fully realized, despite \n     federally funded fish and wildlife restoration programs and \n     other activities intended to conserve fish habitat; and\n       (B) conservation and sustainability may be significantly \n     advanced through a renewed commitment and sustained, \n     cooperative efforts that are complementary to existing fish \n     and wildlife restoration programs and clean water programs;\n       (8) the National Fish Habitat Action Plan provides a \n     framework for maintaining and restoring fish habitats to \n     perpetuate populations of fish species;\n       (9) the United States can achieve significant progress \n     toward providing fish habitats for the conservation and \n     restoration of fish species through a voluntary, \n     nonregulatory incentive program that is based on technical \n     and financial assistance provided by the Federal Government;\n       (10) the creation of partnerships between local citizens, \n     Indian tribes, Alaska Native organizations, corporations, \n     nongovernmental organizations, and Federal, State,\n\n[[Page S1318]]\n\n     and tribal agencies is critical to the success of activities \n     to restore fish habitats;\n       (11) the Federal Government has numerous land and water \n     management agencies that are critical to the implementation \n     of the National Fish Habitat Action Plan, including--\n       (A) the United States Fish and Wildlife Service;\n       (B) the Bureau of Land Management;\n       (C) the National Park Service;\n       (D) the Bureau of Reclamation;\n       (E) the Bureau of Indian Affairs;\n       (F) the National Marine Fisheries Service;\n       (G) the Forest Service;\n       (H) the Natural Resources Conservation Service; and\n       (I) the Environmental Protection Agency;\n       (12) the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the \n     Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the \n     National Marine Fisheries Service each play a vital role in--\n       (A) the protection, restoration, and enhancement of the \n     fish communities and fish habitats in the United States; and\n       (B) the development, operation, and long-term success of \n     fish habitat partnerships and project implementation;\n       (13) the United States Geological Survey, the United States \n     Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Marine Fisheries \n     Service each play a vital role in scientific evaluation, data \n     collection, and mapping for fishery resources in the United \n     States;\n       (14) the State and Territorial fish and wildlife agencies \n     play a vital role in--\n       (A) the protection, restoration, and enhancement of the \n     fish communities and fish habitats in their respective States \n     and territories; and\n       (B) the development, operation, and long-term success of \n     fish habitat partnerships and project implementation; and\n       (15) many of the programs for conservation on private \n     farmland, ranchland, and forestland that are carried out by \n     the Secretary of Agriculture, including the Natural Resources \n     Conservation Service and the State and Private Forestry \n     programs of the Forest Service, are able to significantly \n     contribute to the implementation of the National Fish Habitat \n     Action Plan through the engagement of private landowners.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to encourage \n     partnerships among public agencies and other interested \n     parties consistent with the mission and goals of the National \n     Fish Habitat Action Plan--\n       (1) to promote intact and healthy fish habitats;\n       (2) to improve the quality and quantity of fish habitats \n     and overall health of fish species;\n       (3) to increase the quality and quantity of fish habitats \n     that support a broad natural diversity of fish and other \n     aquatic species;\n       (4) to improve fish habitats in a manner that leads to \n     improvement of the annual economic output from recreational, \n     subsistence, and commercial fishing;\n       (5) to enhance fish and wildlife-dependent recreation;\n       (6) to coordinate and facilitate activities carried out by \n     Federal departments and agencies under the leadership of--\n       (A) the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife \n     Service;\n       (B) the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries of the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and\n       (C) the Director of the United States Geological Survey; \n     and\n       (7) to achieve other purposes in accordance with the \n     mission and goals of the National Fish Habitat Action Plan.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Taxpayer \nProtection Act of 2014. This bill would require the independent IRS \noversight board to better fulfill its obligation to protect the \nconstitutional rights of American taxpayers. The history of the IRS \noffers abundant examples of the agency trampling on these rights. In \nthe most recent controversy, the IRS subjected applications from \nconservative groups that were seeking tax-exempt status to heightened \nscrutiny. Delaying these groups' applications suggests an effort to \nchill the constitutional right of speech and association by groups that \nhold conservative views.\n  The details that have emerged are truly alarming. The IRS has \nadmitted that it deliberately targeted conservative groups' \napplications for tax-exempt status for extra review if they included \nsuch words as ``tea party,'' ``patriots,'' or ``9/11'' in their names \nor they criticized how this country is being run or if their purpose \nwere to address government spending, government debt, taxes, or simply \nto make America a better place. Incredible.\n  These inappropriate criteria stayed in place for more than 18 months \nand resulted in substantial delays in processing the applications of \nmany different groups. In some cases, the applications remained \noutstanding for more than 2 years.\n  The IRS also sought to compel some of the targeted groups to divulge \ntheir membership list. IRS officials have subsequently admitted there \nwas absolutely no reason for agency personnel to have sought that kind \nof information.\n  Such behavior, unfortunately, is not a one-time aberration. A May \n2013 ``Time'' magazine article notes that the IRS has been involved in \nscandals going back at least as far as the Kennedy administration, \nwhich used the service to investigate so-called rightwing groups. \nPresident Nixon employed a secret IRS operation to investigate and \naudit political opponents. During the Johnson administration, the IRS \ntargeted antiwar activists.\n  In the decades since, civil rights groups, political activists from \nboth the conservative and liberals ends of the spectrum, and \nwhistleblowers have been subjected to intimidating and discriminatory \nscrutiny by the IRS.\n  In 1997, the Senate Finance Committee held 3 days of hearings \ninstigated by reports of IRS abuses. One type of abuse was the so-\ncalled Blue Sky Assessment, which then-committee chairman William Roth \ncharacterized as agents making tax assessments that had no basis in \nfact or law, and were, in some instances, simply levied to hurt the \ntaxpayer. Some witnesses had to have their identities concealed out of \nfear of retaliation for their testimony. As witness No. 1--an IRS \nagent--stated, `` . . . abuse of the taxpaying public occurs when the \nIRS improperly and sometimes illegally uses its vast power in the \nprocess of implementing some type of enforcement of the tax laws.''\n  This agent went on to note it wasn't the IRS Code which abused \ntaxpayers but rather how it was being implemented in an unfair, \nintimidating, and discriminatory way.\n  I note these 1997 hearings in particular because they coincided with \nan effort to reform the IRS, culminating in the IRS Restructuring and \nReform Act. The act made a number of changes to the structure of the \nIRS and the manner in which it administers the tax laws. One such \nreform was the creation of the IRS Oversight Board.\n  By law, the Board is charged with ensuring taxpayers are treated \nproperly by the IRS, and the Board is designed to be independent of the \nagency. Of the required nine members, seven must be Senate-confirmed \nappointees who have professional experience or expertise in business \nand tax administration. The IRS Reform Act also requires IRS employees \nbe terminated for violating the constitutional rights of taxpayers.\n  The current IRS scandal was not, however, brought to light by this \nIRS Oversight Board. Instead, these abuses came to the public's and our \nattention through a May 2013 report by the Treasury Inspector General \nfor Tax Administration. Following the release of the inspector \ngeneral's report, the Oversight Board released a statement saying it \nwould work with the IRS and the IG, among others, to meet its statutory \nresponsibility to protect taxpayers. That is the whole purpose of this \nBoard, and I believe it should do much more than just work with IRS \nofficials and the IG.\n  So my bill would strengthen its oversight role by requiring reporting \nto Congress. My bill would ensure the existing laws, which are rooted \nin the response to prior IRS scandals, work as they should. It would \nrequire that the Oversight Board report to Congress each and every year \non allegations of abuse, of taxpayers' constitutional rights, on the \nnumber of employees who were terminated for such violations, on why \nemployees against whom allegations were raised were not terminated, and \non the effectiveness of internal controls, if any, that the IRS has put \nin place to prevent the unfair targeting of taxpayers.\n  The IRS's history of abuses demonstrates that Congress must be ever \nvigilant in protecting taxpayers. The agency's power allows it to \npervade the most sensitive aspects of Americans' private lives. \nIrrespective of whether those singled out are liberal or conservative, \nDemocratic or Republican, Independent or Green Party members, \nirrespective of their personal views, the targeting of private citizens \nfor exercising their First Amendment rights is way out of bounds. It is \nillegal behavior and cannot be tolerated.\n  It has been said the power to tax is the power to destroy. The \nAmerican people cannot and will not tolerate any abuse of that power.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this bill and let us \npass it to help protect the most fundamental rights guaranteed by our \nConstitution against abuse by government's ability to tax.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/05/senate-section/article/S1322-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1322-S1323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 370--SUPPORTING THE TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF UKRAINE \n         AND CONDEMNING RUSSIAN MILITARY AGGRESSION IN UKRAINE\n\n  Mr. COATS (for himself, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Graham, Mr. McCain, Mr. \nPortman, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Cornyn,\n\n[[Page S1323]]\n\nMr. Grassley, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Hoeven) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S.

which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 373\n\n       Whereas following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, \n     the United States increased its efforts to combat the threat \n     of global terrorism;\n       Whereas the September 11th attacks illustrated \n     the vulnerability of the food supply and agriculture economy \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas in 2002, Congress created the Department of \n     Homeland Security to improve the Government's ability to \n     respond to threats facing the United States;\n       Whereas the Department of Homeland Security, in partnership \n     with the Department of Agriculture, was quick to recognize \n     the threat posed by agroterrorism;\n       Whereas on January 30, 2004, President George W. Bush \n     issued a Homeland Security Presidential Directive entitled \n     ``Defense of United States Agriculture and Food'';\n       Whereas the Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass \n     Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism stated in a 2008 \n     report that bioterrorism was a more likely threat to the \n     United States than nuclear terrorism, and higher priority \n     should therefore be given to efforts to combat bioterrorism;\n       Whereas the threat of a terrorist attack on the United \n     States persists, and continued vigilance is necessary; and\n       Whereas construction of the National Bio and Agro-Defense \n     Facility began on May 28, 2013: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) as the United States combats terrorism in all forms and \n     around the world, the safety, security, and health of our \n     livestock and agriculture commodities must not be forgotten;\n       (2) research and investment in biosecurity and agro-defense \n     should be supported by Congress;\n       (3) providing the resources, both intellectually and \n     materially, for the advancement of vaccines and cures for \n     deadly pathogens and emerging zoonotic diseases is an \n     integral part of homeland defense;\n       (4) without the tools necessary to protect the people, \n     agriculture economy, and food supply of the United States, \n     this Nation remains vulnerable to attack;\n       (5) the world depends on the agriculture of the United \n     States;\n       (6) the world depends on the leadership of the United \n     States in science and technology;\n       (7) the United States must remain a leader in the fight \n     against bioterrorism; and\n       (8) biosecurity and a strong agro-defense system are \n     achievable goals for the United States in the global war on \n     terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/05/senate-section/article/S1324-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1324-S1325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 374--DESIGNATING MARCH 3, 2014, AS ``WORLD WILDLIFE \n                                 DAY''\n\n  Mr. COONS (for himself, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \nInhofe, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Markey, and Mr. Cardin) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 374\n\n       Whereas wildlife has provided numerous economic, \n     environmental, social, and cultural benefits during the \n     course of human history, and wildlife preservation will \n     secure these gifts for future generations;\n       Whereas each plant and animal species plays an important \n     role in the stability of diverse ecosystems around the world, \n     and the conservation of this biodiversity is critical to \n     maintain the delicate balance of nature and keep complex \n     ecosystems thriving;\n       Whereas observation of wild plants and animals in their \n     natural habitat provides individuals with a more enriching \n     world view and a greater appreciation of the wonders of the \n     natural environment;\n       Whereas tens of millions of individuals in the United \n     States strongly support the conservation of wildlife, both \n     domestically and abroad, and wish to ensure the survival of \n     species in the wild, such as rhinoceroses, tigers, elephants, \n     pangolins, turtles, seahorses, sharks, ginseng, mahogany, and \n     cacti;\n       Whereas the Convention on International Trade in Endangered \n     Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (referred to in this preamble \n     as ``CITES'' and also known as the ``Washington Convention'') \n     was signed in Washington, DC, on March 3, 1973;\n       Whereas 179 countries, including the United States, are now \n     parties to CITES;\n       Whereas CITES remains one of the most powerful tools in the \n     world for biodiversity conservation by regulating \n     international trade in wild plants and animals, including \n     products and derivatives of wild plants and animals, ensuring \n     the survival of plants and animals in the wild, and providing \n     long-term benefits for the livelihood of local people and the \n     global environment;\n       Whereas CITES seeks to ensure that international trade in \n     listed species is sustainable, legal, and traceable;\n       Whereas the trafficking of wildlife, including timber and \n     fish, comprises the fourth largest global illegal trade, \n     after narcotics, counterfeiting of products and currency, and \n     human trafficking, and has become a major transnational \n     organized crime with an estimated worth of approximately \n     $19,000,000,000 annually;\n       Whereas increased demand in Asia for high-value illegal \n     wildlife products, particularly elephant ivory and rhinoceros \n     horns, has recently triggered substantial and rapid increases \n     in poaching of these species, particularly in Africa;\n       Whereas trafficking of wildlife is the primary threat to \n     many wildlife species, including elephants, rhinoceroses, and \n     tigers;\n       Whereas many different kinds of criminals, including some \n     terrorist entities and rogue security personnel, often in \n     collusion with corrupt government officials, are involved in \n     wildlife poaching and the movement of ivory and rhinoceros \n     horns across Africa;\n       Whereas wildlife poaching presents significant security and \n     stability challenges for military and police forces in \n     African nations that are often threatened by heavily armed \n     poachers and the criminal and extremist allies of such \n     poachers;\n       Whereas wildlife poaching negatively impacts local \n     communities that rely on natural resources for economic \n     development, including tourism;\n       Whereas the lack of sufficient penal and financial \n     deterrents hamper the ability of African governments to \n     reduce poaching and trafficking;\n       Whereas capacity building, including material, training, \n     legal, and diplomatic support, can significantly impact the \n     trajectory of the illegal wildlife trade;\n       Whereas wildlife provides a multitude of benefits to all \n     nations, and wildlife crime has wide-ranging economic, \n     environmental, and social impacts;\n       Whereas the number of elephants killed by poachers in Kenya \n     increased by more than 800 percent from 2007 to 2012, from 47 \n     to 387 elephants killed;\n       Whereas the number of rhinoceroses killed by poachers in \n     South Africa increased by more than 7000 percent between 2007 \n     and 2013, from 13 to 1004 rhinoceroses killed;\n       Whereas the number of forest elephants in the Congo Basin \n     in central Africa declined by approximately two-thirds \n     between 2002 and 2012, placing forest elephants on track for \n     extinction within the next decade;\n       Whereas as few as 3200 tigers remain in the wild throughout \n     all of Asia;\n       Whereas approximately 100,000,000 sharks are killed \n     annually, often targeted solely for their fins, and \n     unsustainable trade is the primary cause of serious \n     population decline in several shark species, including \n     scalloped hammerhead sharks, great hammerhead sharks, and \n     oceanic whitetip sharks;\n       Whereas the United States is developing strong measures to \n     address the criminal, financial, security, and environmental \n     aspects of wildlife trafficking;\n       Whereas Congress has allocated specific resources to combat \n     wildlife trafficking and address the threats posed by \n     poaching and the illegal wildlife trade;\n       Whereas in December 2013, the United Nations General \n     Assembly proclaimed March 3, the day on which CITES was \n     signed, as World Wildlife Day to celebrate and raise \n     awareness of the wild fauna and flora around the world;\n       Whereas March 3, 2014, represents the first annual \n     celebration of World Wildlife Day; and\n\n[[Page S1325]]\n\n       Whereas in 2014, World Wildlife Day commemorations will \n     ``celebrate the many beautiful and varied forms of wild fauna \n     and flora, raise awareness of the multitude of benefits that \n     wildlife provides to people, and raise awareness of the \n     urgent need to step up the fight against wildlife crime, \n     which has wide-ranging economic, environmental, and social \n     impacts'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 3, 2014, as ``World Wildlife Day'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of World Wildlife Day, \n     including--\n       (A) raising awareness of the benefits that wildlife \n     provides to people and the threats facing wildlife around the \n     world; and\n       (B) escalating the fight against wildlife crime, including \n     wildlife trafficking;\n       (3) applauds the domestic and international efforts to \n     escalate the fight against wildlife crime;\n       (4) commends the efforts of the United States to mobilize \n     the entire Government in a coordinated, efficient, and \n     effective manner for dramatic progress in the fight against \n     wildlife crime;\n       (5) encourages continued cooperation between the United \n     States, international partners, local communities, nonprofit \n     organizations, private industry, and other partner \n     organizations in an effort to conserve and celebrate \n     wildlife, preserving this precious resource for future \n     generations.\n\n

Res. 375\n\n       Whereas, for more than 50 years, successive governments in \n     the Central African Republic have struggled to build a \n     durable system of democratic institutions, to effectively \n     secure and control the country's territory and borders, and \n     to ensure a basic level of socio-economic development for the \n     country's people;\n       Whereas, despite its natural resource wealth, the Central \n     African Republic remains one of the poorest countries in the \n     world and one of the lowest ranking countries in terms of a \n     human development index according to the United Nations \n     Development Program;\n       Whereas, in January 2013, regional leaders brokered the \n     Libreville Agreements between the government of then-\n     President Francois Bozize and the loosely allied rebel \n     militia known as Seleka, which resulted in the formation of a \n     government of national unity;\n       Whereas, despite the Libreville Agreements, President \n     Bozize was ousted in March 2013 by the Seleka coalition, and \n     the Seleka leader, Michel Djotodia, declared himself \n     president;\n       Whereas, in April 2013, regional leaders issued the \n     N'djamena Declaration in an effort to pursue a return to \n     constitutional order based on the Libreville Agreements;\n       Whereas an influx of foreign fighters, especially from Chad \n     and Sudan, has been a major factor in the increased number of \n     Seleka fighters, from approximately 5,000 in March 2013, to \n     an estimated 20,000 as of December 2013;\n       Whereas both Seleka forces and armed militia groups known \n     as ``anti-balakas'', which formed initially as a means of \n     protecting communities against Seleka, have been implicated \n     in ethnically-motivated violence and grave and systemic human \n     rights abuses against civilians;\n       Whereas, over the course of the crisis, Seleka and anti-\n     balaka groups have displayed weak control and command \n     structures, and committed war crimes with impunity;\n       Whereas, according to UNICEF, thousands of child soldiers \n     are involved in armed groups in the Central African Republic, \n     amid the near-total collapse of the country's primary \n     education system;\n       Whereas interethnic, intercommunal, and interreligious \n     tensions and violence have risen to alarming levels and led \n     to systematic human rights abuses in the Central African \n     Republic, including targeted killings, rapes, acts of \n     torture, looting, and arbitrary detention;\n       Whereas the United States Embassy in Bangui closed on \n     December 25, 2012, and the ordered departure of country team \n     staff has temporarily suspended the diplomatic presence and \n     consular services of the United States in the Central African \n     Republic;\n       Whereas more than 700,000 civilians have been internally \n     displaced; another 230,000 have recently sought refuge in \n     neighboring countries, including the Democratic Republic of \n     the Congo, Chad, Cameroon, and South Sudan; 2,600,000 people, \n     or over half of the population of the Central African \n     Republic, are in need of humanitarian assistance; and 60 \n     percent of households have no available food stocks;\n       Whereas a failure of the international community to \n     appropriately respond to and address the rapidly \n     deteriorating situation in the Central African Republic could \n     result in further atrocities, mass displacement, and \n     protracted instability with significant repercussions for \n     regional and international security;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 2127 \n     (2013) called for urgent and increased international \n     assistance to the African Union International Support Mission \n     in the Central African Republic (MISCA) to ensure that the \n     force can fulfill its mandate to restore security and protect \n     civilians, and placed an arms embargo on the Central African \n     Republic;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 2127 \n     requested the Secretary-General to establish an international \n     commission of inquiry to investigate reports of human rights \n     abuses in the Central African Republic in order to ensure \n     accountability for perpetrators of violence;\n       Whereas the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office \n     in the Central African Republic has been hindered by a lack \n     of resources and constrained by insecurity;\n       Whereas, consistent with United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 2127, the Government of France launched a \n     peacekeeping operation, Operation Sangaris, in the Central \n     African Republic to assist MISCA in fulfilling its mandate;\n       Whereas, on March 3, 2014, United Nations Secretary-General \n     Ban Ki-moon recommended to the United Nations Security \n     Council a transition to a United Nations peacekeeping mission \n     with a primary mandate to protect civilians; and\n       Whereas the United States Government is providing support \n     for conflict resolution efforts, humanitarian assistance to \n     refugees and internally displaced persons, and assistance to \n     troop contributing countries to MISCA in order to restore \n     security in the Central African Republic, primarily by \n     providing airlift, non-lethal equipment, military logistics, \n     and training, as well as logistical support for France: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the violence, atrocities, abuses, and human \n     rights violations committed by all parties to the conflict in \n     the Central African Republic;\n       (2) commends the efforts of religious and community leaders \n     in the Central African Republic condemning violence and \n     engaging in conflict prevention and conflict resolution \n     activities;\n       (3) welcomes the mobilization of international \n     peacekeeping, conflict mitigation, humanitarian, and \n     diplomatic resources, and encourages continued efforts to \n     help address humanitarian needs, bring an end to the \n     violence, and develop sustainable democratic institutions in \n     the Central African Republic;\n       (4) welcomes the January 2014 decision of the Transitional \n     National Council on the election of Catherine Samba-Panza as \n     the Central African Republic's new transitional president;\n       (5) commends the African Union and its troop and police \n     contributing countries for their work establishing and \n     supporting MISCA;\n       (6) recognizes the Economic Community of Central African \n     States (CEEAS) for its leadership in the political transition \n     process;\n       (7) commends France for its swift intervention under United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 2127, and for its \n     contributions to stabilization efforts and other forms of \n     assistance;\n       (8) welcomes the United Nations Security Council support \n     for MISCA and the Department of Peacekeeping Operation's \n     ongoing contingency planning for a possible transition to a \n     United Nations peacekeeping operation;\n       (9) affirms support for multilateral peacekeeping and \n     policing capacities and recognizes the important \n     contributions these efforts have made in protecting civilians \n     in the Central African Republic and promoting international \n     peace and stability;\n       (10) calls on the President to work with international \n     partners to develop a short-term strategy to support a full \n     and immediate cessation of armed conflict in the Central \n     African Republic, including attacks targeting civilians and \n     the recruitment of child soldiers;\n       (11) calls on the President to develop a long-term United \n     States strategy, in support of international and domestic \n     efforts, to establish a durable peace and greater security \n     for the Central African Republic and to enhance regional \n     stability, including--\n       (A) engagement and coordination with the international \n     community, including the African Union, the Economic \n     Community of Central African States, the United Nations, and \n     other partners;\n       (B) appropriate assistance to help provide emergency relief \n     and reconciliation for the people of the Central African \n     Republic;\n       (C) technical, logistical and other forms of assistance, as \n     appropriate, in support of effective disarmament, \n     demobilization, and reintegration of fighters; and\n       (D) support for appropriate mechanisms to ensure \n     accountability for perpetrators of human rights abuses and \n     violence; and\n       (12) urges the Secretary of State to consider the \n     expeditious reestablishment of a United States diplomatic \n     presence in the Central African Republic.\n\n[[Page S1326]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/05/senate-section/article/S1326-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.
