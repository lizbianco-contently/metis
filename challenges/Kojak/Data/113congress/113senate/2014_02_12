Mr. President, as I just mentioned, today we hope we can \nact on two vital pieces of legislation. On this side of the aisle, as \nwe say, we are ready to move. We want to move to a measure to restore \nearned retirement pay to our Nation's heroes--retirees of the U.S. \narmed services. Dozens of major veterans organizations have written us \nin support of this legislation which was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives yesterday.\n  I commend the sponsors of the Senate bill to restore veterans' \npensions--Senators Pryor, Shaheen, Hagan, and Begich, among others--\nforcing Republicans in the House and the Senate to take this issue very \nseriously and take it seriously now. Without their leadership we would \nnever have reached a compromise that protects our Nation's heroic \nveterans and reached it so quickly. The Senate's unanimous vote on \nMonday to move forward with the bill to restore veterans' pensions \nforced the House to understand that we are serious about this and \nsecured a resolution that protects veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/12/senate-section/article/S915-10", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S915-S916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DEBT CEILING\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is encouraging that some of my Republican \ncolleagues seem to be regaining their grip on sanity this week. \nRepublicans have shown a willingness to compromise to restore veterans' \nhard-\n\n[[Page S916]]\n\nearned pensions. A few reasonable Republicans were willing to join \nDemocrats to avert a catastrophic default on our Nation's obligations--\na default that would have thrown our economy into a tailspin and \ndamaged this Nation's standing in the world.\n  I commend Speaker Boehner for doing the right thing. He voted for \nthis, and he had enough Republican votes to get it done. I have said \noften that he has a difficult job--if not the most difficult, certainly \none of the most difficult jobs in Washington, especially when we look \nat the caucus he has to deal with. I am pleased he has come to the \nrealization that the full faith and credit of this country is not a \nhostage to be held for political gain.\n  Unfortunately, Republicans on this side of the Capitol are forcing us \nto jump through procedural hoops to alleviate the threat of a default. \nI can't imagine that they are doing that, but they are.\n  Every reputable economist acknowledges that defaulting on our bills \nwould devastate the economy and waste the past 5 years of recovery. The \nrecovery is good, but it is not great. We can do a lot better.\n  According to a report by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute, when \nRepublicans forced us to the brink of default 2 years ago, it cost our \neconomy $150 billion in productivity and 750,000 jobs. This is not some \nleftwing blog that is saying this; this is a nonpartisan institute that \nis well respected--it will cost our economy $150 billion in \nproductivity and 750,000 jobs. Scary.\n  The reason I am a little concerned is because it was just a few \nmonths ago that Republicans in the House, by a two-thirds majority, \nvoted to keep the government closed after having been closed for 16 \ndays and voted to default on our Nation's debt. So I hope the Senate is \nnot going to follow that tea party-driven action that was done in the \nHouse just a short time ago.\n  Financial industry leaders have warned Congress again and again that \neven the threat of default ripples through the economy, and today there \nis the threat of a default. We have Republican Senators saying they are \ngoing to filibuster the debt ceiling. We can't default on our \nobligations. It is too bad that a few Senate Republicans would threaten \na filibuster on this critical legislation. It is critical, and it is \ncrucial. However, I am hopeful Senate Republicans won't force the \neconomy to wait for weeks or even days for a resolution. We should wrap \nthis up today.\n  So I hope we can vote and vote soon. The markets all over the world \nare watching to see what we do in the Senate. The House did the right \nthing. I believe many of my Republican colleagues would like to be \nreasonable--I really do believe that--if they weren't so beholden and \nafraid of the tea party overlords. I am hopeful that a more bipartisan, \ncommonsense approach--one that favors collaboration over hostage \ntaking--will prevail this year.\n  Congress should be striding from accomplishment to accomplishment, \nnot staggering from crisis to crisis as they force us to do. If we \nspent more time working together and less time running out the clock on \nprocedural hurdles and Republican filibusters, we might actually get \nlegislation done in the Senate.\n  So I hope we can continue to cooperate and collaborate this year and \nto deliver results for Americans looking for action instead of the \nconstant gridlock we have had.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to appeal to the conscience of my \ncolleagues and my fellow citizens about the mass atrocities that the \nAssad regime is perpetrating in Syria. When the images and horrors of \nthis conflict occasionally show up on our television screens, the \nimpulse of many Americans is to change the channel. But we must not \nlook away. We must not divert our eyes from the suffering of the Syrian \npeople, for if we do, we ignore, we sacrifice that which is most \nprecious in ourselves--our ability to empathize with the suffering of \nothers, to share it, to acknowledge through our own sense of revulsion \nthat what is happening in Syria is a stain on the collective conscience \nof moral peoples everywhere.\n  I appeal to my colleagues not to look away from the images I will \nshow. I want to warn all who are watching these are graphic and \ndisturbing pictures, but they are the real face of war and human \nsuffering in Syria today--a war our Nation has the power to help end \nbut which we are failing to do.\n  These images are drawn from a cache of more than 55,000 photographs \nthat were taken between March 2011 and August 2013 by a Syrian military \npoliceman, whose job it was to document the horrors the Assad regime \ncommitted against political prisoners in its jails. This individual \neventually defected to the opposition along with his photographs, which \nwere meticulously reviewed and verified by three renowned international \nwar crimes prosecutors and a team of independent forensic experts. They \ncompiled their findings in a report late last month that provides \ndirect evidence that the Assad regime was responsible for the \nsystematic abuse, torture, starvation, and killing of approximately \n11,000 detainees in what amounts to war crimes and crimes against \nhumanity. These are just a few of those pictures and far from the most \ndisturbing.\n  I urge every Member of Congress and the American people to read the \nfull report, which can be found on both cnn.com and theguardian.com. \nAlthough only a handful of these gruesome images have been released \npublicly, the authors have provided their own startling commentary on \nwhat they reveal.\n  David Crane, the first chief prosecutor of the Special Court for \nSierra Leone and the man responsible for indicting former Liberian \nPresident Charles Taylor for crimes against humanity, stated that many \nof the photographs show groupings of bodies in ways that ``looked like \na slaughterhouse.'' Crane characterized the Syrian Government as a \n``callous, industrial machine grinding its citizens'' that is guilty of \n``industrial-age mass killing.''\n  Professor Sir Geoffrey Nice, lead prosecutor in the case against \nformer Yugoslav President Milosevic at The Hague, reported that the \nsystematic way the bodies were cataloged and the effort given to \nobscure the true causes of death leads one to ``reasonably infer that \nthis is a pattern of behavior'' for Assad's forces.\n  But perhaps most chilling of all, Sir Desmond de Silva, who also \nserved as a chief prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, \nstated that the emaciated bodies revealed in these pictures are \n``reminiscent of the pictures of those who were found still alive in \nthe Nazi death camps after World War II.''\n  Yesterday, in a hearing of the Committee on Armed Services, I asked \nthe Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, whether these \nphotographs, which clearly depict ghastly\n\n[[Page S917]]\n\ncrimes against humanity, are authentic. The Director said he has ``no \nreason to doubt'' their authenticity. The United Nations is now doing \nits own assessment of these images, and all of us should fully support \nthat. It is important to have the broadest possible validation of these \nimages, and I am confident the U.N. team will validate them. After all, \ndoes anyone seriously believe the Assad regime does not have the means, \nmotive, and opportunity to murder 11,000 people in its prisons?\n  Indeed, this kind of inhumane cruelty is a pattern of behavior within \nthe Syrian Government. According to a detailed U.N. report issued at \nthe end of January, Assad's forces have systematically, as part of \ntheir doctrine, used children as human shields and threatened to kill \nthe children of opposition members if they did not surrender. The U.N. \nalso detailed the arrest, detention, torture, and sexual abuse of \nthousands of children by government forces. I will spare you the \nremaining details, as they are unspeakable, but again I urge you to \nread the entire report which can be found on the Web site of the United \nNations.\n  I also recommend that my colleagues read of the war crimes that Human \nRights Watch has been documenting. They have reported, for example, on \nhow Syrian authorities have deliberately used explosives and bulldozers \nto demolish thousands of residential buildings, and in some cases \nentire neighborhoods, for no military reason whatsoever, just as a form \nof collective punishment of Syrian civilians.\n  Human Rights Watch researchers have also documented the toll of the \nSyrian Government's airstrike campaign against Aleppo and Damascus and, \nin particular, the regime's use over the past few months of what has \nbecome known as ``barrel bombs.'' For my colleagues who are not aware \nof them, barrel bombs are oil drums or other large containers packed \nwith explosives, fuel, shrapnel, glass, and all manner of crude lethal \nmaterial. Their sole purpose is to maim, kill, and terrorize as many \npeople as possible when they are indiscriminately dropped from Syrian \nGovernment aircraft on schools and bakeries and mosques and other \ncivilian areas. In one stark video of a barrel bomb's aftermath, a man \nstands in front of a child's body and cries out: Oh God, we have had \nenough. Please help us.\n  These are just some of the many reasons our Director of National \nIntelligence referred to the Syrian crisis yesterday as ``an \napocalyptic disaster.'' With more than 130,000 people dead, after more \nthan one-third of the Syrian population has been driven from their \nhomes, no truer words were ever spoken.\n  But this apocalyptic disaster in Syria is no longer just a \nhumanitarian tragedy for one country, it is a regional conflict and an \nemerging national security threat to us. The regime's war crimes are \nbeing aided and abetted by thousands of Hezbollah fighters and Iranian \nagents on the ground, as well as Russian weaponry that continues to \nflow into the Assad government, even as Russia works with us to remove \nthe Assad regime's chemical weapons, a truly Orwellian situation.\n  The conflict in Syria is devastating its neighbors. Lebanon is \nsuffering from increasing bombings and cross-border attacks by both the \nSyrian government and opposition fighters in response to Hezbollah's \nrole in the fighting. Unofficial estimates suggest that half of \nLebanon's population will soon be Syrian refugees. Similar estimates \nsuggest that Syrian refugees now represent 15 percent of the population \nin Jordan, which is straining to manage the social instability this \nentails. Turkey has been destabilized. Perhaps most worrisome of all, \nthe conflict in Syria is largely to blame for the resurgence of Al \nQaeda in Iraq, which has grown into the larger and more lethal Islamic \nState of Iraq and Syria, which now possesses a safe haven that spans \nlarge portions of both countries. Nowhere is this more threatening or \nmore heartbreaking than in Fallujah, the Iraqi city where hundreds of \nU.S. troops were killed and wounded fighting to rid it of the \nterrorists and extremists, but where the black flags of Al Qaeda now \nhang above the city.\n  The sanctuary that Al Qaeda now enjoys, thanks to the crisis in \nSyria, increasingly poses a direct threat to U.S. national security and \nthat of our closest allies and partners. The Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, Mr. Jeh Johnson said, ``Syria is now a matter of homeland \nsecurity.'' The Director of National Intelligence has referred to the \nAl Qaeda sanctuary in Syria and Iraq as ``a new FATA''--the tribal \nareas of Pakistan and Afghanistan where Al Qaeda planned the September \n11 terrorist attacks.\n  Indeed, Director Clapper has warned that Al Qaeda affiliated \nterrorists in Syria now aspire to attack the homeland. If the September \n11 attacks should have taught us anything, it is that global terrorists \nwho occupy ungoverned spaces and seek to plot and plan attacks against \nus can pose a direct threat to our national security.\n  This was Afghanistan, September 10, 2001. That is what top officials \nin this administration are now warning us that Syria is becoming today. \nThe conflict in Syria is a threat to our national interest, but it is \nmore than that. It is and should be an affront to our conscience.\n  Images such as these should not be just a source of heartbreak and \nsympathy, they should be a call to action. It was not too long ago, \njust a few months after the revolution in Syria began, that President \nObama issued his Presidential Study Directive on Mass Atrocities. In it \nhe stated, ``Preventing mass atrocities and genocide is a core national \nsecurity interest and a core moral responsibility of the United \nStates.''\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Our security is affected when masses of civilians are \n     slaughtered, refugees flow across borders, and murderers \n     wreak havoc on regional stability and livelihoods.\n\n  Last year, speaking at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the \nPresident said:\n\n       Too often, the world has failed to prevent the killing of \n     innocents on a massive scale. And we are haunted by the \n     atrocities that we did not stop and the lives we did not \n     save.\n\n  Just last September in his address to the U.N. General Assembly, \nPresident Obama said this:\n\n       [T]he principle of sovereignty is at the center of our \n     international order. But sovereignty cannot be a shield for \n     tyrants to commit wanton murder, or an excuse for the \n     international community to turn a blind eye. While we need to \n     be modest in our belief that we can remedy every evil, while \n     we need to be mindful that the world is full of unintended \n     consequences, should we really accept the notion that the \n     world is powerless in the face of a Rwanda, or Srebrenica? If \n     that's the world that people want to live in, they should say \n     so, and reckon with the cold logic of mass graves.\n\n  That was our President. That was the President of the United States. \nI agree with every word of what he said. But how are we to reconcile \nthese stirring words with the reality of these images from Syria? How \ndo we explain how the leader of the free world, who says that it is the \nmoral obligation of the United States to do what we can to prevent the \nworst atrocities in our world, is not doing more to stop the atrocities \nthat are occurring every single day in Syria?\n  Where is that President Obama today? Where is the President Obama who \nspoke so movingly of the moral responsibilities that great power \nconfers? Where is the President Obama who has said he refuses to accept \nthat brutal tyrants can slaughter their people with impunity, while the \nmost powerful nation in the history of the world looks on and stands \nby? Where is the recognition that the ``cold logic of mass graves'' is \nright there, right in front of us, Syria, today?\n  Yet our government is doing what we have sadly done too often in the \npast. We are diverting our eyes. We try to comfort our guilty \nconsciences by telling ourselves that we are not doing nothing, but it \nis a claim made in bad faith, for everyone concedes that nothing we are \ndoing is equal to the horrors we face.\n  We are telling ourselves that we are too tired and weary to get more \ninvolved; that Syria is not our problem; that helping to resolve it is \nnot our responsibility. We are telling ourselves that we have no good \noptions, as if there are ever good options when it comes to foreign \npolicy in the real world. We are telling ourselves that we might have \nbeen able to do something at one point, but that it is too late now, as \nif such words from a leader of the world's only global power will be \nany comfort to the Syrian mother who will lose her child tomorrow.\n\n[[Page S918]]\n\n  We are telling ourselves what Neville Chamberlain once told himself \nabout a different problem from hell in an earlier time; that is, and I \nquote Neville Chamberlain, ``a quarrel in a far away country between \npeople of whom we know nothing.'' Where is our outrage? Where is our \nshame?\n  It is true that our options to help in the conflict in Syria were \nnever good, and they certainly are worse and fewer now. But no one \nshould believe that we are without options, even now, and no one should \nbelieve that doing something meaningful to help in Syria requires us to \nrerun the war in Iraq. That is an excuse for inaction. That is not a \nquestion of options or capabilities; it is a question of will.\n  These images of the human disaster in Syria haunt me. They should \nhaunt all of my colleagues and all Americans. But what haunts me even \nmore than the terror unfolding before our eyes in Syria is the thought \nthat we will continue to do nothing meaningful about it, and how that \ndeadens our national conscience, how it calls into question the moral \nsources of our great power and the foundations of our global \nleadership, and how many years from now an American President will \nstand before the world and the people of Syria, as previous Presidents \nhave done after previous inaction in the face of mass atrocities in far \naway lands, and say what all of us know to be true right now: That we \ncould have done more to stop the suffering of others. We could have \nused the power we possess, limited though it may be; we could have \nexercised the options at our disposal, imperfect though they may be, \nand we could have done something.

Mr. President, fairly recently, the President of the \nUnited States nominated a candidate to lead the Civil Rights Division \nof the Justice Department. His name is Debo Adegbile. I am here this \nmorning to explain to my colleagues why I believe that Mr. Adegbile is \na very bad choice to run the Civil Rights Division of the Justice \nDepartment.\n  To make my case clear, I need to start with a story of a slain \nPhiladelphia police officer. His name was Daniel Faulkner. This is a \npicture of Daniel Faulkner. It is important to tell his story. It is a \nstory that begins 32 years ago. Many people have never heard this \nstory, others have perhaps forgotten, since it was some time ago.\n  But the fact is that Danny Faulkner can no longer speak for himself \nand those who have tried to speak for him have often been drowned out \nby some powerful and wealthy voices that have had a political agenda \nand that have perversely defended his killer rather than the memory of \nDaniel Faulkner.\n  The story begins late at night on December 9, 1981. It was actually \nin the early morning hours that 25-year-old Philadelphia police officer \nDaniel Faulkner stopped a car that was driving in Philadelphia. The \ndriver got out of the car and began to assault Officer Faulkner. The \ndriver's brother Mumia Abu-Jamal was watching the incident from across \nthe street. When he saw what was happening and as Officer Faulkner \nattempted to handcuff the driver of the car, Abu-Jamal ran up to the \ncar and shot Officer Faulkner in the back. As Officer Faulkner was \nfalling, he got off a shot, but the shot did not seriously wound Mumia \nAbu-Jamal.\n  Officer Faulkner then collapsed on the ground. While he was lying on \nthe ground, helpless, defenseless, and severely wounded, Mumia Abu-\nJamal stood over him and pumped four more bullets into him, including \nfive bullets to the face, which killed Danny Faulkner on the spot.\n  Abu-Jamal himself was quickly apprehended. There were police who were \non the next block over, and they got there almost immediately. They \narrested Mumia Abu-Jamal. They took him to the hospital because he had \nbeen wounded, and while he was at the hospital he bragged about the \nfact that he had just shot a police officer and stated that he hoped \nthe police officer would die.\n  Given these facts, Mumia Abu-Jamal's guilt was never in any serious \nquestion. There was a trial. There were four eyewitnesses to the \nshooting. There were three other witnesses who heard Mumia Abu-Jamal \nbrag about the murder he had committed while he was in the hospital. In \naddition, there was ballistic and forensic evidence that made his guilt \ncompletely obvious to everyone. So it was not surprising that a jury \ntook only 3 hours to convict Mumia Abu-Jamal after the trial occurred. \nIt took them a further 2 hours to sentence him to death.\n  Then, instead of allowing Daniel Faulkner's young 24-year-old widow \nand his extended family to grieve in peace, a group of political \nopportunists decided this would be the case they would use to launch a \ncampaign to further their political agenda. They fabricated a whole set \nof claims that Mumia Abu-Jamal was somehow framed. They spread lies \nabout the trial. They organized a rally. Amazingly, what they were \ndoing was portraying Mumia Abu-Jamal as a victim when, in fact, he was \nunquestionably a cold-blooded murderer.\n  It was part of a bigger campaign to turn Abu-Jamal into a celebrity \nand use him by those who had an agenda to attack America's criminal \njustice system. Unfortunately, to a large extent it worked. Abu-Jamal \nthe murderer became somewhat of a celebrity in certain Hollywood \ncircles. In Paris, they even named a street after him, and there were \nplenty of high-priced lawyers who lined up to volunteer their time to \njump on this cause and to file endless series of appeals in a case that \nwas an open-and-shut case. This, of course, among other things, had the \neffect of forcing Danny Faulkner's widow to relive this tragedy, this \ndisaster for her, time after time, for decade after decade.\n  This gross abuse of justice, this travesty of justice had been going \non for nearly three decades when in 2009 the\n\n[[Page S919]]\n\nNAACP Legal Defense Fund, or the LDF, decided to volunteer its time, \nconsiderable resources, and its donor funds to join in this fray, to \njoin in this travesty, initially as an amicus to the trial and then as \nco-counsel.\n  The President's nominee to run the Civil Rights Division, Mr. Debo \nAdegbile, was the person responsible for the LDF's decision and its \nbehavior in this outrageous set of circumstances. At the time, he was \nthe LDF's director of litigation, and, as Mr. Adegbile told our own \nSenate Judiciary Committee during his testimony, he ``supervised the \nentire legal staff'' at LDF. That was 18 lawyers. He was also, if one \nlooks at the LDF's site, responsible for ``providing leadership and \ncoordination regarding both litigation and non-litigation legal \nadvocacy'' and was also, according to the LDF's own description, \n``responsible for LDF's advocacy both in the courts of law and in the \ncourt of political opinion.'' So all of the legal, public, and \npolitical actions LDF was taking, it was taking under the direction, \nthe supervision, and the authority of Mr. Adegbile.\n  It is important to understand this. There is a very clear legal \nprinciple that a supervising lawyer has the responsibility for the \nactions undertaken by the lawyers who report to him. That is the case \nin these circumstances, as well as the fact that the LDF openly \nacknowledges this.\n  What is it that the LDF lawyers then did in the circumstances of this \ncase? When they should have been pursuing their historic role of \nproviding the truth and justice for American people, they were \nadvancing neither cause.\n  It is also important to point out that this was never a case of a \ncriminal deserving a legal defense. Criminals do deserve appropriate \nlegal counsel in their defense. The fact is that the trial had occurred \ndecades ago. Abu-Jamal had multiple high-cost lawyers volunteering \ntheir time. He had plenty of lawyers. He didn't need more lawyers. What \nMr. Adegbile did was he decided to join a political cause. That is what \nhe decided to do. That is what this was all about. In my view, by doing \nso he demonstrated his own contempt for and, frankly, a willingness to \nundermine the criminal justice system of the United States.\n  Under Mr. Adegbile's oversight, the LDF spread misinformation about \nthe trial, about the circumstances, and about the jury. He promoted \ndivision and strife among the American people and blocked justice for \nDanny Faulkner and Danny Faulkner's family. These LDF lawyers promoted \nthe myth that Mumia Abu-Jamal was somehow a heroic political prisoner \nand that he was framed. In fact, he was a coward and an unrepentant \nmurderer.\n  Under Mr. Adegbile's oversight, in January 2011 the LDF issued a \npress release decrying what I quote as the ``grave injustices \nembodied'' in Abu-Jamal's case.\n  In May 2011 two of the lawyers reporting to Mr. Adegbile traveled to \nFrance for a rally on behalf of this murderer Mumia Abu-Jamal. One of \nthese LDF lawyers said she was ``overjoyed'' that Mumia Abu-Jamal's \ndeath sentence was suspended but bemoaned the fact that he would not \nhave a new trial so he could be set free.\n  Another LDF lawyer described Abu-Jamal as ``people who are innocent'' \nbut ``will continue to be put to death in America.'' Later, the same \nlawyer would falsely state that there was an absence of forensic \nevidence tying Abu-Jamal to Officer Faulkner's death. The fact is that \nthere was forensic evidence. There were four eyewitnesses to the \nmurder, and there were three witnesses to the subsequent bragging by \nAbu-Jamal about the murder.\n  At another rally again celebrating this murderer, one of the LDF \nlawyers supervised by Mr. Adegbile gushed: ``It is absolutely my honor \nto represent Mumia Abu-Jamal.'' This attorney went on to say: ``And \nthere is no question in my mind, there is no question in the mind of \nanyone at the Legal Defense Fund, that the justice system has \ncompletely and utterly failed Mumia Abu-Jamal.''\n  I have to say I agree the justice system failed, but the justice \nsystem failed Danny Faulkner, not Mumia Abu-Jamal.\n  Now we are faced with a situation where an individual who was \ndirectly responsible for some of these terrible injustices that have \nbeen done in the wake of Danny Faulkner's murder has been nominated to \na high-ranking position in the Justice Department. The Civil Rights \nDivision is an extremely important division in the Justice Department. \nThe head of this division plays a very important role. And what is his \nresponsibility? According to the division's Web site, the Civil Rights \nDivision ``fulfills a critical mission in upholding the civil and \nconstitutional rights of all individuals.'' Of course, this requires \nthat the head of the Civil Rights Division have an absolute commitment \nto truth and to justice.\n  I do not believe Mr. Adegbile's nomination is consistent with the \ngoal of promoting truth and justice in America. I do not believe Mr. \nAdegbile's nomination is consistent with respect for America's legal \nsystem and rule of law. I do not believe Mr. Adegbile's nomination is \nconsistent with justice for the family of Officer Danny Faulkner or for \nanyone else who cares about the law enforcement community across this \ncountry. For these reasons, I will oppose Mr. Adegbile's nomination to \nhead the Civil Rights Division, and I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/12/senate-section/article/S919-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Yesterday President Obama was asked about the \nadministration's latest ObamaCare delay. Instead of finally explaining \nto the American people why he believes certain employers would get \nObamaCare exemptions while the middle class should not, he just doubled \ndown again on the same old talking points. It is truly disappointing.\n  I wish he would finally agree to work with Republicans on a way to \nreplace ObamaCare with bipartisan reforms that could help the middle \nclass and those who are hurting the most because this much is now \nperfectly clear: ObamaCare is not working the way the administration \npromised. It is hurting the middle class, it is eliminating incentives \nto work in the middle of a jobs crisis, and it will lower overall \ncompensation--things such as salaries, wages, and benefits for the \nAmerican people--with those who earn the least potentially the most \nnegatively impacted of all.\n  ObamaCare is a law that is not fair, and this is essentially true for \nmany of those it purports to help. For all the disruption and pain, it \nis a law that will still leave 31 million Americans uninsured at the \nend of the day. That is why it is not surprising when we hear that \nnearly 90 percent--9 out of 10--of the new enrollees in ObamaCare \nexchange plans are actually folks who were already insured, many of \nthem simply shifting from plans they liked to more expensive plans the \ngovernment thinks they should have. This leads so many Americans to \nask: What was the point? What was the point of ObamaCare?\n  For months the folks in my State have watched the administration hand \nout exemption after exemption to its friends and waiver after waiver to \nthe politically connected. They are left to think, how is that fair? \nMore than one-quarter of a million Kentuckians received notice last \nyear that their health insurance plans would be canceled because of \nObamaCare. Kentuckians lost plans they liked and wanted to keep. Many \nrealized that they wouldn't be able to afford new coverage or that new \nplans wouldn't cover the doctors and hospitals they have come to know \nand trust or that massively increased premiums and deductibles would \nradically alter the ways they lived and worked.\n  So while I am sure the folks who conceived the law meant well, this \nmuch seems perfectly clear by now: Trying to run folks' lives from \nhundreds of miles away is not the way to help. It is often the way to \nmake things worse.\n  Kentuckians are capable of making the decisions that worked best for \nthem, for their own medical needs and financial situations. I am sure \nthere is some think-tank report that might disagree. I know there is no \nend to well-\n\n[[Page S920]]\n\npaid Washington bureaucrats with ``better ideas,'' but people do not \nwant Washington's enlightened judgment ruling over their lies.\n  ObamaCare is what you get when you put decisions that belong in the \nhands of the middle class in the hands of the government class. You get \n2,700 pages of law that lead to 20,000 pages of rules and regulations. \nYou get a Web site that doesn't work as a symbol of a law that won't \nwork. You get a maze of bureaucracies and government contractors with \nindecipherable acronyms--CMS, CCIIO, CGI, QSSI--that seem to exist to \nobscure accountability when things go wrong. You get decisions that are \nbased upon the needs of a political calendar rather than what it will \ntake to get the job done.\n  Worst of all, we hear stories from Kentuckians such as this one from \na woman who was about to lose her plan and was shopping on the \nexchange. She said:\n\n       I can't afford the options that have been made available to \n     me. I make too much money to qualify for any ``help'' from \n     the ACA but I don't make enough to afford paying double what \n     my premium is now. To get a plan that is ``comparable'' to \n     what I have now, I will have to pay about $12,000 a year \n     in premiums alone.\n\n  You hear stories like the one Rebecca Stuart recently shared with \nPresident Obama himself. She told the President that she had to change \nhealth insurance plans even though she liked her old plan--and that she \nwas having ``a panicked experience'' trying to get consistent answers \nabout whether her 10-year-old son would continue being able to see his \nspecialist under ObamaCare.\n  This isn't right. I know the President can't be unmoved by these \nstories, so I am calling on President Obama to move to the center. I am \nsaying it is time to start over on health care--to replace ObamaCare \nwith real bipartisan reforms that can actually help the people who need \nit, because a plan such as ObamaCare that costs this much, that hurts \nthis many Americans, and that still fails to achieve its principal goal \nat the end of the day just won't work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about a bill I \nhave introduced. This is a bill that is about protecting our kids in \nschools. As the father of three young kids, I share the feeling I \nsuspect every parent has: There is no higher priority than making sure \nour children are safe. We can't personally provide that security all \nday everywhere at all times, and so we want to make sure the places our \nkids go are as safe as they can be. Our kids obviously spend a great \ndeal of time at school, and so we want our schools to be the safest \nenvironment they can be. And it turns out there is more we can do.\n  I have a bill--it is a bill I have introduced with Senator Joe \nManchin of West Virginia--a bipartisan bill that is going to help \nprovide greater security for kids in our schools. My immediate \ninspiration for introducing this bill came from a tragic story that \noriginated in Pennsylvania. It is a story that begins at a school in \nDelaware County. One of the schoolteachers, it turns out, had molested \nseveral boys and had raped one. The prosecutors never felt they had \nenough evidence to actually mount a case against him, but the school \nknew what had happened so they dismissed the teacher. But unbelievably, \nto me, although they dismissed him, they also gave him a letter of \nrecommendation he could take with him as he applied--where do you \nthink--to other schools. Because that is what these predators do--they \nlook to be in an environment where they can find more victims. That is \nexactly what this guy did, and he managed to get another teaching job \nin West Virginia.\n  This episode ends in 1997, when that teacher--who by then was a \nschool principal--raped and murdered a 12-year-old boy named Jeremy \nBell. So justice has caught up with that teacher. He has since been \napprehended, charged, tried, and convicted, and he is now serving a \njail sentence for murder. But that was all too late for Jeremy Bell.\n  Unfortunately, Jeremy Bell's story is not unique. I was at a YMCA in \nChester County, PA, a few weeks ago. Our district attorney there, Tom \nHogan--the district attorney for Chester County--told me a very \ndisturbing story. They are doing an investigation of the Coatesville \nSchool District for alleged financial mismanagement. That is what the \ninvestigation was about. But in the course of the investigation, they \ndiscovered there are numerous school employees who are felons.\n  He couldn't reveal many details because it is an ongoing \ninvestigation even now, but he was able to share one story. It is a \nstory of a Victor Ford, who was an employee. He had been convicted \nthree times for felony drug dealing. In 2009 he was hired as a special \neducation classroom aide and a seventh grade boys basketball coach. In \n2010 he raped a young girl--not at this school. Later, he resigned from \nthe school and has since pled guilty to corruption of minors.\n  This is appalling, and it is so completely unacceptable anywhere in \nAmerica. So I have introduced a bill that has broad bipartisan support. \nIn fact, it is a bill that has passed the House unanimously. This \nshould not be controversial.\n  This bill would insist that schools conduct proper criminal \nbackground checks for both existing and prospective employees and that \nthese background checks be repeated periodically. There are five States \nthat don't require any check at all, according to a GAO report, and my \nState of Pennsylvania requires it only for new hires but never relooks \nat people who may have been working for the school for many years.\n  This bill also requires the background check for a criminal history \nbe done for any employee who is going to come into contact with kids, \nso not just teachers. It could be a coach, a contractor, or anybody who \nis going to interact with children. There are 12 States that have no \nsuch provisions.\n  The bill would also require a more thorough background check. Some \nStates check their own State's database for criminal activity but they \ndo not look at the FBI's database or a national record of criminality. \nOur bill would require that.\n  The bill would forbid knowingly passing on a letter of recommendation \nto a predator. It is shocking that even has to be contemplated, but it \nhas occurred. Sometimes there is this feeling of, well, let's just make \nthe problem someone else's problem. So it does happen, but it is \noutrageous and appalling, and it needs to be forbidden. Our bill would \ndo that.\n  The bill would preclude the possibility of hiring people ever \nconvicted of a violent sexual crime against a child, whether that is a \nmisdemeanor or a felony and a number of other violent felonies, \nincluding homicide, child abuse, neglect, crimes against children, \nincluding pornography and other serious crimes, and other felonies if \nthey have been committed within the previous 5 years.\n  The enforcement mechanism basically is to withhold Federal funding \nfor schools in States that refuse to do an appropriate check to make \nsure our kids are safe. This is just common sense and it has broad \nbipartisan support.\n  Again, I thank Senator Joe Manchin for being my cosponsor on this \nlegislation. It is called the Protecting Students from Sexual and \nViolent Predators Act. It is S. 1596. Again, it passed the House \nunanimously. But this is more than just a piece of legislation. This is \na moral imperative. This is something we know we can do to make our \nschools safer for our kids, and I think we should do just that.\n  I am engaged in discussions with some of my colleagues. I hope this \nwill not be controversial and that we will soon get to the point where \nwe can pass this by unanimous consent or hotline this so we get this \ndone. As I said, it has already passed the House. As soon as we pass \nthis bill, it will go to the President and it will be signed into law. \nI hope my colleagues will join me in this effort and we will be able to \nget it done soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp).

Madam President, I rise today to speak again about the\n\n[[Page S921]]\n\nPresident's health care bill--ObamaCare. Monday of this week was \nanother milestone for ObamaCare. It marked yet another admission by the \nPresident that the health care law is unworkable as written.\n  So what happened? On Monday, unilaterally, the administration decided \nto delay the employer mandate for 1 year once again. This time around \nthe delay is for employers with 50 to 99 employees. It is amazing to \nme, and it is completely contradictory, that one day the President is \nbehind the podium talking about how great this law is and the next day \nhe is erasing the very text he supports.\n  The administration had nearly 4 years to implement the major \nprovisions of the law, yet the President finds it necessary to \nliterally rewrite the law with delay after delay after delay. On one \nhand, I am pleased the President recognizes the grievous harm being \ndone by this legislation. I appreciate that he recognizes the harm is \ntoo great to leave it in place. But all he is doing is delaying the \npain until after the elections, which is unfair to American families.\n  The truth is further delays don't solve the problem; they extend the \npain. Reports certainly indicate we have only seen the tip of this \niceberg.\n  Last week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office dealt yet \nanother blow to ObamaCare. The CBO estimates there will be about 2\\1/2\\ \nmillion fewer full-time workers in 10 years than if this law had not \npassed. These new figures are nearly three times greater than the CBO's \nalready dismal analysis back in the day when the law was being debated \nbefore its passage.\n  I found it remarkable back when we were debating this law--when \nunemployment was hovering around 10 percent--that any of my colleagues \nwould support any bill that would cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. \nNow we are learning the truth and it is even worse. It is three times \nas bad. CBO says the law's subsidies and taxes reduce incentives to \nwork. Is that what this Congress should be about? And their report \nasserts the cost of the employer mandate penalty will be passed on to \nworkers in the form of lower wages or other compensation.\n  A number of Nebraskans have reached out to me. An individual from \neastern Nebraska shared this:\n\n       I work part time and I have had my hours cut from 30 to 28 \n     hours due to ObamaCare last April. My employer implemented it \n     early to be sure I did not exceed 30 hours in the year 2013. \n     Even with the delay in the mandate, they have stuck to the 28 \n     hours for part time help. The loss to me is about $150 a \n     month and it sure has hurt our budget. My employer's hands \n     are tied as they would have to pay health care for employees \n     with 30 hours or more or pay a fine if not offering health \n     care. This ObamaCare is a job killer. I keep hoping I will \n     wake up and this will all have been a bad dream.\n\n  Another Nebraskan from the northeast corner of the State wrote to me \nand said:\n\n       My wife just left my office in tears. She worked for the \n     city for over 10 years. She is, or rather was, a 34 hour a \n     week employee who was informed that she is having her hours \n     cut back to 29 as a result of the Affordable Care Act. To \n     many those 5 hours per week may not seem like much but to our \n     family it will result in a huge loss. We currently have 3 \n     children, including one daughter who is a senior getting \n     ready to graduate and go to college. As a family we pretty \n     much live ``hand to mouth'' with our income and this \n     reduction in hours, which I'm sure seems ``minor'' to a lot \n     of folks, is a huge blow to my family. The thing that pains \n     me most is the impact it is going to have on our daughter's \n     decision about college, that one thing alone is so unfair. \n     She should not, on the cusp of choosing her path in life, \n     have to be put in the position--over 5 hours of work--of \n     delaying or altering her life plans. In a world where we tend \n     to be futurists--always talking about the importance of \n     education and the next generation being the future--it just \n     doesn't seem right that I have to look my daughter in the \n     eyes tonight and have a discussion about how 5 hours may \n     alter her future.\n\n  These are heartbreaking stories about Americans who want to work but \ntheir government has gotten in their way. We are seeing smaller \npaychecks and 2.5 million fewer full-time equivalent jobs.\n  We all remember this law's primary marketing pitch was that it would \nprovide coverage for tens of millions of uninsured Americans, but CBO \nnow estimates 31 million Americans will likely be without health \ninsurance in 2024--roughly 1 of 9 Americans--and 6 to 7 million \nAmericans won't get coverage through their employers who otherwise \nwould have. This is according to CBO.\n  Let me say that again. Six million to 7 million fewer Americans will \nnot get health insurance from their employer under ObamaCare compared \nto no bill at all.\n  So ObamaCare has been counterproductive, to say the least. It is \nhardly a good return on investment, considering this law cost over $2 \ntrillion and raised taxes by about $1 trillion.\n  I appreciate and support goals to help our most vulnerable Americans \nreceive access to health care, and I support reforms which will \nincrease competition and lower costs, such as expanding health savings \naccounts and not reducing them. I appreciate the opportunity to work on \nreforms which allow insurers to compete across State lines and allowing \nsmall businesses to pool together to create a broader pool to be \ninsured at lower rates. These solutions would produce results.\n  But a 2,700-page bill packed full of perverse incentives and negative \nconsequences which hurt workers, increase taxes, and costs trillions is \nnot what Americans want. That is why I am committed to shielding \nAmericans from the harmful effects of ObamaCare. We must repeal this \nlaw and build on the alternative solutions which have been proposed by \nRepublicans to help our American families.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, what has made America strong is we have \nprovided opportunities for individuals to develop their talents. \nPrevious generations of Americans have recognized this, and invested in \nhigher education accordingly.\n  During President Lincoln's time, the Federal Government invested in \nestablishing a system of public colleges throughout the Nation. After \nWorld War II, we opened the doors of postsecondary education to our \nreturning veterans under the GI bill. As part of the War on Poverty, we \nenacted the Higher Education Act with the idea that no American should \nbe denied the ability to go to college because their family lacked the \nability to pay for college.\n  Senator Pell, my predecessor, with the creation of the Basic \nEducational Opportunity Grant--later named the Pell grant in his \nhonor--made the promise of a college education real for millions of \nAmericans.\n  As part of the student aid programs, we invested in offering low-cost \nloans to create opportunity, spur innovation, and grow our economy. Our \nstudent loan programs were originally seen as an investment, not a \nprofit center or even a cost-neutral proposition.\n  Today, our student aid investment aid has been stood on its head. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates we will be generating revenue \nfrom student loans through 2024. Student loan debt has become a serious \nthreat to our ladder of opportunity--our pathway to progress for this \ngeneration.\n  That is what brings me and my colleagues to the floor today. We must \nturn the tide because too many students are drowning in debt, and it \nhas threatened to hold back a new generation of young Americans just \nwhen\n\n[[Page S922]]\n\nthey would be forming a household, buying cars or starting a business.\n  As student loan repayment plans stretch out over 20 years or more, \nthis generation will still be paying off student loans when it comes \ntime to send their own children to college and perhaps while also \ntaking care of their parents in their senior years.\n  The bottom line is we know borrowers are struggling. We know the \ngovernment could play a more constructive role in helping them and \nenacting reforms to increase fairness and transparency in this process.\n  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently reported that \ndelinquency rates on student loan debt are increasing even as we see \ndecreases in delinquency rates for other types of household debt.\n  The cohort default rates for student loans have been increasing. For \nborrowers who entered repayment in 2010, 14.7 percent had defaulted by \n2013, up from 13.4 percent for those who began repayments in 2009. It \nis essential borrowers know about their repayment options. That is why \nSenator Durbin's Student Loan Borrower Bill of Rights Act is so \nimportant and why I am proud to be a cosponsor of his legislation.\n  But changing the trend of growing debt and rising defaults is more \nthan a student loan servicing issue. We have to provide a real avenue \nto allow individuals straining under the weight of the estimated $1.2 \ntrillion in student loan debt--many with loans carrying an interest \nrate of 6.8 percent or higher--an opportunity to refinance those loans \nat a lower interest rate. The GAO just reported that on loans made \nbetween 2007 and 2012, the Federal Government is estimated to make $66 \nbillion. Clearly, borrowers are paying more than they should, and we \nhave to address these college costs.\n  But we also have to deal with the issue of giving colleges and \nuniversities their incentive, their skin in the game, to ensure they \ncarefully review their students' loans; that they direct students to \nthe lowest cost and the lowest possible amount of loans; that they do \nthis in a way which will make them truly responsible and conscious of \nthe debt which is accumulated by students. I have been working on \nlegislation to require that.\n  So I commend Senators Durbin, Warren, and others for what they are \ndoing to deal with this issue.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor for my other colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I thank Senators Durbin and Reed for \ntheir extraordinary leadership on this important issue. I also rise \ntoday to talk about the crushing burden which student debt places on \nour college students and on our economy, and I call on Congress to \naddress it.\n  The core facts are well known to every family in America. In recent \ndecades, college costs have skyrocketed. Adjusted for inflation, a \nyoung person today pays 300 percent of what their parents paid just 30 \nyears ago. For millions of young people, the only way to cover this \ntuition cost is to take on huge debt. The average student loan balance \namong 25-year-olds who borrow has grown by 91 percent in just 10 years. \nTotal outstanding student loan debt stands at a staggering $1.2 \ntrillion, and it is getting bigger every single day.\n  The problem is made worse by the Federal student loan program, with \nhigh interest rates which will produce obscene profits for the \ngovernment. The GAO recently projected the government will bring in $66 \nbillion in profits on its Federal student loans made between 2007 and \n2012--profits which would make a Fortune 500 CEO proud.\n  This exploding debt is crushing our young people. More than one third \nof borrowers under the age of 30 have been delinquent for more than 90 \ndays.\n  This exploding debt is also dragging down our economy. With monthly \nloan bills which can easily exceed a mortgage payment, it is no \nsurprise that home ownership among 30-year-olds has declined steeply. \nLast spring the Federal Reserve raised concerns that rising student \ndebt could threaten our overall economic growth.\n  Tying students to a lifetime of financial servitude as a condition of \ngetting an education does not reflect our values. These students didn't \ngo to the mall and run up charges on a credit card. They worked hard, \nand they learned new skills which will benefit this country, help us \nbuild a stronger middle class, and help us build a stronger America. \nThey deserve our support. They don't deserve to be buried in debt.\n  To reverse this trend of student borrowing, we need to bring down the \ncost of college. That will not be easy, and it will require everyone--\nthe government, higher education institutions, and the students \nthemselves--to do far more than they do now.\n  I am committed to working with Chairman Harkin and my colleagues on \nthe Senate HELP Committee to find ways to meaningfully reduce college \ntuition, and I am working closely with many of my colleagues, including \nSenators Durbin, Reed, Schumer, Gillibrand, Murphy, and Brown, who are \nall intensely focused on this issue.\n  But our need to reduce the cost of college must not blind us to the \nurgency of addressing the massive debt already crushing our young \npeople. The pressure is building, and we must act to provide real \nrelief to our students and young graduates now.\n  In the coming weeks I will join with my colleagues to introduce \nlegislation to do just that--legislation which will allow eligible \nborrowers with high-interest loans to refinance at interest rates which \nare at least as low as those currently being offered to new borrowers \nin the Federal student loan program.\n  The idea is pretty simple. When interest rates are low, homeowners \ncan refinance their mortgages and big corporations can swap more \nexpensive debt for cheaper debt. Even State and local governments have \nrefinanced their debts. But a graduate who took out an unsubsidized \nloan before July 1 of this year is locked into an interest rate of \nnearly 7 percent. Older loans run 8 percent, 9 percent, and even more.\n  Last year Congress agreed those interest rates were much too high, so \nthey lowered them significantly for this year's borrowers. But that \nchange does nothing for the millions who are trapped under the old \nhigh-interest-rate loans. Refinancing those old loans would lower \ninterest rates to 3.8 percent for undergraduate loans. The savings \nwould vary, of course. For a recent graduate who borrowed the maximum, \npayments would drop by as much as $1,000 a year, and total interest \ncould be cut nearly in half. For those who have even older loans, those \nwith graduate school loans, and those with loans from private lenders, \nthe savings would be even higher.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I agree with my colleague from \nMassachusetts. She said it exactly right, as will the other Senators \nwho are going to speak on this issue today. I urge Congress to work \nimmediately to tackle the mountain of student debt which is crippling \nthe lives of young people and weighing down an entire generation.\n  The Federal Student Loan Refinancing Act, which I wrote to address \nthe growing economic burden facing our graduates and their families, \nbasically affords a graduate the same right to refinance their loans as \nalready provided to homeowners, corporations, and even governments. \nThis legislation would lower interest rates on refinancing student \nloans to 4 percent, saving borrowers thousands of dollars which would \notherwise be spent purchasing a home or a car or even starting a new \nbusiness.\n  In New York State and across the Nation, we are facing a student loan \ndebt crisis. Student loan debt is at $1.2 trillion nationwide. \nAmericans now owe more on their student loans than they do on their \ncredit cards or car loans, holding back our economy and our economy's \ngrowth. Tens of millions of young people who graduated college and are \nsecuring their first job are not starting their careers on even ground. \nThey are starting them under water, and they have a hard time staying \nafloat when juggling all their bills.\n  A New York student who borrows to pay for college now graduates with \nan\n\n[[Page S923]]\n\naverage of more than $27,000 in student loan debt, according to the \nFederal Reserve Bank of New York. When someone owes upwards of $30,000 \nin debt before even earning the first paycheck, it is no wonder young \npeople are falling further behind on their payments.\n  Providing graduates with the ability to refinance their student \ndebt--Federal loans particularly--would lead to the personal savings of \n$14.5 billion nationwide in the first year alone, according to the \nCenter for American Progress report. A higher education remains the \nclearest path to our middle class. When we price young people out of \ncollege, we all pay the price. Keeping a high-quality education in New \nYork affordable is simply the right thing to do. That is why \nrefinancing Federal student loans should be one of Congress's top \npriorities for college students.\n\n  The magnitude of the problem requires leadership and the solution is \nright in front of us. Now is the time to act. Our Nation's students, \ngraduates, and families cannot afford further delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank my colleagues Senator Jack Reed \nof Rhode Island, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Senator \nKirsten Gillibrand of New York for joining us on the floor this morning \nto talk about the student debt crisis and college affordability.\n  I don't think this is just another issue. I think this is a defining \nissue. Imagine, if you will, what has happened to America since we have \ncalled into question the intrinsic value of owning a home. That used to \nbe built into our culture, the notion that if you could get beyond the \nrental stage and actually buy a home was a smart and good investment in \nterms of your neighborhood, your community, and your State.\n  The mortgage crisis that we went through was a shock to many people. \nThey paid too much for their homes. They found themselves facing \nforeclosure and short sales, and the basic premise has been challenged. \nThere is more rental property now. People are hedging their bets on the \nissue of home ownership.\n  Now take one of the other pillars of our basic American values, and \nthat pillar is: You will never go wrong with more education. I learned \nthat at an early age, and luckily my mom and dad--with limited \neducational experience on their own part--pushed me forward into \ncollege and into law school and to finish. They believed that at the \nend of the day, I would be better off. Of course, statistics bear that \nout.\n  Now comes the new challenge. The increasing cost of higher education \nhas driven many families and students deeply into debt. In many cases, \nit is impossible for them to pay back their debt.\n  Senator Reed says it is transformative. There are young people who \nhave literally had their lives dramatically changed because of debt. \nThe basic premise is called into question: Is higher education worth \nthe money? I didn't think I would ever see that as a legitimate topic \nfor debate in America, but it turned out to be a cover on Time \nmagazine.\n  This is not just a matter of the pundits and politicians talking \nabout it. Average people, working families are talking about it. That \nis why we are coming to the floor. We hope to expand our numbers more \nand more, and I hope some of the Republicans will join in this \nconversation about what to do when it comes to student debt and the \ncrisis it is creating.\n  Millions of Americans pursue a college education hoping they will \nrealize the American dream, but as college tuition, textbooks, and fees \nskyrocket students are paying more and more for education and taking on \ngreater debt to pay for it. Sixty-eight percent of the class of 2012 \ngraduated with some debt. For those students the average debt was \n$27,850 a year. For students who attended for-profit schools, the \naverage debt was close to $40,000, which deserves a special part of \nthis topic of conversation when we talk about the cost of higher \neducation.\n  Americans now collectively hold more than $1.2 trillion in student \ndebt--more than Americans hold in credit card debt. This has surpassed \ncredit card debt in America. It goes way beyond higher education. It \ngoes into a question about personal credit, chances for mobility, and \nthe future of students who sign for these bone-crushing debt loans.\n  In his recent State of the Union Address, President Obama said he \nwants to work with Congress to see how we can help Americans who feel \ntrapped by this crushing debt. Several of us are stepping forward and \naccepting the President's challenge. I hope more Members will do so as \nwell.\n  Late last year Senators Reed, Warren, Boxer, and myself introduced \nthe student loan borrower bill of rights to spell out in basic terms \nthe rights of student borrowers and their families in interacting with \nFederal and private lenders, loan servicers, and schools. It is amazing \nto me that when it comes to mortgage debt there are laws dictating what \nyou need to be told. When it comes to student debt, there are not \nnearly the protections. Younger people who are making these life-\nchanging decisions about debt deserve to know everything they face and \nwhat they are getting into.\n  I met a young woman in Chicago recently named Hannah Moore. She \nthought she did the right thing. She started off her higher education \nby going to community college. She was told that was affordable and \nclose to home. Do that first. She did it and then she made a fatal \nerror.\n  After 2 years at a community college, she enrolled at the Harrington \nCollege of Design in Chicago. If you go to their Web site, you will be \ndazzled with the beauty of this school, the faculty, and all the \nopportunities. Hannah Moore was dazzled, but this for-profit school \nended up becoming a debt pit for her life.\n  After she had exhausted all of her Federal loans and started taking \nout private loans at the Harrington College of Design, she graduated \nwith a debt of $124,000, and she could not find a job. At one point she \nwas working three part-time jobs to pay $800 a month on this debt from \nthis for-profit school.\n  Her Federal loan payments are manageable because the Federal program \nat least allows her to make payments based on income, but the private \nloans this school lured her into--thanks to interest and fees--now \namount to $110,000. Her servicer on these loans refuses to work with \nher to find repayment alternatives. She sinks deeper and deeper every \nday into debt.\n  This poor young woman thought she was doing the right thing by going \nto school. Today she is so deeply in debt she can't even dream of \nbuying a house or a car. Her father had to come out of retirement to \nhelp her pay off the loans at this for-profit school, the Harrington \nCollege of Design.\n  Unfortunately, she wasn't protected with the bill of rights, which I \nhave introduced and is being cosponsored by my colleagues who have \nspoken today, which would have told her don't apply for a private loan \nuntil you have exhausted your government loans.\n  Government loans have lower interest rates and are more manageable. \nGovernment loans can be consolidated and in some cases forgiven, \ndepending on the job you take. She was not told that. She was lured \ninto a debt trap by a school that just wanted to rake in Federal \ndollars at her expense. This is going to standardize policies, such as \nhow payments are applied to principal and interest so borrowers benefit \ninstead of banks.\n  Under the current situation, many students paying back their loans \nfind that the money is going to the higher interest loans and not to \nthe lower interest loans; it is not being transferred to their benefit.\n  The bill requires servicers to have a servicemember and veteran \nliaison. Veterans are often victims of these notorious for-profit \nschools and other lenders. We also require students to be told of all \nof their options, including Federal loans which have better terms and \nrepayments. Students often have no other choice but to take out loans \nto pay for their college education, but this bill says borrowing money \nfor college doesn't mean you give up your power over your money and \nyour debt.\n  I also want to mention something most people don't know. In \nbankruptcy court in America today there are only a handful of debts \nthat cannot be discharged in bankruptcy court: taxes, child support, \nalimony, and government and student loans.\n\n[[Page S924]]\n\n  A few years ago, the for-profit industry and private loan industry \nengineered into these bankruptcy discharge laws protection for their \nown debt. What does it mean? It means if you go to a for-profit school \nand take out a private loan, you are literally burdened with that for a \nlifetime. The grounds for discharging a student loan debt are some of \nthe strictest and toughest in America. Students who sign up for this \ndebt ought to know they are in it until it is paid and that can mean \nfor a lifetime.\n  The Wall Street Journal reported some time ago on a grandmother \ncosigning a student loan for her granddaughter. The granddaughter \ndefaulted, and the lender decided to levy on the grandmother's Social \nSecurity payments. That is how outrageous this has become. Sadly, these \nstudents don't realize when they sign on the dotted line at ages 19, \n20, and 21, they are signing on for a debt that can trail them for a \nlifetime.\n  That has to change. We have to follow Senator Reed's lead. Senator \nJack Reed has said: These colleges have to have some skin in the game. \nIf they are going to lure students into student loans well beyond their \nability to repay, let that college and university bear some of the \nresponsibility for repayment too. I think that is only reasonable.\n  I thank my colleagues for bringing forth this issue. I thank Senator \nWarren. Her partnership in this effort is especially important. Because \nof her background in law and finance she is an important part of this \nconversation.\n  We are not going to end with this speech on the floor today by each \nof us. Once a week we are going to continue to bring together those in \nour caucus--and I hope in the Republican caucus--who believe we have to \naddress the student debt crisis and come up with a reasonable way for \nstudents to pay for an education that is reasonably priced.\n  To have these students burdened with the student loan debtor prison \nis unacceptable in America today. It is time for us, as a Congress, to \naddress this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I would like to speak for another minute \nabout the issue of refinancing student loans. This is real money back \nin the pockets of people who invested in their education; real money \nwill help young people find a little more financial stability as they \nwork hard to build their futures, real money that says America invests \nin those who get an education.\n  We don't need to add a single dime to our deficit to pay for this \nplan. Right now this country essentially taxes students by charging \nhigh interest rates that bring money into the government while at the \nsame time we give away far more money through a Tax Code riddled with \nloopholes and let the wealthiest individuals and corporations avoid \npaying a fair share. We can close those loopholes and put the money \ndirectly into refinancing student loans.\n  We can start with the Buffett rule, a rule that would limit tax \nloopholes for the wealthy and ensure that billionaires pay at least as \nmuch as their secretaries. For every new dollar we bring in by \nstitching this loophole, it can go directly into reducing the cost of \nstudent loans for our students. Dollar for dollar we can invest in \nbillionaires or we can invest in our students. This is about \nopportunity.\n  Our country should offer a helping hand to young people who are \nworking hard to try to build a future, not a handout to billionaires \nwho have already made it. Refinancing student loans will not fix \neverything that is broken in the higher education system, but it is a \nhuge step forward.\n  I was the first person in my family to graduate from college. I went \nto a commuter college where the tuition was $50 a semester. I went to a \npublic law school where I got a great education. I was able to do that \nbecause I grew up in a country that chose investing in kids over \ninvesting in billionaires. I believe in that America, and I believe in \nwhat we can do when we work together to build opportunities for \neveryone who busted their tail to get an education.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, again I compliment my colleagues Senator \nDurbin, Senator Warren, and Senator Gillibrand on their commitment to \nreinvigorating our higher education policy and doing it in an efficient \nand cost-effective way so the future generation of students are not so \nburdened that they cannot essentially rise up, buy a home, start a \nfamily, and do the things that my generation took for granted because \nthere was strong support for higher education at every level of \ngovernment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/12/senate-section/article/S924-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S924-S925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, before I leave the floor, I wish to turn \nto another key issue that requires urgent action; that is, the renewal \nof unemployment benefits for millions of people. It has now been 46 \ndays since unemployment insurance expired for many job seekers. Today \ntheir ranks have swollen to about 1.8 million Americans, including \n20,000 veterans who have lost their emergency unemployment insurance \nbenefits.\n  Getting Americans back to work and accelerating job growth should be \nCongress's top priority--our No. 1 job. We all understand the answer to \nthis is having a situation where there are not three applicants for \neach job, but there is a good job for each applicant, and we have more \nto do.\n  In the meantime we have to address the crisis for these families who \nhave worked hard all of their lives. They only qualify for unemployment \ninsurance if they lost a job through no fault of their own and are \nlooking for work. But in that search, it is difficult. And it is \ncertainly difficult to get by, pay the rent, put gas in the car, keep a \ncell phone operating, to take a call from a potential employer when we \ncut off the modest benefits of roughly $350 a week.\n\n  Doing this has historically been a bipartisan endeavor. We have all \nrecognized in our communities, regardless of where they are located in \nthis country, people who have worked hard, who are struggling and need \nassistance to make the transition from unemployment back to \nreemployment. I am particularly troubled today by the way some people \nare commenting about the unemployed, suggesting they don't have the \nbackbone, the character to work; that this is a great deal for them, \ngetting $300 a week. When, in fact, one of the obvious points, to me, \nat least, of this crisis of unemployment is it is not just young, \nentry-level workers; too often, it is middle-aged individuals who have \ndone extremely well in their lives and now, for the first time, are \ncoming into unemployment situations because of technology, because of \nchanges in the workforce. They are good people, and they deserve our \nsupport. But, instead, they are being mischaracterized, dismissed, and \nignored--perhaps the most dangerous aspect of this attitude.\n  We were only one Republican vote short of breaking a filibuster that \nwould allow us, at least temporarily, to help out these people. I thank \nall of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have worked very \nconscientiously, consistently, and thoughtfully on this critical \nmatter. If one more of our colleagues can recognize the need to do \nthis, then we can do it, and we should do it.\n  We are, I believe, on the verge of addressing the issue of military \nCOLA reductions. That is something important we have to do, but let me \npoint out, that does not go into effect until December 2015. There is \nno veteran who has lost his or her COLA yet, but there are 1.8 million \nAmericans, and growing, who have already lost their extended \nunemployment insurance benefits. So the immediacy of this problem is \ncompelling, and we have to deal with it.\n  We have never turned our back when long-term unemployment was so \nsignificant. We have always stood up and said, we will help you. We \nhave also been willing to make changes to the program. In fact, in \n2012, I was part of a conference committee that made significant \nreforms in the unemployment system. One reform was to cut back the \nweeks from 99 to 73. We provided to States the ability to have \ninnovative programs in terms of putting people in jobs, in terms of \nmaking sure a job search was being thoroughly conducted by recipients. \nThese reforms have been made. What we have asked for is a short \nextension of the program, and I think that is what we should be asking \nfor at this juncture. But as we progress and as we get close to the \npoint where\n\n[[Page S925]]\n\nthe 3 months has expired, I think we have to think more about what are \nwe going to do in the long run, because we are still going to have \nmillions of people who do not have work.\n  We have, I think--and it has been demonstrated by these folks--\nMembers on both sides who want to get this done. We need one more vote \nto procedurally move forward. I hope we can get that vote.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of our time. I believe, under \nthe prevailing UC, that we will now go into executive session.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you.

Madam President, in the Budget Committee yesterday, on \nwhich I am the ranking Republican, Director Elmendorf of the \nCongressional Budget Office gave us the report and his projections for \nnext year and what the consequences and financial situation will be for \nour country as he projects it. When I asked him about his projections \nfor economic growth, he acknowledged they have been way too high over \nthe last several years, and that has been disappointing. Our growth has \nnot reached the level we want to it reach. He projects now a lower \ngrowth rate than he had been projecting for the next 10 years.\n  Let me share with my colleagues, as we vote on these matters on which \nwe want to help veterans and we want to help the unemployed--and we can \ndo that but we have to remember who we are, what we are doing, and how \nwe got here. We virtually doubled the deficit in the last 10 years in \nthe United States of America--added to the total debt of the United \nStates of America. Deficits are going down over the last couple of \nyears, and will for 1 more year, according to Mr. Elmendorf, but then \nwill begin an inexorable rise to nearly a $1 trillion deficit at the \nend of 10 years from today. The interest we paid--and he testified to \nthis; it is in his report--the interest we paid last year on the total \ndebt of the United States, even with the extraordinarily low interest \nrates, was $230 billion--an amazing amount of money.\n  We have a group testifying right now about the highway bill. They \nwould like to see more money spent on our infrastructure and highways. \nFrom the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Donohue, and Mr. Trump, to the top \nunion leader, they all agree we need to spend more on highways.\n  Last year, the interest we paid on the debt, according to Dr. \nElmendorf, was $230 billion. That is a stunning figure. It is half the \ntotal of the budget for the Defense Department. But let me tell my \ncolleagues what he said that is most troubling. Projecting a modest \nincrease in interest rates over the next 10 years and the increased \ndeficits we will see, Mr. Elmendorf predicted last year that 10 years \nfrom now, the 1-year interest payment will be $830 billion.\n  We are having a dispute to try to get--not cut--the veterans \nretirement, and we should not cut veterans retirement, the way this was \ndone. It would cost $6 billion over 10 years. Do we see the difference? \nWe are paying $230 billion. If we pay at that rate for 10 years, that \nwould be $2.3 trillion. But we are not going to be paying at $230 \nbillion a year. By the time we get to the tenth year, according to Mr. \nElmendorf, we will be spending $890 billion on the interest on the debt \nwe have accumulated in the United States of America through reckless \nspending, so much of it producing very little benefit for anybody in \nthe long term, and we cannot continue this. He testified that if \ninterest rates go up 1 percent, we will pay $1.5 trillion more on \ninterest over 10 years than if it didn't go up 1 percent. Who knows--he \nacknowledged he is no seer. Interest rates, many people predict right \nnow, would surge dramatically and may go up to some of the levels we \nhad in 1970. If it did, this country would probably be financially \ndestitute.\n  So I have to say we are not playing games here. The money of the \nUnited States needs to be managed by the elected representatives. They \nexpect us to manage our money wisely. They expect us not to put this \ncountry at financial risk, and they have every right. They have a \nresponsibility, actually, as citizens of this country to be angry with \ntheir Congress, to be angry with their President for running up this \nkind of a debt. It is not a good thing.\n  Earlier this year there was deep concern that the Budget Control Act \nthat was passed on a bipartisan basis, signed by President Obama, that \nlimited the growth in spending--didn't cut spending, but over 10 years \nspending would increase $8 trillion--increase $8 trillion instead of \nincreasing $10 trillion. So we ``saved'' $2 trillion. That was deemed \ntoo tough this year. So we had the Ryan-Murray bill that said we are \ngoing to fix some of the tight places, and we are going to avoid \nspending--we are going to put more money in. We are going to spend more \nthan we agreed to, but we are not going to break the total debt \nsituation because we are going to raise taxes some and we are going to \ncut spending some. One of the cuts they came up with, in secret, \nwithout any public hearings or debate, was to cut the veterans \nretirement plan, and it blew up. It meant $70- to $150,000 for retired \nveterans, how much they would lose in their retirement cost of living.\n  I opposed that. They passed it anyway. The Democratic majority here \nblocked proposal after proposal, and one was to more than pay for it by \nreducing fraudulent income tax credit checks being illegally sent out \nto people who don't qualify for it. That was blocked too. So what did \nwe have just a few days ago? We had--we have a bill that saved the \nveterans so they don't have to have their pensions reduced. And how \nwould they pay for this $6 billion in costs? Why, they wouldn't pay for \nit at all. There is no payment whatsoever. Actually, by voting and \nsupporting that provision--the Pryor amendment, cosponsored by a number \nof Democrats--it would increase the spending of the United States above \nthe agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have one \nadditional minute to wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It would have added to the debt of the United States \ndirectly above the agreement we just voted on in Ryan-Murray. It set \nthe cap on how much spending. So less than two months later, we are in \nhere directly having to defend against a proposal that would have \nbroken the spending agreement that was in the Ryan-Murray legislation. \nIt is unthinkable. I can't imagine this would happen. There are so many \nplaces we could pay for this kind of restoration of veterans' \nretirement benefits without raising taxes and without adding to the \ndebt.\n  I guess I am saying I am frustrated about the mindset of this \nCongress. I don't think we are focused on the threat this debt poses to \nAmerica. Dr. Elmendorf told us we are on an unsustainable path and he \nbegan to discuss the danger of a fiscal crisis such as we had in 2007 \nbecause we are in such a red zone, a marginal zone of debt.\n  I see the majority leader and I know he is busy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes for debate equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, it is my hope that we do not have to \nuse 30 minutes. But let me start off by saying I am very pleased we \nhave three highly qualified nominees for posts at the State Department \nthat are critical to America's national security and economic \ndiplomacy. These nominees were voted out favorably by the Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  Ambassador Tina Kaidanow is well qualified to serve as Coordinator \nfor Counterterrorism at the Department of State. In a long career, most \nrecently she served as the Deputy Ambassador at the U.S. Embassy in \nKabul. In Kabul she worked on some of the most difficult and pressing \nterrorism issues the United States faces. She previously served as \nDeputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs.\n  Ambassador Kaidanow has shown the ability to forge the types of \npartnerships necessary to advance the counterterrorism objectives and \nnational security of the United States. I hope all of my colleagues \nwill join me in supporting her nomination.\n  Next is Daniel Bennett Smith, the President's nominee for Assistant \nSecretary of State for Intelligence and Research. This is an incredibly \nimportant position as the State Department thinks about our advocacy \nabroad in terms of foreign policy. Having the best information on \nintelligence and research is critically important, and certainly \nplaying a role as it relates to embassy security across the globe is \nvery important.\n  Ambassador Smith served as the U.S. Ambassador to Greece from 2010 to \n2013. He has been a career officer in the Senior Foreign Service, with \nthe rank of Career Minister. He has served as Executive Secretary of \nthe State Department and as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for \nConsular Affairs and Deputy Executive Secretary.\n  If confirmed, he will advise State Department officials on the many \nintelligence issues the Department faces--issues that are critical to \npolicymakers' decisions as they relate to U.S. foreign policy efforts. \nI urge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  Finally, Catherine Ann Novelli is in a unique opportunity to help us, \nparticularly with our economic diplomacy abroad. With over three \ndecades of experience in the public and private sectors, including at \nsenior levels at Apple and in the Office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, Ms. Novelli has shown a deep personal commitment to \npublic service. She will bring tremendous private sector skills, \nunderstanding of the interagency process, and knowledge of \ninternational economic issues to her role as the most senior economic \nofficial at the State Department and as an Alternate Governor to the \nimportant multilateral development banks that are a big part of our \nefforts abroad.\n  Ms. Novelli's experience at the USTR coordinating trade and \ninvestment policy for Europe, the Middle East, and northern Africa and \nthe leading role she played in many of the most important U.S. trade \nnegotiations of the last 25 years make her an ideal candidate to lead \nthe State Department's engagement in our country's most ambitious trade \nagenda in generations.\n  One thing I find particularly important--as I always advocate \nquestions on international intellectual property rights and other \nelements that are important to the United States, which leads the world \nin innovation--our private sector is facing tougher international \ncompetition. The world's serious environmental threats and a changing \nenergy landscape are also elements of those challenges.\n  We are fortunate to have someone with Ms. Novelli's expertise in \npromoting trade and investment and her intimate knowledge of the \nsupport needed to ensure our private sector remains globally \ncompetitive. She is the right person to oversee the State Department's \nefforts to increase commerce, open markets, and support the rights of \nworkers. I urge my colleagues to support her nomination.\n  These are three very important, critical positions, and I look \nforward to the Senate confirming these individuals.\n  With that, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to yield back all \ntime on both sides, including the 2 minutes prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Vote on Kaidanow Nomination\n\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Tina S. Kaidanow, of the District of Columbia, to be Coordinator for \nCounterterrorism, with the rank and status of Ambassador at Large?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to a vote on \nthe Smith nomination.\n  The Senator from California\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to support the nomination of \nAmbassador Daniel Bennett Smith to be the Assistant Secretary of State \nfor Intelligence and Research.\n  I am not aware of any opposition to this nominee and so look forward \nto a strong vote of confirmation by my colleagues. I am also pleased \nthat the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, known \nas INR, will continue to have strong leadership by a respected senior \nmember of the foreign service.\n  The INR Bureau is a small, but effective entity within the U.S. \nintelligence community. In fact, it only has approximately 200 \nanalysts, but it has a very strong reputation for independent and \nunbiased analysis. Its intelligence professionals include those from \nthe foreign service and the civil service, including many who have \ndecades of experience in the topics they cover.\n  These analysts are prized for the intelligence value they provide to \nsenior State Department officials, to include the Secretary and his \nteam, ambassadors, and the men and women who work the country desks.\n  INR also brings the State Department's knowledge and viewpoint to \ndiscussions and debates within the intelligence community, helping to \nensure that intelligence decisions are informed by diplomatic \nrequirements and information gained by our embassies around the world.\n  In the past several years, INR has perhaps become best known for its \ndissents from some of the main points in the flawed intelligence \nreports that led to the war in Iraq. Unfortunately, those dissents were \nmarginalized in key intelligence products and not provided adequate \nscrutiny. As a result, I can tell my colleagues that members of the \nintelligence committee pay special attention to dissenting voices in \nthe intelligence community, and always to the views of INR.\n  The primary mission of this Bureau is to provide intelligence to \npolicymakers at the State Department. INR is one of the three all-\nsource analytic agencies within the intelligence community, along with \nthe CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency.\n  INR also ensures that intelligence operations and sensitive \nintelligence-related law enforcement activities are consistent with \nU.S. foreign policy. The Assistant Secretary for INR is therefore the \nconduit between the intelligence community and the State Department to \nensure that our intelligence activities and the conduct of our foreign \npolicy are coordinated and aligned.\n  In sum, the Assistant Secretary for INR is both an independent leader \nof an intelligence community agency and the Secretary of State's point \nperson on intelligence matters.\n  Ambassador Smith is well-qualified to be the Assistant Secretary of \nState for Intelligence and Research. He has served for 30 years as a \nForeign Service officer and in a variety of positions at the State \nDepartment. Most recently he was Ambassador to Greece (from 2010 to \n2013).\n  Ambassador Smith has also served as Executive Secretary of the State \nDepartment, Principal Deputy Secretary for Consular Affairs, and in \noverseas posts in Bern, Istanbul, Ottawa, and Stockholm. He is a career \nofficer in the Senior Foreign Service with the rank of Career Minister.\n  The Intelligence Committee approved Ambassador Smith by voice vote on \nJanuary 16, with unanimous support. A month earlier, on December 17, \n2013, the committee held an open hearing on his nomination. After \nAmbassador Smith was voted out of our committee, the Foreign Relations \nCommittee held a hearing on his nomination on January 28.\n  Ambassador Smith has had a long and distinguished career at the State \nDepartment that will serve him well in this position. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the nomination of Ambassador Daniel Bennett Smith \nto be Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS. We yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Shall the Senate advise and consent to the \nnomination of Daniel Bennett Smith, of Virginia, to be an Assistant \nSecretary of State (Intelligence and Research)?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: \nCalendar Nos. 565 and 570; that the nominations be confirmed en bloc; \nthe motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, \nwith no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in \norder to any of the nominations; that any related statements be printed \nin the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object--and I will object--I \nwish to remind my colleagues of a couple important points.\n  First, over the last several weeks some of my colleagues in the \nmajority have expressed frustration because some of the nominees they \nsupport haven't been brought up for a final vote. I must say this is \nquite surprising to me.\n  As everyone knows, late last year the Senate Democrats invoked the \nso-called nuclear option. The stated reason for doing so of course was \nto strip the minority of our ability to stop any judicial or executive \nnominees on the floor. In fact, just before invoking the so-called \nnuclear option, here is what the majority leader said about it:\n\n       The change we propose today would ensure executive and \n     judicial nominations an up or down vote on confirmation--yes \n     or no.\n       The rule change will make cloture for all nominations other \n     than the Supreme Court a majority threshold vote--yes or no.\n\n  Of course, 52 Democrats voted to take this unprecedented step, which \ntossed aside two centuries of Senate history and tradition, even though \nthis President has an outstanding record of getting his nominations \nconfirmed. In fact, prior to the President's attempt to fill the DC \nCircuit with judges they didn't need, the Senate had confirmed 215 of \nthe President's judicial nominees, rejecting only 2. That is more than \na 99-percent approval rating of the President's nominees.\n  Notwithstanding that record, however, the majority voted to cut the \nminority out of the process on the floor. I note there was bipartisan \nopposition to what the majority leader tried to accomplish. Three \nDemocrats voted against it. I have to give credit to the Senator from \nArkansas who has made this unanimous consent to be one of those who \nthought the minority should not be cut out of the process.\n  The bottom line is that under the precedent 52 Democrats voted to \nestablish, the majority leader now can bring up at any time these \nnominations for a vote on the floor whenever he decides to do it. If he \ndid, the nominees would be confirmed within no more than 2 hours of \ndebate.\n  So the minority simply has no ability to stop anyone from getting a \nvote. There is no filibuster of any nominees anymore, which is the \nwhole point of what the majority chose to do in November.\n  I object to this unanimous consent and respectfully suggest that any \nSenator--including the Senator from Arkansas--discuss the matter with \nthe one individual who has the ability to bypass the minority in that \nmatter, and that happens to be the one Senator who is the majority \nleader of the Senate.\n  I do object, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I wish to respond and further explain.\n  We have two judges pending on the calendar right now. In the sequence \nof judges to be considered, they are No. 2 and No. 7; one is Timothy \nBrooks and the other is James Moody.\n  Tim Brooks was nominated by the White House in June and came out of \nthe Judiciary Committee in October. Jay Moody was nominated by the \nWhite House in July and came out of the Judiciary Committee in \nNovember.\n  On the Federal bench in Arkansas district court level, we have eight \njudges. We now have two vacancies. I don't wish to be dramatic and \ndeclare a judicial emergency, but certainly people should understand we \nare only working at 75 percent horsepower right now and we need to get \nthese judges confirmed forthwith.\n  Yesterday, I stood at my desk and notified the Senate I was going to \nmake this request. I did not receive an objection, as far as I know--\nunless maybe a staff person talked to a staff person. But I never heard \nof any objection.\n  It is bad enough to have 25 percent of our judiciary in Arkansas \nwhich needs to be filled, but the real urgency for this is a matter of \nState law. James Moody is an elected State court judge. He is an \nelected trial court judge. Under Arkansas law, this is a nonpartisan \nposition. Our filing deadline for the 2014 election cycle opens on the \n24th of February and it goes to March 3.\n  So here is the problem: Today is February 12. We are about to have a \nsnowstorm tonight and the next few days and next week we are on recess. \nWe come back on February 24. The filing period will already be open in \nArkansas. I wish I could tell Judge Moody:\n\n[[Page S929]]\n\nDon't worry about it; you are going to be confirmed when we get back. \nThe way things have worked around here recently, I can't give him that \nguarantee. I can't give him my word. I can't tell him: Judge, don't \nfile for reelection. Just go ahead and wait and trust that this is \ngoing to happen. I can't do that under the circumstances. So he is in \nlimbo.\n  There are other lawyers and judges in Arkansas who want to run for \nhis position. There is a domino effect in the local judiciary and local \nbar about this.\n  Under Arkansas State law, once he files, he cannot get his name off \nthe ballot. These are nonpartisan elections. If they were party \nelections, he could go to the State party and they could handle it \nthrough their primary process or through their rules or whatever. But \nthat is not the case here. There is no party to go to. Once he files \nand his name is on the ballot, he is on the ballot, and that is a big \nproblem. This is causing a lot of problems back home.\n  There is no principle involved here. There is no reason why these two \njudges should be held over. They should have been done at the end of \nlast year. I asked my colleagues to help me do that; I was told no.\n  We need to get these judges done now so we don't create this problem \nin Arkansas. Both of these judges are very well qualified. They have \nall the credentials the American Bar Association looks at. As far as I \nknow, every lawyer in Arkansas is unanimously for both. In fact, I \nheard my colleague Senator Boozman of Arkansas tell the Republican \nleader last week: Mitch, if you were picking these judges yourself, you \ncouldn't pick any two better judges.\n  That is a paraphrase, but that is in effect what he said, and it is \ntrue. These are noncontroversial judges. Both these judges should be \nconfirmed now so we don't cause this problem in Arkansas.\n  I yield the floor, but I will continue to push for these nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I see the good Senator from New Mexico \nis here. I am willing to defer to the Senator if time is an issue for \nhim. If it is not, I will proceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/12/senate-section/article/S929-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MILITARY COLA\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise to speak on the issue of the \nmilitary COLA. This is a cost-of-living adjustment for our military \nretirees. In the budget agreement, the COLA was reduced for military \nretirees by 1 percent until they reached age 62, and then the COLA is \nrestored. I am opposed to this provision in the budget, and I have \nsince cosponsored legislation to fix it, meaning fully reinstating the \nCOLA for our military retired.\n  The bill we are considering and voting on later today fixes the COLA \nproblem. It reinstates the COLA in full, and that is good. That is what \nI want to do, and that is what I believe the vast majority of Members \nin this body on both sides of the aisle want to do. We should pass the \nbill, and I believe this afternoon we will.\n  The bill we have been considering this week fixed the COLA problem \nand restored the cost-of-living adjustment for our military retirees, \nbut it did not cover the cost of doing so. The cost of the legislation \nis about $6.8 billion over a 10-year period, which, of course, is the \nCongressional Budget Office's scoring period. We can cover that cost, \nand we should. We have the deficit and the debt. We have to address our \ndeficit and debt. We have to make sure we are paying for things, and we \ncan absolutely do that in this case. In fact, we put forward amendments \nto do just that.\n  The first amendment I joined in putting forward was one led by \nSenator Kelly Ayotte, the Senator from New Hampshire. Her amendment \nfully covers the cost of fixing the COLA. The way it works is it covers \nthe cost by simply requiring that the additional child tax credit \nstatute is properly enforced. I will explain that.\n  This amendment will require families with children who apply for the \nadditional child tax credit must have Social Security numbers for those \nchildren. This is a simple straightforward enforcement provision to \nensure the law is followed. Why wouldn't we make sure the law is \nenforced? After all, I believe that is an important part of our job.\n  In fact, I also believe the Treasury Department supports this \nenforcement provision as well, and I would wish to cite from a recent \ninspector general's report.\n\n       In 2011, the Treasury Department's Inspector General \n     reported that individuals who were not authorized to work in \n     the U.S. received billions by claiming the ACTC, and several \n     news investigations found troubling instances of abuse of \n     this tax credit. In just one example, according to a 2012 \n     news report, an undocumented worker in Indiana admitted that \n     his address was used to file tax returns by four other \n     undocumented workers who fraudulently claimed 20 children in \n     total--resulting in tax refunds totaling nearly $30,000.\n\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates this change would save \napproximately $20 billion over 10 years. That is $20 billion in savings \nover 10 years, which obviously far more than covers the $6.8 billion \ncost of the COLA fix we are putting forward. Clearly that works.\n  I understand we have not been able to get bipartisan agreement on \nthis pay-for, so we need to find something we can agree on because we \nneed both Republicans and Democrats to pass this legislation to fix the \nCOLA, and that is why I have since offered another pay-for. It is a \nsimple 1-page amendment that provides a pay-for for restoring the cost-\nof-living adjustment for our military retirees. What it does is it \nsimply extends the provisions of the Budget Control Act--the budget we \npassed--for one more year, from 2023 to 2024.\n  I am pleased to say we will be voting on my amendment this \nafternoon--not because I have offered the amendment but, rather, \nbecause the leadership has agreed to offer the House version of the \nCOLA fix. The legislation we will be voting on this afternoon has the \npay-for I have just outlined. It is not identical to the amendment I \nhave submitted, but it is very close to it. It ensures our military \nretirees will receive their much-deserved retirement.\n  I have urged my Republican colleagues in our caucus to fix this \nproblem, and I have urged my Democratic colleagues on the Senate floor \nto fix this problem. I believe we will fix the cost-of-living \nadjustment in a bipartisan way today and restore it for our military \nretirees. This amendment will make sure we pay for it so we are not \nincreasing the deficit or the debt.\n  As a former Governor and now as a Senator, I have had the honor and \nprivilege to work with our military men and women. I have been to Iraq \nand Afghanistan. I have gotten the calls when one of our heroes makes \nthe ultimate sacrifice. I know they put it all on the line for us.\n  Today I ask my fellow Senators to join with me and vote for our men \nand women in uniform. We need to fix the COLA for our military retired. \nWe should support those great men and women who wear the uniform and \nhonor and protect us and serve this Nation in the cause of liberty and \nfreedom with their dedicated service.\n  Join with me and support them and vote for this legislation.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/12/senate-section/article/S929-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S929-S930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HEALTH CARE FOR VETERANS\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I rise today to talk about \nhealth care for veterans. This is a critical issue for many veterans \nwho have been left behind and to the many who are not getting the care \nthey need.\n  First, I want to say how important it is that we have reached an \nagreement to restore the cut to pensions for working-age military \nretirees. This cut in the cost-of-living adjustment for military \nretirees should never have been included in the budget bill.\n  Let's be clear. The bipartisan budget agreement was critical to New \nMexico and our Nation because it rolled back damaging sequestration \ncuts--cuts that hurt our military and military families.\n  Working-age military retirees should not have to bear the burden. \nMany of these men and women have given decades of service to our \nNation. They\n\n[[Page S930]]\n\nwere willing to give everything for us. They should get the benefits \nthey have earned. From the beginning I have been working to restore \nthis cut to their COLA benefits. I have been very happy we have a \nbipartisan agreement to move forward and ensure we keep our promise to \nthem.\n  I come to the floor today to also talk about rural veterans and a \nrural veterans improvement act. I was proud to introduce this bill with \nSenator Heller from Nevada earlier this week. When it comes to \nveterans' health care, we know there are challenges. We know we can do \nbetter, and we know we have to do better.\n  Over 6 million veterans live in rural areas, including approximately \none-third who fought in Afghanistan and Iraq. Three million of those \nrural veterans receive health care through the VA. Our veterans have \nfought halfway around the world for our freedom. We should go the extra \nmile for them.\n  Senator Heller and I both come from rural western States. We know the \ndifficulties veterans face when distances are too far and choices are \ntoo few. Our legislation would do four things: improve access to mental \nhealth services, expand transportation grants, hire and retain more \nmedical professionals in rural areas, and give Congress and the VA \ntools to improve the quality of rural facilities.\n  First, let me start with mental health care. This is crucial. \nVeterans are struggling when the help they need is not available or is \nvery far away.\n  One of my constituents lives in a rural area in northern New Mexico. \nHe fought in Vietnam and was diagnosed with post-traumatic distress \ndisorder. He required therapy 2 full days a week for 2 years. This \nvital care probably saved his life. The VA was there for him, and he is \ngrateful, but he had to drive to Albuquerque, over 3 hours away, to get \nthat essential care.\n  The veterans in my State are clear: They need better access to \ntreatment and more mental health options. One size does not fit all. \nConventional therapy does not work for everyone. Veterans groups, such \nas the Wounded Warrior Project, have long supported alternative \ntreatments and more holistic methods. Tribal governments are also \nworking with the VA to use traditional Native American healing \ntechniques, helping their veterans with PTSD and other diagnoses.\n  These veterans are in pain. They are at increased risk of suicide. \nHelp has to be there when they need it. Our bill would enable the VA to \nwork with non-VA fee-for-service providers for veterans with service-\nconnected mental health issues when conventional treatment is not \navailable or where alternative treatment is not an option.\n  Second, even the best health care is useless if you cannot get to it. \nI have talked with many veterans in my State about this issue, and it \nis a big problem across New Mexico. Veterans in Carlsbad face a 6-hour \ndrive to the VA hospital in Albuquerque, 300 miles away one way. One \nsuch veteran fought bravely in World War II. He is now in his eighties. \nHe has to get up at 5 a.m. and make the trip to Albuquerque to see \nmedical specialists. Sometimes he doesn't get home until midnight. \nThanks to the great volunteer drivers at Southeast New Mexico Veterans \nTransportation Network, he is able to get there, but it is an \nexhausting day.\n  Another of my constituents recently retired to Chama, NM, a rural \ncommunity in the north. He and his wife built a home there, looking \nforward to retirement. The VA outreach clinic was nearby, but its \ncontract was not renewed and it closed. His only option now is the VA \nclinic in Espanola, 80 miles each way through the southern Rockies. \nWhen winter storms come, as they do in northern New Mexico, he may not \nbe able to get there at all.\n  The VA offers transportation grants to help, but only for veterans in \nwhat they call highly rural areas with fewer than seven people per \nsquare mile, not for those in rural areas and small towns such as \nChama, and the small towns in Nevada and so many other States. They \nneed help too. The miles are just as long and the journey is just as \nhard.\n  Our bill will help by expanding VA transportation grants to include \nrural communities, and it will not require matching funds for grants up \nto $100,000, making it easier for these communities to apply for \nassistance.\n  Third, rural VA clinics, as their private counterparts, have trouble \ngetting staff and keeping staff. This is not news to veterans who see \nconstant turnover of doctors and nurses and other health care \nprofessionals or who have to travel long distances to see anyone at \nall.\n  Our bill will establish a VA training program, working with \nuniversity medical centers to train health care professionals, serving \nrural veterans at outpatient clinics. Those who complete the program \nand a 3-year assignment will receive a hiring preference for jobs with \nthe Veterans Health Administration.\n  We also propose a pilot program for housing incentives for health \ncare professionals to work in rural VA facilities. We are proposing \nthat the VA streamline the hiring of military medical professionals, \ntransitioning to the civilian world into the VA system.\n  Rural VA health centers have a big job. They do their best. We have \nto do all we can to help them to get and keep staff with incentives, \ntraining, and innovation. It is not easy, but it is essential.\n  Fourth, we call for a full review of VA community-based outpatient \nclinics in rural and highly rural areas so we can prioritize expansions \nand improvements, making sure dollars are well spent and resources go \nas far as possible. We also call for a report to Congress on whether to \nadd polytrauma centers in rural areas to help veterans from Iraq and \nAfghanistan recover from multiple major injuries such as serious burns \nand traumatic brain injuries.\n  Every day, American servicemembers wake up far from home, and every \nday, they stand watch. They do the job they promised to do--and not \nonly if it is easy or only if it is convenient. We owe them the same \npromise. Rural veterans should not be left behind. They should get the \ncare they need and deserve.\n  Again, I thank Senator Heller for working with me on this bill. He \nunderstands the problem. He is committed to finding solutions.\n  Our bill is a step forward for the health and well-being of our \nveterans. This is about essential care, about access, about honoring \nour commitment to the men and women who have sacrificed so much for our \ncommunity. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Durbin be \nrecognized to speak immediately after me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to talk a little bit about the \nletters I have received and the messages we have received in the office \nin the last week regarding the changes we see going on in health care. \nThere was quite a bit of discussion last week about how health care \nimpacts the workplace, and I think a lot of misinformation is out. The \nCongressional Budget Office projection, as some people have alleged, \ndoes not say that 2 million more people are going to have part-time \njobs. It says the equivalent job loss because of the Affordable Health \nCare Act is the equivalent of 2.3 million people losing full-time jobs. \nThat may mean that 10 million people who otherwise would have had full-\ntime jobs have part-time jobs.\n  The other thing is, it is three times as big as the number that was \non the table when people voted for the Affordable Care Act. At that \ntime, the Congressional Budget Office said: If this\n\n[[Page S931]]\n\nlaw passes, there will be 800,000 fewer jobs than if this law does not \npass. The collective impact on the economy is 800,000 fewer jobs.\n  Last week they said there would be 2.3 million fewer jobs--roughly \nthree times the amount that the earlier estimate was. Similar to so \nmany other estimates in this law, the reality of the law turns out to \nbe different than the estimates. Surely that was an estimate that \nnobody wanted. I cannot imagine anybody who voted for this bill--and I \ndid not vote for it--but I cannot imagine anybody who voted for this \nbill thought: That is a really great thing. We are going to lose \n800,000 jobs if this bill passes. I assume they thought: The good this \nbill will do will offset losing 800,000 jobs.\n  Now we find out it is 2.3 million jobs and all kinds of information \nthat the good that was supposedly going to be done is not what people \nhad hoped for.\n  While we are talking about the workplace, I have a letter from a \nperson who is the president of one of our community colleges in the \nState of Missouri. He says because of the Affordable Care Act ``we have \nreviewed all part-time employment to ensure compliance with the \nAffordable Care Act . . . which defines full-time as 30 hours or more \nper week. Without specific guidance in converting credit hours to clock \nhours, we have reduced part-time faculty's teaching loads to ensure'' \nnobody works more than 30 hours.\n  This is not the only letter or contact all of us have had on this \ntopic. We know the unintended consequence of this law on the workplace \nis that people are now told whom they do not have to insure. State \ngovernments, community colleges, big companies all looking at a law for \nthe first time that supposedly says whom you have to insure--though the \nPresident certainly feels he has the authority that none of us can find \nanywhere in the law to decide when the law is going to go into effect \nand when it is not--but the law says whom you have to insure, and \nsuddenly people who for a long time have provided health care benefits \nbecause they thought it was the right thing to do or the competitive \nthing to do now respond to this directive from the Federal Government \nthat says what you have to do, and that means that is all you have to \ndo.\n  So all of these employees who may have worked 25 hours, 28 hours, 32 \nhours in the past who all got insurance now are suddenly working less \nthan 30 hours. I have talked to enough of these employees to know this \nis not because they do not want to work more; this is not because they \nwant to make less money; this is not because they want to teach one \nless class; it is because the law has had that kind of impact on the \nworkplace.\n  The other promises--we are going to get better coverage for less \ncost--surely, somebody is getting better coverage for less cost. But my \nguess is that is a much smaller group than the people who are losing \ntheir insurance and because of the so-called broader and better \ncoverage have more costs.\n  Here is a letter from Kathy in Wentzville, MO. She says:\n\n       I carry insurance through a large corporation and my \n     premium increased this year because the minimum standards [in \n     the law] affect my plan.\n       Premiums increased by 25 percent.\n\n  She goes on, in no uncertain terms, to suggest that she does not like \nthe Affordable Care Act or think it is affordable.\n  Jeff from St. Joseph said:\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to share my family's opinion \n     on ObamaCare. First off I would like to state that we have \n     experienced increases in our health insurance. My employer's \n     insurance has doubled of which I pay \\1/2\\. My family's \n     separate insurance policy has risen as well with a \n     cancellation due in December. I have considered canceling my \n     [own] health insurance through my employer so that I could \n     provide for my family's [health insurance at their new \n     rates].\n\n  This is a family that a few months ago thought they were going to be \nable to continue to keep what they had. They liked what they had. They \nthought they could afford what they had. Now they are deciding who is \ngoing to go without insurance so other people can have insurance in the \nfamily at the higher rate.\n  William from St. Louis, MO, says:\n\n       My insurance was canceled in December.\n\n  He says:\n\n       . . . my insurance rates have been drastically increasing \n     each year since the law was passed.\n       Four years ago, I had a policy for my family with a $500 \n     deductible and the ability to go to any hospital/doctor in \n     St. Louis for $1,000 per month. Now I have a policy with a \n     $2,000 deductible and I can't go to [the doctor I used to go \n     to].\n\n  He says his policy now--that does not allow him to go to the doctor \nhe used to go to--does not cost $1,000 a month any longer; it costs \n$1,500 a month.\n  Ted in St. Joseph said his doctor has changed the way he does \nbusiness. He says his doctor has downsized the types of plans he \naccepts and is moving to a customer base with higher incomes.\n  So Ted's doctor, according to Ted in St. Joseph, has stopped taking \npatients with Blue Cross/Blue Shield because of increased costs, and \nTed, who by the way liked the doctor he had, now has to find another \ndoctor who will take the coverage he can get.\n\n  Steve, in St. Joseph, and his wife are raising their 14-year-old \ngrandson, and all three have seen their insurance costs increase--they \nthink because of the Affordable Care Act. His grandson's policy went up \n$50 a month, from $104 to $154. His wife's deductible went from $1,000 \nper year to $5,000 per year and her insurance costs over $800 a month.\n  He goes on to say--and I thought about whether I should read this; I \nassume they have talked about this too. He said: ``If we were to get \ndivorced, her premium would be less than $200 per month.'' I think \nSteve is not suggesting that he and his wife should get divorced, but \nhe is just talking about, again, the unintended consequences. A family \nwho is together cannot afford to have the coverage they had. Her \ncoverage is $800 a month, but as a substitute teacher--I believe that \nis what this letter says she does--her income would qualify her for a \n$200-a-month policy instead of the $800 they are paying now.\n  Sandy from Armstrong, MO, says she received a letter from her \ninsurance company notifying her that her premiums were about to \nincrease. She went on healthcare.gov to find plans she and her husband \ncould qualify for, and the plans she found were double the premiums she \nhad been paying.\n  Kelly from Farmington, MO, works in the HR department, the human \nresources department, at a bank. She feels healthy groups will be \npaying more for insurance because of the ACA and because of the \nexpanded coverage.\n  Her department has received many questions, she says, about health \ncare coverage but feels limited in how much they can tell anybody \nbecause they do not know how the new law is going to apply.\n  The law of unintended consequences continues to be the law that \napplies here. Missourians and people all over the country are \ncontacting us and asking how much damage we are willing to do to the \nhealth care system that was working to get more people included in that \nsystem. There were ways to do this, every one of which I believe was \nlegislatively proposed in 2009--small changes that would have made a \nbig difference in a health care system that was working for people who \nwere in that system. We needed to figure out the few ways to get more \npeople in that system. Instead, we have had a dramatic impact on the \nbest health care system in the world, and people are beginning to \nfigure that out.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, with what we went through in the State \nof Florida in the attempts to suppress voters, you would think that \nwith the experience of people having stood in line in order to vote for \n5 to 7 hours, it would have put this issue to rest. But they are back \nat it again, this time in a very subtle way.\n  The Governor's office, through his appointed secretary of state, who \nis the chief elections officer, has now interpreted a statute that in a \nmunicipal election students at the University of Florida cannot early \nvote on campus at their student center prior to the election. The \ninterpretation was made that it is an educational facility and does not \nqualify, according to the statute, on a technical reason: that it is \nnot a government-owned conference facility, when, indeed, it is owned \nby the State of Florida through the university, and it is a conference \nfacility for many conferences for outside groups as well as student \ngroups.\n  No, what it is is an attempt, in the runup to the November election, \nto try to make it more difficult and less convenient for students to \nvote.\n  As it turns out, in this particular municipal election coming up \nshortly, students would have to go across town to some other location \nsome 3 miles away, and, of course, as busy as students are, that is \ngoing to discourage them.\n  If they end up doing this for this special election in March, a \nmunicipal election, they are, of course, going to try to do it for the \nNovember election when we have a statewide election for the Governor \nand the cabinet. Why? Well, an attempt to suppress student voters who \nmay not be voting for the people in power who are trying to suppress \ntheir votes.\n  It is all the more of interest because on the ballot there will be a \nproposed constitutional amendment to change the State constitution to \nallow, by doctors, the prescription of medical marijuana, which is \nsomething that has generated interest in all sectors of society but \nparticularly among students--another reason they want to come out to \nvote.\n  The whole idea of early voting is to try to make it more convenient \nfor people to be able to vote, that they might not be able to vote \nbecause of a babysitter problem or a work problem on election day. But \nearly voting, as we saw in the experience of the 2012 election--the \ndays were shortened from 14 to 8. They cut out the Sunday before the \nTuesday election. Professor Dan Smith, in doing a study at the \nUniversity of Florida, found that those who availed themselves of \nSunday voting were primarily Hispanics and African Americans. Indeed, \nattempts were made to limit the number of early voting locations within \na county, and then, of those early vote locations, having a facility \nthat was small so that you could not get in a lot of voting machines. \nThis was another way--very subtle--of trying to suppress the vote.\n  So the people of Florida, naturally, were outraged, particularly when \nthey heard stories of the 101-year-old lady who had to stay 3\\1/2\\ \nhours in order to cast her vote and the others who stayed 5 and 7 \nhours. They were not going to have their vote taken away from them. \nThey stood in line. So the people were outraged.\n  There was an attempt to pass a new law. I will close with this. With \nthis new law now as being interpreted, the very same suppression \nefforts are occurring again. We are simply not going to let this happen \neven if we have to call in the Justice Department.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/12/senate-section/article/S932-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S932-S933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MILITARY RETIREMENT COLA\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, while I will cast my vote this afternoon \nfor the legislation which would replace the cost of living adjustment, \nCOLA, reduction for military retirees, I disagree strongly with the \nprovision to extend the arbitrary sequester cuts included with this \nlegislation.\n  It is frustrating to me that Congress will fix one provision which \nunfairly singled out one group by singling out another.\n  I am pleased that we can fix the COLA adjustment that would have \naffected the men and women who serve in the military prior to it taking \neffect. However, I would have preferred that we find a responsible way \nto offset the cost by identifying savings elsewhere.\n  I joined Senator Shaheen and Senator Kaine in December in introducing \nlegislation that identified a way to pay for this fix: our proposal \nwould close a loophole that some companies use to avoid paying U.S. \ntaxes. Our approach would generate $6.6 billion over 10 years to pay \nfor the cost of un-doing the proposed cut in military pensions.\n  The extension of the sequester on mandatory spending for another \nyear, which primarily hits Medicare providers such as hospitals with a \ntwo-percent across-the-board cut in payments, is a blunt and arbitrary \nway to find savings in Federal health care programs. It does not reward \nhealth care value, or support health care quality, nor differentiate \namong different geographic areas.\n  The across-the-board cut does nothing to reform the real long-term \nfiscal challenges facing our entitlement programs. Instead, it just \ncompounds on the multitude of other cuts that hospitals and other \nproviders are facing, creating a situation where access to care \npotentially will be threatened.\n  The vote before the Senate this afternoon shows yet again how we need \nto have a broader conversation on how to get a better handle on our \nlong-term fiscal challenges. By ignoring that larger conversation, we \ninstead are reduced to playing a game of Whac-A-Mole.\n  The provision which singled out military servicemembers and veterans \nwas included in a bipartisan package which was the least we could do to \nensure that we didn't repeat the stupidity of last fall's government \nshutdown. The overall package, the Bipartisan Budget Act, which I \nsupported, did not touch the major levers available to fix our balance \nsheet. By common agreement, revenue and entitlement reforms were not \npart of the discussion.\n  This package fixed the arbitrary sequester cuts--though only on the \ndiscretionary side, and only for 2 years.\n  For the last 3 years, Congress--and both chambers, and both parties, \nbear some responsibility for this--have repeatedly taken the path of \nleast resistance. All of us recognize that we have an enormous fiscal \nchallenge, but there's not the collective will to make the hard \ndecisions which will put us on a path of solvency.\n  Instead, we punt and we play on the margins. We continually make deep \ncuts in the type of programs that power economic growth--programs that \ntrain our workforce, educate our children, and support those who serve \nand protect our nation. We choose to put off the broader discussion \nabout reforms which would be easier now--easier because they create a \nglide path toward enactment--allowing individuals, families, businesses \nand our state and local government partners to make responsible plans \nfor future changes. We have avoided a conversation about our complex, \nbloated tax code, which promotes inefficiency and too often inhibits \neconomic growth. By putting off the hard choices, we allow these fiscal \nchallenges to get worse. The choices do not get any easier.\n  Decisions like the vote before us today are incredibly frustrating. \nThese decisions ask us to support the repeal of a provision, which hurt \none specific group, by replacing it with another provision which just \nplaces the burden on a separate group. I believe that we can do better \nfor our military personnel, for our Medicare providers, the patients \nwho rely on them, and for our country overall. While I will cast my \nvote for this bill, I remain committed to finding a way to reverse the \nsequester cuts we have just extended through 2024.\n Mr. COBURN. Madam President, regardless of which side one \nfalls on the Ryan-Murray budget deal reduction in the annual COLA \nincrease for working\n\n[[Page S933]]\n\nage military retirees, the sad fact is with the passage of this \nlegislation we are breaking our previous promise to taxpayers to reduce \nthe deficit. Instead of coming up with a real offset for a mere $6.2 \nbillion in spending, the Senate has chosen to resort to budgetary \ngimmicks to disguise the true cost of our politically expedient \ndecisions, and has yet again punted the hard decisions that must be \nmade to future generations.\n  By offsetting real and immediate spending with a promise of future \nspending reductions with the extension of sequestration cuts to \nMedicare through 2024, beyond the 10-year budget window, the savings \nfrom this budget trick will not materialize and taxpayers will not be \nmade whole. By passing this legislation, we are sending a signal that \nthis body does not have the fortitude to lead as our constituents have \nchosen us to do--to take on the sacred cows like military compensation \nthat must be part of the national conversation about our spending and \nreform.\n  As we prepare to pass this legislation, every Member of this body \nwould do well to consider these words by former Joint Chiefs Chairman \nAdmiral Mike Mullen: ``The most significant threat to our national \nsecurity is our debt.'' We best honor the sacrifice of our military \nveterans and realize a more safe and secure future by keeping our \npromise to reduce the national debt. By refusing to come up with a real \noffset to pay for the repeal of the COLA cut, the Senate is undermining \nour veterans, our country, and our future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to talk for a short period \nof time about the magnitude of our budget, debt, and deficit. Against \nthe backdrop of a debt ceiling increase, Members of both parties are \ngoing to today, likely, repeal one of the deficit reduction measures \nincluded in the bipartisan budget agreement that was approved less than \n2 months ago. How do we convey to the Nation the seriousness about \nsolving the debt crisis when at the first sign of political pressure we \nrepeal one of the deficit reduction measures?\n  As we all know, the Ryan-Murray budget deal included modest \nreductions in some spending programs over the next 10 years in order to \nincrease discretionary spending caps in fiscal years 2014 and 2015. I \nvoted against this agreement because I thought the spending cuts did \nnot go far enough. I do not think we are treating our debt and deficit \nseriously enough.\n  Second, I have been down that road of trading spending increases \ntoday for spending cuts later many times. It does not work. We have \nseen that play before. We know how it ends. Year after year Members of \nCongress simply refuse to stick to the budget discipline we said we \nwould stick to. Exhibit 1 is before us today. The Congress is about to \nundo--in fact, repeal--one of those provisions, as I mentioned.\n  It is important to note that the cost-of-living adjustment that will \nbe repealed--or the reform that will be repealed was a cost-of-living \nadjustment--a COLA--for military retirees resulting in less than a 1-\npercent reduction for working-age military retirees. That is 1 percent. \nIt stopped far short of the elimination of COLA requirements for \nretirees under the age of 62 that the Simpson-Bowles Commission \nrecommended.\n  Certainly our veterans deserve the utmost respect and generous \nretirement pay. However, it has been reported that regardless of age, \nmembers of our armed services could easily, in some instances, receive \nretirement and health benefits for 40 years or more.\n  Some of my colleagues have suggested that failing to support measures \nto repeal the COLA reduction is tantamount to turning our backs on \nveterans. This is untrue. This is a mischaracterization of the issue at \nhand. I think we all know that. The U.S. military is at a crossroads. \nFast-growing retirement pay and health benefits are threatening to \ndisplace investments in the readiness of our Armed Forces.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a hard look at the fiscal mess we \nface before we vote to roll back one of the few deficit reduction \nmeasures the President and Congress have agreed to. Our fiscal \nsituation is serious. We cannot ignore that forever.\n  This problem will continue to get worse. Yes, we ought to be \nreforming entitlement programs so they will be around for future \nbeneficiaries, veterans and others, but for goodness' sake, when \ndeficit reduction measures get signed into law, surely at some point we \nneed to stand by them.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Kevin Techau on his \nnomination as the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Iowa.\n  U.S. attorneys hold a very important position in our system of \njustice. They are charged with upholding the law and, consequently, \nmust possess impeccable legal skills and superior knowledge. \nAdditionally, it is just as important that U.S. attorneys be committed \nto justice, fairness, due process and equal protection. I am confident \nthat Mr. Techau understands the importance of the job he is about to \nundertake and has the skills, perseverance, and sense of justice \nnecessary to make the most of his new position.\n  There is no question that Mr. Techau is highly qualified to be a U.S. \nattorney. He gained extensive law enforcement and managerial experience \nas head of Iowa's Department of Public Safety and Department of \nInspections and Appeals under then Governor Tom Vilsack. He also has \nbroad criminal justice and trial experience, including as an assistant \nFederal public defender in Iowa, as a staff judge advocate in the U.S. \nAir Force and Iowa National Guard, and in private practice. That \nexperience will serve him well in his new position.\n  Mr. Techau has also demonstrated over the course of his career his \ncommitment to public service, strong leadership, excellent judgment, \nand integrity. He will vigorously and fairly enforce the law, and I am \ncertain that Mr. Techau will continue his dedication to justice.\n  Mr. Techau is a person of truly outstanding intellect and character, \nand I wholeheartedly congratulate him--as well as his wife, Stephanie, \nand two children--on his nomination as the U.S. attorney for the \nNorthern District of Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to share a few words of \nsupport of Kevin Techau to be U.S. attorney for the Northern District \nof Iowa. Mr. Techau received his undergraduate degree from the \nUniversity of Iowa in 1981, and his J.D. from the University of Iowa in \n1984. Mr. Techau also has a distinguished military career. He served in \nthe U.S. Air Force as a judge advocate from 1985 until 1992. While \nserving in the base legal office he provided legal counsel on a broad \narray of issues, including Federal laws, employment law, medical \nmalpractice claims and criminal prosecution.\n  As a circuit defense counsel, he served as lead attorney in major \nfelony cases in European and eastern United States circuits \nrepresenting U.S. Air Force airmen in court-martial cases involving \ncharges brought under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Mr. Techau \njoined the Iowa National Guard in 1993 and served until 2011.\n  In 1992, Mr. Techau joined the firm of Grefe & Sidney in Des Moines, \nIA. As an associate attorney, the primary focus of his practice was in \ncivil litigation. From 1996 until 1999, Mr. Techau served as a Federal \npublic defender for Iowa. His practice as a public defender was both at \nthe trial and appellate level, and he has tried cases in the U.S. \nFederal Courts for the Northern and Southern Districts of Iowa and the \nEighth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Techau was appointed to the \nposition of director of inspections and appeals for Iowa in 1999, and \nin 2002 was appointed as commissioner of public safety for Iowa.\n  Since 2007, he has been associate general counsel at American Equity \nInvestment Life Insurance Company. There he handles litigation \nmanagement for the company. Throughout his career, Mr. Techau has \ndemonstrated\n\n[[Page S936]]\n\nhis commitment to serving the people of Iowa and the United States.\n  Finally, let me just add that I have known the Techau family for \ndecades and I know Mr. Techau personally. He has even been a running \npartner of mine from time to time. He is a man of fine character and \ncommitment. I believe he will serve as U.S. attorney with distinction \nand honor. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Kevin W. Techau, of Iowa, to be United \nStates Attorney for the Northern District of Iowa?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n\n\n                        Vote on Luger Nomination\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is now recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise in support of Andrew Luger. I \nthank my colleagues for the work they have done to make sure Minnesota \nhas a U.S. attorney in place. I want to particularly thank Leader Reid \nand Senator McConnell, the two leaders, for their work, as well as \nSenator Franken. The two of us put together a nonpartisan \nrecommendation coming from the committee, and we are very glad the \nPresident took that recommendation and recommended Andrew Luger, with \nhis vast criminal prosecution experience as well as his civil \nexperience.\n  I also thank Senator Grassley for his work as well as Senator Corker. \nMinnesota has gone 2\\1/2\\ years without a full-time U.S. attorney, as \nour U.S. attorney was doing the job as ATF Director at the same time, \nand the over 100 people who work at the U.S. attorney's office in \nMinnesota truly deserve a leader.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Andrew Mark Luger, of Minnesota, to be \nUnited States Attorney for the District of Minnesota?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n\n\n                        Vote on Hobbs Nomination\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Robert L.

Mr. President, as we leave Washington for about 10 days, \nI wish to leave some suggestions in President Obama's suggestion box.\n  There has been a lot of commentary about income inequality, needing \nto raise the minimum wage, needing to create more jobs, and the \nPresident talked about doing these things with the stroke of a pen in \nhis office because of an uncooperative legislative branch. I want to \nsuggest four things the President himself could do to immediately \ninitiate job creation, opportunity, and a more robust economy for the \nUnited States of America.\n  First, trade promotion authority. The President said in his remarks \nin his State of the Union speech he was for trade promotion authority. \nWe need him to get with the Democratic majority in the Senate to bring \nTPA to the floor of the Senate.\n  A history lesson: In the 1990s, a Republican Congress gave Democratic \nPresident Bill Clinton trade promotion authority for fast track. \nAmerica's exports and imports grew exponentially, jobs were created, \nand America became a robust trading partner around the world with \ncountries all over the world. That has expired. We need to give it to \nPresident Obama.\n  We have three pending opportunities: The Trans-Pacific Partnership, \nthe Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, and the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act, all of which are pending negotiations \nbetween now and 2015, and all of which will generate jobs, trade, and \nopportunity for the United States of America.\n  Please, Mr. President, demand from the Senate that you get TPA and \nyou get it now.\n  Secondly is Keystone. We have all heard a lot about Keystone, but I \nwant to reiterate, now that the State Department has for the fifth time \nsigned off on the Keystone Pipeline, why are we denying America the oil \nand petroleum it needs and instead acceding ourselves to the nation of \nChina?\n  America has the opportunity to become the most independent energy\n\n[[Page S937]]\n\ncountry in the world. It is critical the Keystone Pipeline be built to \ncreate jobs and to see that we continue to control the generation of \npetroleum and energy in our country and become a net seller rather than \na gross importer, which we have been for many years in the past.\n  The Keystone Pipeline makes sense for the unions, makes sense for \nbusiness, makes sense to America, and America does a better job \nenvironmentally of treating petroleum and refining it than any country \nin the world, particularly China. It ought to come to America, and the \nPresident can do that with the stroke of a pen.\n  Third, GSE reform. Our government-sponsored entities Freddie Mac and \nFannie Mae continue to do business, but they languish from a lack of \nattention. We need to reform those two entities so we can have a robust \nhousing market for a middle America.\n  If you have enough money to pay cash for a house in America today, \nyou can do that. If you are on the low end and want an FHA loan, you \ncan get that. But if you are in middle America--if you are one of those \nAmericans we all talk about wanting to help--there is not enough \nmortgage money available because there is no government-sponsored \nentity to guarantee the paper to guarantee the capital to flow into \nAmerica.\n  If you want to get the unemployment rate down from 6.4 to 5 percent, \nwhich all of us want, there is one way to do it; that is, bring back a \nrobust housing market, which still does not exist in the United States \ntoday.\n  Fourth, talk to Patty Murray and Tom Harkin. Tom Harkin is the \nchairman of our Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. \nPatty Murray is the chairman of the subcommittee I serve on in terms of \nlabor, and let's get the Workforce Investment Act, which for 6 years \nhas languished in terms of continuation and renewal, renewed and \nreauthorized. Let's get it done. The work is done. We are this close. \nWe just need an impetus from the White House to tell the Congress to go \nahead and get it done and send it.\n  I appreciate what the President said he is going to do with Joe \nBiden. I think Joe Biden is a tremendous Vice President and he does a \ngreat job, but we don't need to recreate the wheel. Congress has done \nthe work on WIA. It is time to pass it and it is time for the President \nto sign it.\n\n\n                          Tribute to Bobby Cox\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to a great \nGeorgian, a personal friend of mine, and a great baseball player in the \nhistory of our country: Bobby Cox, No. 6, former third baseman for the \nNew York Yankees, third baseman for the Atlanta Braves, manager of \nToronto's Blue Jays when they won a World Series, and for 14 \nconsecutive seasons he took the Atlanta Braves to a playoff. Five of \nthose seasons he took them to the National League Championship and one \nof those seasons he took them to win the World Series against the \nCleveland Indians.\n  Bobby Cox was voted into Baseball's Hall of Fame and will be sworn in \nat Cooperstown, NY, on June 27 of this year. Bobby Cox is an icon in \nbaseball and a greet human being. He set many records, such as the \nfollowing: 2,085 victories with the Atlanta Braves, best in Braves \nhistory; overall record of 2,413 wins and 1,930 losses. The Braves won \nmore games with Cox, 1,725 in a 19-season span, than any other team in \nbaseball; 15 divisional crowns, 5 pennants, and he holds the record for \nthe most ejections of any manager in the history of baseball.\n  The reason that is a positive story is this: Bobby Cox fought for his \nplayers. He knew how to motivate a crowd, he knew how to get on an \numpire's back, and he knew how to turn the team bench around. His 132nd \nejection took place in November of 2007 during one of the playoff games \nwhen he went out and argued a third called strike against his star \nplayer Chipper Jones. Two innings later the Braves came back and \nrallied and won. In large measure, it was Bobby's fighting for his \nplayers that made the difference.\n  But Bobby Cox also fights for Georgia. His work with the Dreams of \nRecovery Foundation, which Cindy Donald founded for those who are \nparaplegic and quadriplegic in Georgia, has been a miracle. Bobby gives \nhis time and effort all the time to help those who are less fortunate.\n  He also continues to help the Atlanta Braves, who will soon be moving \nfrom downtown Atlanta to my home county of Cobb County, in Marietta, \nGA.\n  I pay tribute and give thanks to Bobby Cox for all he has given to \nour State and recognize him for the achievement of being sworn into \nBaseball's Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. Best of luck, Bobby, for many \nmore years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/12/senate-section/article/S937-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank my colleague Senator \nWhitehouse for yielding me 2 minutes.\n  We are leaving here with major unfinished business. We have not \nextended unemployment benefits for 1.8 million Americans. They are \ngetting to be increasingly desperate. They need this assistance as they \ncontinue to look for work in a very difficult time.\n  I think it is interesting, if not ironic, that the pay-for mechanism \nthat was instead used to pay for the appropriate adjustment of the \nmilitary retirees' COLA was the same pay-for mechanism we had proposed \nto use to extend these benefits for up to several months, almost 1 \nyear. Yet many of my colleagues on the other side rejected that, saying \nthat was inappropriate.\n  We have to come back. We will come back. We have to deal with \nunemployment insurance. We have to find a way, both sides, to come \ntogether and find a way to provide modest assistance for these \nAmericans who are struggling to find work in a market where there are \nup to three applicants for every job.\n  With that, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBoozman precede me in recognition on the floor for such time as he may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in last year's budget agreement our \nretired servicemembers were unjustly targeted to bear the burden of \nirresponsible spending. Balancing the budget on the backs of our \nservicemembers is a reckless move which violates the responsibility we \nhave to those who wear our Nation's uniform, which is why I voted \nagainst the budget agreement.\n  Numerous Arkansans have reached out to me urging Congress to correct \nthese misguided cuts. I have been encouraging my colleagues to restore \nthese cuts at the earliest opportunity in order to provide certainty \nfor our military retirees' financial future. I, working with others in \nthis body, have worked hard to bring this to a vote.\n  Yesterday, the House took action. I am pleased to be able to stand \nhere today and tell those Arkansans and all veterans that the Senate \nhas followed suit and corrected this injustice.\n  However, we must continue working to fully repeal the section of the \nBipartisan Budget Act which reduces retirement pay for those who enlist \nafter January 1, 2014. Any changes which Congress may consider to our \nmilitary compensation system should be done in a thoughtful and \nresponsible manner in the context of a broader compensation system.\n  I supported this bill before the Senate today to restore the full \ncost of living adjustment for those enlisted prior to 2014, but I will \ncontinue working to fully repeal this cut which singles out current \nmilitary enlistments to bear the burden of wasteful Washington \nspending. We need to right this wrong so our veterans, servicemembers, \nand their families have one less thing to worry about. However, this \noverwhelmingly bipartisan vote today was certainly a step in the right \ndirection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown).

Mr. President, this marks the 58th consecutive week \nwe have been in session where I have\n\n[[Page S938]]\n\ncome to the floor to seek to wake up this Congress to the threat of \nclimate change.\n  Carbon pollution from the burning of fossil fuels is altering the \nclimate. The consensus around this fact within the scientific \ncommunity--and in fact the reality-based community--is overwhelming.\n  Since the industrial revolution, humans have dumped 2 trillion metric \ntons of carbon dioxide into the air and oceans--and counting. The EPA \nestimates that in 2011, the United States alone emitted more than 5.6 \nbillion tons of carbon dioxide.\n  We know the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere is higher than \nit has been in the history of mankind. We know that when we put more \ncarbon dioxide into the atmosphere, it warms up the planet. This has \nbeen understood science since Abraham Lincoln was President.\n  We know the ocean absorbs 90 percent of the excess heat and 30 \npercent of the carbon in the air. As water warms, it expands, and sea \nlevels go up. This is called the law of thermal expansion. We know that \nwhen carbon dissolves in water, it increases the levels of carbonic \nacid in the water. This is a law of chemistry. We know from simple \nmeasurements that seawater is acidifying at a rate we haven't seen at \nany time in the past 50 million years. We are a species of homo sapiens \nwho have been on the planet for a little over 200,000. So 50 million \ntakes us back a way.\n  When we put these things together, and then look at things like 37 \nstraight years with a global temperature above the 20th century \naverage, sea level up 10 inches in Newport, RI, oyster spat killed off \nby acidic water in Washington State, shorter seasons for ski resort \noperators and longer seasons for wildfire fighters, our climate is \nchanging. The scientific debate is long settled, and public awareness \nof the crisis is growing stronger and even across party lines.\n  Outside these walls of Congress, which have been barricaded by lies \nand special interest propaganda, Americans of all stripes, including \nmore and more responsible Republican voices, acknowledge the threat of \nclimate change and call for responsible solutions. Yet Congress remains \ntrapped behind a barricade of polluting special interest influence. \nRepublicans in Congress refuse to get serious.\n  It wasn't always this way. Conservation of this land's natural \nresources used to be a core value of the Republican party, and \nprotecting future generations' natural birthright from plundering by \nspecial-interest industry was a cornerstone of Republican leadership. \nThis month actually marks the anniversary of a milestone in that kind \nof American leadership.\n  On February 1, 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt established the \nU.S. Forest Service. Fed up with the cronyism and bureaucracy that \ndefined the weak existing conservation programs, he dissolved the \nBureau of Forestry within the Department of Agriculture and transferred \nmanagement of the 63 million acres of national forests under the \nDepartment of the Interior to the new Forest Service.\n  Roosevelt resented the ``malefactors of great wealth,'' as he called \nthem, the timber and mining interests whose ``selfish and shortsighted \ngreed,'' he called it, ``seeks to exploit [our natural resources] in \nsuch fashion as to ruin them, and thereby to leave our children and our \nchildren's children heirs only to an exhausted and impoverished \ninheritance.''\n  Roosevelt not only knew how to say the right thing, he knew how to \nsay it well.\n  Pictured here is Teddy Roosevelt looking across the vast expanse of \nMogollon Rim in Arizona, one of the many forests transferred to the \nnewly created Forest Service. With the President is Gifford Pinchot, a \nprime advocate of the Forest Service. As its first Chief, Pinchot \nrestructured and professionalized the management of the national \nforests. During Roosevelt's Presidency, the Federal forest system grew \nby nearly 130 million acres. In total, he extended protection to an \nadditional 230 million acres of our Nation's land.\n  Roosevelt said:\n\n       We have become great in a material sense because of the \n     lavish use of our resources, and we have just reason to be \n     proud of our growth. But the time has come to inquire \n     seriously what will happen when our forests are gone, when \n     the coal, the iron, the oil, and the gas are exhausted, when \n     the soils shall have been still further impoverished and \n     washed into the streams, polluting the rivers.\n\n  Today, some of these long-cherished American forests, grasslands, and \nlandscapes are under assault due to climate change.\n  In July 2010, the Forest Service issued its ``National Roadmap for \nResponding to Climate Change.'' Specifically, the Forest Service report \nsays:\n\n       Most of the urgent forest and grassland management \n     challenges of the past 20 years, such as wildfires, changing \n     water regimes, and expanding forest insect infestations, have \n     been driven, in part, by a changing climate. Future impacts \n     are projected to be even more severe.\n\n  Our Bicameral Task Force on Climate Change, which I chair with \nCongressman Waxman, hosted a roundtable of firefighters and State and \nFederal foresters. Here is what Dave Cleaves, the Forest Service's \nClimate Change Advisor, told us:\n\n       So what have we been seeing? . . . The length of the fire \n     season increasing by more than 60 days over the last 10 \n     years, the annual area burned by wildfire increasing more \n     than four times what it was in the 1970s; the portion of the \n     area burned by large fires has gone up two to seven times, so \n     most of that increase in acreage has been because of the \n     large fires, and the extreme part of the distribution of \n     fires.\n       . . . So we have a big issue on our hands, it's an \n     ecological issue, it's an economic issue, it's a social \n     issue, and dealing with it means we have to understand it \n     better and understand some of the related challenges.\n\n  Shown here is the devastation from the largest rim fire in the Sierra \nNevada range in recorded history. The healthy forest is shown 2 years \nprior to the fire on the left, while monitoring right before the fire \nshowed a sudden decline in the health of the forest caused by the \nwestern pine beetle killing ponderosa pine and making the forest \nvulnerable to burning. This is a beetle that is killed off by cold \nweather. So where it can infest forests is limited by cold weather and \naltitude, of course, because it gets colder at higher altitudes.\n  With climate change, the territory of the infestation has expanded, \nand we see this change from a healthy forest to this. When it turns to \nthis, it can burn. On the right we see the charred and unrecognizable \nlandscape. Although we cannot definitively attribute any single fire to \nclimate change, according to a 2012 comprehensive science report for \nthe U.S. forest sector, increased temperature and drought can increase \nfrequency and magnitude of fires and amplify insect and pathogen \noutbreaks which affect forest health. For example, Montana's deep \nfreezes used to kill off the pine bark beetle. Today, that beetle kills \nmillions of acres of trees across the American West.\n  President Roosevelt issued a warning a century ago:\n\n       One distinguishing characteristic of really civilized men \n     is foresight. We have to, as a nation, exercise foresight for \n     this nation in the future; and if we do not exercise that \n     foresight, dark will be the future.\n\n  Have we heeded Roosevelt's warning? We can clearly foresee the \ndevastation climate change will bring. Yet many modern Republicans, \nparticularly those in Congress, are aligning themselves with the \npolluters and deniers to manufacture doubt about the science and fight \nany limits on greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Roosevelt, a Republican, had foresight to protect the natural \nresources we relay on, but his once great party has lost track of his \nideals. Democrats and Republicans should be working with President \nObama to implement his climate action plan to reduce carbon pollution. \nBut when the Environment and Public Works Committee recently held an \noversight hearing on the President's plan, what did we get from our \nRepublican colleagues? Flat-out climate denial--the polluter party \nline.\n  Theodore Roosevelt, the great Republican conservationist, stood up to \npolluting special interests. He was, in the name of the recent book, \n``The Wilderness Warrior.''\n  Today, too many Republicans in Congress have joined polluting \ncorporate special interests in their war on the wilderness. Perhaps \nthey should listen to another Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt IV is the \ngreat-grandson of the 26th President, and he is still a Republican. He \nwants his fellow Republicans\n\n[[Page S939]]\n\nto return to the values of his great-grandfather.\n\n       It seems to be beyond the scope of many on the right to \n     say, for instance, that species extinction, as a result of \n     unrestrained human activity, is immoral and indefensible; \n     that our refusal to seriously engage in a global effort to \n     address climate change is unethical and imprudent.\n\n  There are such clear warnings. The facts speak for themselves. The \ndenial position has shown itself to be nonsense, a sham. Yet in \nCongress we sleepwalk on. Every day more and more Americans realize the \ntruth, and they increasingly want this Congress to wake up. They know \nthat climate change is real.\n  It is time to wake up and to do the work necessary to combat climate \nchange. It is time for us to heed the words of President Theodore \nRoosevelt:\n\n       Here is your country. Cherish these natural wonders, \n     cherish the natural resources, cherish the history and \n     romance as a sacred heritage, for your children and your \n     children's children. Do not let selfish men or greedy \n     interests skin your country of its beauty, its riches or its \n     romance.\n\n  Let us wake up.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/12/senate-section/article/S939-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

Is there objection?\n  The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as everyone \nknows, last year our friends on the other side of the aisle invoked the \nso-called nuclear option. The stated reason was to strip the minority \nof any ability to stop any executive or judicial nominees on the floor. \nBut, in fact, prior to the President's attempt to fill up the DC \nCircuit Court with judges they didn't need, the Senate actually had a \nvery good record of confirming the President's judicial nominees, 215 \nto 2.\n  Now the majority leader would like to short-circuit the process which \nwas put in place as a result of the nuclear option and seek to get \nconfirmation of these judicial nominees by unanimous consent. My hope \nwould be that the majority leader would choose to reverse the partisan \nrules change so we can go back to the bipartisan cooperative process \nwhich resulted in more than 200 Obama judges being confirmed.\n  Absent that, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, 1 year ago today, the Senate came together \nin the best tradition of the Chamber to pass the Leahy-Crapo Violence \nAgainst Women Reauthorization Act, including the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Reauthorization Act, with a strong bipartisan vote. It \nmarked the culmination of years of collaboration with survivors and the \nvictim services professionals who work with them every day. It also \nmarked an historic step to protect all victims, regardless of their \nimmigration status, their sexual orientation or their membership in an \nIndian tribe. As I have said countless times on the floor of this \nChamber, ``a victim is a victim is a victim,'' and the bill the Senate \npassed 1 year ago today was a reflection of that truth.\n  In passing this historic VAWA reauthorization, the Senate showed that \nwe still can act in a bipartisan way and put crime victims above \npolitics. Senators Crapo and Murkowski were steadfast partners in that \neffort and listened to the call from thousands of survivors of violence \nand law enforcement by supporting a fully-inclusive, lifesaving bill.\n  In the year since its passage, the important changes we made to the \nViolence Against Women Act have made lives better. The new \nnondiscrimination provisions included in the law are ensuring that all \nvictims, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, \nhave access to lifesaving programs and cannot be turned away. I was \ndiscouraged by the opposition of some to these inclusive provisions \nlast year, especially when the research so clearly underscored the need \nto update the law to protect the most vulnerable populations. I am \nproud, however, that after all was said and done, we stayed true to our \ncore value of equal protection and these provisions were enacted.\n  We also made vital improvements to the law to address the epidemic of \nviolence against Native women. Three out of five Native women have been \nassaulted by their spouses or intimate partners. On some reservations, \nNative American women are murdered at a rate more than 10 times the \nnational average. Think about those statistics for a minute. They are \nchilling. Native women are being brutalized and killed at rates that \nshock the conscience. We simply could not continue to ignore\n\n[[Page S941]]\n\nthis ongoing and devastating violence, and I am proud that as a country \nwe said ``enough.''\n  A key provision in the Leahy-Crapo bill, now law, recognizes tribes' \nspecial domestic violence criminal jurisdiction to prosecute non-Indian \noffenders who commit acts of domestic violence against an Indian on \ntribal land. This provision also faced strong opposition by some but we \nheld firm in the belief that a tribal government should be able to hold \naccountable those who commit these heinous crimes against its people on \nits land. I was so proud when voices from around the country--Indian \nand non-Indian--joined our message that this was a VAWA to protect all \nvictims and refused to give in. With their unified support, we beat \nback efforts to strip out this critical provision. That is why I was \nparticularly pleased to see the launch of the new pilot project last \nweek in which three tribes--the Umatilla, the Pascua Yaqui, and the \nTulalip--will begin to exercise this authority we fought so hard to \nprotect. I ask unanimous consent that a recent Washington Post article \nhighlighting this project be printed in the Record.\n  Other key provisions of the new law include funding to help law \nenforcement and victim service providers reduce domestic violence \nhomicides, including in my home State of Vermont. It is leading to more \ninvestigation and prosecution of rape and sexual assault crimes and a \ngreater focus on these issues on college campuses. It is also helping \neliminate backlogs of untested rape kits to help those victims receive \njustice and security promptly.\n  Unfortunately, one provision that was not included in the final VAWA \nbill was a modest increase in the number of U visas available to \nimmigrant victims of domestic violence and other crimes. These visas \nare an important law enforcement tool that encourages immigrant victims \nto report crime, making us all safer. I reluctantly agreed to remove \nthis provision and instead ensured its inclusion in the comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill the Senate passed last year. As the House \nconsiders ways to move on that important issue, I urge them to include \nan increase in U visas so that all victims of domestic violence will be \nprotected.\n  The Violence Against Women Act is an example of how the Federal \nGovernment, in cooperation with State and local communities, can help \nsolve problems. By providing new tools and resources to communities all \naround the country, we have helped bring the crimes of rape and \ndomestic violence out of the shadows. There is much we can learn from \nthat effort as we consider legislation that should similarly rise above \npolitics.\n  After the Senate passed the bill last year, I mentioned a tragic \nincident that had just occurred. A man shot and killed two women \nwaiting to pass through metal detectors at a courthouse, where he was \nstalking another victim. Two male police officers also were struck by \nbullets but were saved by their bulletproof vests. At that time, I \nurged this body to reauthorize the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant \nProgram so that more of our law enforcement officials can be protected. \nSadly, a year later, that effort remains incomplete.\n  Before I came to the Senate, I spent years in local law enforcement \nand have great respect for the men and women who protect us every day. \nWhen I hear Senators say that we should not provide Federal assistance, \nwe should not help officers get the protection they need with \nbulletproof vests, or that we should not help the families of fallen \npublic safety officers, I strongly disagree.\n  In our Federal system, we can help and when we can, we should help. \nThat is what programs like the Violence Against Women Act are all \nabout. Despite our different political perspectives, most of us came to \nthe Senate with the goal of helping people. We must be able to find \ncommon ground to do that. I hope that this body can again come together \nto protect the American people and support law enforcement like we did \n1 year ago today when we passed the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act and the Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 8, 2014]\n\n       New law offers protection to abused Native American women\n\n                           (By Sari Horwitz)\n\n       White Earth Nation, Minn.--Linda Davidson. Lisa Brunner \n     remembers the first time she saw her stepfather beat her \n     mother. She was 4 years old, cowering under the table here on \n     the Ojibwe reservation, when her stepfather grabbed his \n     shotgun from the rack. She heard her mother scream, ``No, \n     David! No!''\n       ``He starts beating my mother over the head and I could \n     hear the sickening thud of the butt of the shotgun over her \n     head,'' Brunner said. ``Then he put the gun back on the rack \n     and called her a bitch. He slammed the bedroom door and sat \n     down on the squeaky bed. And then I heard the thud-thud of \n     his cowboy boots as he laid down, squeaking again, and he \n     went to sleep.''\n       There were many more beatings over the years, Brunner said. \n     Twenty years later, she said, she was brutally assaulted by \n     her own husband on this same Indian reservation, an enormous \n     swath of Minnesota prairie that has seen its share of sorrow \n     for generations.\n       An estimated one in three Native American women are \n     assaulted or raped in their lifetimes, and three out of five \n     experience domestic violence. But in the cases of Brunner and \n     her mother, the assailants were white, not Native American, \n     and that would turn out to make all the difference.\n       Lisa Brunner of the Ojibwe tribe in Minnesota speaks on the \n     cycle of sexual violence Native American women, including \n     herself, have faced.\n       For decades, when a Native American woman has been \n     assaulted or raped by a man who is non-Indian, she has had \n     little or no recourse. Under long-standing law in Indian \n     country, reservations are sovereign nations with their own \n     police departments and courts in charge of prosecuting crimes \n     on tribal land. But Indian police have lacked the legal \n     authority to arrest non-Indian men who commit acts of \n     domestic violence against native women on reservations, and \n     tribal courts have lacked the authority to prosecute the men.\n       President Obama, joined by Vice President Biden, members of \n     women's organizations, law enforcement officials, tribal \n     leaders, survivors, advocates and members of Congress, signs \n     the Violence Against Women Act in March.\n       Last year, Congress approved a law--promoted by the Obama \n     administration--that for the first time will allow Indian \n     tribes to prosecute certain crimes of domestic violence \n     committed by non-Indians in Indian country. The Justice \n     Department on Thursday announced it had chosen three tribes \n     for a pilot project to assert the new authority.\n       While the law has been praised by tribal leaders, native \n     women and the administration as a significant first step, it \n     still falls short of protecting all Indian women from the \n     epidemic of violence they face on tribal lands.\n       The new authority, which will not go into effect for most \n     of the country's 566 federally recognized Indian tribes until \n     March 2015, covers domestic violence committed by non-Indian \n     husbands and boyfriends, but it does not cover sexual assault \n     or rape committed by non-Indians who are ``strangers'' to \n     their victims. It also does not extend to native women in \n     Alaska.\n       Proponents of the law acknowledge that it was drawn \n     narrowly to win support in Congress, particularly from \n     Republican lawmakers who argued that non-native suspects \n     would not receive a fair trial in the tribal justice system.\n       For their part, native women say they have long been ill-\n     served by state and federal law. U.S. attorneys, who already \n     have large caseloads, are often hundreds of miles away from \n     rural reservations. It can take hours or days for them to \n     respond to allegations, if they respond at all, tribal \n     leaders say. Native women also have to navigate a complex \n     maze of legal jurisdictions.\n       ``There are tribal communities where state police have no \n     jurisdiction and federal law enforcement has jurisdiction but \n     is distant and often unable to respond,'' said Thomas J. \n     Perrelli, a former associate attorney general who was one of \n     the administration's chief proponents of the amendment. \n     ``There are tribal communities where the federal government \n     has no jurisdiction but state law enforcement, which has \n     jurisdiction, does not intervene. And there are still other \n     tribal lands where there is a dispute about who, if anyone, \n     has jurisdiction. All of this has led to an inadequate \n     response to the plight of many Native American women.''\n       More than 75 percent of residents on Indian reservations in \n     the United States are non-Indians. In at least 86 percent of \n     the reported cases of rape or sexual assault of American \n     Indian and Alaska native women, both on and off reservations, \n     the victims say their attackers were non-native men, \n     according to the Justice Department.\n\n\n                             `Not enrolled'\n\n       The loophole in the American Indian justice system that \n     effectively provides immunity to non-Indians is the story of \n     a patchwork of laws, treaties and Supreme Court decisions \n     over generations.\n       At the root of the confusion about Indian jurisdiction is \n     the historical tension over Indian land. As American settlers \n     pushed Native Americans off their tribal lands and then \n     renegotiated treaties to guarantee tribes a homeland, large \n     areas of the reservations were opened for white families to \n     homestead.\n\n[[Page S942]]\n\n       That migration led to the modern-day reservation, where \n     Indians and non-Indians often live side by side, one farm or \n     ranch home belonging to a white family, the next one \n     belonging to an Indian family. It is a recipe for conflict \n     over who is in charge and who has legal jurisdiction over \n     certain crimes.\n       ``The public safety issues in Indian country are so \n     complicated,'' said Deputy Associate Attorney General Sam \n     Hirsch, one of the Justice Department officials who focus on \n     tribal justice issues. ``No one would have ever designed a \n     system from scratch to look like the system that has come \n     down to us through the generations.''\n       Over the past 200 years, there have been dramatic swings in \n     Indian-country jurisdiction and the extent of tribal powers.\n       In 1978, in a case widely known in Indian country as \n     ``Oliphant,'' the Supreme Court held that Indian tribes had \n     no legal jurisdiction to prosecute non-Indians who committed \n     crimes on reservations. Even a violent crime committed by a \n     non-Indian husband against his Indian wife in their home on \n     the reservation--as Brunner said happened to her on the White \n     Earth Nation reservation--could not be prosecuted by the \n     tribe.\n       The court said it was up to Congress to decide who had that \n     authority.\n       ``We are not unaware of the prevalence of non-Indian crime \n     on today's reservations, which the tribes forcefully argue \n     requires the ability to try non-Indians,'' the court said. \n     ``But these are considerations for Congress to weigh in \n     deciding whether Indian tribes should finally be authorized \n     to try non-Indians.''\n       Congress took no action for 35 years.\n       As a result, native women who were assaulted were often \n     told there was nothing tribal police could do for them. If \n     the perpetrator was white and--in the lingo of the tribes--\n     ``not enrolled'' in the tribal nation, there would be no \n     recourse.\n       ``Over the years, what happened is that white men, non-\n     native men, would go onto a Native American reservation and \n     go hunting--rape, abuse and even murder a native woman, and \n     there's absolutely nothing anyone could do to them,'' said \n     Kimberly Norris Guerrero, an actress, tribal advocate and \n     native Oklahoman who is Cherokee and Colville Indian. ``They \n     got off scot-free.''\n       In 2009, shortly after taking office, Attorney General Eric \n     H. Holder Jr. was briefed by two FBI agents on the issue of \n     violence on Indian reservations.\n       They told him about the soaring rates of assault and rape \n     and the fact that on some reservations, the murder rate for \n     native women is 10 times the national average.\n       ``The way they phrased it was, if you are a young girl born \n     on an Indian reservation, there's a 1-in-3 chance or higher \n     that you're going to be abused during the course of your \n     life,'' Holder said in an interview. ``I actually did not \n     think the statistics were accurate. I remember asking, `check \n     on those numbers.' ''\n       Officials came back to Holder and told him the statistics \n     were right: Native women experience the highest rates of \n     assault of any group in the United States.\n       ``The numbers are just staggering,'' Holder said. ``It's \n     deplorable. And it was at that point I said, this is an issue \n     that we have to deal with. I am simply not going to accept \n     the fact it is acceptable for women to be abused at the rates \n     they are being abused on native lands.''\n\n\n                             Measuring tape\n\n       Diane Millich, left, joins Attorney General Eric H. Holder \n     Jr. and Deborah Parker, vice chairwoman of the Tulalip Tribes \n     of Washington state, at the bill-signing ceremony in March.\n       Diane Millich grew up on the Southern Ute Indian \n     reservation, nestled in the mountain meadows of southwestern \n     Colorado. When she was 26, she fell in love and married a \n     non-Indian man who lived in a town just beyond the \n     reservation.\n       Not long after they were married, Millich's husband moved \n     in with her and began to push and slap her, she said. The \n     violence escalated, and the abuse, she said, became routine. \n     She called the tribal police and La Plata County authorities \n     many times but was told they had no jurisdiction in the case.\n       One time after her husband beat her, Millich said, he \n     picked up the phone and called the sheriff to report the \n     incident himself to show that he couldn't be arrested, she \n     said. He knew, she said, there was nothing the sheriff could \n     do.\n       ``After a year of abuse and more than 100 incidents of \n     being slapped, kicked, punched and living in terror, I left \n     for good,'' Millich said.\n       The brutality, she said, increased after she filed for a \n     divorce.\n       ``Typically, when you look backwards at crimes of domestic \n     violence, if less serious violence is not dealt with by the \n     law enforcement system, it leads to more serious violence, \n     which eventually can lead to homicide,'' said Hirsch, the \n     deputy associate attorney general.\n       One day when Millich was at work, she saw her ex-husband \n     pull up in a red truck. He was carrying a 9mm gun.\n       ``My ex-husband walked inside our office and told me, `You \n     promised until death do us part, so death it shall be,' '' \n     Millich recalled. A co-worker saved Millich's life by pushing \n     her out of the way and taking a bullet in his shoulder.\n       It took hours to decide who had jurisdiction over the \n     shooting.\n       Investigators at the scene had to use a measuring tape to \n     determine where the gun was fired and where Millich's \n     colleague had been struck, and a map to figure out whether \n     the state, federal government or tribe had jurisdiction.\n       The case ended up going to the closest district attorney. \n     Because Millich's husband had never been arrested or charged \n     for domestic abuse on tribal land, he was treated as a first-\n     time offender, Millich said, and after trying to flee across \n     state lines was offered a plea of aggravated driving under \n     revocation.\n       ``It was like his attempt to shoot me and the shooting of \n     my co-worker did not happen,'' Millich said. ``The tribe \n     wanted to help me, but couldn't because of the law. In the \n     end, he was right. The law couldn't touch him.''\n\n\n                              Section 904\n\n       Last year, Millich and other American Indian women came to \n     Washington to tell their stories to congressional leaders. \n     They joined tribal leaders in lobbying for the passage of the \n     288-page reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, \n     which included language proposed by the Justice Department \n     that for the first time would allow tribal courts to \n     prosecute non-Indians who assaulted native women on tribal \n     lands. It would also allow the courts to issue and enforce \n     protective orders, whether the perpetrator is Indian or non-\n     Indian.\n       Opponents of the provision, known as Section 904, argued \n     that non-native defendants would not be afforded a fair trial \n     by American Indian tribes. In the case of Alaska, the Senate \n     excluded Native Alaskan women because of especially \n     complicated issues involving jurisdiction.\n       At a town hall meeting, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) \n     said that ``under the laws of our land, you've got to have a \n     jury that is a reflection of society as a whole.''\n       ``On an Indian reservation, it's going to be made up of \n     Indians, right?'' Grassley said. ``So the non-Indian doesn't \n     get a fair trial.''\n       Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), another opponent, said the \n     Violence Against Women Act was ``being held hostage by a \n     single provision that would take away fundamental \n     constitutional rights for certain American citizens.''\n       The bill passed the Senate last February but was held up by \n     House Republicans over Section 904. They argued that tribal \n     courts were not equipped to take on the new responsibilities \n     and non-Indian constituents would be deprived of their \n     constitutional rights without being able to appeal to federal \n     courts.\n       ``When we talk about the constitutional rights, don't women \n     on tribal lands deserve their constitutional right of equal \n     protection and not to be raped and battered and beaten and \n     dragged back onto native lands because they know they can be \n     raped with impunity?'' Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) argued on the \n     floor.\n       Underlying the opposition, some congressmen said, was a \n     fear of retribution by the tribes for the long history of \n     mistreatment by white Americans.\n       With the support of Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a member of \n     the Chickasaw Nation, the House accepted the bill containing \n     Section 904 on a vote of 229 to 196. On March 7, President \n     Obama signed the bill with Millich, Holder and Native \n     American advocates at his side.\n       The Justice Department has chosen three Indian tribes-- the \n     Pascua Yaqui Tribe of Arizona, the Tulalip Tribes of \n     Washington state and the Umatilla tribes of Oregon-- to be \n     the first in the nation to exercise their new criminal \n     jurisdiction over certain crimes of domestic and dating \n     violence.\n       ``What we have done, I think, has been game-changing,'' \n     Holder said. ``But there are still attitudes that have to be \n     changed. There are still resources that have to be directed \n     at the problem. There's training that still needs to go on. \n     We're really only at the beginning stages of reversing what \n     is a horrible situation.''\n       Lisa Brunner and her daughter, Faith Roy, fold clothes at \n     home on the White Earth Indian reservation in Minnesota.\n\n\n                         Sliver of a Full Moon\n\n       Last summer, several Native American survivors of domestic \n     violence from around the country put on a play, ``Sliver of a \n     Full Moon,'' in Albuquerque. The play documented the story of \n     the abuse and rape of Native American women by non-Indians \n     and the prolonged campaign to bring them justice.\n       Using the technique of traditional Indian storytelling, \n     Mary Kathryn Nagle, a lawyer and member of the Cherokee \n     Nation in Oklahoma, wove together their emotional tales of \n     abuse with the story of their fight to get Washington to pay \n     attention.\n       Millich and Brunner played themselves, and actors played \n     the roles of members of Congress, federal employees and \n     tribal police officers who kept answering desperate phone \n     calls from abused native women by saying over and over again, \n     ``We can't do nothin',?'' ``We don't have jurisdiction,'' and \n     ``He's white and he ain't enrolled.''\n       Brunner portrayed herself in a play that told the story of \n     the abuse and rape of Native American women by non-Indians \n     and the campaign to bring them justice.\n       By that time, Brunner's intergenerational story of violence \n     and abuse had taken a painful turn. Her youngest daughter, \n     17, had been abducted by four white men who drove onto\n\n[[Page S943]]\n\n     the reservation one summer night. One of them raped her, \n     Brunner said.\n       It was the real-life version of author Louise Erdrich's \n     acclaimed fictional account of the rape of an Ojibwe woman by \n     a non-Indian in her 2012 book, ``The Round House.'' In both \n     the real and the unrelated fictional case, the new \n     congressional authority would not give the tribe jurisdiction \n     to arrest and prosecute the suspects, because they were not \n     previously known to the victim.\n       Last week, inside her home on the frigid White Earth \n     Nation, which was dotted by vast snowy cornfields and \n     hundreds of frozen lakes, Brunner brought out a colorful \n     watercolor she had painted of three native women standing in \n     the woods under a glowing full moon. The painting was the \n     inspiration for the title of Nagle's play, she said, but it's \n     also a metaphor for the new law.\n       ``We have always known that non-Indians can come onto our \n     lands and they can beat, rape and murder us and there is \n     nothing we can do about it,'' Brunner said. ``Now, our tribal \n     officers have jurisdiction for the first time to do something \n     about certain crimes.''\n       ``But,'' she added, ``it is just the first sliver of the \n     full moon that we need to protect us.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/12/senate-section/article/S943-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GI EDUCATION BENEFITS FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I introduced a bill this week that would \nfix a small problem with the Post-9/11 GI bill that is creating big \nproblems for some servicemember and veteran families.\n  In 2010, SFC Angela Dees sent her son, Christopher Webb, to the \nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago after receiving approval from DOD \nthat she could transfer her GI benefits to pay for his education.\n  Dees first enlisted in the Army in 1998. At the time, she was \nmarried, and Christopher was her stepson. But after a divorce, she went \nto court and obtained sole legal custody, raising him from a 2-year-old \ninto a young man. Since she never formally adopted him he was legally \nconsidered her ward.\n  But no matter how you slice it, Angela Dees is Chris's mother, and he \nis her son.\n  But halfway through Chris's first year at UIC, he received a letter \nfrom the VA telling him that he could no longer use his mother's GI \nbenefits. The letter explained that he needed to repay the first year's \nbenefits, $30,000.\n  What happened?\n  It turns out they were caught in a bureaucratic wrinkle with enormous \nimplications for this family. Foster children and legal wards like \nChris are considered dependents by the Department of Defense, but not \nby the VA.\n  Servicemembers can pass along their GI Bill benefits to their spouses \nor children if they re-up for 4 more years. So Angela did that. In good \nfaith, she signed an Army contract for 4 more years so that she could \ngive her son a college education.\n  But the left hand of government did not know what the right hand of \ngovernment was doing. So when it came time for the VA to pay Chris's \ntuition bill, VA said no. In their case, neither of them had the money \nto repay the VA, so Chris had to drop out of school and get a job in \norder to pay it back.\n  According to DOD, at least 25 students are in the same boat--approved \nby DOD, they enrolled in school only to have their benefits revoked by \nthe VA when the bill came due.\n  It is an expensive bureaucratic nightmare for these families, and it \nshould be fixed.\n  The Post-9/11 GI bill is the most comprehensive education benefits \npackage for servicemembers since 1944. It was the first time we granted \nservicemembers the opportunity to transfer some or all of their earned \nbenefits to family members.\n  But in this small way it is clear that the benefit does not match our \nintent.\n  The GI Education Benefits Fairness Act, S. 2014, will fix that.\n  This bill is very simple: it will align the definition of an \n``eligible child'' at the DOD and the VA so that wards and foster \nchildren also qualify, and it will offer retroactive payment to those \nwhose benefits were revoked because of the original discrepancy.\n  The bill has the support of many veteran and military advocacy \ngroups: the Military Officers Association of America, Veterans of \nForeign Wars, the American Legion, Student Veterans of America, the \nNational Military Family Association, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans \nof America, the Association of the United States Navy, and the Foster \nParent Association of America.\n  In the House, Representatives Bill Foster and Cathy McMorris Rodgers \nare leading a companion bill in a bipartisan effort.\n  These servicemembers have made good on their obligations to our \ncountry. And the GI Education Benefits Fairness Act allows us to make \ngood on the promises we have made to them.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/12/senate-section/article/S943-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I wish to discuss the circumstances many \nunemployed families face.\n  Millions of Americans have lost their jobs through no fault of their \nown and now face serious financial consequences.\n  Many families are having trouble paying the rent or their mortgage, \nor they are struggling to buy necessities for their children.\n  On February 6, the Senate voted, again, to try to extend unemployment \nbenefits for the long-term unemployed who are down on their luck.\n  But we still fell one vote short. We needed one more Republican.\n  I hope one of my colleagues on the Republican side will join us soon \nto get that legislation over the top and help folks who have been \nhurting since the first of the year. Getting this benefit extended is \nonly one of the problems that unemployed families have faced in my \nState.\n  Thousands of unemployed Floridians have had their benefits delayed by \nflaws in the State's new automated unemployment system.\n  The website is called ``Florida CONNECT.''\n  But ironically it has left many Floridians disconnected.\n  We started hearing about some of the problems people were facing soon \nafter the website was launched late last year.\n  When I started hearing about these reports, I asked U.S. Labor \nSecretary Thomas Perez to investigate.\n  And I am pleased to report that the Department of Labor is now \nworking with the State to sort out who should be getting their checks.\n  I am told most of the people who were stuck in this mess have either \nstarted getting the benefits they deserve or have received a letter \ndirecting them to a human being they can talk to and resolve possible \nproblems with their applications.\n  I trust that the State of Florida will hold anyone responsible for \nthat flawed website completely accountable for this mess.\n  In the meantime I hope that we here in the Congress will do our part \nto help folks that are down and out and pass the extension of benefits \nfor long-term unemployed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/12/senate-section/article/S943-3", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S943-S944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE SOCHI OLYMPICS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as we speak, the 22nd Winter Olympics are \nwell under way in Sochi, Russia.\n  Let me first congratulate the organizers on a fantastic opening \nceremony. It really was something to see the depth and breadth of \nRussia's rich history and culture on display for the entire world to \nadmire.\n  The Olympics put a powerful spotlight on Russia--a spotlight Russia's \npresident has so vigorously sought. But just as this attention is \neducating the world about Russia's invaluable contributions to music, \nscience, and sport, it is also highlighting the gaps between Russia's \nprevious commitment to fundamental freedoms and the reality on the \nground.\n  There is no question that in recent years we have seen Russia move \ntowards a less open, less pluralistic society. But we cannot lose hope \nyet. Change is possible and Russia's beleaguered but tenacious civil \nsociety offers much hope for the future. We continue to expect Russia's \nleadership to uphold basic and universal human rights. Now there are \nother countries where the situation is much worse, but Russia is a \npowerful global example and should be committed to upholding \nfundamental freedoms much like Germany or the United Kingdom, its \nEuropean neighbors. But unlike those governments, Russia's current \nleadership wantonly violates international commitments and seems bent \non trying to redefine a settled consensus on the universality of human \nrights. We cannot let that go unchallenged.\n  Much has been said about Russia's 2013 law prohibiting so-called gay \npropaganda. Some have pointed to the fact\n\n[[Page S944]]\n\nthat this law enjoys widespread public support while others have \nfaintly condemned it and worried that Western pressure could be \ncounterproductive. Let's stop negotiating with ourselves here and tell \nit like it is. And it is really quite simple: this law infringes on the \nrights to free speech, association, and assembly. These rights are not \nAmerican rights, they are human rights, and they are universally shared \nand universally binding. Russia acknowledged as much in myriad \ninternational commitments. And this law is just the tip of the \nproverbial iceberg when it comes to fundamental freedoms in Russia.\n  In recent days it has been fashionable to change the colors of your \nwebsite or make other symbolic gestures of solidarity with Russia's \nLGBT community. I applaud this and have done as much myself, but let's \nnot kid ourselves or rest on our laurels. It takes little courage to \nswap an avatar on Twitter or to use a coded phrase in a statement and \nit is going to take a lot more to change the world for the better. As \nimportant as these symbols of solidarity are, let's not confuse them \nwith the steady and sustained activism that will be necessary to \nhighlight human rights abuses in Russia long after the flame goes out \nin Sochi.\n  I have heard much speculation of a further crackdown in Russia after \nthe Olympic spotlight fades, and I would note that the ongoing unrest \nin Ukraine is watched with great interest from Russia. While the \nKremlin appears nervous at the prospects of renewed demonstrations at \nhome or the success of any grassroots uprising on its borders, many in \nMoscow and St. Petersburg appear envious that the Ukrainian protests \nhave shown staying power and the ability to pry concessions from the \nruling elite. I worry that if anything could provoke a crackdown inside \nRussia post-Sochi, a turn of events in Ukraine could well prove that \ntrigger and I urge the administration to double-down on its efforts to \nhead off further violence. That is why I introduced the Global Human \nRights Accountability Act, which would ensure human rights abusers from \nanywhere in the world are denied entry into the United States and \nbarred from using our financial institution.\n  Finally, let me commend our current and outgoing ambassador to the \nRussian Federation, Dr. Michael McFaul, for a job well done. Dr. McFaul \nserved with distinction in a tough post at a tough time and did a \nfantastic job of representing our country's openness and ``can do'' \nspirit. He will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/12/senate-section/article/S944-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            PURITAN BACKROOM\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and honor the \nPuritan Backroom in Manchester, a beloved New Hampshire restaurant that \ncelebrates its 40th anniversary this month. The Backroom has earned its \nplace as one of the Granite State's most popular family restaurants, \nserving up delicious dishes for four decades.\n  Today, the Backroom is part of a tradition of outstanding hospitality \nthat dates back for nearly a century in New Hampshire's Queen City. In \n1917, Arthur Pappas and Louis Canotas, who immigrated to the United \nStates from Greece, opened an ice cream and candy shop on Hanover \nStreet. They started a restaurant the following year, the first of \nseveral in Manchester and beyond. In 1938, Pappas and Canotas opened an \nice cream stand on Daniel Webster Highway, later adding a candy shop \nand a restaurant. In February 1974, the Puritan Backroom served its \nfirst meal, and it is now a fourth generation family business.\n  There is something for everyone on the menu at the Backroom--from \nfresh seafood, to prime rib, to their saute specials.\n  The restaurant is perhaps most famous for its fried chicken tenders, \nwhich come with duck sauce, and can be ordered in a few different \nways--regular, coconut, buffalo or spicy. Or, you could get them \nbroiled in the Backroom's special sauce. Or, you could have chicken \ntenders parmigiana or chicken tenders cacciatore.\n  For dessert, you can not beat the Backroom's homemade ice cream. On \nhot summer nights, it is not unusual to see customers lined up in front \nof the ice cream stand, eager to choose from among dozens of flavors. \nYou will find the standard offerings--vanilla and chocolate--alongside \nBackroom favorites, including: Baklava, Moose Tracks, and Mudslide. \nSpeaking of mudslides, they're also on the drink menu, and the Backroom \nwas once recognized for being the top buyer in the Nation of Baileys \nIrish Cream.\n  The Puritan Backroom is more than just a restaurant. It is part of \nthe heart and soul of Manchester, NH. It is a place for friends to meet \nand enjoy a meal. And it is a place for families to celebrate special \noccasions. I know that my family always looks forward to heading to the \nBackroom, where we know we will see familiar and friendly faces.\n  The family ownership, management and staff of the Backroom have made \nthis special restaurant a true New Hampshire treasure. The Backroom \nsets the standard for excellence in hospitality in the Granite State, \nand I am so proud to join citizens across our State in congratulating \nthe Puritan Backroom on its 40th anniversary. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/12/senate-section/article/S944-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ASCAP'S 100TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the centennial \nof ASCAP, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.\n  When ASCAP's founders gathered in a New York hotel 100 years ago, \nthey could not have imagined what the future held in store for the \nmusic industry, and the central role their organization would play in \nthe music community. ASCAP's membership has grown to include more than \n\\1/2\\ million songwriters, composers, and publishers. Among these are \nsome of America's most beloved musical talents, but ASCAP is also home \nto thousands of lesser known musicians who inspire and delight us.\n  ASCAP licenses nearly 9 million musical works. The royalties ASCAP \ncollects on behalf of its members, and the additional resources it \nprovides, empower thousands of musicians to follow their lifelong \npassion for music while providing for themselves and their families. \nASCAP is truly an invaluable resource both for songwriters and \ncomposers as well as the music loving community they serve.\n  Over the years, ASCAP has been a tireless advocate for strong \nintellectual property protections. It continues to be at the forefront \nof the movement for sensible intellectual property laws that can keep \npace with changes in technology, all the while serving the interests of \nboth music creators and consumers in the digital age.\n  It is critically important that both music creators and consumers \nhave certainty about the relevant legal rules and protections. Yet, the \ncurrent regulatory regime that governs ASCAP's operations may need to \nbe updated to keep pace with innovations in how music is created, \nshared, and enjoyed. An updated legal regime is important not only for \nthe musicians that make up ASCAP's membership, but also for the \ncontinued enjoyment of all their listeners among the American people. \nAs Congress contemplates reforming our country's copyright law, it is \nmy hope that this and other related issues will be given careful \nconsideration.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in recognizing ASCAP's 100 years of \ntireless advocacy on behalf or songwriters, composers, and publishers, \nand wish them 100 more years of great music and success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/12/senate-section/article/S944-3", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S944-S945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING MICHAEL ANGELO OLIVERIO, SR.\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of \na dear friend and a remarkable West Virginian who was taken from us on \nFebruary 5, 2014. Michael Angelo Oliverio, Sr. was a dedicated public \nservant, an inspiring educator and a passionate civic leader who was \nrespected and admired by all who knew him. He led an extraordinary life \nthat will always be remembered in the hearts of the countless \nindividuals whose lives he touched.\n  The son of an Italian immigrant shepherd, Mike was born and raised in \nthe town of Carolina in Marion County, just a few miles down the road \nfrom my hometown of Farmington. Like many other families in North \nCentral West Virginia, our families' ancestors both originated from the \nsame town in\n\n[[Page S945]]\n\nItaly, San Giovanni in Fiore. Our shared heritage was truly a special \naspect of our family friendship.\n  Mike lived a life of unprecedented success both professionally and \npersonally. He graduated from Monongah High School, Fairmont State \nCollege, West Virginia University, and also received postgraduate \neducation from the University of Virginia, College of St. Thomas, \nMinnesota, and George Washington University.\n  He was a tireless advocate for the disabled community, which was \nrecognized not only in West Virginia but on a national level. As the \npresident of the National Rehabilitation Counseling Association and \nalso president of the National Rehabilitation Association International \nAdvocacy Group for Persons with Disabilities, he met with Congress and \nPresidents Carter and Ford to promote laws for persons with \ndisabilities.\n  With a heart of gold, Mike passionately served his community, his \nState and his country. He served for more than 10 years as the \nMonongalia County clerk, served as chairman of the Community Advisory \nCommittee, and vice chairman on the national board of the American \nHeart Association.\n  Genuinely committed to improving the lives of all West Virginians, \nMike helped start the Kennedy Correctional Center and founded the \nRonald McDonald House. He also designed and facilitated the building of \na memorial honoring fathers and President John F. Kennedy in Star City \ncalled ``A Father's Love.''\n  Additionally, he served as chairman of the Fairmont State University \nBoard of Advisors, the Klingberg Development Center Advisory Committee, \nNorth Central West Virginia Goodwill Board, People Aware of Children \nExceptional (PACE), West Virginia Italian Heritage Festival, and St. \nMary's Roman Catholic Church.\n  During his life, Mike received many awards for his incredible works--\nof which he was most proud, Mike received the National Nathan Hale \nAward for Patriotism and the F. Ray Power Award for Administration \nState Director Internationally.\n  Promoting his family's cultural history and Italian heritage was one \nof Mike's greatest passions. He made West Virginia and Calabria, Italy, \nsister states and conducted the twinning process joining Clarksburg and \nSan Giovanni in Fiori, Italy. He also initiated an exchange program \nwith students from the University of Calabria and Fairmont State \nUniversity. He was rightly awarded the International Award for \nAchievement and Humanity in Rome, Italy.\n  Mike took many trips to Italy throughout his life, but there was one \ntrip in particular I know he cherished most. Dubbed ``The Oliverio Boys \nTour,'' Mike traveled to the homeland in 2009 with his three sons, Joe, \nMike, and Frank; his brother, John; and his cousins, Jason, Maryn, and \nNate.\n  During the trip they were blessed to spend time with relatives and \nfriends in the region and experience the authentic Italian traditions, \npassion and food. As they walked the streets, natives knew the \nAmericans were in town and that Mike Oliverio had brought his family. \nThey were hosted by many of Mike's second and third cousins, including \nMario Oliverio, who had recently been elected President of the Region. \nIt was very important to him to travel around Italy together as a \nfamily and to explore their roots. I know it was a special memory he \nheld close to his heart.\n  Mike was not only reputable and accomplished in his public life, but \nhe was also an unparalleled example of a dedicated family man--a \ndevoted husband, a proud father, and a wonderful grandfather. Much of \nhis success he credited to his late wife, Julia, who supported him in \nall of his endeavors. His children are accomplished and respected \nthroughout our state.\n  I will never forget a special dinner my wife, Gayle, and I shared at \nthe Governor's Mansion in 2007 with Mike, Julia, and their family--Joe, \nPaula, Alyssa, Mary, Christina, Maria, Mike, Melissa, Frank, Amy, \nJulia, Aunt Teresa Gabriele, and a family friend, Jessica Faulkenberry. \nIt was just two weeks before Julia lost her life to ovarian cancer and \nwe were celebrating her birthday. I remember being touched by the love \nshared within their family and the strength they had in one another. \nYou see, the Oliverios personify the power of families--working hard, \nsupporting one another, and standing together when times get tough.\n  Anyone who knew Mike Oliverio can tell about his incredible ability \nto inspire each person he encountered to live a life of purpose. \nPersonally, I have lost a dear friend and mentor. And although he will \nbe forever remembered for his many years of service, he will also be \nremembered as a loving father, grandfather, and friend. He was truly a \nlocal legend in our State, and though he will be greatly missed, his \nlegacy will always live on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/12/senate-section/article/S945-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/12/senate-section/article/S945-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/12/senate-section/article/S945-3", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:17 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, with an amendment, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       S. 25.

A bill to reform the financing of Senate elections, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when it comes to understanding the \ninfluence of big money donors on congressional and presidential \ncampaigns, the numbers don't lie. In 2012, the top 32 donors to super \nPACs spent as much money as every single small donation to President \nObama and Governor Romney combined. The top 32 donors to super PACs \nspent as much money as every single small donation to President Obama \nand Governor Romney combined. That means 32 individuals contributed as \nmuch as 3.7 million Americans. In 2012, candidates from both the House \nand Senate raised the majority of their funds from large donations of \n$1,000 or more. Forty percent of all contributions to Senate candidates \ncame from donors who maxed out at the $2,500 contribution limit, \nrepresenting just .02 percent of the American population. The amount of \nmoney special interest lobbies, wealthy donors, corporations and super \nPACs are willing to spend to shape policy has grown exponentially since \nCitizens United and it is expected to increase.\n  This dramatic increase in spending tells us that special interests \nare not going to be shy about saying to Members of Congress: If you \nvote against our interests, we will spend millions to make sure you \nnever get a chance to vote again. That is a terrible reality for many \nMembers of Congress who are trying to make honest decisions about \npolicy. It is an even worse statement about our democracy.\n  I think it is time for fundamental reform of the way we finance \ncongressional elections. We need a system that allows candidates to \nfocus on their constituents, their districts, and their States, instead \nof fundraising. We need a system that encourages ordinary Americans--\nthe candidates I call mere mortals--to make their voices heard with \nsmall, affordable donations to candidates of their choice.\n  That is why I am introducing the Fair Elections Now Act. The Fair \nElections Now Act will dramatically\n\n[[Page S950]]\n\nchange the way campaigns are financed in America. This bill lets \ncandidates focus on the people they represent, regardless of whether \nthese people have wealth or whether they are going to attend big money \nfundraisers. Fair elections candidates would be in the policy business, \nregardless of what policies are preferred by the special interests.\n  I thank Senators Boxer, Brown, Cardin, Franken, Gillibrand, Harkin, \nHeinrich, Klobuchar, Leahy, Markey, Menendez, Merkley, Murphy, Sanders, \nShaheen, and Warren for joining me in this effort.\n  The Fair Elections Now Act will help restore public confidence in \ncongressional elections. It provides qualified candidates for Congress \nwith grants, matching funds, and vouchers from the Fair Elections Fund \nto replace campaign fundraising that now relies largely on lobbyists, \nwealthy donors, corporations, and other special interests. In return, \nparticipating candidates would agree to limit their campaign spending \nto amounts raised from small-dollar donors plus the amounts provided \nfrom the Fair Elections Fund.\n  There are three stages for Senate candidates under this bill. To \nparticipate, candidates would first need to prove their viability by \nraising a minimum number and amount of small-dollar qualifying \ncontributions from in-State donors. Once a candidate qualifies, that \ncandidate must limit the amount raised from each donor to $150 per \nelection.\n  For the primary, participants would receive a base grant that would \nvary in amount based on the population of the State that the candidate \nseeks to represent. Participants would also receive a 6-to-1 match for \nsmall-dollar donations up to a defined matching cap. The candidate \ncould raise an unlimited amount of $150 contributions if needed to \ncompete against high-spending opponents.\n  For the general election, qualified candidates would receive an \nadditional grant, further small-dollar matching, and vouchers for \npurchasing TV advertising. The candidate could continue to raise an \nunlimited amount of $150 contributions if needed. Instead of spending \nso much time courting donors and super PACs, fair elections candidates \nwould have an incentive to spend their time with the middle-class \nAmericans they want to represent. Candidates would have an incentive to \nseek small donations, and citizens would have an incentive to donate.\n  Under the Fair Elections Now Act, the average citizen would know \ntheir small donation of $150 would be converted to a $900 donation \nthrough the 6-to-1 fair elections match. They would also be eligible \nfor a refundable tax credit. The Fair Elections Now Act would establish \nthe ``My Voice Tax Credit'' to encourage individuals to make small \ndonations to campaigns. The maximum refundable amount for the tax \ncredit would be $25 for individuals and $50 for joint filers. To ensure \nthe tax credit targets small donors, it is only available to \nindividuals who do not contribute more than $300 to a candidate or \npolitical party in any given year.\n  Our country faces major challenges. Everybody knows we need to reduce \nthe deficit, modernize our energy policy, create good-paying jobs, \nreform the Tax Code, and many other things. What many people may not \nknow is that at every turn, there are high-powered special interests \nfighting each and every one of these proposals. It is difficult for \nMembers of Congress not to pay attention to the concerns of these \nspecial interests when the Members have to raise money for their own \ncampaigns.\n  This bill would change the whole ball game. It would reduce the \ninfluence of these special interest lobbyists and wealthy donors. As a \nresult, the bill would enhance the voice of average Americans.\n  Let me be clear. I honestly believe the overwhelming majority of the \npeople serving in political life are good, honest people, and I believe \nSenators and Congressmen are guided by the best of intentions. But we \nare stuck in a terrible system. The perception is that politicians are \ncorrupted because of all the big money we each have to raise. Whether \nit is true or not, that perception and the loss of trust that goes with \nit makes it incredibly difficult for the Senators to solve tough \nproblems. That is why so many Americans have Congress in such low \nregard. This problem--the perception of pervasive corruption--is \nfundamental to our democracy, and we need to address it.\n  Fair elections is not a farfetched idea. Fair election systems are \nalready at work in cities and States around America. Similar programs \nexist and are working well in jurisdictions throughout the country from \nMaine to Arizona. These programs are bringing new faces and new ideas \ninto politics, making more races more competitive, and dramatically \nreducing the influence of special interests.\n  The vast majority of Americans agree it is time to fundamentally \nchange the way we finance political campaigns. Recent polling shows \nthat 75 percent of Democrats, 66 percent of Independents, and 55 \npercent of Republicans support fair elections-style reform. The Fair \nElections Now Act is supported by numerous good government groups, \nformer Members of Congress from both parties, prominent business \nleaders, and even some lobbyists. Everyone is entitled to a seat at the \ntable, but no one is entitled to a special seat, or maybe the only \nseat. The Fair Elections Now Act will reform our campaign finance \nsystem so Members of Congress can focus on implementing policies in the \nbest interests of the people who sent them to Washington.\n  The Presiding Officer just finished a campaign, and I know, having \nvisited with her in her home State, she worked hard. I am in the midst \nof a reelection campaign myself. I know I am working hard. A lot of \ntime is being spent on the telephone, raising money from a lot of \ngenerous people.\n  I say in politics there are millionaires and the mere mortals. I am \nin the second category, and that means I can't write a check to cover \nthe cost of a campaign. I have to hope enough people want to support me \nin my effort. With those contributions I will be buying media--\nprimarily television, radio, Internet advertising, some mailings--and \npaying for a headquarters and volunteers. It is expensive in a big \nState such as Wisconsin or Illinois.\n  In the Citizens United era, where the traditional campaigns I just \ndescribed are frankly not even close to the reality of what candidates \nface, one incumbent Democratic Senator now up for reelection has had \nover $8 million spent against her in her home State with negative \nadvertising that has gone on for months--for months. It is being paid \nfor by some very wealthy billionaires. These billionaires, in this case \nthe Koch Brothers, spent, I believe, $248 million of their own money in \nthe last election cycle. They are, in fact, a political party to \nthemselves. They decide the candidates they support, which, \ncoincidentally, are all in the other political party, and they invest \nhuge sums of money in those election efforts. Make no mistake. We are \nraising money on the Democratic side too, but not nearly to the numbers \nwe see on the other side.\n  This business of politics is being swamped with money in amounts and \nlevels we have never seen before. What it means is that if an incumbent \nor even a challenger wants to have a viable campaign, they spend more \nand more time raising money if they can't write a personal check to \ncover it--and most of us can't. So instead of being back in my State, \nworking on issues that are important in the Senate, I spend a lot of \ntime fundraising. We have become so used to it. It is like the frog in \nthe pot of water on the stove that may not sense the increase in \ntemperature until the water is boiling and it is too late. We are in \nthat same predicament. We are watching, election after election, the \ncost of campaigns go through the roof. It discourages good people from \nengaging in the political process. It makes small contributors feel as \nthough they are such small peanuts that nobody even notices.\n  We have to change that whole concept. I am reluctant to say this, but \nso far, this campaign finance reform bill is only being cosponsored by \nMembers of one political party. I have tried for years to get \nRepublican support for campaign finance reform. The only Republican \nSenator who would ever join me was Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who \nultimately changed political parties on me--not on me, but changed \npolitical parties and then I didn't have bipartisan sponsorship.\n  The point I am getting to is this should be a bipartisan issue.

FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.\n\n       (a) Undermining of Democracy by Campaign Contributions From \n     Private Sources.--The Senate finds and declares that the \n     current system of privately financed campaigns for election \n     to the United States Senate has the capacity, and is often \n     perceived by the public, to undermine democracy in the United \n     States by--\n       (1) creating a culture that fosters actual or perceived \n     conflicts of interest by encouraging Senators to accept large \n     campaign contributions from private interests that are \n     directly affected by Federal legislation;\n       (2) diminishing or appearing to diminish Senators' \n     accountability to constituents by compelling legislators to \n     be accountable to the major contributors who finance their \n     election campaigns;\n       (3) undermining the meaning of the right to vote by \n     allowing monied interests to have a disproportionate and \n     unfair influence within the political process;\n       (4) imposing large, unwarranted costs on taxpayers through \n     legislative and regulatory distortions caused by unequal \n     access to lawmakers for campaign contributors;\n       (5) making it difficult for some qualified candidates to \n     mount competitive Senate election campaigns;\n       (6) disadvantaging challengers and discouraging competitive \n     elections; and\n       (7) burdening incumbents with a preoccupation with \n     fundraising and thus decreasing the time available to carry \n     out their public responsibilities.\n       (b) Enhancement of Democracy by Providing Allocations From \n     the Fair Elections Fund.--The Senate finds and declares that \n     providing the option of the replacement of large private \n     campaign contributions with allocations from the Fair \n     Elections Fund for all primary, runoff, and general elections \n     to the Senate would enhance American democracy by--\n       (1) reducing the actual or perceived conflicts of interest \n     created by fully private financing of the election campaigns \n     of public officials and restoring public confidence in the \n     integrity and fairness of the electoral and legislative \n     processes through a program which allows participating \n     candidates to adhere to substantially lower contribution \n     limits for contributors with an assurance that there will be \n     sufficient funds for such candidates to run viable electoral \n     campaigns;\n       (2) increasing the public's confidence in the \n     accountability of Senators to the constituents who elect \n     them, which derives from the program's qualifying criteria to \n     participate in the voluntary program and the conclusions that \n     constituents may draw regarding candidates who qualify and \n     participate in the program;\n       (3) helping to reduce the ability to make large campaign \n     contributions as a determinant of a citizen's influence \n     within the political process by facilitating the expression \n     of support by voters at every level of wealth, encouraging \n     political participation, and incentivizing participation on \n     the part of Senators through the matching of small dollar \n     contributions;\n       (4) potentially saving taxpayers billions of dollars that \n     may be (or that are perceived to be) currently allocated \n     based upon legislative and regulatory agendas skewed by the \n     influence of campaign contributions;\n       (5) creating genuine opportunities for all Americans to run \n     for the Senate and encouraging more competitive elections;\n       (6) encouraging participation in the electoral process by \n     citizens of every level of wealth; and\n       (7) freeing Senators from the incessant preoccupation with \n     raising money, and allowing them more time to carry out their \n     public responsibilities.\n\n     SEC. 102.

Res. 355\n\n       Whereas, on March 9, 2012, Afghan General Abdul Rahim \n     Wardak and United States Marine General John Allen signed a \n     Memorandum of Understanding in which the United States \n     reaffirmed its commitment to transfer Afghan nationals \n     detained by the United States Armed Forces at the Detention \n     Facility in Parwan (DFIP) to Afghanistan, provided that the \n     Government of Afghanistan establish an administrative \n     detention regime under its domestic law and comply with its \n     international obligations with respect to due process;\n       Whereas, on March 25, 2013, a Memorandum of Understanding \n     between the United States and Afghanistan called for the \n     creation of an Afghan Review Board (ARB) to convene under \n     Afghan law to determine the disposition of all Afghan \n     detainees;\n       Whereas, in the event of a dispute over the disposition of \n     detainees, the March 2013 Memorandum of Understanding also \n     commits the Government of Afghanistan to exchange views and \n     information between the Minister of Defense and the Commander \n     of United States Forces, Afghanistan before any detainee is \n     released;\n       Whereas the Government of Afghanistan has announced the \n     imminent release of 65 dangerous individuals from the DFIP \n     without referral to the Afghan justice system, despite \n     evidence showing these detainees have engaged in violent \n     crimes against the Afghan people and under protest from \n     United States Forces, Afghanistan;\n       Whereas detainees from this group of 65 are directly linked \n     to attacks wounding or killing 32 United States or Coalition \n     Forces and attacks wounding or killing 23 Afghan National \n     Security Forces or Afghan civilians;\n       Whereas the United States Government has declassified and \n     provided hundreds of pages of evidence and investigative \n     leads to the ARB;\n       Whereas the Justice Center in Parwan has successfully \n     adjudicated more than 3,000 criminal cases of individuals who \n     committed acts of terror against Coalition Forces, Afghan \n     National Security Forces, and the people of Afghanistan;\n       Whereas there is a legitimate force protection concern for \n     the lives of Coalition Forces and Afghan National Security \n     Forces if any disputed individual is released, since the \n     primary weapon of choice is the improvised explosive device, \n     which also poses a significant threat to Afghan civilians;\n       Whereas there is evidence that some detainees already \n     released by the ARB have rejoined the fight against Coalition \n     Forces;\n       Whereas, despite evidence to the contrary, President of \n     Afghanistan Hamid Karzai stated the prisoners set to be \n     released are innocent and must be released;\n       Whereas releasing the dangerous detainees deprives the \n     people of Afghanistan of their day in court and undermines \n     the rule of law in the country;\n       Whereas the release of detainees under these conditions is \n     not authorized, and the ARB is performing an extra-judicial \n     function, contrary to the rule of law in Afghanistan; and\n       Whereas this extrajudicial action harms the prospective \n     Bilateral Security Agreement between the United States and \n     Afghanistan for post-2014 United States military presence in \n     the country: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) insists President of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai honor the \n     terms included in the Memorandum of Understanding, dated \n     March 25, 2013;\n       (2) insists that if the Afghan Review Board (ARB) will not \n     follow the conditions set forth in the Memorandum of \n     Understanding, that the ARB shall be dismantled and the \n     National Directorate for Security (NDS) and Afghan \n     prosecutors shall determine how to handle the remaining \n     detainees;\n       (3) urges close and continuing communication between the \n     Minister of Defense and the Commander of United States \n     Forces, Afghanistan prior to the release of any detainee;\n       (4) urges the Government of Afghanistan to cease the extra-\n     judicial release of detainees and instead refer the dangerous \n     individuals and the remainder of the ARB cases for \n     prosecution at the Justice Center in Parwan or for \n     investigation by the NDS; and\n       (5) calls on the Secretary of State to consider the \n     Government of Afghanistan's adherence to existing detainee \n     memoranda of understanding in implementing the certification \n     requirements for assistance for Afghanistan under section \n     7044(3) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and \n     Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2014 (division K of \n     Public Law 113-76).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/12/senate-section/article/S957-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S957-S958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 356--DESIGNATING FEBRUARY 13, 2014, AS ``$2.13 DAY''\n\n  Mr. BROWN (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Markey, Ms. Warren, Mrs. \nMurray, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Casey, Mr. Whitehouse, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. \nSanders, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Hirono, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nDurbin, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Heinrich, and Mr. Franken) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 356\n\n       Whereas $2.13 per hour is the Federal minimum wage that an \n     employer is required to pay a tipped employee (as defined in \n     section 3(t) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 203(t))) as a cash wage under section 3(m) of such Act \n     (29 U.S.C. 203(m)) (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``Federal minimum wage for tipped employees'');\n       Whereas when the Federal minimum wage for a tipped employee \n     was established in 1966, such wage was linked to the Federal \n     minimum wage for a covered nonexempt employee under section \n     6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. \n     206(a)(1));\n       Whereas while the Federal minimum wage for a covered \n     nonexempt employee increased in 2009, the Federal minimum \n     wage for a tipped employee has not changed in more than 20 \n     years;\n       Whereas in the 1980s, the Federal minimum wage for a tipped \n     employee reached 60 percent of the Federal minimum wage for a \n     covered nonexempt employee, and in 2014, the Federal minimum \n     wage for a tipped employee is only 29 percent of the $7.25 \n     per hour Federal minimum wage for a covered nonexempt \n     employee;\n       Whereas tipped employees work in many occupations, \n     including working as restaurant servers, airport attendants, \n     hotel workers, valets, and salon workers;\n       Whereas $2.13 per hour is such a low wage that tipped \n     employees are dependent on the discretional contributions of \n     consumers for the majority of their income;\n       Whereas 7 States have 1 minimum wage for both tipped \n     employees and covered nonexempt employees, and the restaurant \n     industry has continued to thrive in such States;\n       Whereas in States with a minimum wage for a tipped employee \n     that is higher than $2.13 per hour, the poverty rate for \n     tipped employees is lower than the poverty rate for tipped \n     employees in States without such a higher minimum wage for \n     tipped employees;\n       Whereas restaurant servers have a poverty rate that is 3 \n     times that of the general workforce and are nearly 2 times \n     more likely to depend on the supplemental nutrition \n     assistance program established under the Food and Nutrition \n     Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.) than the general \n     workforce;\n       Whereas States with a minimum wage for a tipped employee of \n     $2.13 per hour have a poverty rate for employees of color \n     that is nearly double that of States with the highest minimum \n     wage for a tipped employee;\n       Whereas women account for 66 percent of all tipped \n     employees and 71 percent of restaurant servers;\n       Whereas 1/3 of tipped employees are parents who work hard \n     to support their families;\n       Whereas the Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that from \n     2008 to 2018, the food preparation and serving sector, as \n     defined by the Bureau, would add more than 1,000,000 jobs;\n       Whereas such food preparation and serving sector has the \n     lowest median wages of the top 20 growth sectors; and\n       Whereas raising the Federal minimum wage for a tipped \n     employee would provide hardworking people in the United \n     States with more just wages, lift families in the United \n     States out of poverty, and provide economic security to \n     tipped employees in the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S958]]\n\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate designates Thursday, February 13, 2014, as \n     ``$2.13 Day''; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that the cash wage that \n     an employer is required to pay a tipped employee (as defined \n     in section 3(t) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 203(t))) under section 3(m) of such Act (29 U.S.C. \n     203(m)) should be increased to 70 percent of the Federal \n     minimum wage for a covered nonexempt employee under section \n     6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. \n     206(a)(1)).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/12/senate-section/article/S958-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 357--EXPRESSING CONCERN OF UNDEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE \n         AND THE ABUSE OF THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS IN UKRAINE\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. Risch) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 357\n\n       Whereas the political crisis that has engulfed Ukraine \n     reflects the people's desire for a democratic state which \n     rejects corruption and abides by the rule of law;\n       Whereas Ukraine is a participating State of the \n     Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) \n     and has made commitments to respect the human rights of its \n     citizens;\n       Whereas, in 2009, Ukraine joined the European Union's \n     Eastern Partnership initiative, pledging to uphold the shared \n     values of democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human \n     rights;\n       Whereas the Government of Ukraine committed to judicial and \n     electoral reforms to align with those of the European Union \n     in preparation for the signing of an Association Agreement \n     with the European Union;\n       Whereas, on Thursday, November 21, 2013, Ukraine President \n     Viktor Yanukovych announced that Ukraine would not sign an \n     Association Agreement with the European Union, causing \n     thousands of Ukrainians to assemble in Kiev's Maidan Square \n     in peaceful protest;\n       Whereas, on November 30 and December 11, 2013, Ukrainian \n     paramilitary police used excessive force against peaceful \n     demonstrators in Kiev's Maidan Square;\n       Whereas, on January 16, 2014, the parliament of Ukraine \n     passed anti-protest legislation restricting the right to \n     peaceful assembly and the exercise of free speech, \n     constraining independent media, and inhibiting the operation \n     of nongovernmental organizations;\n       Whereas it is unclear whether these measures were passed \n     legally, or have subsequently been entirely repealed;\n       Whereas, on January 20, 2014, Freedom House stated it is \n     ``deeply concerned by Ukrainian authorities' targeted \n     violence against journalists during public protests in Kiev - \n     demonstrations spurred by President Viktor Yanukovych's \n     signing into law measures that tightly limit public protests, \n     among other rollbacks on freedom'';\n       Whereas, on January 22, 2014, the actions of authorities in \n     Ukraine resulted in the death of two protestors, including \n     one who was ``brutally beaten by two riot police officers,'' \n     according to Amnesty International;\n       Whereas, on January 30, 2014, Freedom House stated that \n     ``at least five Euromaidan activists are still reported \n     missing, some since November 30, 2013 when anti-government \n     demonstrations intensified'';\n       Whereas there are substantiated reports of kidnappings, \n     including the abduction and torture of opposition activist \n     Dmitrii Bulatov, and evidence of police brutality carried out \n     against protesters and other activists, and the Ukrainian \n     nongovernmental organization EuroMaidan SOS claims that as \n     many as 27 people may be missing;\n       Whereas, on January 31, 2014, Human Rights Watch found that \n     ``Ukrainian police assaulted and injured dozens of \n     journalists and medical workers while trying to disperse \n     street fighters and protesters in Kiev'' and called upon the \n     international community to ``press Ukraine to investigate \n     serious human rights violations and prosecute those \n     responsible in accordance with international due process \n     standards'';\n       Whereas, on January 31, 2014, Freedom House reported that \n     ``more than 40 journalists have been injured covering the \n     demonstrations'' and that ``[m]any of the reporters were \n     attacked while wearing visible identification of their status \n     as journalists'';\n       Whereas the Government of Ukraine has continued to \n     intimidate and use violence against journalists and others \n     expressing political opinions critical of the current \n     government; and\n       Whereas, on January 7, 2014, the United States Senate \n     passed a resolution expressing support for the people of \n     Ukraine in light of public resistance to President \n     Yanukovych's decision not to sign an Association Agreement \n     with the European Union: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the President should increase democracy and human \n     rights programming in Ukraine to the extent possible;\n       (2) the United States Government should immediately review \n     security assistance funding for any organization in Ukraine \n     involved in repressive efforts that violate the civil or \n     human rights of the people of Ukraine;\n       (3) the United States Mission to the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) should utilize the \n     resources and mechanisms of the OSCE to monitor and address \n     human rights concerns, including the Office for Democratic \n     Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and Representative on \n     Freedom of Media (RFM);\n       (4) the United States Representative to the United Nations \n     Human Rights Council should address Ukraine appropriately to \n     bodies such as the United Nations Human Rights Council;\n       (5) the Department of State should immediately consider the \n     imposition of targeted sanctions, including visa bans and \n     asset freezes, against the perpetrators of state-sanctioned \n     violence in Ukraine against peaceful protesters, journalists, \n     and other members of civil society;\n       (6) the United States Government should urge authorities in \n     Ukraine to locate missing persons and release all political \n     prisoners, including former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, \n     and hold perpetrators of extra-legal measures accountable;\n       (7) the United States Government should work closely with \n     the European Union to strengthen and support its efforts in \n     Ukraine;
