Mr. President, yesterday the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives, John Boehner, on national TV claimed there are not \nenough votes to pass the bill and bring an end to the dangerous \ngovernment shutdown. I believe he is mistaken.\n  Two hundred Democratic Members of the House of Representatives said \nthey would vote for the bill to reopen the government, and 22 \nRepublicans in the House have said publicly they would vote for the \nbill. We have heard there are as many as 100 who wish to vote for it. \nNo matter how we do the math, it adds up to a majority of the Members \nof the House of Representatives.\n  If there were only a mechanism for polling all Members of the House \nof Representatives to find out whether they support the Senate-passed \nbill, one surefire way to find out whether the bill would pass is to \nhave a vote on it; that is, to vote on the legislation that has already \nbeen passed in the Senate.\n  There is a way; have a vote. That would settle the question for a \nlong, long, time, wouldn't it.\n  What I say to the Speaker: Allow a vote on the resolution that would \nend the shutdown, legislation that you, John Boehner, proposed in the \nfirst place. The entire Federal Government could reopen for business by \ntomorrow morning.\n  I ask the Speaker, why are you afraid? Are you afraid this measure \nwill pass, the government will reopen and America will realize you took \nthe country hostage for no apparent reason?\n  Why is the Speaker opposed to these reasonable solutions.\n  Across the Nation people are suffering--not only Federal employees--\nbecause of his irresponsible action, the irresponsible tea party driven \naction. But it is not, I say, only Federal employees. US Air had a \ndelivery last Friday of a $180 million aircraft. They couldn't take \ndelivery. Why? Because there weren't inspectors to do that for those \naircraft.\n  We know that Lockheed has already announced today they are laying off \n3,000 people, and there is more to come in the defense industry. It is \nhappening all through the government.\n  There is an easy way out of this; the same escape hatch has been \navailable as long as we have been a country. It is called a vote. But \nfor the 7 days the Federal Government has been closed for business, the \nSpeaker has refused to use that escape hatch.\n  It is so important when people wish to buy a home. One can't buy a \nhome with an FHA loan today. Even if it is not FHA, they can't get them \ndone because to confirm the amount of money that is on the application \nthey need an IRS person to check it. They are not available.\n  The Senate-passed bill to reopen the government, while we work out \nour\n\n[[Page S7246]]\n\nbudget differences, wasn't my idea. It was his idea. The Speaker of the \nHouse of Representatives said: You do this CR at this number, and I \nwill get it done.\n  We negotiated for a while. I agreed to his number. It was very hard \nto do for us in the Democratic Caucus. But it was his idea, not my \nidea. All this talk about not negotiating, that is what that was all \nabout. He admits it was his intention all along to pass a clean \nresolution. But then he ran into the tea party, a minority within a \nmajority that runs the majority in the House of Representatives.\n  The bill before the House of Representatives is a compromise by us, a \ncompromise that was difficult, I repeat, to get my caucus to accept. \nNow that we have compromised, the Speaker won't take yes for an answer. \nHe has moved the goal line again.\n  Last week he said he wanted to go to conference to work out some \ndifferences. As we heard on national TV yesterday, he is not only \nconcerned about ObamaCare, he is concerned about the budget deficit, as \nwe all are. He keeps changing. He said he wanted to talk about that. \nFine. We are happy to do that. If he wants to talk about ObamaCare, if \nhe wants to talk about anything else, we will do it. I put that in \nwriting and had it hand delivered to him. We said that we would talk \nabout agriculture, we would talk about health care, we would talk about \ndomestic discretionary spending, military spending, and anything he \nwishes to talk about. We have been asking to go to conference on a \nresponsible budget for more than 6 months.\n  On national TV, the Speaker said Chairman Ryan and Chairman Murray \nhave been working together for a long time. As I have indicated here \npreviously, he said that in a meeting we had in the White House in the \nlast few days. I said in front of everybody there: It is simply not \nfactual.\n  Senator Murray issued a statement yesterday after she heard him \nsaying this on national TV saying that is not true. They have had a \ncouple of meetings but they haven't discussed anything substantive. I \nguess the meetings were only to say to the Speaker they met, but they \ntalked about nothing in her budget or his budget.\n  We are saying simply, reopen the government. We have said we will go \nto your budget number. We don't like it. We have said we will go to \nconference and talk about anything you want.\n  He can't take yes for an answer.\n  Simply reopen the government. We will talk, I repeat, about anything \nyou wish to talk about. We are not afraid to negotiate. We are not \nafraid to make reasonable compromises. Once again the football was \nmoved, just like Lucy in the ``Peanuts'' cartoon.\n  As Judd Legum, editor-in-chief of ThinkProgress pointed out, \nRepublicans have a strange definition of compromise. This is how he \nexplains it:\n  Republicans ask: ``Can I burn down your house?'' We say: ``No.'' \nRepublicans ask: ``Just the second floor?'' We say: ``No.'' Republicans \nask: ``[Just the] garage?'' We say: ``No.'' Republicans say: ``Let's \ntalk about what I can burn down.'' We say: ``No.'' Then Republicans \nsay: ``You're not compromising!''\n  Republicans insist we must negotiate while the Federal Government \nremains closed. As The New York Times editorial reported on Saturday, \nwhen 800,000 Federal employees are furloughed, government services are \nshut down and the economy is flagging, it is hardly time for talking.\n  Then they come up with all this: We will do an NIH bill. We will open \nNIH.\n  The problem is, it is really hard to pick and choose between that and \nthe Park Service, especially when we consider they have cut spending \nthis year for NIH by $1.6 billion; the second year of their famous \nsequestration, $2 billion. This is all a charade.\n  This is what the Times wrote after the brief introduction:\n\n       This is a moment for immediate action to reopen the \n     government's doors, not the beginning of a conversation \n     Republicans spurned when they lacked the leverage of a \n     shutdown.\n       [Republicans] have refused to negotiate over the Senate's \n     budget, they have refused to negotiate over the President's \n     budget, and they have refused to negotiate to make the health \n     law more efficient. . . . The two sides will eventually have \n     to reach a reckoning on long-term economic issues, but the \n     time to do so is not while dangling over an abyss.\n\n  Democrats are willing to negotiate but won't negotiate with a gun to \nour heads. We say to our Republican colleagues: End this irresponsible \ngovernment shutdown. Stop your reckless threats of a default on the \nNation's obligations. Then Democrats will negotiate over anything, \nanything our Republican colleagues wish to negotiate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/07/senate-section/article/S7246-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

We are now in the second week of a government shutdown \nthat nobody claims to want.\n  Democrats say it is unreasonable to ask for any changes or delays to \nObamaCare. Republicans, we think the ObamaCare rollout has proven \nbeyond a shadow of a doubt just how reasonable a delay is. If anybody \nhad any doubts about the need to delay this thing, those doubts should \nhave been allayed this weekend when the administration admitted its Web \nsite wasn't working and took it offline for repairs.\n  Delay and basic fairness are what Republicans are asking for at this \npoint, not exactly the Sun and the Moon.\n  Another thing Republicans have been saying is that if we can't agree \non a bill to fund the entire government, let's at least pass the most \nurgent pieces of it. Let's at least pass the parts we can all agree on. \nThat is exactly what the House has begun to do.\n  Over the past several days, the two parties in the House have \nresponsibly come together and passed no fewer than eight bills to fund \nthings such as the Coast Guard, the Guard and Reserve, and programs for \nveterans. In other words, the House has quietly shown the two parties \naren't completely at odds in this debate and that there is, in fact, \nsome common ground here. Slowly but surely the House has approved \nfunding for folks who shouldn't get caught in the middle of a political \nimpasse such as this. They have done it on a bipartisan basis.\n  Over the weekend the House passed a bill that said a government \nshutdown doesn't affect the free exercise of religion on military \nbases, and 184 Democrats agreed. Another bill said government workers \nshouldn't have to wonder how they are going to pay their bills during a \nshutdown, and 189 Democrats agreed with that.\n  The bill to fund FEMA drew 23 Democrats. The one to fund NIH drew 25; \nnational parks, 23.\n  Let's be clear here that the problem isn't the House. There is \nactually a fair amount of agreement among Republicans and Democrats \nover in the House, that Republicans and lawmakers have a duty and a \nresponsibility that rises above the politics of the moment to fund \nthings such as veterans, cancer trials, the National Guard, and \nreservists in every State.\n  The problem is the Senate.\n  I know Democrats don't like it, but the American people have given us \ndivided government for two elections in a row. They gave us a \nRepublican House, and they gave us a Democratic Senate.\n  This means negotiation isn't a luxury; it is a necessity. Until \nSenate Democrats accept reality, these crises will only be harder to \nresolve. So I would suggest they start thinking about how they might \nstart playing a constructive role in the crisis and in the challenges \nthat lie ahead. There is a time for politics, and there is a time for \nsitting down like adults and working things out. Republicans are ready \nand willing to negotiate. We invite Senate Democrats to join us.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/07/senate-section/article/S7246-3", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me start off by acknowledging an \narticle which appeared in today's New York Times attributed to the \nSenate Chaplain, Dr. Barry Black, who led us in prayer to open the \nSenate's session. It is entitled ``Give Us This Day, Our Daily Senate \nScolding,'' and it goes on to talk about the prayers which Dr. Black, \nour Senate Chaplain, has offered during the course of the last week \nduring the government shutdown. They say in the article the morning \ninvocation has turned into a daily conscience check for the 100 men and \nwomen of the Senate.\n  The article points out that in the course of one of his prayers Dr. \nBlack said:\n\n       Remove from them that stubborn pride which imagines itself \n     to be above and beyond criticism. Forgive them the blunders \n     they have committed.\n\n  I can't match his baritone voice and delivery when it comes to these \nprayers, but I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this \narticle as a tribute to our Senate Chaplain who has been given the \nawesome responsibility to prove the power of prayer during the midst of \na government shutdown.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 6, 2013]\n\n              Give Us This Day, Our Daily Senate Scolding\n\n                         (By Jeremy W. Peters)\n\n       Washington.--The disapproval comes from angry constituents, \n     baffled party elders and colleagues on the other side of the \n     Capitol. But nowhere have senators found criticism more \n     personal or immediate than right inside their own chamber \n     every morning when the chaplain delivers the opening prayer.\n       ``Save us from the madness,'' the chaplain, a Seventh-day \n     Adventist, former Navy rear admiral and collector of brightly \n     colored bow ties named Barry C. Black, said one day late last \n     week as he warmed up into what became an epic ministerial \n     scolding.\n       ``We acknowledge our transgressions, our shortcomings, our \n     smugness, our selfishness and our pride,'' he went on, his \n     baritone voice filling the room. ``Deliver us from the \n     hypocrisy of attempting to sound reasonable while being \n     unreasonable.''\n       So it has gone every day for the last week when Mr. Black, \n     who has been the Senate's official man of the cloth for 10 \n     years, has taken one of the more rote rituals on Capitol \n     Hill--the morning invocation--and turned it into a daily \n     conscience check for the 100 men and women of the United \n     States Senate.\n       Inside the tempestuous Senate chamber, where debate has \n     degenerated into daily name-calling--the Tea Party as a band \n     of nihilists and extortionists, and Democrats as socialists \n     who want to force their will on the American people--Mr. \n     Black's words manage to cut through as powerful and \n     persuasive.\n       During his prayer on Friday, the day after officers from \n     the United States Capitol Police shot and killed a woman who \n     had used her car as a battering ram, Mr. Black noted that the \n     officers were not being paid because of the government \n     shutdown.\n       Then he turned his attention back to the senators. ``Remove \n     from them that stubborn pride which imagines itself to be \n     above and beyond criticism,'' he said. ``Forgive them the \n     blunders they have committed.''\n       Senator Harry Reid, the pugnacious majority leader who has \n     called his Republican adversaries anarchists, rumps and \n     hostage takers, took note. As Mr. Black spoke, Mr. Reid, \n     whose head was bowed low in prayer, broke his concentration \n     and looked straight up at the chaplain.\n       ``Following the suggestion in the prayer of Admiral \n     Black,'' the majority leader said after the invocation, \n     seeming genuinely contrite, ``I think we've all here in the \n     Senate kind of lost the aura of Robert Byrd,'' one of the \n     historical giants of the Senate, who prized gentility and \n     compromise.\n       In many ways, Mr. Black, 65, is like any other employee of \n     the federal government who is fed up with lawmakers' \n     inability to resolve the political crisis that has kept the \n     government closed for almost a week. He is not being paid. \n     His Bible study classes, which he holds for senators and \n     their staff members four times a week, have been canceled \n     until further notice.\n       His is a nonpartisan position, one of just a few in the \n     Senate, and he prefers to leave his political leanings vague. \n     He was chosen in 2003 by Senator Bill Frist, a Tennessee \n     Republican who was the majority leader at the time, from a \n     group of finalists selected by a bipartisan committee. Before \n     that he ministered in the Navy for nearly 30 years.\n       ``I use a biblical perspective to decide my beliefs about \n     various issues,'' Mr. Black said in an interview in his \n     office suite on the third floor of the Capitol. ``Let's just \n     say I'm liberal on some and conservative on others. But it's \n     obvious the Bible condemns some things in a very forceful and \n     overt way, and I would go along with that condemnation.''\n       Last year, he participated in the Hoodies on the Hill rally \n     to draw attention to the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. In \n     2007, after objections from groups that did not like the idea \n     of a Senate chaplain appearing alongside political figures, \n     he canceled a speech he was scheduled to give at an \n     evangelical event featuring, among others, Tony Perkins of \n     the conservative Focus on the Family and the columnist and \n     author Ann Coulter.\n       Mr. Black, who is the first black Senate chaplain as well \n     as its first Seventh-day Adventist, grew up in public housing \n     in Baltimore, an experience he draws on in his sermons and \n     writings, including a 2006 autobiography, ``From the Hood to \n     the Hill.''\n       In his role as chaplain, a position that has existed since \n     1789, he acts as a sounding board, spiritual adviser and \n     ethical counselor to members of the Senate. When he prays \n     each day, he said, he recites the names of all 100 senators \n     and their spouses, reading them from a laminated index card.\n       It is not uncommon for him to have 125 people at his Bible \n     study gatherings or 20 to 30 senators at his weekly prayer \n     breakfast. He officiates weddings for Senate staff members. \n     He performs hospital visitations. And he has been at the side \n     of senators when they have died, most recently Daniel K. \n     Inouye of Hawaii in December.\n       He tries to use his proximity to the senators--and the fact \n     that for at least one minute every morning, his is the only \n     voice they hear--to break through on issues that he feels are \n     especially urgent. Lately, he said, they seem to be paying \n     attention.\n       ``I remember once talking about self-inflicted wounds--that \n     captured the imagination of some of our lawmakers,'' he said. \n     ``Remember, my prayer is the first thing they hear every day. \n     I have the opportunity, really, to frame the day in a special \n     way.''\n       His words lately may be pointed, but his tone is always \n     steady and calm.\n       ``May they remember that all that is necessary for \n     unintended catastrophic consequences is for good people to do \n     nothing,'' he said the day of the shutdown deadline.\n       ``Unless you empower our lawmakers,'' he prayed another \n     day, ``they can comprehend their duty but not perform it.''\n       The House, which has its own chaplain, liked what it heard \n     from Mr. Black so much that it invited him to give the \n     invocation on Friday.\n       ``I see us playing a very dangerous game,'' Mr. Black said \n     as he sat in his office the other day. ``It's like the \n     showdown at the O.K. Corral. Who's going to blink first? So I \n     can't help but have some of this spill over into my prayer. \n     Because you're hoping that something will get through and \n     that cooler heads will prevail.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I picked up the newspaper, at least went \nonline to look at the newspapers from Illinois this morning, and two \nstories jumped right off the page. One was in the Bloomington \nPantagraph. What a great story it is and makes me so proud to be from \nthe Midwest and to represent people who are, by their very nature, \npretty darned extraordinary. It is a story that comes out of Lexington, \nIL, about an event that happened yesterday, and I will quote just a bit \nof it.\n\n       More than 60 area farmers, truckers and their families \n     gathered north of Lexington on Sunday morning to pay back a \n     friend who had helped them out at one time or another during \n     his 71-year lifetime. Some 16 combines harvested more than \n     300 acres of corn as friends of Dave Thomas brought in \n     Thomas' last harvest. Thomas died of a heart attack on July \n     22 and his wife Sharon and four sons, decided to end the \n     family's farm operations.\n\n  The article went on to say how it broke the family's heart to give up \nthis family farm, but these neighbors pitched in. They wanted to \nharvest David Thomas' land and to make sure that last crop was brought \nin for his family. It is the kind of compassion and caring and family \nand community which we see in many States, but I see over and over in \nmy home State of Illinois.\n  This is not unique. It happens often, and every time it does it is \nworthy of note because it is such a special comment on the people of \nthis great Nation and their caring for their neighbors.\n  The area farmers in Chenoa, not too far from Lexington, are planning \na similar harvest operation for another neighbor, David Harrison, this \nmorning. Dave passed away last week.\n  Time and again these farm families put aside their own physical \ncomfort, their own daily schedules, their own lives to help one \nanother. It is such a wonderful comment on this great Nation that we \ncall home and the area I am so proud to represent.\n  The second article that jumped off the page after I read this came \nout of Kansas--Wichita, KS--and it quotes Tim Peterson. He is a wheat \nfarmer. I am not as familiar with wheat as I am corn and soybeans, but \nhe started talking about the problems he is running into. His problems \nare created by us because Tim doesn't have access to vital agricultural \nreports. They are casualties of the Federal Government shutdown. We \nstopped publishing this information, and farmers such as Tim\n\n[[Page S7248]]\n\nPeterson and others are forced to make some very important family \ndecisions, some important financial decisions without the necessary \ninformation.\n  These reports can alert them to shortfalls in overseas markets or if \nthere is a wide swing in acres planted, both of which might prompt U.S. \ngrowers to plant extra crops to meet demand or hang on to a harvest a \nlittle longer to get a better price.\n  Here are these farmers across the Midwest who have worked hard to \nreach this point in the harvest where they can make enough money to \nlive and to plant another year, to sustain their families and \ncommunities around them, and they have a problem. The problem is the \npoliticians in Washington who want to shut down the government.\n  What a contrast: farmers who rallied in Lexington, IL, for the family \nof a fallen farmer, to show they would stand by him through thick and \nthin and help him out--at least his family out through this adversity--\nand then this article and story in Kansas, where the Congressmen and \nSenators sent to Washington to do their job and to provide the basic \ninformation for these farmers have failed and in failing have made it \nmuch more difficult for these farmers.\n  Two articles in the morning papers from the central part of the \nUnited States of America, which brings home to me the graphic human \nside of this government shutdown. Something else brought it home \npersonally. When Harry Reid, our majority leader, announced we weren't \ngoing to have votes on Saturday or Sunday, I took the opportunity to \nget out of town and I raced off to be with my grandkids.\n  I have two twin grandchildren, 22 months old, and I just love them to \npieces. I thought getting away with them is exactly what I need, to get \nout of this town and to get my mind straight after a tough political \nweek. We had a ball. We did the normal things one would expect: going \nto the park and reading ``Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear?'' \nand all the things that are fun for a grandfather.\n  There were a couple moments, though--you see, they are almost 2 years \nold, and there were a couple moments during the weekend where one of \nthem would lose it for just a little while and start crying and \nscreaming uncontrollably and saying the word ``no'' over and over again \nand unable to express themselves because they just don't have the \nvocabulary to tell us what is on their minds. In those moments I felt \nas though I was back in Washington again.\n  The terrible twos temper tantrums sounded like Congress--people \nshouting no, screaming uncontrollably, and unable to express what they \nare doing and why they are doing it, and that is where we find \nourselves today.\n  On the morning talk shows yesterday, on Sunday, a number of leaders \ncame to speak, and of course everybody was focused on Speaker Boehner \nbecause he is the captain of the ship when it comes to the government \nshutdown, but it was interesting to me that what guided this government \nshutdown last week--ObamaCare, the health care reform bill--they were \nnot talking about so much anymore. It has been launched, and 9 million \npeople across America have visited the Web site because they are \ninterested in finding health insurance maybe for the first time in \ntheir lives or health insurance they can afford--9 million.\n  Because so many have come to these Web sites, the Republican leader \nis right, we have had trouble getting them moving forward. It will take \na few days to adjust to this volume of people coming on board to find \nout whether this insurance exchange can help them, their family or the \nbusiness. The good news for my colleague Senator McConnell, from \nKentucky, is that his State has been a real success story, with 8,000 \npeople having already signed up in Kentucky for health insurance on the \ninsurance exchange of ObamaCare.\n  I hope Senator McConnell and Senator Rand Paul take some pride in the \nfact that now 8,000--at least 8,000--Kentuckians have health insurance \nthey can afford and they can trust, some of them for the first time in \ntheir lives. When I hear this news, I wonder how these Senators from \nKentucky and some other States can say we want to repeal this, we want \nto get rid of this.\n  What are they going to tell those 8,000 families who finally have \nhealth insurance for the first time? Big mistake. Sorry. Go back to the \nmarketplace where you have no health insurance protection. That is \nhardly the response Americans want to hear in Kentucky, Illinois, in \nMaine or any other State.\n  What we are trying to do with ObamaCare, the health care reform act, \nis to open up an opportunity for 40 to 50 million Americans to have \nhealth insurance they can afford for the first time in their lives. \nWhat we have heard from the other side of the aisle is: Repeal it. \nDefund it. Delay it. Do anything you can to stop it. Stop it.\n\n  You know why they want to stop it? Because they understand that once \npeople's appetites are whetted for health care insurance they can \nafford and insurance where they can protect their families, there is no \nturning back. We are at a point in history, much as we were with the \ncreation of Social Security and Medicare, where we are offering to \nfamilies across America something they could not do by themselves and \nsomething they will value very much as part of their families and their \nfuture, and that is what is driving this fear on the other side of the \naisle. That is what is driving the government shutdown.\n  What is worse is October 17, the next deadline, and it is not that \nfar away. In another 9 or 10 days we are going to face a debt ceiling \nexpiration. The debt ceiling is basically America's mortgage. We have \nto extend our mortgage. We borrow money to manage our government, to \nfight wars, to pay our military, to do the most basic things. When we \nborrow that money, we have to have authorization from the government. \nThat is the debt ceiling.\n  Many of the same Senators and Congressmen who voted for this spending \nnow will not vote to pay the bill. That is akin to eating the big meal \nat the restaurant and, when the waiter brings the check, saying: I \nain't paying. How long would that last? That is what many are \nsuggesting when they say we are not going to extend the debt ceiling. \nThey have eaten the meal. They just don't want to pay the bill.\n  It would be the first time in the history of the United States we \nwould default on our national debt. The first time we would basically \nviolate the full faith and credit of the United States of America. It \nhas its consequences. The last time the tea party did this, America's \ncredit rating suffered. What happens when our credit rating suffers? \nThe interest rates we pay go up. Taxpayers are paying more to China and \ncountries that loan us money than they are paying to educate children, \nto build roads or do medical research.\n  Here we go again. Another threat by the Speaker that we are going to \ndefault on our national debt again. They threatened it 2 years ago, and \nthey have come back again--the tea party. This is totally \nirresponsible.\n  I read the newspapers from different countries and they look at the \nUnited States and shake their head and they wonder how this country, \nwhich many say--and I can certainly see the reason for it--is one of \nthe leaders in the world, can find itself in this manufactured \npolitical crisis again and again and again. It is like the temper \ntantrums of the terrible twos when we hear this. We think it is totally \nunnecessary. We have to help these kids grow up and get through it. \nAmerica has to grow up and stand and say to Congress: It is time for \nyou to grow up and stand and do the right thing for the future of this \ncountry.\n  I hope we can do this, and I hope we can do it together in a \nbipartisan fashion. This shutdown of the Federal Government should end \ntoday. The Speaker has before him a continuing resolution which he \ncould pass, could pass in a heartbeat, and the government would be \nextended. The farmer out in Kansas would have the information he needs, \nthe medical researcher would be back to work at the National Institutes \nof Health, and all of the agencies of the government would be \nfunctioning for the good of the American people. That is what we were \nsent to do. There are no excuses and no political reasons not to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to thank the distinguished Senator\n\n[[Page S7249]]\n\nfrom Illinois, the distinguished majority whip, for bringing up \nChaplain Barry Black's name and the article that appeared in the New \nYork Times. I know Senator Durbin and I do a lot of things together. \nOne of those things is just about every Wednesday morning we attend the \nSenate Prayer Breakfast. Replete through all of Barry's prayers at that \nbreakfast is always one word, and that is ``humility.'' I think the \nmessage in that article in the New York Times and the message in the \nprayers in the last 7 or 8 days in the Senate and the message to all of \nus right now is that we need to grasp a little humility and find common \nground among consternation and move this country forward.\n  To that end, I want to make my suggestion, for what it is worth, and \nI want to make mine as an inspiration with Senator Collins, the other \nSenator from the State of Maine who last week made her proposal. If we \ncan't find common ground with the arguments we have today, let's \nproffer a new proposal to give us a chance to solve our problem.\n  Susan Collins made a great suggestion, to replace the medical device \ntax with other revenue so it doesn't cut the revenue and to get back to \nsequestration but only by cutting defense agencies, not by cutting \nacross the board. That made a lot of sense. It provides a way to absorb \nthose cuts but does so in a professional way.\n  So I come to the floor in a Robert Frost moment. You know the poem:\n\n       ``Two roads diverged in a yellow wood. . . . I took the one \n     less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.''\n\n  We have been traveling down the wrong road for far too long. We are \nhere today, in large measure, arguing over a CR we shouldn't have to be \narguing over. Had we been doing our appropriations and doing our \nbudgets over the last 4 years, the money would have been spent, the \nregular order would have been in place, the fiscal year moneys would \nhave been appropriated, and there would be no need for a CR.\n  There is bipartisan responsibility for not having done a budget or an \nappropriations act. The leadership, obviously, controls the floor, so \nthey can bring the appropriations act forward and that is their \nresponsibility. But we have also cried out on our side for a budget. \nYear after year, let's have a budget. Now we have a budget, one \napproved by the House and one approved by the Senate, but an inability \nto go to conference because we can't get agreement on preconditions. \nOnce again, this is another situation of not negotiating over something \nthat is important to the American people.\n  So I have a suggestion, a suggestion that two-thirds of this Senate \nagreed to in the budget debate we had in March, a decision that 20 \nStates have exercised in our country that has made them better, a \ndecision the State of Israel made 2 or 3 years ago when they got into \nsuch dire financial conditions and went to the World Bank for \nsuggestions; that is, let's force our CR and add to it a simple \nresolution that changes our way of doing business to a biennial budget \nand appropriations act, where we force ourselves to appropriate over 2 \nyears and not 1, and make those appropriations in the odd-numbered \nyears so that in the even-numbered years we do only oversight.\n  It would make a lot of difference for the American people if we were \narguing over not how much bacon we were bringing home but how much \nmoney we were saving through oversight, savings, and fiscal \naccountability. I have introduced that legislation, along with Senator \nShaheen--a Democrat from New Hampshire and a Governor who ran a State \nunder a biennial budget. It makes sense, it is humble, it is the right \nway to do business, and it ends this necessity of having continuing \nresolutions at the last minute because we didn't do our job.\n  Let's face it. We are here today in the conundrum we are in because \nwe did not do our job. We did not pass a budget and go to a conference \ncommittee, we didn't have appropriations acts, so we are doing a \ncontinuing resolution into a new fiscal year. That is no way to run the \ngreatest country on the face of this Earth. Four years and running we \nhave shirked our responsibility. It is time for a new day in the \nSenate. It is time for a biennial budget. It worked for Israel. If it \nworked for 20 States, it will work for us. It establishes priorities, \nit ends waste, fraud, and abuse, and it brings about good decisions.\n  Last night on ``60 Minutes,'' Senator Tom Coburn from Oklahoma was \nfeatured, and the feature was about SSI disability and the fact that we \nnow pay $135 billion a year in SSI disability payments--a trebling of \nthose costs in just a few years--and fully 25 to 40 percent we know is \nfraudulent. Twenty-five to forty percent is $40 to $60 billion. You can \ndo a lot with $40 to $60 billion. That is where transparency and \noversight works.\n  There is nobody better than the Senator from Oklahoma in terms of \noversight and nobody more humble than the Senator from Oklahoma, but \nwhen he knows he is right, he is going to work hard to do what is \nright, and that is what all of us should be doing.\n  Referring to the Senator from Oklahoma, I go back to the Workforce \nInvestment Act, which Senator Murray and I are working very hard to \nbring to the floor. In that, Senator Coburn found forty-four \nduplicative job training programs in nine different agencies--over and \nover again. We are appropriating money forty-four different times to \nnine different agencies to do workforce training when we really only \nought to be doing one. If we were budgeting on a 2-year basis and doing \nother oversight in even-numbered years, there would be no limit to the \nsuccesses we could have, the transparency we could enforce, the \nagreements we could come to, and the lack of cliff management we are in \ntoday.\n  The debt ceiling we face in about 10 days is a debt ceiling we face \nbecause we are having to borrow more money to run our government. We \nare having to borrow more money to run our government because we are \nnot doing fiscal accountability, we are not doing appropriating, and we \nare going to continue for that to grow and grow.\n  As a businessman and a saver, I know what the time value of money is. \nThe time value of money means that if you put away a little bit of \nmoney every year and save for your kids' education, for your health \ncare, or whatever it might be, when the time comes and you need it, you \nwill have it. But I also know what the time cost of money is: when you \nare borrowing money to pay off borrowed money--and that is where we are \nin the United States of America today. So that is why this debt ceiling \ncrisis is such a big issue.\n  I would submit, and humbly, that the Shaheen-Isakson legislation that \nforces us to do our regular order of business of appropriating, forces \nus to budget, and forces us to do it every year puts us back to the \nkind of discipline and job responsibility we really need around this \nplace. Instead of arguing about what we can't agree upon, we ought to \nfind common ground and run our country's household the way American \nfamilies run their households. If we had to do here in Washington what \nevery American family has to do year in and year out, this place would \nbe a whole lot different.\n  It is time that we find humility, find common ground, do what 20 of \nthe 50 States do, do what the State of Israel has done, and do what 67 \nSenators said we ought to do in the budget debate back in March; that \nis, pass a biennial and appropriations act, end this foolishness, and \ngain back some of the humility we richly deserve.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \n2 extra minutes to pay tribute to a physician in my county.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The further remarks of Mr. Isakson are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. Isakson. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for his \ncall on this place to get back to regular order and to bridge our \ndifferences. I think it is an important one and a noble and hopefully \neasy request for us to ultimately follow.\n  I came down here this weekend to talk about a young woman in \nBridgeport, CT, who is at the epicenter of the fallout of this \nshutdown, and I wanted to come back down on Monday to tell her story \nvery briefly once again because the way a lot of trade papers\n\n[[Page S7250]]\n\ncover this shutdown makes it seem as if this is just about politics. If \nyou listen to some commentators and some members of the tea party crowd \nin the House of Representatives, they will tell you that what we are \ngoing to find in this shutdown is that everybody is going to learn that \nthe government really doesn't do that much and it is not that big a \ndeal if it goes away for a couple of months, a couple of weeks, a \ncouple of days.\n  What we are finding as we enter week 2 of this shutdown is we have \nnow moved past the point where the collapse of the government is just \nan inconvenience. It is now ruining lives. I wish Melanie Rhodes was \nthe exception, but she is increasingly becoming the rule across the \ncountry. The Presiding Officer heard me tell her story this weekend, \nbut I am going to do it again.\n  Melanie was homeless a couple years ago. She lives in the \nsouthwestern portion of Connecticut. She had hit really hard times, but \nshe decided to pull her life together--not the least of the reasons \nbeing that she has a little boy. She has a son Malachi. Malachi was \nborn about 2 months premature, so he was born with some developmental \ndisabilities that luckily, because of a government program, were caught \nearly on. The program is called Birth to Three. In Connecticut, it is \nour early intervention program. Most States have it. It is one of the \nprograms that are going to run out of funds pretty soon if we don't \nstart turning back on the faucet to State governments.\n  But even more important to Melanie was that through that early \nintervention screening program that figured out Malachi needed a little \nbit of extra help, they got him into a Head Start Program. He wasn't \neven 1 year old when he started the Head Start Program. Today he is 3, \nand he is making incredible progress. He has some serious issues. He is \njust now learning how to communicate with some signs he has been \ntaught. But he is doing better and doing better every single day.\n  On Monday night of last week Melanie stayed up all night watching to \nsee whether the government was still going to be operating because she \nknew the Bridgeport Head Start Program works on a fiscal year that \nmatches ours. So if the government shut down on October 1, the check \nwouldn't come to Bridgeport Head Start and they would have to send \n1,000 kids home.\n  But she also knew her life was starting to get brighter in other ways \nas well. She had been looking for a job for a long time and she had \ndone everything we asked of her. She had applied to everybody she could \nthink of, from Walmart to Walgreens to McDonald's, and hadn't found \nanything until a bus company decided to hire her as a driver. She had \ngone through her training; she was just waiting for her background \ncheck to come back. It was going to be OK and she was going to start \nwork. But, of course, the only way she could start work was if she had \ncare for her child. As she has said so eloquently over the past week, \nshe can't just leave Malachi with anybody because he is a kid with \nsubstantial difficulties and his caregivers need to know how to take \ncare of him. So if there is no Head Start, there is no school for \nMalachi, he regresses in terms of the progress he has made, and she \ncan't start her job. Her family essentially collapses around her simply \nbecause this place can't pass a budget. That is what is happening to \nMelanie, and she says simply this: We need our government and our \nbusinesses open. Why should we suffer and be held hostage while \ngovernment can't do what they need to do?\n  Her story can be repeated thousands of times across Connecticut. I \nthink I saw today that about 18,000 Head Start slots are going to be \nclosed by the end of this week. Unfortunately, her story is not the \nexception; it is becoming the rule. This is what this shutdown means. \nIt is not playacting. It is real.\n  As I watched some of the shows over the weekend, I heard a familiar \nrefrain from our Republican colleagues. They said: Yeah, we have this \ndemand that we want the health care law delayed or repealed or defunded \nin order to get the government up and operating, but really it is the \nDemocrats. It is Harry Reid, it is President Obama who won't sit down \nand negotiate. If they would just sit down and negotiate, then we could \nend this whole thing.\n  I understand how some people might watch and think to themselves, why \nwon't the Democrats just sit down and talk about this? So I would like \nto address this claim that the only thing stopping us from reopening \nthe government is Democrats won't talk to Republicans. I want to \naddress that in five simple ways.\n  First, I would make the point that every single one of my colleagues \nhas made: We have already talked. What we thought we were talking about \nwas a continuing resolution, a temporary budget that would keep the \ngovernment operating for about 6 weeks. A lot of Democratic critics \nactually would argue that we didn't really negotiate that well over \nthat particular issue because in the end the Senate passed a budget \nwith a particular number for the continuing resolution, the House \npassed a budget with a particular number for the continuing resolution, \nand the difference was pretty substantial, but in the end the Senate \njust decided to go with the House number. We didn't settle in between. \nWe didn't settle closer to ours or closer to theirs. We just took the \nHouse number. So we kind of feel, on the subject at hand, which is the \ncontinuing resolution, that the negotiation has already happened and we \ngave the House everything they wanted. There is not much more to \nnegotiate after you give them everything when it comes to the bottom-\nline number in the continuing resolution.\n  Second, it is kind of hard to have a negotiation when only one side \nis making demands. We don't have any demands in this negotiation. All \nwe want is for the things that normally happen to continue to happen--\ni.e., we want the government to stay open on the exact same terms the \ngovernment was open last week and the week before. We want the country \nto pay our bills just as we have paid our bills for a generation. It is \nonly Republicans--and, frankly, not all Republicans. Most Republicans \nin the Senate are not making these demands. It is mainly a small \nhandful in the House and the Senate who say: In order to keep the \ngovernment open, we want the health care law defunded or repealed or \ndelayed.\n  It is difficult to have a negotiation when all we want is the status \nquo.\n  It is kind of like if two people lived in a house and one of them \nsaid: I am going to take the roof off the house if you don't do what I \nwant. You wouldn't really negotiate that. That is an unreasonable \ndemand. The roof just needs to be there. It is something that, for good \nreason, is normally not the subject of debate or negotiation. And you \nwouldn't settle for half. You wouldn't allow your roommate to take half \nthe roof off. The roof just needs to be there, and if you are angry \nwith me about something or you want to talk about something, let's do \nit while the roof is still on.\n  We can't negotiate over the government just operating. We can't \nnegotiate over whether or not we are going to pay our bills. We don't \nwant anything. We just want things to happen as they have happened in \nthe past.\n  Third, this place just can't operate if in order to keep the \ngovernment open for 6 weeks we have to satisfy everybody's personal \npolitical agenda.\n  I also said this weekend I have things I believe in very strongly. I \nrepresent Sandy Hook, CT. I submit I feel just as strongly about \nbackground checks as the Senator from Texas does about the repeal of \nthe health care bill. But it would be unreasonable for me to say I am \nnot going to vote for a budget because I don't get my way on background \nchecks or immigration reform or tax fairness or whatever it may be that \nI care about outside the confines of the continuing resolution. If all \n100 Senators had to get their particular nonbudgetary political points \nsettled as a requirement of passing a continuing resolution, this place \nwould absolutely collapse.\n  Maybe that is what some people want. Maybe some people want \ngovernment to collapse and the government to shut down. But when I hear \npeople talk on this floor, I take them at face value, that that is not \nwhat they want. Ultimately we all cannot get what we need all the time.\n  Fourth, you normally need to compromise when you do not have \nconsensus, when you do not have agreement, when both the Senate and the \nHouse do not have the majority of\n\n[[Page S7251]]\n\ntheir Members agreeing to the exact same thing. In that case you need \nto negotiate because clearly we do not have consensus, and so we have \nto get two sides together to find consensus.\n  We have consensus. We have a bill the majority of Senators supports, \nthe majority of House Members supports, the President is ready to sign \nthe minute it gets to his desk. That is what is referred to as a clean \ncontinuing resolution, a bill that would keep the government operating \nfor the next 6 weeks on the same terms it was operating beforehand. The \nonly reason why that is not law today is because Speaker Boehner will \nnot bring that up for a vote in the House of Representatives. But it \nreportedly enjoys the support of more than 216 Members of the House, \nwhich is what you need today to get that bill passed. It has already \npassed the Senate.\n  Last, as Senator Durbin talked about, what Republicans are demanding \nas their condition to keep the government up and operating is no less \nthan the repeal of the signature achievement of President Obama's first \nterm, the most important bill I have ever worked on, the most important \nvote I have ever cast. That is the health care law which is today \nsaving millions of dollars for senior citizens in their Medicare \nbenefits and right now is providing a lifeline to millions of Americans \nwho need cheaper insurance.\n  It is why poll after poll tells you that although people are still \nsplit on whether they agree with the exact prescription for our health \ncare economy laid out in the bill we passed, they sure as heck do not \nwant us to repeal the law. By about a 2-to-1 margin people say don't \nrepeal the law, let it go into effect, give it a shot. It is also why \nby a 3-to-1 margin people do not agree with shutting down the \ngovernment over the repeal of the health care law. It is why 9 million \npeople have gone onto the Federal health care reform Web site to see \nwhat their options are. It is why, as Senator Durbin said, even in \nStates such as Kentucky, people are signing up by the thousands. In the \nfirst day of Connecticut's exchange we had more visits to the Web site \nthan we had in the entire month previous. People are desperate for \nlower cost health care out there. Sick people and families with sick \nchildren have been waiting lifetimes to finally be able to get \ninsurance for their loved ones.\n  People need this health care reform law to go into effect. It is \nsimply not true, as the Senator from Texas and others have said, that \npeople do not want this law. They have shown us how badly and \ndesperately they need it by the flood of interest in the exchanges over \nthe first week, and in poll after poll the American people say loudly \nthey do not want this repealed.\n  It is hard to get major social change passed in this town. The \nFounding Fathers intentionally set up a process by which something such \nas health care reform seems nearly impossible. That is why it took 100 \nyears since Teddy Roosevelt first proposed that we guarantee access to \nour health care system for all Americans for it to happen.\n  You have a lot of chances for that idea to crater. You need both \nChambers to pass the exact same bill, you need a President willing to \nsign it, you need the courts to uphold it, and then you need the \nelectorate to confirm it when everybody who voted for it stands for \nreelection again.\n  The reason why we are implementing the health care law today and the \nreason why most Americans want it to go forward is we passed every \nsingle one of those tests. For the first time in a hundred years the \nexact same proposal to reform our health care system passed with a \nmajority of both the House and the Senate and was signed by our \nPresident. The Supreme Court reviewed the law and stamped that it was \nconstitutional. Then this President and every Member of the Senate who \nvoted for the health care bill went out to stand for reelection in \n2012, based on the promise they would continue to implement the law. \nThe President was reelected by a resounding margin and every Senator in \nthis Chamber who voted for the health care law won reelection. The bill \npassed, the courts upheld it, voters confirmed their original choices. \nPeople want this law.\n  We already compromised on the amount in the continuing resolution. It \ncannot be much of a negotiation when all we want is for the government \nto stay up and operating and for us to pay our bills. This place cannot \nwork if, every time you negotiate a budget, everybody has to have their \nown political priorities taken care of.\n  We do not need to negotiate because we already have a bill that \nenjoys the support of both Chambers and will be signed by the President \nif only the House of Representatives will call it for a vote. The idea \nthat people do not want the health care law simply is not borne out \neither by the polls or by people's conduct on the exchanges over the \nlast 2 weeks.\n  Melanie Rhodes is waiting for an answer from us. Malachi needs to get \nback into preschool, ASAP. He is a little autistic boy who, every \nsingle day he sits home by himself, is marching a little bit more \nquickly backward off the progress gained through this program, funded \nnot by government but by all of us, because we thought it was important \nthat little boys with autism growing up in poor families with moms who \nused to be homeless should have a chance at success in life. Every day \nwe continue to reverse our collective decision as a society that \nMalachi should get some help, he goes backward and backward. His mom, \nto whom we said: You know what. Pick yourself up by your bootstraps, do \nthe right thing for yourself and your child--she did it. She got him \ninto Head Start, she found a job, and now because that program is shut \ndown, she likely will not be able to start her job. He moves backward. \nShe moves backward.\n  It is not because Democrats will not negotiate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut \nfor those eloquent and very powerful remarks, and I will take advantage \nof his presence here to perhaps engage in a colloquy, if he agrees to \ndoing so, asking him, because he spoke so wonderfully about that one \nfamily, whether he has seen, as I have seen, that story of deprivation \nand setback duplicated on a bigger scale throughout our State?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank my colleague from Connecticut for the question. \nAs he knows, there are a thousand different children in that one Head \nStart Program alone who have essentially lost access to childcare. This \nweek I think the number is, as the Senator knows, about 18,000 kids \nacross the country who will lose access to health care. As we have \nseen, it has already had a big effect in our State because we have so \nmany defense manufacturers. Some of the initial furloughs to civilians \nhave caused a loss of work among families who could not afford it. We \nare seeing over and over how this shutdown trickles down.\n  Frankly, it is affecting the very families who cannot afford to miss \na paycheck, the very families who cannot make quick arrangements to \nfind somebody else to take care of their autistic child. As the Senator \nhas seen and knows, this is affecting, in our small State, thousands \nand thousands of residents who did not have a lot of wiggle room when \nit came to the support that was standing around them due to programs \nrun by the Federal Government.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. In fact, I think statistics show more than a thousand \nchildren and their families are directly affected by this shutdown in \nHead Start alone. Seniors, in terms of nutritional assistance--I do not \nknow whether my good friend and very distinguished colleague from \nConnecticut has seen that phenomenon as well in Bridgeport and \nthroughout our State of Connecticut and would care to remark on it?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I would say to the Senator, we have had this effort on \nbehalf of Republicans to kind of pick and choose which parts of the \ngovernment they are going to reopen. As I noted here on the floor in \nobjecting to one of these piecemeal requests, that exact program my \ncolleague referred to, the senior nutrition program which provides \nmeals to very low-income and often very frail seniors who are getting \nthem either at a senior center or delivered to them through the Meals \nOn Wheels Program, was not initially one of the programs that \nRepublicans chose to reopen.\n  That is why we object to this piecemeal approach. It is bad policy to \nallow\n\n[[Page S7252]]\n\nfor a wing of this House or the other House to pick and choose which \npeople they help, leaving on the outside, as the Senator mentioned, \nsome who are very deserving, such as very frail and often very hungry \nsenior citizens.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. What is needed, I think my colleague would agree, is \nan end to the shutdown, reopening government--not for the sake of \nreopening the government but to provide these vital services and \nassurance that the United States of America, the greatest Nation in the \nhistory of the world, is going to continue paying its debts. Then and \nonly then have a conference and a compromise and collaboration on what \nour overall budget should be with smart spending cuts and increases in \nrevenue that close some loopholes and subsidies. I think that was the \nthrust, was it not, of what my colleague from Connecticut had to say?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I think the majority leader made it very clear he is \nwilling to sit down to talk about everything and anything the \nRepublicans want to discuss but not with a gun to our heads. Let's \nreopen the government. Then, as we as a Chamber have been willing to do \nover and over, let's sit down in a budget conference with everything \npart of that budget on the table.\n  But this just cannot happen every time that one faction of one House \ndoes not get their way, they shut down the government until their \nparticular demands are remediated.\n  As I was saying, Senator Blumenthal and I care deeply about the issue \nof background checks. He worked his entire life on this issue. But \ngiven his life's work, he is still not coming to this Chamber and \ndemanding until he gets his way on that issue, which is of such vital \nimportance to his constituents and mine, that he will shut down the \ngovernment.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. In fact, what is happening is a small fraction of one \nHouse of the Congress--in fact, in the House of Representatives, one \nsmall group of rightwing extremists, whatever they may characterize \nthemselves as--is holding hostage the entire House of Representatives, \nthe entire Congress, the entire government, even though it is only one \nbranch and one part of a branch. I think Senator Murphy has explained \nwell our view--and our constituents in Connecticut need to know it--we \nare willing to compromise and collaborate but not with hostage-taking \ntactics that in effect say to everyone else in the country: It is our \nway or the highway.\n  I thank my colleague from Connecticut for speaking so clearly and \npersuasively on his topic, and for giving the impact of this government \nshutdown a human face and a human voice. The story he told from \nBridgeport has indeed thousands of others just like it across the State \nof Connecticut, across the country, who are suffering the real hardship \nand harm of this shutdown.\n  We can talk in the abstract here. Our rhetoric may carry a little bit \nbeyond these four walls. But the real-life consequences belong to them. \nBoth Senator Murphy and I have seen them in real life and that is why \nwe are here to advocate and fight for those people of Connecticut, in \nBridgeport, those families who depend on Head Start, those seniors who \ndepend on nutritional assistance--he has told their story, and that of \nSikorsky, so well today in this Chamber. These men and women, and their \nfamilies, do great work for our Nation on their assembly lines.\n\n  Black Hawk helicopters are the best-made helicopters in the Nation. \nThey perform rescue operations for our troops in Afghanistan. They \nmedevac our Nation's warriors to places where they can be saved. They \nprovide resupply and provisions. They are literally lifesaving vehicles \nin our war to keep America safe.\n  Those workers in Sikorsky were told late last week: You are done. You \nare furloughed. Do not report to work next week because 45 inspectors--\ncivilian employees of the U.S. Department of Defense--are going to be \nfurloughed. The 45 inspectors and 1,500 or 2,000 or more workers at \nSikorsky who work on the Black Hawk helicopter assembly line, and other \nproduct assembly as well, were told they were going to be furloughed.\n  Senator Murphy and I, and other members of our delegation, spoke with \nofficials of the Department of Defense. We made our interpretation of \nthe recently passed law clear to them and told them that it applies to \nemployees of the Defense Contract Management Agency whose services were \nvital to certify and inspect those helicopters. We needed to keep the \nassembly lines at Sikorsky open in order to make sure that Black Hawk \nhelicopters were continuing to be available to our military men and \nwomen who depend on them so vitally.\n  Those conversations--and I am sure others had them as well--with \nofficials at the Department of Defense, along with the action of the \nHouse over the weekend, will make sure that all of the furloughed \nemployees who work for the U.S. Government will eventually be paid.\n  Secretary Hagel was persuaded to do the right thing. I commend and \nthank Secretary Hagel for bringing back those employees, such as the 45 \nDCMA inspectors, who have to be there for the Department of Defense in \norder to take delivery of those helicopters, which, in turn, is \nnecessary to keep the assembly line open and keep Sikorsky workers \nemployed and on the job with the countless other hard-working men and \nwomen defense contractors across the United States.\n  I thank Secretary Hagel, but at the same time we need to recognize \nthat for every Sikorsky helicopter situation, for every Fortune 500 \ncorporation, and for every one of those big defense contractors, there \nare literally thousands of suppliers and small businesses that are \ncontinuing in uncertainty, and sometimes confusion, about what is \nhappening here in Washington.\n  There are thousands of other businesses that depend on those \nsuppliers because they provide the raw materials for the parts for the \nSikorsky helicopters. The ripple effect and the ramifications pervade \nour economy and our society. The uncertainty creates harm and hardship \nthat is immeasurable and perhaps irreparable.\n  The harm is not only to those workers who rightly have whiplash from \nbeing furloughed one day and being called back another and then being \nuncertain as to what impact this shutdown will ultimately have; there \nare suppliers and the countless other small businesses that cannot \nplan, cannot look ahead, cannot hire for the future, and sometimes they \nhave to tell their workers: You are going to be furloughed. You cannot \nplan to buy a car or a new home or even the most minor things such as \nschool supplies--or make other plans, for that matter.\n  Lives hang in the balance; lives are at stake. The real-life \nconsequences are real and perhaps lasting for many Americans--not only \nthe family who depends on Head Start or the senior nutrition assistance \nor the jobs in Sikorsky, but there are countless others whose lives \nalso hang in the balance.\n  There is a solution to this impasse. Calmer minds, cooler heads, and \ncommon sense are beginning to reach a consensus that the House should \nbe given a chance to vote, and that the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives, John Boehner, should enable that vote. He should very \nsimply provide an opportunity to Republicans and Democrats--not \nsingling out one side or the other--to come together on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  Who cares who is in the minority of that vote as long as it reopens \nthe government and provides Head Start, nutritional assistance, and \nenables some certainty that permits our economy to move forward \nrationally and sensibly so we can recover from the great recession? We \nneed to grow jobs and enable the economy to reach some measure of \nprosperity. We all have an interest in that outcome. We should all be \npulling for America. We should all be assured that the greatest nation \nin the history of the world will leave no doubt that it will pay its \nbills on time and that it will fulfill its obligations on time, just as \nwe have for every year in the history of this great Nation.\n  There is a way to come together. I have heard from my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle that the time has come to end this impasse. \nSimply let the House vote.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n[[Page S7253]]\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, all over this country the American people \nare outraged by what is going on here in Washington. They have a hard \ntime understanding why rightwing extremists in the Republican Party in \nthe House are able to shut down the U.S. Government, while paychecks \nare being denied to millions of Federal employees and, at the same \ntime, services--in some cases desperately needed services--are being \nthreatened for tens of millions of Americans. People are hurting and \nthey wonder what is going on.\n  Let me say a few words regarding what, in my view, has, in fact, \nhappened. From the beginning, some of my Republican colleagues are \nsaying: We just need to talk. Let's compromise. A key point they \nneglect to make is that a major compromise has already taken place. The \nDemocrats in the Senate--and I am an independent, as is the Presiding \nOfficer, affiliated with the Democratic Caucus--decided to send a \nbudget for a continuing resolution to the House, which, in my view, was \na very, very weak budget, one that I am totally dissatisfied with, and \nI think most Members of the caucus are. It continues the budget at \nsequestration levels which will have a devastating impact on this \ncountry. It is a bad budget. But the reason the majority leader sent it \nover to the House was that he was of the understanding that the Speaker \nof the House had requested that type of budget, and that once that \nbudget came over--once that CR came over--the House would agree to it. \nIn fact, let me read from an article in the Washington Post today \ncommenting on an ABC interview that Speaker Boehner did. The Washington \nPost says:\n\n       In the ABC interview, Boehner tacitly acknowledged making a \n     deal with Senate Democrats to avoid using the threat of a \n     shutdown to attack ObamaCare in exchange for an agreement to \n     maintain the deep cuts known as the sequester through the \n     fall. He conceded that his rank and file forced him onto the \n     path to shutdown by insisting on waging the fight over \n     ObamaCare.\n\n  That was the Washington Post today.\n  What does that mean? It means that an agreement had been reached by \nthe Speaker and the majority leader that if the Democrats accepted the \nvery low budget number the Republicans wanted, there would be a clean \ncontinuing resolution. What this article points out--and what I think \nthe Speaker has virtually acknowledged--is that despite his agreement \nwith the majority leader here in the Senate, he couldn't carry it out \nbecause his extreme rightwing said: Thanks. You got us the budget we \nwanted, the CR we wanted. That is not enough. Now we want to end \nObamaCare.\n  That is where we are today.\n  So anyone who comes forward and says: Why don't you talk? Why don't \nyou compromise? The fact is--and I think the majority leader has made \nthis point--he compromised far more than many of us felt comfortable \nwith.\n  A compromise has already been reached. The Democrats accepted, in my \nview, a very bad and weak Republican budget. But it was done with the \nhope and the understanding that there would be a clean continuing \nresolution and that the U.S. Government would not be shut down. That is \npoint No. 1.\n  Point No. 2 is that the other day the Speaker said on TV that there \nare not the votes to pass a clean CR. What I have been hearing here on \nthe floor of the Senate and in the House is that we have Republicans \nwho are not sympathetic to ObamaCare, they don't like ObamaCare, and \nthey would like to defund ObamaCare. But they understand we don't shut \ndown the U.S. Government. We don't threaten that for the first time in \nthe history of the United States we may not pay our bills, be a \ndeadbeat Nation, and drive our economy and our financial system, and \nperhaps the entire world's financial system, into a catastrophic area \nby not paying our bills. We believe that there are enough Republicans \nin the House to join with Democrats and pass a clean CR.\n  The President and the majority leader have both made this point: Have \nthe vote. Have the vote, Mr. Speaker. Maybe you are right or maybe you \nare not. But we don't know until you have the vote. I urge, as I have \nbefore, that the Speaker of the House function as the Speaker of the \nHouse of Representatives and not as the speaker of the Republican \nParty.\n  The last point I wish to make touches on an article that appeared in \nyesterday's New York Times. It is a very important article because it \nreally tells us who is behind this shutdown and what their motives are. \nIf anybody thinks this government shutdown or the threats about not \npaying our bills and driving the world's economy into catastrophic \nareas are ideas that just occurred the other day, that a Senator just \nhad this bright idea, they would be very mistaken. The fact is we have \na growing rightwing movement in this country funded by some of the \nwealthiest people in America, including the Koch brothers, a family \nthat has made their money in fossil fuels and are worth over $70 \nbillion--$70 billion is their worth. They are worth $70 billion, and \nthey have access to the best health care in the world. They have access \nto the best housing in the world. Their family members can go to the \nbest colleges and universities in the world. Yet they are obsessed \nwith, among other things, making sure 25 million Americans have no \nhealth insurance at all.\n  I am a strong supporter of a Medicare for all, a single-payer \nprogram. I don't think the Affordable Care Act went far enough. But to \nsay the least, 20 million or 25 million Americans can finally have \naccess to health insurance. They can go to the doctor when they need to \ngo to the doctor. There are now no regulations that prevent them from \ngetting care because of a preexisting condition. Can we imagine \nbillionaires--billionaires--going to war against working people so they \nand their kids cannot get health insurance? I think that is just \nobscene. That is just obscene.\n  Let me quote from The New York Times article of yesterday. It is \nimportant that people understand that the fight against the Affordable \nCare Act is just the tip of the iceberg. We have families and \nbillionaires such as the Koch brothers who not only want to see that we \ndon't expand health insurance in this country, but they have a long \nlist of issues they are going after. In fact, they want to repeal \nvirtually every major piece of legislation passed in the last 80 years \nthat protects the middle class, working families, women, children, the \nelderly, the sick, and the poor. That is their agenda. So it is not a \nquestion of opposing the extension of health insurance through \nObamaCare; that is not enough for them. What they want to do is end \nMedicare as we know it right now, and transform it into a voucher \nsystem, that gives an elderly person who is dealing with cancer $8,000 \nand says: Good luck to you.\n  They want to make massive cuts in Medicaid. They don't want to expand \nMedicaid. They want massive cuts. They are very clear about wanting to \nend Social Security. They don't believe the Federal Government should \nbe involved in retirement issues and Social Security.\n  One of the more amazing things these guys want to do--and many of our \nRepublican colleagues apparently drank the lemonade on this issue--is \nto abolish the concept of the minimum wage. The Federal minimum wage \nnow is $7.25 an hour. People can't live on that. But their idea is to \nget the Federal Government out of the minimum wage issue--no floor--so \nthat if an employer in a hard-pressed area in Maine or in Vermont or in \nMichigan can pay people $4 an hour, they think that is freedom: People \nhave the freedom to work for $4 an hour. We don't want a minimum wage.\n  So, in other words, these rightwing extremists and the big money \nbehind them have a major agenda, of which repealing ObamaCare is just \none small part.\n  Let me just quote, if I might, the New York Times article. I ask \nunanimous consent to have the entire New York Times article printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 5, 2013]\n\n             A Federal Budget Crisis Months in the Planning\n\n               (By Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Mike McIntire)\n\n       Washington.--Shortly after President Obama started his \n     second term, a loose-knit coalition of conservative activists \n     led by former Attorney General Edwin Meese III\n\n[[Page S7254]]\n\n     gathered in the capital to plot strategy. Their push to \n     repeal Mr. Obama's health care law was going nowhere, and \n     they desperately needed a new plan.\n       Out of that session, held one morning in a location the \n     members insist on keeping secret, came a little-noticed \n     ``blueprint to defunding Obamacare,'' signed by Mr. Meese and \n     leaders of more than three dozen conservative groups.\n       It articulated a take-no-prisoners legislative strategy \n     that had long percolated in conservative circles: that \n     Republicans could derail the health care overhaul if \n     conservative lawmakers were willing to push fellow \n     Republicans--including their cautious leaders--into cutting \n     off financing for the entire federal government.\n       ``We felt very strongly at the start of this year that the \n     House needed to use the power of the purse,'' said one \n     coalition member, Michael A. Needham, who runs Heritage \n     Action for America, the political arm of the Heritage \n     Foundation. ``At least at Heritage Action, we felt very \n     strongly from the start that this was a fight that we were \n     going to pick.''\n       Last week the country witnessed the fallout from that \n     strategy: a standoff that has shuttered much of the federal \n     bureaucracy and unsettled the nation.\n       To many Americans, the shutdown came out of nowhere. But \n     interviews with a wide array of conservatives show that the \n     confrontation that precipitated the crisis was the outgrowth \n     of a long-running effort to undo the law, the Affordable Care \n     Act, since its passage in 2010--waged by a galaxy of \n     conservative groups with more money, organized tactics and \n     interconnections than is commonly known.\n       With polls showing Americans deeply divided over the law, \n     conservatives believe that the public is behind them. \n     Although the law's opponents say that shutting down the \n     government was not their objective, the activists anticipated \n     that a shutdown could occur--and worked with members of the \n     Tea Party caucus in Congress who were excited about drawing a \n     red line against a law they despise.\n       A defunding ``tool kit'' created in early September \n     included talking points for the question, ``What happens when \n     you shut down the government and you are blamed for it?'' The \n     suggested answer was the one House Republicans give today: \n     ``We are simply calling to fund the entire government except \n     for the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare.''\n       The current budget brinkmanship is just the latest \n     development in a well-financed, broad-based assault on the \n     health law, Mr. Obama's signature legislative initiative. \n     Groups like Tea Party Patriots, Americans for Prosperity and \n     FreedomWorks are all immersed in the fight, as is Club for \n     Growth, a business-backed nonprofit organization. Some, like \n     Generation Opportunity and Young Americans for Liberty, both \n     aimed at young adults, are upstarts. Heritage Action is new, \n     too, founded in 2010 to advance the policy prescriptions of \n     its sister group, the Heritage Foundation.\n       The billionaire Koch brothers, Charles and David, have been \n     deeply involved with financing the overall effort. A group \n     linked to the Kochs, Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, \n     disbursed more than $200 million last year to nonprofit \n     organizations involved in the fight. Included was $5 million \n     to Generation Opportunity, which created a buzz last month \n     with an Internet advertisement showing a menacing Uncle Sam \n     figure popping up between a woman's legs during a \n     gynecological exam.\n       The groups have also sought to pressure vulnerable \n     Republican members of Congress with scorecards keeping track \n     of their health care votes; have burned faux ``Obamacare \n     cards'' on college campuses; and have distributed scripts for \n     phone calls to Congressional offices, sample letters to \n     editors and Twitter and Facebook offerings for followers to \n     present as their own.\n       One sample Twitter offering--``Obamacare is a train \n     wreck''--is a common refrain for Speaker John A. Boehner.\n       As the defunding movement picked up steam among outside \n     advocates, Republicans who sounded tepid became targets. The \n     Senate Conservatives Fund, a political action committee \n     dedicated to ``electing true conservatives,'' ran radio \n     advertisements against three Republican incumbents.\n       Heritage Action ran critical Internet advertisements in the \n     districts of 100 Republican lawmakers who had failed to sign \n     a letter by a North Carolina freshman, Representative Mark \n     Meadows, urging Mr. Boehner to take up the defunding cause.\n       ``They've been hugely influential,'' said David Wasserman, \n     who tracks House races for the nonpartisan Cook Political \n     Report. ``When else in our history has a freshman member of \n     Congress from North Carolina been able to round up a gang of \n     80 that's essentially ground the government to a halt?''\n       On Capitol Hill, the advocates found willing partners in \n     Tea Party conservatives, who have repeatedly threatened to \n     shut down the government if they do not get their way on \n     spending issues. This time they said they were so alarmed by \n     the health law that they were willing to risk a shutdown over \n     it. (``This is exactly what the public wants,'' \n     Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, founder of the \n     House Tea Party Caucus, said on the eve of the shutdown.)\n       Despite Mrs. Bachmann's comments, not all of the groups \n     have been on board with the defunding campaign. Some, like \n     the Koch-financed Americans for Prosperity, which spent $5.5 \n     million on health care television advertisements over the \n     past three months, are more focused on sowing public doubts \n     about the law. But all have a common goal, which is to \n     cripple a measure that Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican \n     and leader of the defunding effort, has likened to a horror \n     movie.\n       ``We view this as a long-term effort,'' said Tim Phillips, \n     the president of Americans for Prosperity. He said his group \n     expected to spend ``tens of millions'' of dollars on a \n     ``multifront effort'' that includes working to prevent states \n     from expanding Medicaid under the law. The group's goal is \n     not to defund the law.\n       ``We want to see this law repealed,'' Mr. Phillips said.\n\n\n                           A Familiar Tactic\n\n       The crowd was raucous at the Hilton Anatole, just north of \n     downtown Dallas, when Mr. Needham's group, Heritage Action, \n     arrived on a Tuesday in August for the second stop on a nine-\n     city ``Defund Obamacare Town Hall Tour.'' Nearly 1,000 people \n     turned out to hear two stars of the Tea Party movement: Mr. \n     Cruz, and Jim DeMint, a former South Carolina senator who \n     runs the Heritage Foundation.\n       ``You're here because now is the single best time we have \n     to defund Obamacare,'' declared Mr. Cruz, who would go on to \n     rail against the law on the Senate floor in September with a \n     monologue that ran for 21 hours. ``This is a fight we can \n     win.''\n       Although Mr. Cruz is new to the Senate, the tactic of \n     defunding in Washington is not. For years, Congress has \n     banned the use of certain federal money to pay for abortions, \n     except in the case of incest and rape, by attaching the so-\n     called Hyde Amendment to spending bills.\n       After the health law passed in 2010, Todd Tiahrt, then a \n     Republican congressman from Kansas, proposed defunding bits \n     and pieces of it. He said he spoke to Mr. Boehner's staff \n     about the idea while the Supreme Court, which upheld the \n     central provision, was weighing the law's constitutionality.\n       ``There just wasn't the appetite for it at the time,'' Mr. \n     Tiahrt said in an interview. ``They thought, we don't need to \n     worry about it because the Supreme Court will strike it \n     down.''\n       But the idea of using the appropriations process to defund \n     an entire federal program, particularly one as far-reaching \n     as the health care overhaul, raised the stakes considerably. \n     In an interview, Mr. DeMint, who left the Senate to join the \n     Heritage Foundation in January, said he had been thinking \n     about it since the law's passage, in part because Republican \n     leaders were not more aggressive.\n       ``They've been through a series of C.R.s and debt limits,'' \n     Mr. DeMint said, referring to continuing resolutions on \n     spending, ``and all the time there was discussion of `O.K., \n     we're not going to fight the Obamacare fight, we'll do it \n     next time.' The conservatives who ran in 2010 promising to \n     repeal it kept hearing, `This is not the right time to fight \n     this battle.' ''\n       Mr. DeMint is hardly alone in his distaste for the health \n     law, or his willingness to do something about it. In the \n     three years since Mr. Obama signed the health measure, Tea \n     Party-inspired groups have mobilized, aided by a financing \n     network that continues to grow, both in its complexity and \n     the sheer amount of money that flows through it.\n       A review of tax records, campaign finance reports and \n     corporate filings shows that hundreds of millions of dollars \n     have been raised and spent since 2012 by organizations, many \n     of them loosely connected, leading opposition to the measure.\n       One of the biggest sources of conservative money is Freedom \n     Partners, a tax-exempt ``business league'' that claims more \n     than 200 members, each of whom pays at least $100,000 in \n     dues. The group's board is headed by a longtime executive of \n     Koch Industries, the conglomerate run by the Koch brothers, \n     who were among the original financiers of the Tea Party \n     movement. The Kochs declined to comment.\n       While Freedom Partners has financed organizations that are \n     pushing to defund the law, like Heritage Action and Tea Party \n     Patriots, Freedom Partners has not advocated that. A \n     spokesman for the group, James Davis, said it was more \n     focused on ``educating Americans around the country on the \n     negative impacts of Obamacare.''\n       The largest recipient of Freedom Partners cash--about $115 \n     million--was the Center to Protect Patient Rights, according \n     to the groups' latest tax filings. Run by a political \n     consultant with ties to the Kochs and listing an Arizona post \n     office box for its address, the center appears to be little \n     more than a clearinghouse for donations to still more groups, \n     including American Commitment and the 60 Plus Association, \n     both ardent foes of the health care law.\n       American Commitment and 60 Plus were among a handful of \n     groups calling themselves the ``Repeal Coalition'' that sent \n     a letter in August urging Republican leaders in the House and \n     the Senate to insist ``at a minimum'' in a one-year delay of \n     carrying out the health care law as part of any budget deal. \n     Another group, the Conservative 50 Plus Alliance, delivered a \n     defunding petition with 68,700 signatures to the Senate.\n       In the fight to shape public opinion, conservatives face \n     well-organized liberal foes. Enroll America, a nonprofit \n     group allied with the Obama White House, is waging a campaign \n     to persuade millions of the uninsured to buy coverage. The \n     law's supporters\n\n[[Page S7255]]\n\n     are also getting huge assistance from the insurance industry, \n     which is expected to spend $1 billion on advertising to help \n     sell its plans on the exchanges.\n       ``It is David versus Goliath,'' said Mr. Phillips of \n     Americans for Prosperity.\n       But conservatives are finding that with relatively small \n     advertising buys, they can make a splash. Generation \n     Opportunity, the youth-oriented outfit behind the ``Creepy \n     Uncle Sam'' ads, is spending $750,000 on that effort, aimed \n     at dissuading young people--a cohort critical to the success \n     of the health care overhaul--from signing up for insurance \n     under the new law.\n       The group receives substantial backing from Freedom \n     Partners and appears ready to expand. Recently, Generation \n     Opportunity moved into spacious new offices in Arlington, \n     Va., where exposed ductwork, Ikea chairs and a Ping-Pong \n     table give off the feel of a Silicon Valley start-up.\n       Its executive director, Evan Feinberg, a 29-year-old former \n     Capitol Hill aide and onetime instructor for a leadership \n     institute founded by Charles Koch, said there would be more \n     Uncle Sam ads, coupled with college campus visits, this fall. \n     Two other groups, FreedomWorks, with its ``Burn Your \n     Obamacare Card'' protests, and Young Americans for Liberty, \n     are also running campus events.\n       ``A lot of folks have asked us, `Are we trying to sabotage \n     the law?' '' Mr. Feinberg said in an interview last week. His \n     answer echoes the Freedom Partners philosophy: ``Our goal is \n     to educate and empower young people.''\n\n\n                            Critical Timing\n\n       But many on the Republican right wanted to do more.\n       Mr. Meese's low-profile coalition, the Conservative Action \n     Project, which seeks to find common ground among leaders of \n     an array of fiscally and socially conservative groups, was \n     looking ahead to last Tuesday, when the new online health \n     insurance marketplaces, called exchanges, were set to open. \n     If the law took full effect as planned, many conservatives \n     feared, it would be nearly impossible to repeal--even if a \n     Republican president were elected in 2016.\n       ``I think people realized that with the imminent beginning \n     of Obamacare, that this was a critical time to make every \n     effort to stop something,'' Mr. Meese said in an interview. \n     (He has since stepped down as the coalition's chairman and \n     has been succeeded by David McIntosh, a former congressman \n     from Indiana.)\n       The defunding idea, Mr. Meese said, was ``a logical \n     strategy.'' The idea drew broad support. Fiscal conservatives \n     like Chris Chocola, the president of the Club for Growth, \n     signed on to the blueprint. So did social and religious \n     conservatives, like the Rev. Lou Sheldon of the Traditional \n     Values Coalition.\n       The document set a target date: March 27, when a continuing \n     resolution allowing the government to function was to expire. \n     Its message was direct: ``Conservatives should not approve a \n     C.R. unless it defunds Obamacare.''\n       But the March date came and went without a defunding \n     struggle. In the Senate, Mr. Cruz and Senator Mike Lee, a \n     Utah Republican, talked up the defunding idea, but it went \n     nowhere in the Democratic-controlled chamber. In the House, \n     Mr. Boehner wanted to concentrate instead on locking in the \n     across-the-board budget cuts known as sequestration, and Tea \n     Party lawmakers followed his lead. Outside advocates were \n     unhappy but held their fire.\n       ``We didn't cause any trouble,'' Mr. Chocola said.\n       Yet by summer, with an August recess looming and another \n     temporary spending bill expiring at the end of September, the \n     groups were done waiting.\n       ``I remember talking to reporters at the end of July, and \n     they said, `This didn't go anywhere,' '' Mr. Needham \n     recalled. ``What all of us felt at the time was, this was \n     never going to be a strategy that was going to win inside the \n     Beltway. It was going to be a strategy where, during August, \n     people would go home and hear from their constituents, \n     saying: `You pledged to do everything you could to stop \n     Obamacare. Will you defund it?' ''\n       Heritage Action, which has trained 6,000 people it calls \n     sentinels around the country, sent them to open meetings and \n     other events to confront their elected representatives. Its \n     ``Defund Obamacare Town Hall Tour,'' which began in \n     Fayetteville, Ark., on Aug. 19 and ended 10 days later in \n     Wilmington, Del., drew hundreds at every stop.\n       The Senate Conservatives Fund, led by Mr. DeMint when he \n     was in the Senate, put up a Web site in July called \n     dontfundobama\n     care.com and ran television ads featuring Mr. Cruz and Mr. \n     Lee urging people to tell their representatives not to fund \n     the law.\n       When Senator Richard M. Burr, a North Carolina Republican, \n     told a reporter that defunding the law was ``the dumbest idea \n     I've ever heard,'' the fund bought a radio ad to attack him. \n     Two other Republican senators up for re-election in 2014, \n     Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Lindsey Graham of South \n     Carolina, were also targeted. Both face Tea Party \n     challengers.\n       In Washington, Tea Party Patriots, which created the \n     defunding tool kit, set up a Web site, exemptamerica.com, to \n     promote a rally last month showcasing many of the Republicans \n     in Congress whom Democrats--and a number of fellow \n     Republicans--say are most responsible for the shutdown.\n       While conservatives believe that the public will back them \n     on defunding, a recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation \n     found that a majority--57 percent--disapproves of cutting off \n     funding as a way to stop the law.\n       Last week, with the health care exchanges open for business \n     and a number of prominent Republicans complaining that the \n     ``Defund Obamacare'' strategy was politically damaging and \n     pointless, Mr. Needham of Heritage Action said he felt good \n     about what the groups had accomplished.\n       ``It really was a groundswell,'' he said, ``that changed \n     Washington from the outside in.''\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Let me quote from the yesterday's New York Times:\n\n       The current budget brinkmanship is just the latest \n     development in a well-financed, broadbased assault on the \n     health law, Mr. Obama's signature legislative initiative. \n     Groups like Tea Party Patriots, Americans for Prosperity, and \n     FreedomWorks are all immersed in the fight, as is Club for \n     Growth, a business-backed nonprofit organization. Some, like \n     Generation Opportunity and Young Americans for Liberty, both \n     aimed at young adults, are upstarts. Heritage Action is new, \n     too, founded in 2010 to advance the policy prescriptions of \n     its sister group, the Heritage Foundation.\n       The billionaire Koch brothers, Charles and David, have been \n     deeply involved with financing the overall effort.\n\n  Let me repeat that.\n\n       The billionaire Koch brothers, Charles and David, have been \n     deeply involved with financing the overall effort.\n\n  Remember, these are the guys who are worth $70 billion, who want to \nessentially repeal every major piece of legislation protecting working \nfamilies over the last 80 years.\n  Let me go back to the article:\n\n       A group linked to the Kochs, Freedom Partners Chamber of \n     Commerce, disbursed more than $200 million last year--\n\n  $200 million last year.\n\n     to nonprofit organizations involved in the fight.\n\n  Et cetera, et cetera.\n  Now I will go to another paragraph, which is really interesting and \nreally important:\n\n       The groups have also sought to pressure vulnerable \n     Republican members of Congress with scorecards keeping track \n     of their health care votes; have burned faux ``Obamacare \n     cards'' on college campuses; and have distributed scripts for \n     phone calls to Congressional offices, sample letters to \n     editors and Twitter and Facebook offerings for followers to \n     present as their own.\n\n  What is going on here? What does that mean? This is what it means. As \na result of the disastrous Supreme Court ruling called Citizens United, \nwhat billionaires such as the Koch brothers and others can do--and what \nthey are doing today--is to say to Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives: If you vote for a clean continuing resolution, if you \nvote to keep the government open, if you make it very clear that you \nwill oppose any effort to see the U.S. default on its debts--if you do \nthat, let me tell you what is going to happen to you, because we have \nthe Koch brothers and people worth billions of dollars who are prepared \nto jump into your campaign, perhaps get a primary opponent to run \nagainst you, and to fund that opponent with as much money as he or she \nneeds.\n  So now, what democracy in the House--as a result of Citizens United--\nis about is that a handful of billionaires can threaten any Member of \nthe House with defeat by pouring in unlimited sums of money if they \nvote in a way that the Koch brothers do not like.\n  If that is how people think American democracy is supposed to \nfunction, it would surprise me very much. But that is not what American \ndemocracy is supposed to be about. That tells me again why we have to \ndo everything we can to overturn this disastrous Citizens United \nSupreme Court decision so that a handful of billionaires cannot dictate \npublic policy here in the United States of America and in the Congress.\n\n  Let me just conclude by saying this: The American people are angry \nand they are frustrated, and I think what they are seeing is that the \nmiddle class of this country is disappearing. In fact, in the last 24 \nyears median family income today is lower than it was. It has gone \ndown. You have millions of people who are out there working for wages \nthey just cannot raise a family on. You are seeing right now a growth \nin poverty among elderly people. In the midst of a disappearing middle \nclass and the increase of poverty, you are seeing more income and \nwealth inequality in this country than we have seen since\n\n[[Page S7256]]\n\nthe 1920s. The gap between the very rich and everybody else grows \nwider. And now, as I mentioned a moment ago, what billionaires are \ndoing with their money is continuing their war against the middle class \nby trying to repeal important pieces of legislation.\n  What the American people are saying is: What about us? What about us? \nWho is worried that my kid who graduated from high school cannot find a \njob? Who is worried that my other kid who graduated college is leaving \nschool deeply in debt? Who is worried that in our country we are not \nbeing aggressive in dealing with the issue of global warming?\n  There are enormous issues facing the middle class in this country: \nthe need to create millions of jobs, the need to raise the minimum \nwage, the need to make college affordable, the need to significantly \nimprove childcare in this country and education in general.\n  There is an enormous amount of work to be done. What this Congress \nshould not be doing is telling 2 million workers that you are not \ngetting paid, furloughing what was then 800,000, now 400,000 workers. \nThat is not what we should be doing.\n  I hope the American people stand and make it clear to our Republican \nfriends that they cannot shut down the government because they are not \ngetting their way. I hope the American people would do everything they \ncan to demand that this Congress start doing its job, which is to \nrepresent working families.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today with a pretty simple message \nfor House leadership: You can end this Republican shutdown today. Just \nsimply let the House vote.\n  On issue after issue after issue, when the House has acted, the \nSenate has responded with a vote, either with a vote for or against a \ntabling motion or a vote for or against legislation, but we have taken \na vote. We simply ask the House to do the same.\n  By scheduling a vote on the Senate-passed plan--the continuing \nresolution--Speaker Boehner can ensure that more than 800,000 workers, \nincluding tens of thousands in my home State of Ohio, can get back to \nwork.\n  By scheduling a vote on the Senate-passed bill, he can reopen the \ngovernment without rehashing old political fights; then get down to \nbusiness--deal with the debt limit--then get down to business and make \ndecisions about immigration, make decisions about jobs, make decisions \nabout what we are going to do with the budget.\n  I do not think we have ever, Mr. Speaker, seen one faction of one \nparty of one chamber of one branch of government hold the entire \ncountry and economic recovery of our Nation hostage--a faction of one \nparty of one house of one branch of government hold the country \nhostage.\n  Do not take my word for it. A Cleveland Plain Dealer headline said: \n``Republicans need to quit the attack on Obamacare and agree to a clean \ncontinuing resolution.'' They called the actions of the far right \nattack on the 3-year-old health care law--the health care law that was \npassed overwhelmingly in both Houses, with 60 votes in the Senate and \nwell over a majority in the House, affirmed in part by the Supreme \nCourt--the Plain Dealer called the actions attacking the health care \nlaw ``bordering on the un-American.''\n  The Toledo Blade called the actions of the far right in the House \n``GOP extortion,'' challenging Speaker Boehner to put America's economy \nover his own job, reminding him of his election night saying the 2012 \nelection ``changes that,'' making the health law ``the law of the \nland.''\n  Finally, the Washington Post--no stranger to criticizing Democrats--\ncalled out the ``House of Embarrassment'' and its ``heedlessness'' on \nthe impact of its actions on ordinary Americans.\n  I was home this weekend, and I spoke with all kinds of people. I \nspoke with Federal employees, some of whom have been furloughed, some \nof whom have not. I spoke with others in Avon Lake, OH, other places. I \nlistened to what they had to say. People are frustrated. They cannot \nbelieve that, again, one group of radicals in one House of one branch \nof government can, for all intents and purposes, shut the country down \nand move us towards the precipice of what happens if the Congress does \nnot pay the bills that we as a Congress ran up. These are real people \nfacing a real and devastating impact.\n  I did something else that I know the Acting President pro tempore, as \na Senator from Maine, a former Governor, does also: get on the phone \nand just talk to people in your State about the impact this will have.\n  I spoke to one of the leaders of an institution in Ohio that has a \nlarge R presence in the State. He talked about the irreparable damage \nto our infrastructure, similar to what happens in Senator Nelson's \nState--who just joined me on the floor--what could happen at NASA in \nSouth Florida, what happens at NASA in Cleveland, what happens at \nBatelle in Columbus, what happens at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in \nDayton.\n  This leader at one of these institutions--I do not want to call him \nout by name--he talked about the irreparable damage to our \ninfrastructure as a nation. This is not just highways and bridges. This \nis scientific researchers, this is engineers, this is people working on \nsome of the most top secret issues in our country and our government.\n  He went on to say it is asymmetric: building and killing a scientific \nendeavor. Think about that. Killing a scientific endeavor you can do in \na week or you can do in a month simply by stopping the research by an \ninterruption like this, where many of the top scientists, the top \nengineers, at some point just say: I do not want to go through this \nagain. I am not going to continue to do this important work for my \ncountry and then see it shut down because somebody has a political ax \nto grind, because somebody, on a continuing resolution, or one \npolitical party, as we approach the debt ceiling, wants to attach their \npolitical platform to one of these important pieces of legislation just \nto make the government run.\n  What is happening in places like that is some of these engineers say: \nI am not sure I want to work for NASA anymore. I am not sure I want to \nstay in the military. I am not sure I want to be at a major research \ninstitution like Batelle. I can go elsewhere where my work will not get \ninterrupted and people will show their appreciation simply by \ncontinuing to fund my research.\n  When you think about this building and killing a scientific endeavor, \nit is a little bit like one old politician said, that it takes a \ncarpenter a long time to build a barn, but any--I am not sure he used \nthe word ``mule''--but any mule can knock down that barn in a day or \nso.\n  I remember I was in a car accident years ago. I broke my back. I was \nin the hospital for a week. For 3 days I stayed in bed. I remember the \nfirst time I tried to walk how my muscles had atrophied. It took \nseveral weeks before I was back to full strength and could rebuild that \nmuscle.\n  That is really the way it is with these research institutions in our \ncountry, which we have so many of, that are so important, whether it is \nNASA, whether it is Batelle, whether it is Wright-Patterson Air Force \nBase, whether it is the National Institutes of Health. We have \nassembled some of the greatest scientists and engineers and technicians \nin the world at these institutions, but building a scientific endeavor \ntakes days and weeks and months and years; killing one is a matter of \nan interruption of 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 weeks.\n  That is why this is so dangerous, this shut down. That is why going \nup against the debt ceiling is potentially catastrophic for our \ncountry. It makes no sense. It is not good for our economy. It is not \ngood for our people. It is not good for our Federal workforce that \nreally can do the right kinds of things for our country.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I would be glad to yield to the Senator \nfrom Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. What the Senator said about NASA is so true. Would the \nSenator believe that 97 percent of the\n\n[[Page S7257]]\n\nworkforce at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is on \nfurlough? A few of us had to intercede. The Mars mission that is \nsupposed to go in a narrow window between mid-November and early \nDecember--if they miss that window, it would be another 2 years before \nthey could launch that Mars mission and, therefore, you would have all \nthe expense of keeping the scientists on, and so forth. We finally got \nthem to bring them back so they could continue processing the mission \nso it can launch in that narrow 3-week window. But the rest of the \npeople are gone.\n  Does that sound very intelligent to the Senator from Ohio?\n  Mr. BROWN. I would add, it is interesting: Three of the great NASA \nfacilities are represented on the floor now by Senator Cornyn from \nTexas, Senator Nelson, and me. It is not just NASA employees at NASA \nGlenn in Cleveland.\n  Mr. NELSON. Correct.\n  Mr. BROWN. It is another 1,300 contractors who are doing work paid by \ntaxpayers. They are actually private companies, as the Senator knows. \nIt is the same in Florida, the same in Texas. And their work is \nimportant too.\n  I just think these kinds of interruptions are so senseless. What I \nheard more than anything from people when I was home was how senseless \nthis is, how ludicrous this is.\n  I spoke to hospital administrators all over my State today. I was on \nthe phone with a number of them from Williams County in the northwest \ncorner of the State, to Columbus, to Cleveland, to all over, and it is \nsenseless to them that they are in the midst of maybe a hospital \nexpansion or maybe just doing the day-to-day work of the hospital, and \nthey do not know what to think.\n  I have heard many of my colleagues here for years talk about the \nunpredictability of this economy and that it is partly because of \nWashington and ObamaCare or maybe Dodd-Frank: We do not know what is \nhappening next.\n  The worst kind of unpredictability is shutting the government down or \nleading us right up to the debt ceiling. That is why it is so important \nthat the House vote and then we get serious about doing the debt \nceiling vote and then we move on to issues such as immigration and \nothers that matter for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I agree with our colleagues that a \ngovernment shutdown is not the best way to do business around here. We \nshould get together--the President, the House, and the Senate--and we \nshould work this out, both the continuing resolution and the debt \nceiling, of which Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew has said he will \nbasically run out of all of the extraordinary measures he can use to \navoid us reaching the debt ceiling--which, colloquially speaking, I \nwould say is the equivalent of maxing out your credit card, the Federal \nGovernment's credit card.\n  But it is worth remembering that as James Baker, former Secretary of \nthe Treasury, Secretary of State, with a distinguished record of public \nservice going back many years--he recently noted in an article in the \nWall Street Journal that since 1976 we have had 17 government shutdowns \ntemporarily until differences between the parties, between the branches \ncould be worked out. I hope we can do that sooner rather than later.\n  The truth is that there was a way out with regard to the shutdown, \nparticularly when the House passed a piece of legislation that would \nmaintain the spending limits at $988 billion, which was the same level \nthe Senate majority had chosen, but it also attached two other \nprovisions to it, one of which would have eliminated the carve-out for \nCongress for ObamaCare--in other words, the carve-out that treats \nCongress differently than the rest of the country. Our Democratic \nfriends unfortunately voted against that provision. All Republicans \nvoted to eliminate that carve-out.\n  The second was the delay in the penalties that would be applied to \nindividuals who do not buy government-approved health insurance under \nObamaCare. The President has unilaterally delayed for 1 year the \npenalties for employers who do not meet the requirements of ObamaCare. \nAll we were asking is that the same consideration be given to hard-\nworking Americans. If our friends across the aisle--or at least enough \nof them--had joined with us to vote for both of those provisions that \ncame over with the House bill, the government would not be shut down, \nit would be operating. But that was the decision they made. I think \nthey made a mistake.\n  But we know the government shutdown debate is now quickly becoming a \ndebate over the broader subject of what we do about spending and debt, \nparticularly what we do with regard to the debt ceiling I mentioned \nearlier. We have reached almost the top of our credit limit on the \nNation's credit card, and President Obama is asking for another \ntrillion dollars in spending, in debt limit. But the President differs \nfrom many of us in that he thinks this debt ceiling cap ought to be \nlifted by another trillion dollars without anything else attached to \nit. He thinks it ought to be automatic, even though we believe it is \nentirely appropriate--and the majority of times in the past, the debt \nceiling increase has been accompanied by other long-term policy \nreforms. The President himself has agreed to these kinds of reforms in \nthe past. But apparently this time he has drawn a line in the sand.\n  So now he believes, unlike the past, that Congress should act like a \nrubberstamp when it comes to raising the limit on America's credit \ncard, our debt limit. Meanwhile, it seems our friends across the aisle \nalso feel the House should be a rubberstamp for the Senate. All of this \nleads me to conclude that James Madison, the father of the \nConstitution, must be rolling over in his grave because he and others \nof the Founders were the geniuses who decided that it was the checks \nand balances from separated government--the executive and the \nlegislative, the House and the Senate--that would best protect our \nfreedoms and best prevent overreach by other branches.\n  But in a way I can understand why the President and the majority \nleader are refusing to negotiate and are saying ``it is my way or the \nhighway.'' After all, the last time we had these kinds of major fiscal \ntalks in advance of a debt ceiling deadline, the result was the Budget \nControl Act. That was 2011. That law produced, by default, real \nspending cuts and real deficit reduction. If you recall, that was where \nthe supercommittee was created to try to negotiate a grand bargain. The \nsupercommittee was unsuccessful, and the default was the Budget Control \nAct and the sequester, which automatically cut discretionary spending. \nOur friends across the aisle clearly think that was a big mistake. The \nPresident and the majority leader now are refusing to negotiate at all \non the debt ceiling. They believe it ought to be rubberstamped.\n  Well, amidst all of the rhetoric and the finger-pointing, now \nWashington has erupted into something it does best, which is the blame \ngame. I am afraid we have lost sight of our underlying debt problem.\n  Despite the short-term deficit reduction we have witnessed since 2011 \ndue to the default position of the Budget Control Act, our long-term \nfiscal trajectory remains unsustainable. Last month the Congressional \nBudget Office projected that publicly held Federal debt is on course to \nexceed the size of our entire economy. By that point, again, under \ncurrent law, the interest we have to pay to China and other foreign \ncreditors that hold more than half of our debt will be 2\\1/2\\ times \ngreater than the 40-year average. We know interest rates are \nextraordinarily and abnormally low because of the policies of the \nFederal Reserve. But can you imagine, for that $17 trillion in debt on \nwhich the U.S. Government would have to pay historic averages of \ninterest to our creditors in order to get them to buy our debt, what \nimpact that would have? Well, I will talk about that more in a moment.\n  If we continue down this road without adopting real reforms for our \nlong-term fiscal challenges, we will condemn our children and our \ngrandchildren to fewer jobs, slower economic growth, worse opportunity, \nand a much greater risk of a full-blown fiscal crisis.\n  In the event of a crisis, our safety net programs that we all care \nabout for the most vulnerable in our country would be cut harshly and \nabruptly, as would\n\n[[Page S7258]]\n\nour ability to fund national security and other priorities.\n  Nobody wants that kind of a future. Nobody has to accept that kind of \na future if we just do our job--not the President trying to go it alone \nagain, not the Senate saying ``it is my way or the highway'' to the \nHouse, but by the House and the Senate and the White House working \ntogether to try to work our way through it.\n  But if we continue to rack up debt--another trillion is what the \nPresident wants to raise the debt limit--and if we continue to postpone \nthe hard choices and leave it to others, we will move closer and closer \nto an eventual disaster. By contrast, if we were to take the \nresponsibility now to reform our safety net programs, we could reform \nthem gradually so that people would barely feel it. That will make it \nmuch easier to protect the Americans who need these programs the most--\nour seniors and the most vulnerable in our society.\n  Of course, we cannot make any real progress as long as the President \nand the majority leader in the Senate refuse to negotiate. As I said \nearlier, Congress is not a rubberstamp. That is not the Constitution \nwritten by our Founders. The House of Representatives is not a \nrubberstamp for the Senate. We have been willing to compromise and \nnegotiate. As a matter of fact, the House has sent over multiple bills. \nEvery time a Member of the opposing party comes to the floor and talks \nabout the National Institutes of Health's funding being cut off for \nchildren's cancer research, we have come down here and said: Well, \nlet's pass the bill. Let's pass that appropriation.\n\n  When someone has said: Well, what about the veterans' disability \nclaims that are stacking up and are not being processed as a result of \nthe shutdown, the House has passed legislation. We have come to the \nfloor and offered legislation that would allow us to address that \nproblem, but we have been told no time and time again.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 4 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we need to work together. That is the only \nway this is going to happen. We know it will happen. It is going to \nhappen. The President cannot take the unsustainable position that ``it \nis my way or the highway and I will not negotiate,'' especially since \nhe has done it before, especially since that is the only way our \nconstitutional framework allows the resolution of problems. If we were \nto do--which we are not going to do--what the President and the \nmajority leader have asked us to do, which is to raise the debt limit \nautomatically without dealing with any of our long-term fiscal \nproblems, we would simply be encouraging Congress and our policymakers \nto delay the tough choices and hard votes. We would be encouraging--\nindeed, we would be enabling--this type of fiscal profligacy that has \nleft us with a gross national debt of $17 trillion, which is about \n$53,000 for every man, woman, and child in America.\n  More than $6 trillion of debt has been added since President Obama \nbecame President of the United States. Yet the President seems to show \nabsolutely no sense of urgency in dealing with it. That is despite his \nown fiscal commission, the Simpson-Bowles Commission, coming back in \nDecember 2010--that was a bipartisan commission he himself appointed--\nthey came back with their own policy prescription to deal with this \nproblem. Republicans, some of our most conservative Members, and some \nof the most liberal Members on the other side of the aisle came \ntogether and they voted for the Simpson-Bowles Commission report in \nDecember 2010, but the President simply walked away from it.\n  Back in March, he told ABC News:\n\n       We do not have an immediate crisis in terms of debt. In \n     fact, for the next 10 years, it is going to be in a \n     sustainable place.\n\n  That is what the President of the United States said last March. But \nthat is not what his own bipartisan fiscal commission said in December \n2010. That is not what the Congressional Budget Office says. As \neverybody around here knows, the Congressional Budget Office is the \nfinal authority on these matters. In their 2013 long-term budget \noutlook, on page 13, they have a couple of pages that I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  It is entitled ``Consequences of Large and Growing Federal Debt.'' \nThey did not say: We do not have an immediate crisis in terms of debt, \nand we are pretty much in a sustainable place for 10 years.\n  They said:\n\n       The high and rising amounts of Federal debt held by the \n     public that CBO projects for the coming decades under the \n     extended baseline would have significant negative \n     consequences for both the economy and the federal budget.\n\n  What were those? They said there would be less national savings and \nless future income. They said there would be pressure for larger tax \nincreases and spending cuts to deal with this, particularly the \nphenomena of high interest payments that I mentioned a moment ago.\n  Again, because of the Federal Reserve's policies, it costs next to \nnothing for the Federal Government in terms of interest on our national \ndebt, but when that goes back up to historic averages, to 4, 5 percent, \nit is going to cost trillions of dollars more for us to service the \nexisting debt, not to mention the additional trillion the President \nwants to borrow.\n  What is that going to do? Well, that is going to crowd out other \npriorities such as NASA, which my colleague from Florida and I both \nthink is an important national priority. I heard the Senator from Ohio \nsay the same. But higher interest payments as a result of not dealing \nwith this high debt are going to crowd out other important national \npriorities.\n  Finally, the Congressional Budget Office said there is a ``greater \nchance of a fiscal crisis.'' Specifically, what they are talking about \nis that as we pay more and more for interest on our national debt, we \nlose more and more control over our fiscal future. As we all know on a \nbipartisan basis, we have been told time and time again by the experts \nthat when our creditors lose confidence in our ability to repay debt, \nthere can come a breaking moment when all of a sudden we lose control \nand all of these things happen, which we can avoid if we deal \nresponsibly today.\n  In other words, the President seems content to let one of his \nsuccessors deal with the problem of our rising national debt--that is \nonly, I would add, if we get lucky enough to postpone the kinds of \ncrises and problems CBO and Simpson-Bowles project that long. The \nPresident obviously has other priorities, but I want to remind him what \nhis own former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen, \nsaid when he was asked about the Nation's biggest threat to our \nnational security.\n  He said it was the national debt. The President himself has echoed \nthose comments, but the President is still sitting on the sidelines and \nstill takes the untenable position that he is unwilling to negotiate. \nAt a time when the country needs genuine leadership, he is nowhere to \nbe found.\n  Until that changes, we are not going to get any closer to where we \nneed to be sooner, rather than later, and that is a true bipartisan \ncompromise.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article: \n``Consequences of Large and Growing Federal Debt.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the 2013 Long-Term Budget Outlook, Sept. 2013]\n\n             Consequences of Large and Growing Federal Debt\n\n       The high and rising amounts of federal debt held by the \n     public that CBO projects for coming decades under the \n     extended baseline would have significant negative \n     consequences for both the economy and the federal budget. \n     Those consequences include reducing the total amounts of \n     national saving and income; increasing the government's \n     interest payments, thereby putting more pressure on the rest \n     of the budget; limiting lawmakers' flexibility to respond to \n     unexpected events; and increasing the likelihood of a fiscal \n     crisis.\n\n\n                 Less National Saving and Future Income\n\n       Large federal budget deficits over the long term would \n     reduce investment, resulting in lower national income and \n     higher interest rates than would otherwise occur. The reason \n     is that increased government borrowing would cause a larger \n     share of the savings potentially available for investment to \n     be used for purchasing government securities, such as \n     Treasury bonds. Those purchases would ``crowd out'' \n     investment in capital goods,\n\n[[Page S7259]]\n\n     such as factories and computers, which make workers more \n     productive. Because wages are determined mainly by workers' \n     productivity, the reduction in investment would also reduce \n     wages, lessening people's incentive to work. In addition, \n     both private borrowers and the government would have to pay \n     higher interest rates to compete for savings, and those \n     higher rates would strengthen people's incentive to save. \n     However, the rise in private saving would be a good deal \n     smaller than the increase in federal borrowing represented by \n     the change in the deficit, so national saving would decline, \n     as would private investment. (For a detailed analysis of \n     those economic effects, see Chapter 6.)\n       In the short run, though, large federal budget deficits \n     would tend to boost demand, thus increasing output and \n     employment relative to what they would be with smaller \n     deficits. That is especially the case under conditions like \n     those now prevailing in the United States--with substantial \n     unemployment and underused factories, offices, and \n     equipment--which have led the Federal Reserve to push short-\n     term interest rates down almost to zero. The effects of the \n     higher demand would be temporary because stabilizing forces \n     in the economy tend to move output back toward its potential \n     level. Those forces include the response of prices and \n     interest rates to higher demand, as well as (in normal times) \n     actions by the Federal Reserve.\n\n\n    Pressure for Larger Tax Increases or Spending Cuts in the Future\n\n       Large amounts of federal debt ordinarily require the \n     government to make large interest payments to its lenders, \n     and growth in the debt causes those interest payments to \n     increase. (Net interest payments are currently fairly small \n     relative to the size of the federal budget because interest \n     rates are exceptionally low, but CBO projects that those \n     payments will increase considerably as rates return to more \n     normal levels.)\n       Higher interest payments would consume a larger portion of \n     federal revenues, resulting in a larger gap between the \n     remaining revenues and the amount that would be spent on \n     federal programs under current law. Hence, if lawmakers \n     wanted to maintain the benefits and services that the \n     government is scheduled to provide under current law, while \n     not allowing deficits to increase as interest payments grew, \n     revenues would have to rise as well. Additional revenues \n     could be raised in many different ways, but to the extent \n     that they were generated by boosting marginal tax rates (the \n     rates on an additional dollar of income), the higher tax \n     rates would discourage people from working and saving, \n     further reducing output and income. Alternatively, lawmakers \n     could choose to offset rising interest costs, at least in \n     part, by reducing benefits and services. Those reductions \n     could be made in many ways, but to the extent that they came \n     from cutting federal investments, future output and income \n     would also be reduced. As another option, lawmakers could \n     respond to higher interest payments by allowing deficits to \n     increase for some time, but that approach would require \n     greater deficit reduction later if lawmakers wanted to avoid \n     a long-term increase in debt relative to GDP.\n\n\n   Reduced Ability to Respond to Domestic and International Problems\n\n       Having a relatively small amount of outstanding debt gives \n     a government the ability to borrow funds to address \n     significant unexpected events, such as recessions, financial \n     crises, and wars. In contrast, having a large amount of debt \n     leaves a government with less flexibility to address \n     financial and economic crises, which in many countries have \n     been very costly. A large amount of debt could also harm a \n     country's national security by constraining military spending \n     in times of crisis or limiting the country's ability to \n     prepare for such a crisis.\n       A few years ago, the size of the U.S. federal debt gave the \n     government the flexibility to respond to the financial crisis \n     and severe recession by increasing spending and cutting taxes \n     to stimulate economic activity, providing public funding to \n     stabilize the financial sector, and continuing to pay for \n     other programs even as tax revenues dropped sharply because \n     of the decline in output and income. If federal debt stayed \n     at its current percentage of GDP or grew further, the \n     government would find it more difficult to undertake similar \n     policies in the future. As a result, future recessions and \n     financial crises could have larger negative effects on the \n     economy and on people's well-being. Moreover, the reduced \n     financial flexibility and increased dependence on foreign \n     investors that would accompany a rise in debt could weaken \n     the United States' international leadership.\n\n\n                   Greater Chance of a Fiscal Crisis\n\n       A large and continually growing federal debt would have \n     another significant negative consequence: It would increase \n     the probability of a fiscal crisis for the United States. In \n     such a crisis, investors become unwilling to finance all of a \n     government's borrowing needs unless they are compensated with \n     very high interest rates; as a result, the interest rates on \n     government debt rise suddenly and sharply relative to rates \n     of return on other assets. That increase in interest rates \n     reduces the market value of outstanding government bonds, \n     causing losses for investors who hold them. Such a decline \n     can precipitate a broader financial crisis by creating losses \n     for mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, banks, \n     and other holders of government debt--losses that may be \n     large enough to cause some financial institutions to fail.\n       Unfortunately, there is no way to predict with any \n     confidence whether or when such a fiscal crisis might occur \n     in the United States. In particular, there is no identifiable \n     tipping point of debt relative to GDP that indicates that a \n     crisis is likely or imminent. All else being equal, however, \n     the larger a government's debt, the greater the risk of a \n     fiscal crisis.\n       The likelihood of such a crisis also depends on the \n     economic environment, both domestic and international. If \n     investors expect continued economic growth, they are \n     generally less concerned about debt burdens; conversely, high \n     debt can reinforce more general concern about an economy. In \n     many cases around the world, fiscal crises have begun during \n     recessions and, in turn, have exacerbated them. In some \n     instances, a crisis has been triggered by news that a \n     government would, for any number of reasons, need to borrow \n     an unexpectedly large amount of money. Then, as investors \n     lost confidence and interest rates spiked, borrowing became \n     more difficult and expensive for the government. That \n     development forced policymakers to either cut spending and \n     increase taxes immediately and substantially to reassure \n     investors, or renege on the terms of the country's existing \n     debt, or increase the supply of money and boost inflation. In \n     some cases, a fiscal crisis also made borrowing more \n     expensive for private-sector borrowers because uncertainty \n     about the government's response to the crisis reduced \n     confidence in the viability of private-sector enterprises. \n     Higher private-sector interest rates, combined with \n     reductions in government spending and increases in taxes, \n     have tended to worsen economic conditions in the short term.\n       If a fiscal crisis occurred in the United States, \n     policymakers would have only limited--and unattractive--\n     options for responding to it. In particular, the government \n     would need to undertake some combination of three approaches: \n     restructuring its debt (that is, seeking to modify the \n     contractual terms of its existing obligations), pursuing \n     inflationary monetary policy, and adopting an austerity \n     program of spending cuts and tax increases. Thus, such a \n     crisis would confront policymakers with extremely difficult \n     choices and probably have a very significant negative impact \n     on the country.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, before the Chair is yielded, I wish to say \nit is almost like deja vu all over again. The great Senator from Maine \nwas sitting in the chair only a few days ago when this Senator had a \nchance to make comments. Here we are again.\n  I wish to say to the Senator from Texas, as he is leaving the \nChamber, that I think the Senator is a good Senator who believes \nstrongly in what he is saying, but if there is a will, there is a way. \nReasonable people can come together and work through to a reasonable \nconclusion.\n  I was going to say, with the Senator from Texas on the floor, the \nSenator had a chance to express his opinion. Indeed, the Senator did \nwith his vote when we passed the appropriations bill, now called the \ncontinuing resolution, because we have not brought each of the \nappropriations bills to the floor.\n  We accepted it at the House number. The senior Senator from Texas \nexpressed his opinion by means of his ``no'' vote, but ``yes'' votes \nwon, and we sent it to the other body to keep the government open. \nIndeed, the government is not open.\n  I go back to 2 days ago when the Senator from Maine was the Presiding \nOfficer and here we are again. If we would remember the Golden Rule put \nin the old English: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you \nor put into modern street language: Treat others as you want to be \ntreated--in other words, recognize that the other fellow has a point of \nview and you have to respect his point of view--even though his point \nof view may be different from yours--the genius of American democracy \nis hammering out those differences and building consensus in a civil \nway and achieving a workable solution. What we have here is \nbrinkmanship.\n  We hammered it out, we passed appropriations, a continuing \nresolution. We sent it to the House of Representatives, and they will \nnot put it up for a vote because they are only--and this is operative--\ngoing to pass this with Republican votes.\n  What does that do? This takes an outsized minority of the Republican \ncaucus being the tail that is wagging the Republican dog in the House \nof Representatives. If they only pass it with Republican votes instead \nof the will of the whole House then, in fact, we will have what we have \nnow, a small out-of-the-mainstream political philosophy extremist group \ndictating what\n\n[[Page S7260]]\n\nthey want and only what they want. It is their way or no way. That is \nnot treating others as they wish to be treated. This is an attitude of \nsaying: I know better than you and my way is going to be the only way. \nThat is not how we govern this country. That is not how we honor and \nrespect other people's points of view that may be different from ours.\n  I do not wish to hold up the Senator from Maine, but I wanted to \nfollow up on the conversation I had through the Chair 2 days ago. All \nof these high-minded, highfalutin ideas of all of us getting together \nand treating each other as we wish to be treated and hammering out this \npolicy--lo and behold, maybe everything I am saying doesn't have a \nthing to do with this by virtue of an investigative piece having been \ndone by the New York Times over the weekend. I wish to read the first \nthree paragraphs of this investigative piece. It is entitled: ``A \nFederal Budget Crisis Months in the Planning'' by Sheryl Gay Stolberg \nand Mike McIntire.\n\n       Shortly after President Obama started his second term, a \n     loose-knit coalition of conservative activists led by former \n     Attorney General Edwin Meese III gathered in the capital to \n     plot strategy. Their push to repeal Mr. Obama's health care \n     law was going nowhere, and they desperately needed a new \n     plan.\n       Out of that session, held one morning in a location the \n     members insist on keeping secret, came a little-noticed \n     ``blueprint to defunding Obamacare,'' signed by Mr. Meese and \n     leaders of more than three dozen conservative groups.\n       It articulated a take-no-prisoners legislative strategy \n     that has long percolated in conservative circles: that \n     Republicans could derail the health care overhaul if \n     conservative lawmakers were willing to push fellow \n     Republicans--including their cautious leaders--into cutting \n     off financing for the entire federal government.\n\n  This is only the first three paragraphs. If that is true, then all of \nthese high-minded ideas of the Golden Rule and treating each other with \nrespect and working out your differences is all out the window.\n  If that is true--and it looks as if it is by virtue of what we see \ngoing on down in the other end of this Capitol Building, a small group \nof people are not going to do anything to open the government unless \nthey get their way to defund the Affordable Care Act, the health care \nreform act--I would suggest that if that is the case, then the people \nwho are suffering should sit up and take notice of what is happening to \ntheir government.\n  We have heard examples over and over. Senator Brown and I were just \ntalking about the 97 percent of people who are laid off in NASA. Then \nwhat do we do with all of the civilian workforce in NASA? Think of what \nthis is doing to all of the contractors who work for NASA.\n  We have heard also the statistic out here that over 70 percent of the \nintelligence community has been furloughed. We have heard that Head \nStart, the federally funded program to get children ready to start the \npublic schools, kindergarten and first grade, is shutting down.\n  We know last week, when we were in the middle of this shutdown, there \nwas a storm brewing in the Gulf of Mexico. Thank the good Lord it \nfizzled out, but at one point it was expected to turn into a Category 1 \nhurricane hitting the gulf coast. Had that happened, FEMA had been laid \noff--although they reached back and started the National Guard, et \ncetera. Thank you to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel for finding an \nunintended consequence in the law that was passed to pay the U.S. \nmilitary while the government is shut down because he found a little \nhook in there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. He found a hook in there so he could then extend that to \nmost of the civilian workforce, including some of the National Guard, \nbut we didn't know that.\n  In my State of Florida, 156 employees were getting the notices just \nin the National Guard on Friday. There were already 1,000 military \ntechnicians that had been furloughed in the National Guard, and we had \nan inbound storm.\n  What about the programs in our State to help veterans find jobs? If \nwe are not done with this shutdown at the end of October, that is gone. \nWhat about the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, a \npart of the State government. Ten percent of their funds are Federal \nfunds. What about the Florida Department of Agriculture? Over 6 percent \nof their workforce is federally funded.\n  What about--and we have heard this in the Senate--Women, Infants, and \nChildren? A society is supposed to take care of its very old and its \nvery young. This is why we have programs for Women, Infants, and \nChildren. Yet the supplemental nutrition program for women, for nursing \nmothers, for children up to the age of 5, for breast-feeding support, \nfor nutrition education, and for health checkups is gone.\n  I could go on and on. Others have said it more articulately than I. \nThis is ridiculous. This shouldn't go on. As the drumbeat of the \ncrescendo continues, it will grow louder as we march toward October 17, \nwhen the debt ceiling has to be raised so we don't go into default.\n  It is a sad day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). The assistant majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/07/senate-section/article/S7260-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7260-S7261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     STIRLING AND ELLIS NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I rise to speak in support of two individuals whose \nnominations will be voted on at 5 p.m. We haven't set any records in \nthe Senate in the last 5 weeks for productivity. We passed one major \npiece of legislation, which the Senator from Oregon brought before us \nrelative to the issue of our helium reserve. It was great work. It is \none of the few bipartisan actions we have accomplished in 5 weeks, \nmaybe the only bipartisan one. At 5 p.m. we have a chance to improve \nour record.\n  These are two nominees for Federal district court judges in Illinois \nthat I commend to the Members of the Senate.\n  I wish to say at the outset it isn't only this Senator on this side \nof the aisle making this recommendation, Senator Mark Kirk and I worked \non a bipartisan basis to come up with these nominees and get them \napproved by our nomination committees. They are then approved by us, by \nthe White House, by the Judiciary Committee, and brought to the floor.\n  Since Senator Kirk has been elected, we have done this in lockstep, \ntogether every step of the way. By tradition, the President's party \nSenator, in this case myself, has three appointments. Senator Kirk has \nthe fourth, but each of us has the veto power over the other's choices.\n  We have a working relationship and a good one. Senator Kirk has \nendorsed these two nominees: Colin Bruce, who has been nominated to \nserve in the Central District of Illinois, and Sara Ellis, nominated to \nserve in the Northern District of Illinois. They have the experience, \nqualifications, and integrity to be excellent Federal judges. Both \nappeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a hearing on June \n19, and both were reported out of the committee by a unanimous voice \nvote.\n\n  I would like briefly to discuss their backgrounds and qualifications.\n  Colin Bruce has been nominated to fill the judicial vacancy that \nopened in Urbana when Judge Michael McCuskey took senior status. \nMichael McCuskey is also one of my appointments, an outstanding Federal \njudge. I am sorry he is going into senior status, but he felt, and I \ndid too, that Colin Bruce would be an excellent replacement to succeed \nhim in that position.\n  Mr. Bruce has worked in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central \nDistrict of Illinois since 1989. He currently serves as the first \nassistant U.S. attorney, a position he has held since 2010.\n  Colin Bruce applied for the position of U.S. attorney. He didn't get \nit. But the man who did, the man I selected, Jim Lewis, hired him as \nhis first assistant. So it was a few months ago that Jim Lewis, the \nU.S. District Attorney, came by my office with Colin Bruce. We talked \nabout a number of things, and he said: Incidentally, I don't know what \nI would do without Colin Bruce. He is such an extraordinary first \nassistant. When he finished his presentation, I said: Jim, would you \nstick around for a minute; Colin, go outside, if you would. I said: \nJim, I have an opening for a judgeship, and I know Colin is a person \nwho would fill that\n\n[[Page S7261]]\n\nbill. He has already gone through all the vetting. He would be an \nextraordinary judge, but you would lose him as your first assistant. He \nsaid: I can't stand in his way. I couldn't think of a better choice to \nbe a judge in this district.\n  Colin Bruce was born in Urbana, IL. He got his undergraduate and law \ndegrees from the University of Illinois and went straight to the U.S. \nAttorney's Office out of law school. He has handled criminal, civil \ncases, and bankruptcy and tort claims filed against the government. He \nthen shifted to prosecuting complex criminal matters, drug fraud and \ncyber crime cases. In 2007, he was appointed branch chief of the Urbana \ndivision of the U.S. Attorney's Office, and in 2010 he was named first \nassistant U.S. attorney, which is the No. 2 position, as I mentioned.\n  In his current capacity, he oversees the day-to-day operations of the \nU.S. Attorney's Office, supervises all the Federal criminal \ninvestigations, prosecutions, and appeals in the district, as well as \ncivil defensive and affirmative litigation in the district in which the \nUnited States is a party.\n  He has received numerous recognitions, including certifications of \nappreciation from the Justice Department, the FBI, and the DEA, as well \nas awards from the Illinois State Police and the Metropolitan \nEnforcement Group and Task Force.\n  He has a record of giving back to the Urbana community through his \nassociation with charities, such as the Central Illinois Chapter of the \nAmerican Red Cross and Imagine No Malaria, a charity that purchases \nmosquito nets for families in Africa.\n  He is an outstanding nominee for the Federal bench, and has a great \nfamily whom he brought to the hearing. I certainly urge my colleagues \nto join Senator Kirk and me in supporting his nomination.\n  The second nominee is Sara Ellis. She has been nominated for a \nChicago-based judgeship that was formerly occupied by the distinguished \nJudge Joan Gottschall. Ms. Ellis currently works at the prestigious law \nfirm of Schiff Hardin in Chicago, where her practice involves white-\ncollar criminal matters, complex civil litigation, and corporate \ncounseling.\n  She was born in Ontario, Canada, to parents who had emigrated from \nJamaica. She moved to the United States and became a citizen at the age \nof 15. Her undergraduate degree is from Indiana University and her law \ndegree is from the Loyola University Chicago School of Law.\n  After law school, Ms. Ellis joined the Federal Defender Program in \nChicago, where she served for 6 years as a staff attorney. In this \ncapacity she represented indigent criminal defendants in all aspects of \ncriminal litigation, preliminary hearings, trials, sentencing hearings, \nand appeals. She then worked in private practice for several years \nbefore joining the City of Chicago Department of Law in 2004, where she \nserved as assistant corporation counsel for 4 years, primarily handling \nsection 1983 cases.\n  In 2008, Ms. Ellis joined Schiff Hardin, where she handles criminal \nand civil matters. She has served as an adjunct professor at Loyola \nUniversity Chicago School of Law, teaching Federal criminal practice \nand legal writing.\n  She has a distinguished record of pro bono work and community \nservice. Among her endeavors she has taught reading and legal skills to \nchildren living in juvenile detention and she has provided legal advice \nand guidance to the Warren Park Youth Baseball League.\n  She is also actively involved with St. Gertrude Catholic Parish in \nChicago and is on the board of the parish school, Northside Catholic \nAcademy.\n  Ms. Ellis is an excellent nominee for a Federal judge. She too is a \nperson with great family and children backing her up, and I am happy \nSenator Kirk and I can commend her as well to the Senate for this \nnomination.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in voting to confirm these two \nnominees who have bipartisan support and will be outstanding Federal \njudges.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/07/senate-section/article/S7261-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7261-S7265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I want to thank \nthe Senator from Illinois for his kind words, and I certainly support \nthe appointments, and I am glad we were able to get that legislation \npassed on a bipartisan basis to help American industry.\n  On Friday last, it was thrilling to read the United States is now No. \n1 in the world when it comes to energy production--not Saudi Arabia, \nnot Russia, but our country. It was a particular source of such \nsatisfaction because, after all these years of the American people \nhearing about how we are dependent on foreign sources of energy, at the \ntop of our papers Friday last the energy experts said the red, white, \nand blue was at the top in terms of energy production.\n  This good news story about the energy boom is, obviously, as the \nPresiding Officer knows, absolutely essential to creating more high-\nskilled, high-wage jobs. I saw it, along with my colleague, when I was \nin his State, and we see it all across the country. This energy boom, \nfor example, has been key to triggering a manufacturing renaissance--\nthe lower cost of natural gas in particular being a magnet to bringing \ncompanies that had gone overseas back to the United States again and \nemploying our workers with good-paying jobs. It has been key to the \nfalling imports of foreign oil. Of course, wind and solar farms are \nadding tremendously to the power mix. In our part of the country, \nShepherds Flat in eastern Oregon is our country's biggest wind farm, \nand we are especially proud of it.\n  The current senseless government shutdown is putting this good news \nstory at risk. When it comes to causing problems, unfortunately, this \nshutdown has something for everybody. If you care about oil and natural \ngas development, Federal agencies now cannot approve drilling permits \neither on Federal land or offshore. If you care about renewable energy, \nwind and wave energy permitting is now at a standstill. It is at a \nstandstill because of the shutdown. Environmental reviews for solar \nfarms on Federal land have stopped. The Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission has canceled a meeting about implementing two hydropower \nbills that passed this Congress on overwhelming votes.\n  In my part of the country we are especially proud of this \nlegislation. Hydropower is responsible. It is actually the biggest \nsource of clean power in the United States. Industry estimates it could \ngenerate perhaps as much as 60,000 megawatts of additional clean power. \nThese hydropower bills--there were two of them--were the first stand-\nalone energy bills to become law since 2009. Now they languish because \nof the shutdown.\n  All of these developments--the developments I have described with \nrespect to natural gas development, solar and wind energy, the \nhydropower laws that passed overwhelmingly in both the Senate and the \nHouse--are now, in effect, languishing. What it means is less new \nenergy, fewer new jobs, and less revenue--less revenue that we are \ngoing to need in both the public and the private sector.\n  I might also add this shutdown harms the important safety work that \nneeds to be done by blocking work that is going to speed up the \nresponse to oilspills and accidents offshore. Of particular concern to \nme, and I know to so many others in the Senate--I see my colleague from \nAlaska is here--are the people who get hammered, who get hit hardest by \nthese consequences who live in our rural communities, the ones who \ndepend upon producing energy, timber, and recreation. They are the ones \nwho feel the biggest hit from the shutdown.\n  I am going to talk about what this means in terms of recreation and \nhunting and fishing. The hunting season starts at different times in \ndifferent parts of the country, but between recreation and hunting and \nfishing we are talking about something in the vicinity of $646 billion \na year which goes just to the recreation sector, and another $140-\nbillion-plus in terms of hunting. I am going to describe the \nconsequences there, but we are talking about policies with enormous \nimpact for our rural communities.\n  I mentioned the thrilling news of last Friday, about how we were tops \nin terms of energy production, but I got some additional news that \nwasn't exactly thrilling last Friday when I was\n\n[[Page S7262]]\n\ncalled by the Chief of the Forest Service, Tom Tidwell, who called to \nreport the Forest Service had canceled 450 timber sales on 120 national \nforests across the country. What that means is loggers, such as the \nhardworking folks I represent in Oregon, who want to do a hard day's \nwork, are being benched because of this shutdown.\n  The shutdown comes at a particularly ominous time because winter is \nat hand, in effect putting an end to logging operations for the year in \nmany parts of our country. That means workers won't be able to make up \nfor this lost time and money this year. Those loggers will simply have \nto get by with less. So again, rural communities are the face of what \nthis means. They are the ones that are going to get walloped because of \na handful of Members of Congress--a handful of Members of Congress--who \nwon't fund the government.\n  So logging, energy, recreation, I mentioned the hunting season, the \nsort of flip side of the coin with respect to recreation. While the \nhunting season for ducks and geese is starting in my home State and \nacross the country, the government shutdown here is closing hundreds of \nwildlife refuges where those waterfowl are normally fair game. \nAccording to the Fish and Wildlife Service, hunting, fishing and \nwildlife-related activities generate about $144 billion per year. \nHunters contribute $5.4 billion in State and local taxes each year. \nBecause the waterfowl season is only 3 months long in Oregon, if you \nlose 1 week, every lost week is a huge bite out of the benefits that \nhunting brings to our local economy.\n  What Senators may also not be aware of is the shutdown also means our \ngovernment is less prepared to respond to these fires, these rapidly \ndeveloping dangerous infernos in our national forests. The fires have \nlessened in some parts of the West, but there are areas of high to \nextreme danger in California, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, South \nDakota, and other States. While many firefighters are considered \nessential, others, such as our off-duty firefighters, have been \nfurloughed. Public safety on Federal lands is also impacted by these \nfurloughs. Although law enforcement continues, without rangers and \nother agency employees on hand, the conditions are ripe for visitors to \nfind their way into severely understaffed forests and pose a safety \nrisk. And, of course, thousands of hardworking employees at these key \nnatural resource agencies are now out of work.\n  As we speak, there are 24,000 furloughed at the Forest Service, more \nthan 10,000 furloughed at the Bureau of Land Management. If they are \nnot working, Bureau of Land Management employees can't issue permits \nfor grazing on Federal lands. Energy Department workers and contractors \ncan't clean up nuclear waste sites, such as that at the Hanford \nReservation that threatens the Columbia River and the million people \nwho live downstream.\n  Our committee, recognizing the situation, recently had to cancel a \nhearing on the Columbia River Treaty, which is vital to the energy and \nenvironment of the Pacific Northwest. It is vital to our relations with \nCanada. This treaty is about managing a river that is the lifeblood for \nthe Pacific Northwest. It is our lifeblood for transportation, for \nelectricity, for fish, and there isn't much time for our two nations to \ncome together to decide the treaty's future.\n  I have tried to describe what the shutdown means in terms of our \nstatus as No. 1 in energy production, what it means with respect to \nlogging and forest fires, hunting and recreation, and it is all \nhappening because a small group of Members in the other Chamber is \ndemanding negotiations with the American economy tied to the train \ntracks. It is especially ironic that in many cases the districts of \nthose Members are the ones that are going to bear the brunt of the \nimpasse, those rural communities. They are the ones that are going to \nbear the consequences of stalled energy production and stalled logging.\n  I hope we can quickly come together and pass this budget without all \nthe various additions that have made it impossible for Congress to go \nforward. It is time to reopen the government. I have spent a lot of \ntime working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle on these other \nissues, and I will continue to do so, and I know a lot of Senators \nwill. Right now it is time to reopen the government and end the \nshutdown.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, if the Senator will stay on the floor for \na moment, one of the bills mentioned by the Senator from Illinois was \nthe helium bill. Within that there is an important Alaska priority. I \nknow my colleagues worked with the Senator--important to my State--on \ncleaning up those legacy wells that have been on Federal land for years \nwith oil literally seeping out of those wells. And now there is money \nfor the first time in I don't know how many years to actually clean up \nthese wells. But from what I just heard, and correct me if I am wrong, \nwhat the Senator just indicated is that the Bureau of Land Management \ndoesn't have the capacity to do permitting and other staffing. So there \nis no work to be done even though we finally passed a bipartisan bill \nin both Houses, signed by the President--something that has been \nwaiting for decades to be cleaned. Am I correct on this, that BLM now \ncan't do the work we want them to do? And Alaskans have been \ndesperately waiting for decades.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I say to the Senator, we know for certain that 10,000 \nindividuals have been furloughed at the Bureau of Land Management. And \nI tried to describe particularly getting these new permits. I guess if \nwe are already out there with something--and I talked to Chief Tidwell \nabout how we would try to stabilize operations that have, in effect, \nbeen put in place now. But we are not going to be able to go forward \nwith new operations like the Senator from Alaska is describing.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I know the Senator came to Alaska a few months ago and \nhad an opportunity to see some of the great ability of our energy \ncompanies and what we are trying to do. Today I got an important \nannouncement from Exxon and ConocoPhillips about building an LNG plant \nin an area the Senator had a chance to see. I didn't want to tell them \nyet, but I wanted to say thank you for the announcement, the \nmultibillion-dollar investment in our State, something we have been \ndoing already for 40 years--exporting to Japan. But now if there are \nany Federal Government permits they will need, the odds of them getting \nthem in a timely manner are now delayed. Is that a fair statement?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Again, the Senator is right, because in Alaska, like \nOregon, there is an extraordinary level of Federal ownership. In my \nState the Federal Government owns more than half of the land. The \nSenator is absolutely correct. With the shutdown, Federal agencies \ncannot approve drilling permits either on Federal land or offshore, and \nI saw both when I was in Alaska.\n  The point is that these are issues we can work on in a bipartisan \nway. As soon as the government gets reopened, we will go about the task \nof getting those permits out and coming together on a bipartisan basis, \nas we have done on so many issues. But we can't do it if the government \nis shut down. We can't do it if we can't pay our bills. That is what we \nare going to have to deal with.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I think this is more of a question/comment. One of the \nstatements at the end talked about how this was held up. We passed a \nbill out of here--a continuing resolution--in which we cut, on an \nannualized basis, $70 billion. We didn't compromise. We took their \nnumber. Let's make sure we are clear. We negotiated starting back in \nJuly, reduced and reduced, and then we went with their number, a $70 \nbillion annualized reduction. The body passed it, and nothing passes \nout of this body unless we get a motion to proceed with some sort of \nunanimous consent or bipartisan, and that was 99 to 0--people forget \nthat--to move us to the bill. Then we moved it and sent it over to the \nHouse, where it has sat since the day we sent it over there. That would \nhave kept this budget operating. Again, it had a $70 billion annualized \nreduction.\n  I think that was the point toward the end of the Senator's comment, \nthat a simple vote over there would put everyone back to work--these \npermits we just talked about, cleaning up the legacy wells.\n  The timber we have in southeastern Alaska is now in jeopardy because \nour Federal lands are now at risk. Is that a fair assessment?\n  Mr. WYDEN. It is. And I am sure the Senator was involved in this as \nwell,\n\n[[Page S7263]]\n\nwhere, after all these years about hearing that the Senate hadn't \npassed a budget, we stayed up one night until the wee hours and passed \na budget. We had scores of votes. Then a lot of us simply wanted to \nhave a conference with the other body. After hearing that there hadn't \nbeen a budget, we thought we would be able to get that conference \ngoing, and we haven't been able to do that either.\n  Mr. BEGICH. And they have passed their budget too. So we have two \nbudgets ready to go to conference; is that fair?\n  Mr. WYDEN. It was there for the doing. I remember coming to the floor \nand asking unanimous consent to go to conference. I knew there had been \nsome conferencing. But there was an immediate objection. At that time I \npointed out that Republican and Democratic economists were saying look \nto the long term. I talked about it that day, saying that Senator \nIsakson of Georgia--a very able Member of the Finance Committee--and I \nhave some new ideas on Medicare that we think can protect the Medicare \nguarantee and hold costs down. But we can't get at those kinds of \nissues unless, as the Senator says, we first reopen the government with \nthat simple vote.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I appreciate the comments, and I thank the Senator for \nanswering these questions. I think it is important again to point out \nthat budget was passed back in April-May. We did ours, and they did \ntheirs. We have tried 18 times to bring the two parties together. We \nhave tried unanimous consent, as the Senator noted, here on the floor \n18 times.\n  Then we went to this continuing resolution. That debate and \nnegotiation started in July. The House had one number, and we had one \nnumber. As time progressed, we took their number--a $70 billion \nannualized reduction. Some would not call that a compromise, but we \nwill call it a negotiated compromise because we wanted to get it done. \nWe again sent it over there. It has sat idle. One person--the Speaker--\ncould put it on the floor. I heard him on the radio or TV this weekend \nexplaining how the votes aren't there. Well, if the votes aren't there, \nput it on the floor and it will fail. But the reality is that the votes \nare there.\n\n  Just as we have taken every one of their items, brought it to the \nfloor--we have voted on every single item over here. They haven't \nprevailed, but we voted because that is the process. But for whatever \nreason, it has gone over there and sat idle.\n  So if the Speaker doesn't think the votes are there, put it up. His \nside will win then. But there are clearly Republicans and Democrats \nover on the House side who want to put the government back in operation \nso we can get on to these bigger issues.\n  Is that a fair chronology of events?\n  Mr. WYDEN. It is. And what I was struck by over the weekend with \nrespect to those comments is, why not at least try that? If we add up \nall the Members on both sides of the aisle who said they would vote, \nfor whatever----\n  Mr. BEGICH. House Members.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes, the House Members who said they would vote for it, it \nsure looks as though the votes are there. And if they are trying to \nbreak the gridlock, why not try?\n  So I hope that kind of thinking will set in here in the next few \nhours because that would be the fastest way, as the Senator from Alaska \nhas made clear, to get the government open.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I thank the Senator for allowing me to ask some \nquestions.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, we are in day number 7 of this government \nshutdown. As was pointed out by the Senator from Alaska and the Senator \nfrom Oregon, we started with a continuing resolution of $1.058 billion. \nThat was compromised down, with the expectation that there would be a \nclean CR, to $986 billion--over a $70 billion reduction. That wasn't \ngood enough because there were some who wanted to add different \namendments to deal with the affordable health care act. The bottom line \nis that we are in the throes of a governmental shutdown.\n  It is interesting that since the government was shut down--midnight \ntonight will be a solid week--we have seen bills come over from the \nHouse that would fund the VA and the National Park Service. The Senator \nfrom Alaska is on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. We both work very \nhard for rural veterans in this country, but we both know the VA can't \ndo their job unless the IRS has funding and CMS has funding. So it is \ngreat to put that political gesture out there, but the truth is that \nthey can't do their job until we have more than just the VA funded.\n  Then there was a story of childhood cancer, so the House came across \nand said: Maybe we ought to fund the National Institutes of Health.\n  Then there was the terrible scene last week where Capitol police \nofficers--who are actually working without pay--had to address a lady \nwho drove up here by the Hart Building. Since those officers responded, \nmaybe we should pay them. So they came across with a bill for them. \nThey should be paid all the time, I might add.\n  Then there is the issue of Hurricane Karen, so we need to fund FEMA. \nSo they came across to fund FEMA.\n  Then they thought, all these furloughed Federal employees, we should \npay them. And I agree, we should. The fact is that they do a great job \nand they should be back here working, and every one of them wants to be \nback here working to get that backpay.\n  Then they decided to fund things such as food inspectors because they \nunderstand our food security is at risk.\n  These guys can't see past their political noses. The bottom line is, \nas the previous speakers talked about, if the Speaker of the House put \nthe clean resolution up with $986 billion, it would pass the House. He \nsaid it wouldn't this weekend. OK. So if it doesn't, put it up anyway. \nProve us wrong. The bottom line is that it would pass and this \nsenseless shutdown would be over.\n  There are plenty of things out there that continue to hamper this \ncountry's moving forward economically due to this economic shutdown. We \nhave talked about Head Start. We have talked about the Forest Service \nsuspending logging contracts. The Senator from Alaska talked about \ndrilling permits. Montana is an outdoor State, and people live for this \ntime of year. It is called hunting season. Access to a lot of the \nhunting, camping, and fishing sites has been severely restricted. This \nweekend the National Guard furloughed its drill for 3,500 guardsmen. \nCommunities around our national parks are being severely impacted, \nlosing literally millions of dollars, which is real money.\n  So how do we get out of this? It is pretty simple: If the Speaker \nwould put the bill on the floor, it would pass. He refuses to do that. \nI think he refuses to do it for another reason, and that reason is that \nI think a lot of his Members want to cater to the tea party movement \nbut go back home and want to appear as if they are moderates. If they \nhad that vote, it would certainly point out who stands for what in that \nbody. That is why he needs to have the vote.\n\n  As was said by the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Alaska, \nwe have had votes on everything they sent over here, just about. The \nfact is they need to do the same. We sent a clean CR to them. Unless \nthey want this shutdown to go and on and on for some unknown reason, \nthey would vote on that clean CR.\n  Then we are rapidly approaching the debt ceiling, which puts the full \nfaith and credit of this country at risk if we do not increase it. I \nmight add this is not money that is yet to be spent, this is money that \nhas been spent. It is not unlike the mortgage on your house or your \ncredit card bill. If you do not pay them, interest rates will go up. If \nwe do not increase the debt limit, interest rates and our national debt \nwill go up. Those who are concerned about the debt and the deficit, as \nI am, and others on both sides of the aisle, we will see our national \ndebt increase, not decrease, by doing something as silly as not \nincreasing the debt ceiling.\n  I know there are some in this body who would love to put issues on \nthe debt ceiling, and they are playing with fire. We saw what happened \nin 2011 when our credit rating was downgraded because some were just \ntalking about not increasing the debt ceiling.\n  The truth is I will be the first to work with anybody in this body to \ntry\n\n[[Page S7264]]\n\nto reduce the debt and deficit by reducing spending, by removing tax \nloopholes in the code. We need to do that at the front end, not the \nback end. The debt limit is dealing with the issue at the back end. If \nwe do not do it, if we do not increase the debt ceiling, we will see \nthe economy spiral down out of control, potentially even putting us \ninto a depression.\n  I don't say that to scare people. I say that to make the point that \nwe should not be fooling around with this issue. We are adults here. We \nneed to get together and realize that the debt ceiling is too important \nto play politics with. I know since I have been here--and this \ngovernment shutdown issue is a prime example--politics has trumped \npolicy nearly every time. It is time to endorse the right policy and \nget a long-term comprehensive deal that is not a patch, that doesn't \nadd to the uncertainty, yet gets us by the continuing resolution, gets \nus out on the debt ceiling so we do not have to deal with this every 45 \nor 90 days and do not have to deal with the debt ceiling just about \nevery year.\n  I think if we were to do that and cooler minds prevailed, we could \nsee this country start to grow economically. We would see unemployment \ndrop even more than we have seen previously. We would see this country \ngo on to have an opportunity to pay down our debt and deficit in a way \nthat makes sense for our kids and grandkids.\n  I do not know where this is going to end. I can tell you the folks \nback home see it for what it is, and they are tired of foolishness and \nthey want to see it stopped. I can tell you what makes it particularly \nfrustrating for me is that as I see businesses start to expand, as I \nsee entrepreneurs ready to take chances, they look at what goes on in \nWashington, DC, and: Whoa, this is not worth it. We don't know what the \nfuture is to bring because of the uncertainty of not only the \ncontinuing resolution, keeping the government open, but also the talk \nthat has been revolving now around the debt ceiling talks.\n  I hope this body will do the right thing, and that it would push the \nHouse to do the right thing; that is, put the clean resolution on the \nfloor in the House. Let's get the debt ceiling behind us. Let's talk \nabout debt and deficit reduction in a meaningful way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Could the Senator from Montana stay for a second so I can \nask for a clarification of one of his beginning statements?\n  Mr. TESTER. Yes.\n  MR. BEGICH. The Senator had at the beginning some good numbers there. \nIf I do the math right, when the Senator from Oregon was here and from \nwhat I saw, we hear over and over there are not negotiations or \ncompromise going on. But if I hear my colleague's numbers right, there \nwere negotiations, there was compromise. As a matter of fact, there was \nso much compromise we went to the House number--not our number, we went \nto their number. We actually reduced the budget on an annualized basis \n$70 billion. Isn't that what the Senator's numbers are? He is on the \nAppropriations Committee, I am on the Appropriations Committee. There \nis one thing we do know a lot about and that is numbers.\n  Mr. TESTER. It is. It is a much lower number. I will tell the good \nSenator from Alaska this: That is what happened in the negotiations. \nThe upshot of all that is that we would get a clean CR coming back if \nwe would negotiate it back down to that figure; there would not be a \nbunch of games being played.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Not a lot of stuff added on later that wasn't necessary. \nWe would debate that later but----\n  Mr. TESTER. Absolutely. And we should debate them later. But the \nbottom line is it is important that we keep our government open. Why? \nBecause we are wasting a ton of money the way it is being done now, and \nthis piecemeal funding, trying to get a political advantage, is crazy. \nPeople see it for what it is: Political gamesmanship.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Isn't it odd they pass ``let's pay everybody,'' 435 to 0, \nthey pass it but they only want to have some of them come back to work? \nIf you are a fiscal conservative--I think I am; we are from Montana, \nAlaska, you know, conservative States--I want them working if we are \npaying them. Doesn't that make sense?\n  Instead, it seems as though we are given a couple of agencies, but \nthey still want to pay everybody. I don't know what the logic is there.\n  Mr. TESTER. Why don't we have them come back? We know the value of \nwork to their self-esteem.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Absolutely.\n  Mr. TESTER. We know those folks are important to my office. If they \nwere not important to my office, they would not be working for me. They \ntell folks what is going on, help constituents when they have problems \nwith some of the agencies around.\n  But the bottom line is they are sitting at home. These are not rich \nfolks. A lot of them are hand to mouth. They don't know how long this \ngovernment shutdown is going to go on and they want to go back to work.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I guess I have one more. The Senator said something I \nthought was very interesting on the budget deficit. The Senator is \nolder than I am. I came here 2 years after the Senator. When we came \nin, we dealt with the debt ceiling, which is about paying the bills. We \nhave to pay the bills that were racked up for a period of time before \nwe got here.\n  In 2009, I think the deficit per year was $1.4 trillion. This year--\nwhich just closed out because we are still not done--it was about $630 \nbillion. That is almost a 60-percent reduction in the deficit. We are \nheaded the right way. But this is not helping.\n  Mr. TESTER. My last point would be this. If we are going to get the \ndebt and deficit under control, one of the things we have to do is grow \nthe economy. By stopping government with this continuing resolution, by \ntalking, simply talking about increasing the debt limit, it does not do \ngood things for our economy. In fact, it takes it in the wrong \ndirection. We see businesses contract when they see what is going on \nhere in Washington.\n  It is time to start using some common sense. There are folks who \nclaim to be business representatives out there. I talked to a bunch of \nbusinesses this afternoon.\n  Mr. BEGICH. The Senator runs a business. He is a farmer.\n  Mr. TESTER. I am. Every one of them said they ought to quit messing \naround, get to an agreement, have the debates on debt and deficit we \nneed to have, because they are important, but don't hold up the debt \nlimit and don't hold up the government funding in the process.\n  I thank my friend from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I thank my good friend for allowing me to take a few \nminutes and ask a couple of points.\n  Mr. President, I am here to say that is what this debate is about, a \nsimple question, allowing a vote on the House side. If they do not have \nthe votes, because obviously the Speaker there believes he doesn't have \nthe votes and he doesn't support it being voted on, let it be on the \nfloor, it will fail, and we will go back to the drawing board.\n  But the reality is he knows the votes are there. We would be out of \nthis shutdown. The result would be people would be back to work, \nservices will be provided, and businesses will not be losing the \nconfidence they are losing every day or like the market once again. \nSince this debate started, the threats of shutdown, of actual shutdown, \nthe stock market over the last 15, 16 days has lost almost 600 points. \nMost people do not pay a lot of attention to that. But if you have an \neducation account, a 401(k) account, a retirement account, an IRA, or \nyou have a little money set aside, it has a direct impact to your \nlivelihood over the long haul.\n  I encourage the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Speaker \nBoehner, to allow a simple vote. We have, on every bill that has come \nover here. They have not prevailed, but we allowed a vote. That is the \nprocess.\n  But over there they refuse to do it. They keep sending back gimmicks. \nIt is hard for me to understand this logic. They want to pay every \nsingle Federal employee, but they are only going to have some of them \ncome back to work. It makes no sense. If you are paying your employees, \nhave them come back and work.\n  I run a small business, my wife runs a small business, I know the \nSenator from Montana, who just left here, runs a small business. You \ndon't pay your people not to come to work. When you pay them to work, \nyou pay them to work.\n\n[[Page S7265]]\n\n  The Presiding Officer was a Governor. He would not say one day: Oh, \nby the way, I am going to pay everyone, stay home for a month. No, he \nwould have them come to work when he is paying them unless they have \nleave or vacation time. This is crazy. It passes unanimously on the \nHouse side.\n  Then they say: But we don't want you to work.\n  The taxpayers should be outraged about that. I want to vote on that \nbill. I want to vote on that furlough bill here. I want to make sure \neveryone gets paid, and then I went to follow it up with the CR and put \neveryone back to work. That is what we should be doing here, not these \ngames where they bring over political statements with the items they \nare bringing over.\n  Do we want to vote against veterans? I have a higher per capita \nnumber of veterans in my State than any other State. Veterans are \nimportant to our economy. They have served our country. They deserve \nevery benefit. But to play this game of leveraging--the American people \nsee right through this. These guys who keep bringing these little \nschemes over here are thinking they are one step ahead of the American \npeople. They are absolutely wrong. The American people are two or three \nsteps ahead of us. They see the show-and-tell that is going on and it \ndoesn't make sense.\n  Again, if you are going to fund all the employees--again, 435 to 0 \nthey voted to fund all the employees who get paid, but then they only \nwant some of them to go to work. It makes no sense to me at all.\n  I appreciate the time of the Presiding Officer allowing me the \nopportunity to engage with a couple of my colleagues here, but every \ntime they spoke I wanted to explain and show kind of the farce that is \ngoing on over there and what is happening over there with a small group \nof the tea party--very small, 30, 40 Members over there, who decided \nthey are going to run the government here.\n  The government is not run by one group, it is run by compromise and \nnegotiation. We have negotiated all the way down to their number, we \nhave put every one of their bills on the floor and voted on them. Now \nall we ask is one simple vote, a clean CR that sits in the Speaker's \noffice, ready to be put on the floor.\n  He even says it will fail. OK. Let's see. Let's see where his votes \nare. Let's see where it all is. If it fails, we will be right back to \nwhere we are today, no difference. What does he fear? He fears the fact \nit will pass.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering judicial nominations \nfrom a previous order.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we are going to vote on two of the \ndistrict court nominations pending before the Senate. I am glad we are \ngetting to these important nominations, as we should have weeks ago. \nThey should have been done in a routine fashion in the normal course of \nevents, but there has been this concerted effort to slow down President \nObama's judges--something we have never seen with other Presidents, but \nwe do with him. I am glad that these are at least going through.\n  In the same vein, we see a needless government shutdown. I hope it \ncomes to an end so the Senate can tend to the business of the country, \nincluding, as I said on the floor the other day, ensuring that the \ncourts have the judges they need. In fact, speaking of judges, they are \nboth from Illinois and have the support of Senator Durbin and Senator \nKirk.\n  I ask that my full statement regarding the judges be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Nominations of Colin Bruce and Sara Ellis\n\n       Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we will vote on two of the \n     district court nominations pending before the Senate. While I \n     am glad we are considering these important nominations today, \n     I hope that this needless government shutdown soon comes to \n     an end so the Senate can tend to the business of the country, \n     including ensuring that our courts have the judges they need.\n       Colin Bruce is nominated to serve on the U.S. District \n     Court for the Central District of Illinois. Mr. Bruce is a \n     lifelong Federal prosecutor who has served in the U.S. \n     Attorney's Office for the Central District of Illinois for \n     nearly 25 years. He has served as the first assistant U.S. \n     attorney since 2010. He has extensive experience in Federal \n     court and has handled over 600 cases, including 60 jury \n     trials, 3 bench trials, and 80 appeals involving a broad \n     range of issues such as drugs, fraud, national security, and \n     cyber crime.\n       Sara Ellis is nominated to serve on the U.S. District Court \n     for the Northern District of Illinois. Ms. Ellis works in \n     private practice in Chicago and also serves as an adjunct \n     professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law. She has \n     substantial experience litigating in the civil and criminal \n     context, having previously worked as a staff attorney for the \n     Federal Defender Program and as an attorney for the city of \n     Chicago Department of Law. Over her 18-year legal career, she \n     has tried 11 cases to verdict.\n       Both of the nominees have the bipartisan support of their \n     home State Senators, Mr. Durbin and Mr. Kirk. They were \n     reported by the Judiciary Committee by voice vote more than 2 \n     months ago. While I am pleased that we are finally getting to \n     vote on these nominees, voting on just 2 of the 13 judicial \n     nominees currently pending on the floor is not enough to make \n     real progress in reducing the vacancies on our Federal \n     courts. Our Federal judicial vacancies currently number more \n     than 90, including 39 that have been designated as emergency \n     vacancies due to high caseloads by the nonpartisan \n     Administrative Office of the Courts. There is no good reason \n     for us to not get back to what used to be the regular order \n     in the Senate of taking up and confirming consensus nominees \n     within days of being reported out of committee. We need to \n     get these talented men and women off the Senate calendar and \n     into the courtroom so they can get to work on behalf of the \n     American people.\n\n\n                          Government Shutdown\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think I have spoken on the floor every \nday since this happened. In what has become an all-too-familiar scene \naround\n\n[[Page S7266]]\n\nthe Capitol over the past few years as we again find ourselves in a \nstalemate over providing funding to keep the Federal Government \nrunning. I share the frustration of most Americans--Republicans and \nDemocrats--that what was once the regular business of Congress, funding \nthe government, has been replaced by political theater and another \nartificial made-in-Congress crisis that might get a number of people on \ntelevision, but while doing it, they imperil the economy, and in ways \nlarge and small, every single family in America. It makes no difference \nwhat their politics are, they are in peril.\n  Of course, there is an easy way to resolve this fabricated crisis. \nThe House of Representatives could simply vote on the Senate bill. It \nis a clean continuing resolution. It has no partisan ideological riders \non the right or the left. It would provide the funding necessary to \nkeep the Federal Government open through November 15, and Speaker \nBoehner could accept the offer Leader Reid made to get on with the \nbusiness of negotiating and passing this year's appropriations bills \nthat should have been passed by the end of last month.\n  Over the past week, the House has had ample opportunity to end this \nshutdown. They could have passed the Senate's legislation to fund all \nof the Federal agencies and provide Congress with the time it needs to \nfind a path forward.\n  Yet a faction--not the whole House by any means--of extreme House \nmembers, supported by their leadership, have prevented the full body \nfrom voting on the Senate bill. Extreme Republican members--they \ncertainly don't represent the kind of Republicans we have in Vermont--\nhave prevented the full body from voting on the Senate bill.\n  Instead, what do they do? They are all collecting their salaries, but \nthey closed the government all because they want to erode access to \naffordable, private health care options for millions of uninsured \nAmericans. It is unconscionable, and they have not come up with an \nalternative.\n  They said: We will get rid of a family's option to keep their \ncollege-aged children on their health insurance, but we have no \nalternative. We are going to get rid of the ability of spouses who may \nhave had a preexisting condition, such as cancer or diabetes or a heart \ncondition, from having insurance. We are going to get rid of that, but \nwe have nothing as an alternative. We are going to eliminate those \noptions, for those--who might be low-income persons--to get insurance, \nbut we have no alternative. We just want to get rid of it.\n  There is no question that this is a crisis driven by a handful of \npartisans on the other side of the aisle for whom there is no path to \ncompromise on just about anything. Well, there is one exception. They \ndo find every possible opportunity to get in front of a television \ncamera and talk about what they have done. The American people ought to \nknow what they are doing; they are hurting them terribly.\n  Their demands are both constantly shifting and breathtakingly \nunreasonable.\n  While the Senate has voted on one flawed House proposal after \nanother, the House refuses to vote on anything from the Senate. \nIncredibly, these same extremists--and they are extremists--are now \nthreatening to employ this same harmful tactic when the Federal \nGovernment reaches its statutory borrowing limit in a couple of weeks.\n  It is interesting that the Speaker says: We are not going to be able \nto do anything on the debt limit. We saw the stock market, which was \nprojected to be up by 150-to-200 points suddenly go down 150 points. \nThere was a 300-point swing. In other words, we will continue our \nsloganeering and our stalling no matter what that might do to people's \nsavings for retirement, or their pension, or to their kids in college \nor to the small businesses that are trying to make money so they can \nstay in business. We don't care what happens to them because we have to \nbe on the evening news and talk about how we are standing up for \nAmerica.\n  No, they are not standing up for America.\n  In fact, the Treasury Department reported last week that a failure to \nraise the debt limit could cause credit markets to freeze, the dollar \nto plummet, and interest rates to rise precipitously. The report goes \non to say a government default on its debts might prove so catastrophic \nthat it could potentially result ``in a financial crisis and recession \nthat could echo the events of 2008 or worse.'' They don't seem to care \nso long as they get on television.\n  We have all heard a lot of talk and seen a lot of crocodile tears \nabout getting our fiscal House in order. Oh, what a great campaign \nslogan. But too many who got elected with such bumper sticker \nsloganeering are not following through on their constitutional \nresponsibility to the government.\n  Look at their list of ransom demands for reopening the government: \nThe first one blows a $100 billion hole in the national debt by \nrepealing the Affordable Care Act. The second one adds $30 billion more \nto the debt without offering any suggestion for making up the revenue. \nThe third still keeps important government functions closed, such as \nproviding food assistance to young children, expectant mothers, \nseniors, continuing health trials that could cure cancer or childhood \ndiseases; and the list goes on and on.\n  It is truly unfortunate that a relative few Republicans in Congress, \nwho are obviously enjoying the limelight, are willing to play politics \nand brinkmanship at a time when the public demands statesmanship. Their \nreckless actions are hurting families all across America. I would \nremind them they are hurting Democratic families, Republican families, \nIndependent families; they are hurting Americans. For this small, \nextreme faction, it seems ``compromise'' is a dirty word and \n``distrust'' is a political tactic. That may explain why we have heard \nexcuse after excuse for blocking the budget discipline they so \ndesperately pled for just a short time ago. They said: Why don't we \npass a budget? Why didn't the Senate pass a budget? I was in the chair \nat 5 o'clock in the morning on a Saturday morning when we were voting \non that budget. We voted all day and all night and we finished it. That \nwas back in March.\n\n  So what happens when we want to go to a conference on the budget and \nwork out the differences with the House? In a conference, if we counted \nthe number of people, there would be more Republicans than Democrats. \nIt was a Republican Senator who stood on the floor and said: I object \nto going to conference--the same one who was giving speeches asking why \nwe don't have a budget.\n  Then, when we pass a budget, we have to go to the next step to work \nit out with the House: Oh, no, I object to that. Probably because he \nwas surprised we had actually done our work. The chairwoman of the \ncommittee, the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, who did such a \nbrilliant job of getting together a budget that saves the taxpayers \nmoney--they then act terrified that it might actually pass.\n  They have objected 19 times to go to that budget conference. They \nhave shut down the government. They are preparing to cause the \ngovernment's first ever debt default in our Nation's history. That is \nright. The Speaker of the House is now holding the government's credit \nhostage, threatening this weekend to let the Nation default come \nOctober 17 when the debt limit is reached unless even more draconian \nspending cuts are made. Is there any reason markets all over the world \nare dropping? Is there any reason the rest of the world looks at \nAmerica and says: What are you doing? Why are you letting the children \nin the sandbox take over?\n  We have caught just a preview of the chaos such a move could create. \nStock futures, as I mentioned, dropped sharply and European stocks \ndropped dramatically in the wake of House Republicans' newest \nultimatum. This is no way to govern.\n  It is also not an example to set for the rest of the world when we \nhave to go to the rest of the world and say: Help us, work with us, to \nstop the terrorists who threaten the United States. Help us, work with \nus, so we can export our goods to your country. Help us, work with us \nto bring about stability around the world. They say: You will not do a \nthing to even help yourself. Why should we help you?\n  I talked to some of these countries. I talked to the people in those \ncountries. They are shaking their heads and saying: What has happened \nto America?\n  So it is far past time for reason and sanity to return to Congress, \non this\n\n[[Page S7267]]\n\ngovernment shutdown, on setting our budget priorities, and a whole host \nof other issues. Let's let the grownups come back and start running \nthings around here.\n  I remain ready to work with people on both sides of the aisle. I am \nproud of my record, as the senior-most Member of this body, that year \nafter year after year legislation I have written with both Republicans \nand Democrats as cosponsors has passed. The distinguished Presiding \nOfficer was Governor of one of the great Commonwealths of this country, \nthe Commonwealth of Virginia. He brought Republicans and Democrats \ntogether. It was a model for the rest of the country. It can be done, \nbut it takes grownups to do it. We are always going to have a few loud \nvoices saying: Oh, we can't possibly do this.\n  The American public expects the people who truly lead to be leaders. \nSo let's work with people on both sides of the aisle. Let's find a \nsolution that ends this needless shutdown and gets us and hundreds of \nthousands of Federal employees back to doing our work on behalf of the \nAmerican people. That starts with the House voting on the Senate bill \nto reopen the American people's government.\n  That bill is sitting over there right now. Bring it to a vote. Vote \nto put Americans back to work and to reopen those trials to find cures \nfor childhood diseases, or vote no if some wish to continue to be \nchildren in the sandbox.\n  I am blessed with grandchildren. I like to think none of my \ngrandchildren would act as childish as a small group of ultra-rightwing \nRepublicans have in the House. They don't reflect the great tradition \nof the Republican Party in my State or in this country. They reflect an \natmosphere of people who care only for themselves. No matter what they \nsay, they care only for their own egos and their own political future. \nIt is time they started caring for the United States of America.\n  I see nobody else seeking recognition. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum, and if time is being charged, I ask unanimous consent that it \nbe charged on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I think we are all in a state of shock \nthat we are entering the fourth day of a government shutdown with no \nmovement in sight.\n  I wanted to go home to California to see how the Affordable Care Act \nis going in California since that is the reason the Republicans have \nshut down the government. I want to report that people there cannot \nunderstand why on Earth the Republicans want to stop the Affordable \nCare Act. They can't believe that just as Californians are on the brink \nof getting millions of our citizens insured and small businesses are \ngetting affordable health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, \nRepublicans not only have shut down the government, but they are \nthreatening default. And they understand that default would lead to \neconomic chaos. It has never happened before in American history. I \ntried to explain to my constituents exactly what has been going on \nhere, and I did it in the best way I could, and I think I was fair.\n  The first thing: In order to keep the government open for 6 weeks, \nthey wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They tried 43 times. \nThat never worked, so then they said they would defund it, which \neverybody understands that if you don't fund it, it is the same thing. \nBut we told them they couldn't defund most of it because most of it is \nnot appropriated funds. They didn't care. They put that forward. That \nwent nowhere.\n  Then they said: We won't repeal it or defund it. We will delay the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  We all said: If you think we are going to delay further the chance \nfor millions of Americans to get affordable insurance, we are not going \nto do it. This bill passed 3\\1/2\\ years ago and was upheld by the \nSupreme Court. It is not going to happen.\n  Then they said: We will just take part of it and stop part of it. We \nwon't allow women to get preventive services.\n  That went over like a lead balloon, their war on women again. They \nwere saying women won't be able to get tested for cervical cancer, for \nSTDs, for pregnancy-related diabetes. They were just going to shut that \npart of the Affordable Care Act down. Women here in\n\n[[Page S7268]]\n\nthe Senate held a press conference, and they dropped that.\n  Then they said: OK, we are going to repeal one of the revenue streams \nthat is going to cost $30 billion, but we have no way to replace it.\n  So then they actually sent us a provision that would have added $30 \nbillion to the deficit--from the Republican Party. They say they are so \nfiscally conservative, and they actually sent us a provision that would \ncost $30 billion with no way to pay for it. So that didn't go down to \nwell.\n  This one is really beautiful. They say our staff and the staff of \nanyone working in the White House--all these people who believe so much \nin giving back to their great country will no longer get the employer \ncontribution that all Americans get who work for large employers. That \nis their great ``thank you'' to their staff. That is their great show \nof appreciation--besides shutting down the government where their staff \nis working without pay.\n  So I explained this to my constituents who are trying to sign up for \nhealth care.\n  I went to a really good community health care center where people are \nlining up and getting information and they will be signing up for \nhealth care.\n  They said: Well, why would they do this?\n  I said: Well, there is more bad news. We thought they would extend \nthe debt ceiling, which is the way you pay for the debts you have \nalready incurred. It is already on the credit card. We need to pay for \nthat, and now they are threatening not to pay the bills of the United \nStates of America. They are threatening to take this country into \ndefault.\n  Now they are saying: Well, maybe we won't do it if we can cut \nMedicare and Medicaid.\n  So now they have put the Affordable Care Act on the line, they have \nput Medicare on the line, Medicaid on the line, Social Security is out \nthere, and they may cause a default if we don't deal with these \nprograms that are so critical to our people.\n  I have been around here a long time, and I know we have differences. \nBut the President is right when he says we the Congress have two things \nwe have to do. One of them is that we have to keep the doors open \nbecause we have passed laws and they need to be carried out. Keep the \ngovernment open. And the second thing we have to do is pay our bills \nthat we incurred. Raise the debt ceiling. So far, the Republicans \nrefuse.\n  We sent a clean continuing resolution over there without all this \ncutting health care, Medicare, and Social Security that they are \ninterested in. We said: Let's just keep the government open and going \nfor 6 weeks, raise the debt ceiling, and then of course we will talk \nabout all of this. That is what we do. We negotiate. We talk. And the \nPresident is more than willing. He offered the Republicans a $4 \ntrillion deficit-reduction deal. They walked away. He is willing to \ntalk about everything and anything. But you have to keep the government \ngoing and you have to pay your bills. That is the fundamental work we \nhave to do. The irony, of course, is we get our checks. But our staff, \nthey do not get their checks. The workers who come back because they \nare deemed essential, they are working without getting their pay.\n\n  This is an outrage. Speaker Boehner, all you have to do is put the \ncontinuing resolution on the floor for an up-or-down vote. Every \nDemocrat will vote for it and, at last count, the newspapers say at \nleast 21 Republicans. Open up the government. We are knocking on the \ndoor. Open it up. Guess what you will find behind the door? People who \nwant to work, people who need a paycheck.\n  I have to tell you, they passed a bill that says they are going to \npay Federal workers after the shutdown, and that is good. They should \nhave done that. But right now we hear Republicans over here who say \nthey don't really think that is a great idea. I have a better idea than \neven that: Open up the government and pay people for doing the jobs \nthey were hired to do.\n  I have a ranking member who has asked for a big hearing on climate \nchange, and he wants all the administration officials to show up. We \nwere planning on that. But most of them have absolutely no staff, and \nthey are responding to emergencies. If there is a chemical explosion, \nthe chemical safety board has to respond. If there is a horrible coal \nash spill, the EPA will have to respond. If there is a disastrous \ncancer hot spot, the EPA will have to respond. Open up the government. \nDon't just say to people you will get paid so you don't have to bother \ncoming to work. Open up the government. Let people work for the pay \nthey are supposed to get. This is an outrage.\n  I have to say when they passed over there ``pay the workers,'' we \nknow why they did it. It was political. Because the heat in Virginia is \nso hot in this gubernatorial race, even the far right Republicans over \nthere said to open up the government and fight about health care later.\n  I have to say when I went home and I saw people waiting to sign up \nfor coveredCA.com, I learned that on the first day coveredCA.com had 5 \nmillion hits and 500,000 distinct users. Some 17,000 people called \nCovered California service centers and over 6,000 Californians began to \nsign up on the first day. On the second day they had 200,000 distinct \nusers.\n  They are training thousands of enrollment counselors there. Many of \nthem are already insurance agents. Many of them are going to work for \nbig providers like Kaiser Permanente. Many of them are going to be in \nthe community health care centers. Why do the Republicans want to shut \ndown the government and threaten the default of this Nation when we are \non the brink of getting millions of people the health insurance they \nneed and deserve? The small business community is going to have an \nopportunity to get better rates and better tax breaks.\n  I want to talk a little bit about this threat of default because the \nthreat of default is real. Let's start off and go through a couple of \ncharts. First of all, we have a new thing going on. The junior Senator \nfrom Oklahoma today said: Oh, you don't default if you don't pay people \nwhat they are owed, only if you default on interest payments.\n  All of a sudden there is a new definition. But if you don't pay \nSocial Security, he doesn't consider it a default. If you don't pay for \nMedicare, he doesn't consider it a default. If you don't pay \ncontractors, he doesn't consider it a default.\n  Why don't we go to Black's Law Dictionary:\n\n       Default: The failure to make a payment when due.\n\n  Let's be clear, there is not one bill that is coming due that \nCongress did not pass. Let's be clear. Congress makes the decisions on \nspending. We default when we fail to make a payment when due. They are \nplaying, as Jack Lew, the Treasury Secretary, said, with fire--playing \nwith fire.\n  Let's see what has been said about default. Default means you fail to \nraise the debt ceiling in order to accommodate the bills you have \nalready incurred. Ronald Reagan, the hero of the Republican Party:\n\n       The full consequences of a default--or even the serious \n     prospect of a default--by the United States are impossible to \n     predict and awesome to contemplate. Denigration of the full \n     faith and credit of the United States would have substantial \n     effects on the domestic financial markets and the value of \n     the dollar.\n\n  Ronald Reagan said that in 1983. Why don't the Republicans listen to \ntheir hero? He said even the thought of a default was dangerous for \nthis Nation. The last time they played these games it cost billions of \ndollars because we were downgraded. Let's look at Douglas Holtz-Eakin, \nCBO Director under George W. Bush, talking about default:\n\n       It's a bad idea, little defaults, big defaults; defaults, a \n     bad idea, period, and there should be no one who believes \n     otherwise.\n\n  If they don't listen to Ronald Reagan, why don't they listen to the \nCBO Director under George W. Bush? I tell you, these guys are in the \nfringes. They are in the fringe lane. They are in the far right, and \nthey are going to go off the road, and if it were just them, it would \nbe one thing, but they are taking America with them. We have to stand \nup and be counted around here and not let this go without comment.\n  Mark Zandi, he was John McCain's economic adviser. Here is what said:\n\n       The dark scenario is so dark I can't imagine it.\n\n  He is talking about a default. Speaker Boehner is standing there \nsaying: Well, despite the fact that you read that I didn't want a \ndefault, I can't\n\n[[Page S7269]]\n\ncontemplate approving this without figuring out how to cut entitlement \nprograms like Medicare and Social Security.\n  I have to tell you, they are playing with fire. I think they have lit \nthe match. Anyone who knows anything about economics--I happened to \nhave majored in it in college, and I was a stockbroker for a period of \ntime and know that uncertainty is the worst thing. The last time the \nRepublicans tried this--and eventually they decided to back up and back \noff--it cost us, as I was saying, almost $19 billion over 10 years in \ntaxpayer costs. America's credit rating was downgraded. Standard & Poor \ndowngraded the U.S. credit rating for the first time in American \nhistory and the stock market sank. It dropped 2,000 points in July and \nAugust of 2011.\n  That is a wonderful policy, Republicans. Just keep it up. Who do you \nthink you are helping? People who have 401(k)s? Everyone in America who \nis counting on the certainty of a government opening up every day in \nthe greatest nation of the world? What are they accomplishing? The \nPresident had to cancel a trip to Asia that was so anticipated, giving \nChina the upper hand there. You have to be kidding. Who are you \nhelping?\n  Here is the deal. We have a health care program now called the \nAffordable Care Act. I will tell you the story of Leslie Foster, a 28-\nyear-old freelance filmmaker in Hollywood. He told the Wall Street \nJournal--Leslie Foster--that he found a plan on Covered California that \nwill cost him only $62 a month. Because Leslie earns $20,000 a year, \nfederal assistance will pick up nearly three-quarters of the cost of \nhis premium. Leslie says he hasn't had comprehensive health insurance \nsince 2006.\n  I went home to be with the real people, to see the good that we can \ndo. Is the Affordable Care Act perfect? No. Can we fix it? Yes. Let's \ntalk about it. But don't try to scuttle a law that is so important for \nthe people of my State and for this country--48 million people who are \nuninsured in America today. They have a shot at getting insurance for \nthe first time. Don't take it away. Don't threaten default, and don't \nshut down this government--which you already did. Open it up.\n  The more I think about it, they pass a law to pay Federal employees \nwho are sitting home. Tell me how that makes sense. They want to come \nto work and do their jobs. They are not happy sitting at home, whether \nthey get a check or they don't. Open up the government. If you don't \nlike certain functions, fight it out during the regular order. Patty \nMurray, the chair of our Budget Committee, she has asked--I think it is \nnow 18 times, I could be wrong and I'll correct the record if I am \nwrong--she has asked them to go to conference and strike a deal. Let's \nsit down and talk.\n  Senator Cruz objected every time, and when he was not here Senator \nLee objected. The far right wing does not want to solve this problem \nbecause they like the chaos. I don't know why. They ought to say it to \nAndrew Stryker. He is 34 years old. He lives in Los Angeles. He does \nfreelance work. He pays a monthly premium of around $600 to stay on the \nplan from the job he left 4 years ago. He has high blood pressure and \nsays he has been denied coverage in the past due to a preexisting \ncondition. Last Tuesday Andrew told the Washington Post he picked out a \nsilver plan on the Covered California exchange. It took him a while to \nsign up for coverage due to traffic and high demand on day 1. He said, \n`` . . . it will save me over $6,000. For that I would have waited all \nday.''\n  I think the Republicans should call up Mr. Stryker and say: Too bad. \nToo bad. You don't mind if we delay this another few years, do you?\n  And he would say: I sure would. I have a chance.\n  Last week San Franciscan Paul Cello told KQED that he selected a plan \non the California exchange that will save him more than $300 a month \ncompared to what he pays now in the high risk pool. ``It's like a whole \n'nother world,'' he said. ``The coverage is better, no preexisting \ncondition exclusions, I will get mental health coverage, so there's way \nmore coverage than I had and I am going to be saving.''\n  Why doesn't John Boehner, who is known to shed tears, call up Paul \nCello and say: Gee, Mr. Cello, we are really sorry. We want to delay \nyour insurance for a year or 2 or forever. Where is the emotion Speaker \nBoehner has shown in many other cases. Where is the emotion for workers \nhere who cannot get a paycheck, who are just praying to God the \nRepublicans will vote on that clean CR and open up this government?\n  We know we have disagreements. That is fine. We are proud of the \nvalues that we bring. But it is not right to shut down the government \nand cause so much pain. It is not right to threaten default and havoc \nin the markets, and havoc all across the nation. It is not right. They \nare trying to shut down the government, and they might default because \nthey don't like Medicare, ObamaCare, Social Security, and Medicaid, and \nthey are stamping their feet and they are throwing a tantrum. Why are \nthey inflicting so much suffering on our workers and on our families, \nbut none on themselves?\n  Note to the Republicans: You are protecting your pay. Give it up \nduring the shutdown.\n  Here in the Capitol last week we had a very frightening incident. It \nhappened right outside my office. We are so thankful to the Capitol \nPolice for rushing to save the day. A vehicle was being used as a \nweapon. They ran right to the trouble. A couple of them wound up in the \nhospital. They are not getting paid. What do you think that does to the \nego of people, to their feeling of self-worth? And these Republicans \ncan get all the protection they want, and so do we. This is the way we \nvalue people: Shut down the government and don't give them their pay? \nAnd by the way, they tried to take away their employer contribution to \ntheir health care which is equivalent to a huge pay cut. Talk about \nvalues, Speaker Boehner, why don't you get a little bit of a dose of \nTip O'Neill? Tip O'Neill knew the magic of 218. He didn't care whether \nit was Republicans or Democrats who voted. He got things done. They \nhave done nothing. Just because they control one-half of one-third of \nthe government doesn't mean they get to decide everything. It doesn't \nwork that way. We have to work together.\n\n  They don't get to pick and choose what laws to enforce. If they don't \nlike them, then repeal them. Try to repeal the Clean Air Act. Bring it \non. Try to repeal the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Super Fund Act, the \nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform law, and the Consumer Protection Agency. \nBe honest. They don't even like Social Security, they don't like \nMedicare, and they don't like Medicaid. If they want to battle that \nout, bring it on. We will battle it out. But don't hold this whole \ncountry hostage and don't hurt millions of workers.\n  They did pass these little mini bills. We stand on the floor and talk \nabout the horror stories. Oh, they passed a mini bill. I guess \neventually they will send enough bills over here to open the whole \ngovernment. Why don't they just open the government?\n  We cry for those people who can't get into NIH trials. They have a \nmini bill, but they didn't open the CDC and people are not working to \ncatch the next epidemic. They didn't do anything to restart food \ninspections, and Lord knows we lose thousands of people a year from \neating poisoned food. They will not open the EPA, and we have kids in \nLos Angeles, as we speak, who are very sick and ill with bloody noses.\n  There is a picture in the paper I can show everyone. The red over \nhere is the result of bloody noses from little children who are living \nnear an oil and gas operation. The day I read about it, I called up the \nEPA. They said they would be on it in 5 minutes, and then the \ngovernment shut down. They don't care over there. Even though 75 \npercent of the people strongly support the EPA, they want to get rid of \nit. Bring it on but don't hold this country hostage.\n  There are 110 FAA safety inspectors in southern California who were \nfurloughed, 830 Bureau of Land Management employees were sent home, and \nsmall businesses are not getting paid. We don't even know what our \nunemployment rate is in the greatest country in the world because the \nLabor Department had to send home the people who calculate that number.\n  In Santa Monica a plane crashed on Sunday evening and four people \nwere killed. The NTSB cannot investigate--that is the National \nTransportation Safety Board--because the investigators are off the job. \nThey took what\n\n[[Page S7270]]\n\nthey learned, put it in a vault, and when the government reopens, they \nwill take it out. In the meantime, who knows why it happened. Maybe it \nis a defect in the plane that we could fix for all planes. Maybe it is \nsomething on the runway. We don't know. Maybe it was pilot error. All \nof this needs to be discussed and looked at.\n  What they are doing is disgraceful, and it is unprecedented. I have \nlooked back, and there have been shutdowns, but most lasted 1 or 2 or 3 \ndays, but none of them were about repealing a law, let alone a \nsignature law of a President--Democratic or Republican.\n  The Republicans have to wake up and smell reality. They had an \nelection and a lot of it was about the Affordable Care Act. They lost. \nAmazingly, the Affordable Care Act--they dubbed it ObamaCare--is based \non a Republican idea of individual responsibility. We actually got the \nidea from Republicans and from a Republican Governor named Mitt Romney. \nThey ran away from it because they don't care for this President. Get \nover it. You lost. There are people in this Senate who ran on saying \nthey would make the Affordable Care Act better, but they weren't going \nto repeal it.\n  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission furloughed 600 employees. \nThe government can't regulate the markets for contracts in oil, corn, \nand metals. Commissioner Bart Chilton said:\n\n       Taking our cops off the beat for even a few days could have \n     disastrous impacts on these markets that consumers depend \n     upon.\n\n  We talked about the CDC. They furloughed 9,000 workers who respond to \noutbreaks such as salmonella. This is happening at a time when an \noutbreak of hepatitis A has affected 79 people in California.\n  We are dealing with a self-inflicted wound upon this Nation, a \ngovernment shutdown that is unnecessary. We cannot allow this to \ncontinue. So I say to Speaker Boehner, who is the architect of this \nshutdown, stop playing games with the lives of Americans--our workers, \nour families, and our children. Do your job. Open the government. Let \nthe House vote. It is pretty simple.\n  We have sent a bill over there which funds the government. We have \nmade a commitment to them that after they pass that and the debt \nceiling, every single thing is on the table.\n  I was thinking the other day that if you are a teacher and you get \nhired in a school and the school opens for work at 9 a.m. every \nmorning, you have to be in the classroom at 9 a.m. in the morning in \norder to keep your job. If you weren't in your classroom at 9 a.m. in \nthe morning and decided that you wanted to do something different such \nas come in at 11 a.m., you would be fired.\n  Our job is to keep the government running and pay the bills we have \nincurred. We don't get to pick and choose or decide that all of a \nsudden in the middle of everything we are going to cancel out a law \nthat passed 3\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  This is so bad that the Republican candidate for Governor in Virginia \nhas said: Stop it. Open the government and then debate health care.\n  The good news is Speaker Boehner could change his mind, bring up our \nbill in a few minutes' time. I know how it works. I spent 10 years in \nthe House. It is real easy. They take the bill, go to the rules \ncommittee, talk about how they are going to allow one or two amendments \nor none, and they could then actually take it up, pass it, and send it \nto the President. What would that do? It would reopen the government \ntomorrow. It would keep the government open for 6 weeks while we debate \nthe bigger issues, and then we should raise the debt ceiling so we can \npay the bills we have already incurred.\n  It is so good to go home to your State and talk to people who are \nlooking at us and thinking: Why would anyone want to close down this \ncountry because they don't like the fact that our families can get \nhealth insurance? They don't understand it. They are pondering it, and \nthey are coming up with a tilt.\n  So, Speaker Boehner, you are a man; obviously, you have deep \nemotions. Your policies and that of your party are hurting people, \nhurting children, hurting families, hurting the economy, hurting the \ncountry, and all you have to do is bring up a clean continuing \nresolution that we passed over here, thanks to Republicans who allowed \nus to bring it up and pass it, and pass it over there. Let's get \nthrough this. Let's restore some faith that this country can function \nonce again.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/07/senate-section/article/S7270-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF DR.

Mr. President, we had a discussion at the Prayer \nBreakfast 2 weeks ago about skin cancer, and we have shared a common \nexperience in that we have confronted a melanoma at one time in our \nlives.\n  On this Friday night Dr. Clem Doxey of Marietta, GA, is retiring \nafter 43 years as a leading dermatologist in the Southeast, chief of \nstaff at Kennestone Hospital, and also a leading dermatologist around \nthe United States of America. He is a real inspiration to me, a man who \nled me to help pass the TAN Act, along with Senator Reid, John McCain, \nand others, who came together to bring about awareness for skin cancer, \nawareness for melanoma, and awareness for early detection; a citizen \nwho contributed to us an idea that is now the law of the land in the \nUnited States of America and one I am sure will help save lives.\n  Clem is retiring after many years in Marietta, GA, and 43 years of \npractice. He has been a leader in Rotary, a leader in organizations in \nour community, a leader in our hospital, a friend to me, and my \ndermatologist.\n  He graduated from the Pensacola School of Medicine and went straight, \nas a flight surgeon, to Vietnam in the U.S. Marine Corps. He returned \nto be a physician and get his residency training at Tulane University \nMedical Center in New Orleans, LA, and then came to Marietta, GA, and \nfounded Marietta Dermatology, now the leading dermatology practice in \nthe State of Georgia. He will retire this Friday night.\n  I walk around on these two feet in part because Clem taught me early \nawareness, early identification, and the right practices to deal with \nskin cancer. I thank him for what he did for me and what he has done \nfor countless patients over countless years in the great city of \nMarietta in the great county of Cobb.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/07/senate-section/article/S7270-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7270-S7271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNIVERSITY OF MAINE AT FARMINGTON\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on October 9, 1863, the Maine legislature \nsigned a charter establishing the State's first public institution of \nhigher education. I rise today to celebrate 150 years of remarkable \naccomplishments by the University of Maine at Farmington.\n  Also, 2013 marks another significant anniversary: this is the 16th \nconsecutive year that the University of Maine at Farmington has been \nnamed to the U.S. News and World Report ``Best College'' list. That \nsame publication has named UMF, as it is known throughout Maine, a \n``Best Value'' school for its quality programs and affordable cost. In \naddition, the Institute of International Education and the U.S. State \nDepartment have recognized UMF as a ``Top Producer'' of Fulbright \nScholars, with 11 faculty members having received that prestigious \naward.\n  Such recognition is but one measure of UMF's success. Another is the \ndeep affection alumni and people throughout Maine have for this \nremarkable institution. In 2005, I had the privilege to serve as \nhonorary chairman of UMF's campaign for a new Education Center to \nintegrate technology with teaching and learning. The support from \ncountless individuals, businesses, and organizations was overwhelming \nand enabled a small school of just 2,000 students to keep pace with the \ntop colleges and universities in the country.\n  Responding to the needs of an ever-changing society is one of the \nrichest traditions a college can have. The UMF tradition of service \nbegan in 1857, 6 years before the charter was granted, when a \nconvention of teachers from Franklin County, in the mountains of \nwestern Maine, urged the establishment of an institution dedicated to \neducating educators for the benefit of their region and of the entire \nState. When the first class of 31 students matriculated at the new \nFarmington Normal School the summer after the charter, they did so in a \nsetting that was described by a UMF historian as ``rough, crude, and \nplenty humble.''\n\n[[Page S7271]]\n\nOver the years, UMF has become known for its outstanding liberal arts \nprograms, which attract students not only from Maine but also from all \nover the nation.\n  Through the years, UMF has established another noble tradition--that \nof contributing to the entire region by adding to its cultural life, \nteaching in local classrooms, coaching youth athletics, and helping \nyoungsters learn everything from swimming to foreign languages. From \nthe Health and Fitness Center to the Mantor Library, the doors of UMF \nare open to the community.\n  The combination of quality and value results in graduation and \nfreshman retention rates that are significantly higher than the \nnational averages for both public universities and private colleges. \nUMF's dedication to educating educators continues today, with graduates \nreceiving the Maine Teacher of the Year Award in four of the last 6 \nyears.\n  On that ``rough, crude, and plenty humble'' foundation laid 150 years \nago, something magnificent has been built--an ongoing commitment to \nexcellence and a spirit of service. On behalf of the people of Maine, I \ncongratulate the University of Maine at Farmington for 150 years of \noutstanding contributions to our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/07/senate-section/article/S7271-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ELIJAH EVANS\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor an exemplary \nyoung man who has persevered through life's challenges and devoted \nhimself to bettering the lives of children in foster care. As a young \nboy, Elijah Evans was abused by his family, forcing him to be removed \nfrom their care and placed into a foster care program. Quickly winning \nthe love of the nurse assigned to attend to his wounds, Elijah was \nadopted by Lynore Harding when he was 4 years old. But after being \nadopted, Elijah did not forget what it was like to live in foster care, \nor about the more than 400,000 children who are in foster care today.\n  In 2011, when Elijah was 13 years old, he began raising money to give \nChristmas gifts to foster children, knowing that the Christmas season \noften leaves these children with the longing feeling of not being a \npart of a family. In that year, he was able to raise $5,000 and give \nChristmas gifts to 72 children. Since then, Elijah has established his \nown organization, No Use for Abuse, and has continued Christmas of \nHope, which is going into its third year. He hopes that he will be able \nto expand his organization in the future to offer college scholarships \nto foster children after they graduate from high school.\n  As a father, I know that every life is incredibly precious. There is \nalways more we can do to increase adoptions, but I'm deeply grateful \nfor everything the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute and \nthe Angels in Adoption do for children. Thankfully, with their help \nover 50,000 foster children were adopted into loving families last year \nand given a chance to make a positive difference like Elijah has. \nElijah's actions are an extraordinary example of what can be achieved \nthrough love and respect for all mankind and a passionate desire to \nserve others.\n  Elijah's noble and thoughtful efforts have not gone unnoticed. Aside \nfrom positively affecting the lives of so many foster children, Elijah \nwill be recognized for his service by the Congressional Coalition on \nAdoption Institute at its annual Angels in Adoption awards gala on \nOctober 9, 2013. This award honors groups and individuals who have made \nextraordinary contributions on behalf of children still in need of \nfamilies, and honorees include such individuals as First Lady Laura \nBush, Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy, and Muhammad Ali.\n  Lastly, I would like to express my appreciation to Lynore Harding for \nwelcoming Elijah to be a part of her loving family and to offer my \nsincere congratulations and appreciation to Elijah for remembering the \nexperience of being a foster child and for being a positive role model \nfor the children who have not yet been as fortunate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/07/senate-section/article/S7271-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/07/senate-section/article/S7271-3", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/07/senate-section/article/S7271-4", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  The President pro tempore (Mr. LEAHY) announced that on today, \nOctober 7, 2013, he had signed the following enrolled bill, previously \nsigned by the Speaker of the House:\n\n       H.R. 3095.
