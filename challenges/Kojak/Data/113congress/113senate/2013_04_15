Mr. President, the debate over the best way to prevent gun \nviolence in America raises strong emotions. Second amendment \nadvocates--me among them--want to preserve and protect the right of \nevery law-abiding citizen to bear arms. Victims of gun violence and \nfamily members of those killed by guns--me among them--want to ensure \nthat guns are kept from the hands of criminals and those with mental \nillnesses severe in nature. These are both worthy goals, and they \nshould not be mutually exclusive goals.\n  It is possible to uphold the second amendment while protecting \ninnocent Americans from gun violence. Of course it is. The compromise \nbackground check proposal before the Senate--a measure crafted by \nSenators Toomey, Manchin, Kirk, and Schumer--achieves both goals. This \nbipartisan measure would keep guns out of the hands of dangerous \ncriminals by requiring background checks for private gun sales at gun \nshows and over the Internet.\n  It strengthens the existing instant check system by encouraging \nStates to put all their criminal and mental health records into the \nNational Instant Criminal Background Check System, a step supported by \ngun rights groups. And it would establish a National Commission on Mass \nViolence to study all causes of mass violence in our country. School \nsafety, mental health, video games--whatever is appropriate should be \nlooked into.\n  This legislation has the backing of the Citizens Committee for the \nRight to Keep and Bear Arms. It has 650,000 members. It is the second \nlargest gun rights group in the Nation.\n  On this proposal--background checks--the National Rifle Association \nis not being very talkative. Why? Because they have supported this \nmeasure in the past. And while they are not publicly supporting it now, \nthey have done it in the past.\n  This measure has the support of antigun violence advocates such as \nMayors Against Illegal Guns, consisting of hundreds of mayors around \nthe country. It has the support of law enforcement groups, such as the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police.\n  Although this compromise does not go as far to expand background \nchecks as some had hoped, the nature of compromise is what it is. That \nis what legislation is all about. It is not perfect, but it certainly \nis a long, big, heavy step forward.\n  Expanding background checks to cover gun shows and Internet sales is \ncommon sense. It will help protect the innocent from gun violence. And \nit will also protect firearms sellers. No responsible firearms dealer \nwants to unwittingly put a gun in the hands of a murderer.\n  One need only ask a man by the name of Bruce Daly. Mr. Daly sold the \nshotgun that was used in a shooting rampage at the Lloyd D. George \nFederal Courthouse in Las Vegas a few years ago.\n  Seventy-two-year-old security guard and retired police officer \nStanley Cooper was murdered by a felon who bought a gun at a gun show \nin Kingman, AZ--90 miles from Las Vegas. I repeat, the shooter was a \nconvicted felon, who had no right to own a gun and could never have \npassed a background check. But because Mr. Daly sold the shotgun at a \ngun show in Arizona, he never had to perform a background check.\n  After the shooting at the Las Vegas courthouse, Mr. Daly was found to \nhave an expired Federal permit for selling weapons, and because of that \nhe\n\n[[Page S2630]]\n\nwas convicted. But Mr. Daly, admirably, has stepped forward. He admits \nto having sold dozens of guns that were linked to violent crimes. I \nrepeat, today Mr. Daly, admirably, wishes he had done more to keep the \nguns he sold out of the hands of criminals, and he has stated many \ntimes that expanded background checks are the best way to do that.\n  Most gun owners--and most gun dealers--are responsible, law-abiding \npeople. They love and respect firearms. They are sportsmen who hunt. \nThey may take their weapons when they go fishing. These are people who \nenjoy target shooting, who no longer hunt, but they like to go out and \nplunk or they like to go to a range and shoot. They are citizens who \nsimply want to protect themselves, their homes, and their families.\n  A better background check law will not infringe on second amendment \nrights in any way. But it will prevent the small minority of people who \nwant to obtain guns for the wrong reasons from buying these weapons. \nAnd it will stop troubled people who, because of an illness beyond \ntheir control, would be a danger to themselves or to others if they \npossessed a firearm.\n  This compromise legislation should not be controversial. Nine out of \n10 Americans--including a majority, a vast majority, of gun owners and \n75 percent of NRA members--support stronger background check laws. This \nis not the background check law that was reported out of the committee \nthat is in the underlying bill. But Manchin, Toomey, Kirk, and Schumer \nthink they can improve that, and that is what this amendment is all \nabout.\n  A number of my colleagues oppose this measure. I am sure that is the \ncase. It is their right to vote against it. We continue to work--I \ncontinue to work--toward an agreement to vote on this compromise and to \nconsider other amendments. We need to do that. Democrats are not going \nto offer all the amendments. Republicans want to offer amendments. They \nfeel the law in the country today is too weak. In their minds, they \nwant to make it weaker but they think that is a strength. Most people, \na majority of us, would disagree, but they have a right to do that.\n  I hope there are not going to be a few unreasonable extremists who \nare going to try to prevent an up-or-down vote on legislation in this \nbill. We should not have a filibuster on this legislation. I, of \ncourse, can always file cloture. I hope we do not have to do that. That \nwould be a shameful tribute to the memory of 27 people who died in \nNewtown: little boys and girls--in the minds of many, babies--and \nschool teachers, administrators who were killed; 27 of them.\n  Newtown deserves a vote, and so do the mothers and fathers, loved \nones and friends, of the 3,300 victims of gun violence in America since \nthat terrible day at Sandy Hook. Mr. President, 3,300 people have died \nbecause of gunshots since Sandy Hook.\n  Don't we have an obligation to the American people to do some \ncorrecting of what is not right in this country? I believe so.\n  Mr. President, I know the chairman of the committee, who has worked \nhard to get this matter before us, is here. He also has an amendment. I \nhope we can get to his amendment, which I wish to do next; and that is \nan amendment that I am told is even supported by the National Rifle \nAssociation to improve what is in this bill that was reported out of \nthe committee dealing with Federal trafficking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/15/senate-section/article/S2630-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2630-S2631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GUN TRAFFICKING\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I tell the Senator from Nevada, we have \nbeen working very hard on that. It has bipartisan support. It had a \nbipartisan vote out of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  We had been working on it with the National Rifle Association and a \nlot of others because this trafficking allows somebody who can \nlegitimately buy weapons to go in and buy them and then sell them to \npeople who are from a drug cartel in this country or others or to a \ngang member--people who could not have bought them legitimately. It is \na huge loophole.\n  We saw the same loophole in the murder of the head of the Colorado \nprison system. The man who we understand shot him would have been \nprohibited from buying a weapon, but somebody who could buy one bought \nit and passed it on to him.\n  I want to thank Senators Manchin and Toomey for coming forward with \ntheir bipartisan amendment to close the gun show loophole and prevent \ncriminals from obtaining firearms, while at the same time respecting \nand protecting the second amendment rights of responsible gun owners. \nThese Senators have worked long and hard. They have studied the issue. \nThey have compromised, and they have reached an agreement that I intend \nto support and I hope the Senate will adopt.\n  The Senator from Nevada certainly hopes Senators will vote and not \nfilibuster. The American people I think would consider it a disgrace if \nSenators were unwilling to stand and vote either yes or no. A \nfilibuster means you vote maybe. I would hope, with only 100 of us to \nrepresent 314 million Americans, we would at least have the courage to \nvote yes or vote no. It may not be a popular vote either way you vote, \nbut voting maybe--which is what a filibuster is--shows no respect for \nthe Senate and shows no courage.\n  We have had background checks for decades. They are an accepted part \nof the process of buying a gun. I am among millions of responsible gun \nowners who have undergone a background check as part of this process. \nAnd as I tell our gun dealers in Vermont when I buy a gun there, I am \nlike millions of responsible gun owners. I understand this check is \nnecessary and I have no problem going through it. But I expect \neverybody else to go through it because it keeps guns out of the hands \nof criminals and those who are a danger to themselves and others due to \nmental illness.\n  Background checks work. Since 1998, over 2 million sales to \nprohibited people have been prevented thanks to background checks. That \nis 2 million times a potentially dangerous person trying to get a gun \nwas denied a gun.\n  Now some argue that background checks do not work because not enough \npeople who fail the background check are later prosecuted. Failing a \nbackground check is not in itself a crime. Indeed, the main purpose of \nthe background check is to prevent a prohibited person from getting the \ndesired gun. Although not foolproof, the background check system we \nhave had in place has succeeded in preventing dangerous people from \ngetting guns over 2 million times. What we are now trying to do is \nimprove the background check system. That is what the Manchin-Toomey \namendment is trying to do. We all know there is a huge, huge loophole \nin that background check system. Criminals and other prohibited people \nwho could not go in to a legitimate gun store in the Presiding \nOfficer's State or my State can get around this by going to nonlicensed \ndealers at gun shows.\n  I know gun store owners in Vermont. They follow the law and conduct \nbackground checks. They wonder why others who sell guns do not have to \nfollow these same rules. I agree with these responsible business \nowners. Just as I go through a background check when I buy a gun, I \nwant everybody to have to go through it and not be able to use the \nloophole.\n  I have been voting to close this loophole for years. In 1999, when \nthe Senate adopted an amendment to close the gun show loophole, we \npassed that provision after the tragedy at Columbine. Regrettably, the \nHouse would not pass the bill. Republican leadership at the time let \nthe matter drop. I hope this time the House will join us to close the \nloophole once and for all.\n  The Manchin-Toomey bipartisan amendment closes the loophole in a way \nthat does not infringe upon second amendment rights. Sales at gun \nshows, sales using online or print advertising will be governed by the \nsame kind of requirements that a gun store owner in Vermont or Virginia \nor anywhere else has to follow. It is going to make us safer. It will \nnot confiscate anyone's guns. It will not create a government registry. \nIt does not undermine the second amendment. No court has held that \nbackground checks, which have been with us for decades, violate the \nsecond amendment. Indeed, when the U.S. Supreme Court expressly held \nthat the second amendment provides an individual right in the Heller \ncase, it also said that ``longstanding provisions on the possession of \nfirearms by felons and\n\n[[Page S2631]]\n\nthe mentally ill'' do not violate the second amendment.\n  The compromise these Senators have presented to us is focused on gun \nshows and commercial sales. It does not require background checks for \nsales between spouses or siblings or parents, grandparents, uncles, \naunts, nieces, nephews, and cousins. It does not require background \nchecks for a transfer between friends and neighbors who talk to each \nother and decide to sell or give each other a firearm.\n  The bill does not require background checks for temporary transfers \nof guns for hunting or target shooting. But it does require background \nchecks for the kind of sales that can be easily exploited by people who \nintend to do harm: sales at gun shows and through online and print \nadvertisement.\n  I would hope Senators would agree with 90 percent of the people in \nthis country: We need a strong background check system in order to keep \nguns out of the hands of dangerous criminals. Why not try to plug the \nloopholes in the law that allow dangerous criminals to buy guns without \nbackground checks? It is a matter of common sense. If we agree that the \nbackground check system makes sense, why not make it more effective? \nWhat responsible gun owner objects to improving the background check \nsystem?\n  I come from a State with a lot of gun owners, myself included. I have \nnot heard a single gun owner say, we should not have a background check \napply to everybody just as it applies to them.\n  At the first of our Judiciary Committee hearings of the year, the \nfirst of three hearings on gun violence proposals, I pointed out that \nWayne LaPierre of the NRA testified in 1999 in favor of mandatory \ncriminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. He \nemphasized at that time the NRA supported closing loopholes in the \nbackground system by saying, ``No loopholes anywhere for anyone.''\n  It is common sense. That is what we voted to do in 1999 and we should \nagain, and this time we should get it enacted. I have said over and \nover again, do not filibuster or sloganeer. Vote. Vote yes; vote no. Do \nnot vote maybe. No one is going to take away our second amendment \nrights. They are not at risk. But lives are at risk where responsible \npeople fail to stand up for laws that will keep guns out of the hands \nof those who use them to commit crimes of violence.\n  This is something we can come together and do to make America safer \nand more secure. Some have expressed frustration about the level of \nprosecutions under existing gun laws. And some have suggested that \ninstead of making sensible changes to our public safety laws to prevent \ngun violence, Federal law enforcement officials should focus \nexclusively on existing laws. I share some of that frustration, but I \ndo not agree it is a valid excuse for us to do nothing. Improvements in \nthe enforcement of existing laws and efforts to give law enforcement \nofficials better tools to do their jobs are not mutually exclusive; \nthose efforts complement each other. A recent article in the Washington \nTimes, certainly not considered a liberal paper, documented the gun \nprosecutions were in decline beginning in the Bush administration. They \nsuggested having a Senate-confirmed Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, Firearms and Explosives would significantly help law \nenforcement. We need to get such a director. But let's not be \ndistracted from what we can do to keep Americans safe by partisan \nattacks on this administration or the last administration.\n  I also want to thank Senator Schumer for all his efforts to bring us \nto this point. I worked with him to make sure the legislation \nconsidered and voted on in the Judiciary Committee included a provision \nto improve the background checks system. He introduced a number of \nbackground check proposals. He reached across the aisle to try very \nhard to come to an agreement with Senator Coburn. His efforts helped \npave the way for the agreement that Senator Manchin and Senator Toomey \nwere able to reach.\n  I have also been encouraging the junior Senator from West Virginia in \nhis efforts. He has shown great leadership, sensitivity and \nperseverance. I commend Senator Toomey for his willingness to join in \nthis legislative effort. Together they have done the Senate and the \ncountry a great service. At the outset of the Judiciary Committee's \nconsideration of this issue, I encouraged Senators to bring forward \ntheir ideas, to debate that which they thought could make a difference, \nnot just obstruct that which they opposed. I hope those who oppose the \nmeasure put forward by Senators Manchin and Toomey will seek to be part \nof this debate rather than simply try to silence it.\n  Improving the background check system is a matter of common sense. \nSenators Manchin and Toomey have shown that it can be accomplished in a \nway that better protects our communities and fully respects our Second \nAmendment rights. I am pleased to support this bipartisan solution.\n  Now, will everybody agree on this legislation? Perhaps not. But at \nleast have the courage to vote yes or no. Vote yes or no. If you are \ngoing to vote maybe, that is voting for a filibuster. The American \npeople want a little bit of courage on the part of 100 Senators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/15/senate-section/article/S2631-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in Shakespeare's ``Julius Caesar,'' a \nsoothsayer warned Caesar to ``beware the Ides of March.'' For most \nAmericans, however, the Ides of March passes without incident. It is \nthe Ides of April--April 15, tax day--that so many Americans dread. The \nlast few days must have been a big bonanza for the headache medicine \nindustry. Taxes are due tonight at midnight.\n  Millions of Americans spent their weekend struggling to use tax \nsoftware that crashed, flailing about to locate receipts, and wading \nthrough hundreds of pages of tax instructions. Instead of enjoying the \noutdoors or spending time with family and friends, too many Americans \nspent this past weekend hunched over their kitchen tables or in front \nof their computers surrounded by a maze of receipts, canceled checks, \nforms, and other paperwork as they undertook the annual water torture \nritual of preparing tax returns.\n  This is the tax instruction booklet for our personal taxes, our 1040 \nform. It goes on and on, well over 200 pages. The first 104 pages of \ninstructions are the basic form 1040. The further 110 pages of \ninstructions are for the most common schedules to the 1040. There has \ngot to be a better way.\n  Some day I hope Democrats and Republicans can come to the floor of \nthis body, ask unanimous consent that this goes into the trash, and \ninstead we substitute a much simpler way for our people to do their \ntaxes. The reality is the Tax Code is too complex, too costly, and \nsimply takes too much time to comply with. It is a code that is \nhopelessly out of date, mind-numbingly complex, increasingly unfair, \nand extraordinarily inefficient.\n  As a result, one of our most consequential economic policies, our tax \nlaw, does far more to stifle economic growth than to encourage it. Our \ncountry needs a comprehensive overhaul of our system of raising revenue \nand a modern Tax Code that is simpler, fairer, and simply more \nefficient. In sum, what is needed is a progrowth economic tax policy. \nIf history is any guide, particularly when former President Reagan and \na big group of Democrats got together, it can bolster American families \nand increase revenue without raising rates.\n  I have been something of a broken record on this issue for some time. \nBut on a day such as this, particularly given what our people went \nthrough over the past weekend, I think it is time we spend a few \nminutes to talk\n\n[[Page S2632]]\n\nabout how important it is to bring some common sense to American tax \nlaw. What is particularly striking is that I think the Congress \nunderstands what needs to be done. This is a question of political will \nnow. There have been all kinds of blue-ribbon reports from the Bush \nadministration, the Obama administration. I think what needs to be done \nis widely understood.\n  The pipes in the Tax Code are clogged with provisions that encourage \nrent-seeking behavior, lead to the misallocation of capital, and warp \nthe American economy. What needs to be done is go in there and drain \nthe swamp and clean out the Tax Code. It contains almost 4 million \nwords. In the last decade alone, more than 130 laws have been enacted \nthat yielded almost 4,500 changes to the Tax Code. That amounts to more \nthan one change to the Tax Code each and every day, year in and year \nout.\n  It has become so complicated that almost 90 percent of taxpayers \neither hire a tax preparer or use tax preparation software to complete \nreturns. The IRS reports that the average estimated time burden for all \ntaxpayers filing a Form 1040, a 1040A, a 1040EZ, is 13 hours, with an \naverage cost of $210. With respect to these forms, nonbusiness \ntaxpayers face an average burden of about 8 hours, a full day's work, \nwhile business taxpayers face an average burden of about 23 hours, \nnearly 3 days of work.\n  In 2011, the Small Business Administration found that among \nbusinesses with 20 or fewer employees, tax compliance cost $1,584 per \nemployee. In addition to the escalating cost of compliance with this \ncode, cost, both time and money, the complexity of the code, in my \nview, has obscured the typical person's ability to understand it and \nhas undercut voluntary compliance, which is, of course, the bedrock \nprinciple of our tax law.\n  With the ongoing debate about how to reduce the budget deficit, the \nTax Code's complexity serves also to perpetuate what is known as the \ntax gap; that is, the difference between what taxpayers pay and what is \nowed under the law. The most recent Internal Revenue Service estimate \nfor the tax gap is $385 billion. Based on statistical trends, the \nlikely gap for this year is going to exceed $420 billion. This is an \nunderpayment of approximately 14 percent.\n  My gut tells me--I serve on both the Finance Committee and the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation--that some of this gap certainly is due to \nconscious tax evasion, but I also believe a significant portion of it \nis attributable to inadvertent mistakes in filing, many of which stem \nfrom the complexity of the code. Well-coordinated, thoughtful, \ncomprehensive reform is going to reduce the need for many complex \nprovisions that limit the ability of taxpayers to benefit from certain \ndeductions, credits, exemptions, and exclusions. Comprehensive tax \nreform must eliminate the multiple provisions that require taxpayers to \ncalculate their liability multiple times, such as the alternative \nminimum tax. Talk about bureaucratic water torture. All this weekend \nacross the country we had middle-class folks essentially doing their \ntaxes twice as a result of the minimum tax. The personal exemption \nphaseout, PEP, and the phaseout of itemized deductions, Pease, isn't \nmuch easier.\n\n  I would show this poster which demonstrates 11 tax forms. These are \nforms, colleagues, the typical filer must fill out every year or, if \nthey can afford it, pay someone to fill them out. Is it really \nnecessary to run this full-time, hand-cramping program for our citizens \nto have to wade through all of this?\n  We also have another alternative, a one-page 1040 form which I have \nworked on with colleagues for years. It is only about 29 lines long. \nSome industrious reporters took this particular tax form and found a \ntypical citizen--this was worked on by Democrats and Republicans--may \nfill out their taxes with this form in under an hour.\n  To illustrate how complicated the code has become, let me refer \nbriefly to capital gains. The income tax currently imposes at least \nnine different effective tax rates on capital gains, depending on the \ntaxpayer's regular rate, how long an asset was owned, the type of \nasset, and whether the taxpayer owes the alternative minimum tax. For \nthis the IRS provides three different worksheets, one with 37 lines, to \nhelp taxpayers calculate their tax on capital gains.\n  Comprehensive reform should make things easier for taxpayers by \nallowing a percentage exclusion for long-term gains and reapplying \nregular tax rates to the rest. This simple change, to have an exclusion \nfor a measure of capital gains which have been earned and then a \nprogressive rate structure from this point on, would sharply reduce the \ncomplexity of returns while maintaining fairness and opportunities for \nall our people to invest.\n  Further complicating matters, a number of commonly used terms in the \nTax Code: qualifying child, modified adjusted gross income, and more, \nhave multiple definitions depending on the provision. Certainly, \nDemocrats and Republicans should agree uniform definitions for the most \ncommonly used terms are something which shouldn't be a bipartisan \nissue. More than 40 definitions of small business exist in the Tax Code \nalone.\n  There are certainly policy reasons to provide tax benefits to \nfamilies with children. The definition of a child differs widely across \nthe Tax Code.\n  Children under 19 count in defining the earned-income tax credit \nbenefits. Those under 17 qualify for the child credit, and only those \nunder 13 are eligible for the child and dependent care credit. Maybe \nthese differences result from deliberate congressional actions about \nwho ought to receive tax benefits, but I think they needlessly \ncomplicate tax filing and certainly lead to inadvertent errors which \nthe Internal Revenue Service then attempts to figure out how to \ncorrect.\n  Other factors used to define qualifying children further complicate \nthe situation, including the child's physical residence, custody \narrangements, and who pays the child's living expenses. Establishing a \nsingle definition to determine whether taxpayers may claim tax benefits \nfor children would simplify both tax filing and IRS processing of \nreturns.\n  The list only goes on and on, such as the earned-income tax credit, \nsomething vital to low-income families, and a whole host of different \nworkshops. The educational credits are, again, another example where \nfamilies with students in college qualifying for multiple tax benefits \nto defray educational expenses often may claim only one of them. For \nexample, a family may be able to claim either the Hope credit or the \nLifetime Learning Credit, but not both for the same student.\n  If the family has more than one student it may claim one credit for \none student and the other for a second student. Determining which \nalternative is best requires multiple calculations and may conflict \nwith the use of other tax benefits for education such as Coverdale \nsavings accounts and 529 savings plans. Comprehensive tax reform would, \nat the very minimum, coordinate these educational benefits to make it \neasier for families to determine eligibility.\n  How complicated have things become? A few years ago Treasury's \nInspector General for Tax Administration sent staff to pose as \ntaxpayers at 12 commercial preparer chains and 16 small independent \npreparers. Of the 28 tax returns the professionals prepared, 17 had \nmistakes. All of the business returns were wrong. Let me repeat that. \nAll of the business returns were wrong when professionals had prepared \nthem.\n  In 2006 the same sort of drill was undertaken. Again, the Government \nAccountability Office found professional preparers made mistakes. They \nmishandled those bread-and-butter kinds of issues, such as the earned-\nincome tax credit and the childcare credit. They even got it wrong \nwhether the taxpayer should even itemize his or her deductions.\n  The question is, If the pros can't figure out how to file taxes, \nisn't it clear, isn't it obvious to all of us the Tax Code needs to be \npurged and the special interest breaks cleaned out so rates can be held \ndown for all? And we can agree on a simple tax philosophy. I can sum up \nmine in a sentence.\n  I believe we need a tax system which gives everybody in America the \nopportunity to get ahead. If you are successful, we want you to be \nsuccessful. You will pay your fair share, but nothing in the Tax Code \nwill make it impossible for you to be successful in the days\n\n[[Page S2633]]\n\nahead. If you don't have much, we will have a Tax Code which is simple \nand understandable. When you work hard and play by the rules, you will \nhave an opportunity to get ahead as well.\n  Comprehensive tax reform will make it easier to file. It is going to \nlay out an opportunity for the Senate Democrats, Republicans, and \nIndependents to come together.\n  I close simply by saying once again, we saw in the past few days how \nbroken and dysfunctional our tax system in America has become. Can you \nimagine what people thought when their software was crashing in the \nlast couple of days? They are trying to find their receipts, flailing \nthrough filing cabinets trying to find those documents which attest to \ntheir taxable events for the past year. They can't know with certainty, \nbased upon some of those analyses by the Government Accountability \nOffice, whether they have done it right or even professionals have done \nit correctly.\n  Until this Senate comes together on a bipartisan basis to work for a \nsimpler, more coherent tax system--one which promotes growth and eases \nthe burden on American families and American businesses--there will be \nno relief from the Ides of April. This, in my view, is a tragedy worthy \nof Shakespeare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER.

I rise today on Tax Day, the deadline for Americans to \nfile Federal tax returns on their hard-earned income for the 2012 tax \nyear. Benjamin Franklin famously said the only sure things in life are \ndeath and taxes. Today we Americans live up to that second hard truth, \nthe day when the taxman comes.\n  For those of us in Congress, Tax Day serves as an important reminder \nof just who is funding all of the government's spending: it is the \nAmerican taxpayer. Even as families across America have made tough \ndecisions and tightened their household budgets, the Federal Government \nhas gone on a spending spree. The government has posted four straight \ntrillion-dollar deficits and is growing the national debt, which is \napproaching $17 trillion.\n  In recent years the average annual deficit has skyrocketed to 8.7 \npercent of our gross domestic product. These deficits should be all the \nevidence we need in order we get our fiscal house in order.\n  I believe, and Nebraskans believe, to generate economic growth we \nmust first address our Nation's addiction to spending. We need to fix \nour broken tax system, and what better time than Tax Day to highlight \nthis need?\n  Tax Day is a day to renew our efforts to simplify the tax system and \nease the burden on hard-working Americans. The act of actually filing \ntaxes is never pleasant, but it also allows Americans the chance to \nassess just how much of their income is going toward subsidizing an \never-growing bureaucracy.\n  Rather than make it easy for citizens to comply with the income tax \nrequirements, the Federal Government has held onto an arcane, \nconvoluted tax system. Many citizens, particularly small business \nowners, are forced to hire costly accountants or buy tax software just \nto sift through the 3,951,104 words of the Tax Code which, along with \nother rules and regulations, fills 73,608 pages of text, all in order \nto figure out just how much one owes.\n  Nebraskans shouldn't need to waste their time or pay for expensive \nfinancial advisers just to fork over more money to Uncle Sam. Americans \ncollectively spend more than 6 billion hours preparing their tax \nreturns. Imagine what more could be done if Americans could focus less \ntime and resources on tax compliance.\n  According to the National Federation of Independent Businesses, 90 \npercent of small businesses have given up attempting to comply with the \nTax Code. Instead, they pay a professional tax preparation service.\n  Through tax reform to make the Tax Code simpler and fairer, these \nsmall businesses could redirect scant resources currently used for tax \ncompliance to focus more on growth and creating jobs.\n  I am encouraged, however, by the recent efforts toward much needed \ncomprehensive tax reform to simplify our Tax Code. Just last week the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Max Baucus, wrote an opinion \npiece in the Wall Street Journal with House Ways and Means Committee \nchairman Dave Camp highlighting their progress to date in pressing \ntoward bipartisan tax reform.\n  President Obama has called for revenue-neutral corporate tax reform \nin his fiscal year 2014 budget. Unfortunately, the President's proposal \nis contingent on a $1.1 trillion tax increase above and beyond the $1.7 \ntrillion in tax increases the President has already sought and won.\n  Such a tax hike sends the unmistakable message to every American \ntaxpayer that the government knows how to spend their money better than \nthey do. I believe American families know how best to spend their \nmoney, particularly during ongoing times of economic hardship when \neveryone is called upon to make tough decisions and to make those tough \ndecisions about their budgets and about spending.\n  Revenue-neutral, progrowth tax reform should not only be geared \ntoward the corporate side of our Tax Code, we should pursue revenue-\nneutral tax reforms on the individual side as well which would benefit \nAmerican families as well as small businesses that pay those taxes at \nthe individual level.\n  Small businesses generate two out of every three new jobs. Ninety-\nfive percent of businesses, which employ nearly 70 million Americans, \nare organized in such a way that earnings are passed through the \nenterprise and therefore subject to taxation at the individual \nlevel. Tax day provides us with a needed reminder of how broken our Tax \nCode is. We can and should use it as the impetus to pursue progrowth \ntax reform. My goal for tax reform is simple--a fairer tax code that \nensures that Nebraskans and our neighbors from across the country can \nkeep more of the money they work hard to earn while providing for the \ncore duties and responsibilities of our government.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are about to enter into an incredibly \nimportant debate about a series of issues relating to violence--\nspecifically, gun violence--in our communities all across America.\n  Today I rise to speak about a very important bipartisan amendment I \nwill be offering with Senator Roy Blunt and others called the \nExcellence in Mental Health Act. This addresses a very important piece \nof the discussion. It is an opportunity for us to come together amidst \na lot of controversial debate and agree on something that is a very \nimportant piece of the puzzle--having access to comprehensive, quality \nmental health services.\n  This weekend we heard from Francine Wheeler, whose 6-year-old son Ben \nwas murdered on December 14 in Newtown, CT. We know that Ben was one of \n26 people--20 children--who lost their lives. I can only begin to \nimagine what all of us as parents would feel in that situation. For \nthose 26 victims and the 3,300 other Americans killed since then in \nacts of gun violence, it is time to take action. I am hopeful, given \nthe strong bipartisan vote we had to move forward on this debate, that \nwe can actually have the debate, that people will have their say and \nthen vote on this very important issue.\n  The bill before us is a commonsense effort toward comprehensive \nbackground checks that will help save lives. I am very supportive of \nnot only that provision but others that will be offered as well.\n  One important piece that hasn't been in the headlines as much but is \nvery important in getting it right is the need for better access to \ncomprehensive mental health services. That is why we need the \nbipartisan Excellence in Mental Health Act passed as an amendment that \nwill increase access to care and improve the quality of life for those \nwho need it.\n  We know that a person who does not receive treatment after his or her \nfirst psychotic episode is 15 times more likely to commit a violent \nact. But let me\n\n[[Page S2634]]\n\nbe clear. We also know that the vast majority of those who are living \nwith mental illnesses are more likely to be a victim of crime than to \nbe a perpetrator of crime. But tragedies do happen when treatment and \nhelp are not available.\n  In too many instances today we are seeing that there is not effective \nhelp available to people in communities. The current lack of access to \nmental health services means too often it is the local police who are \nresponding to psychiatric emergencies, and they may not have services \nto which to take someone. These police officers are being diverted from \nwhat they should be doing--responding to other crimes--and so they take \npeople to jail rather than have them get the services they need. They \nare spending resources incarcerating people who would otherwise need to \nbe and should be in a treatment situation.\n  That is why we have law enforcement supporting this amendment. We \nhave over 50 organizations--from law enforcement and community mental \nhealth and health groups, as well as those who represent our brave \nveterans home from the war--supporting us because they know that if we \ndon't have quality service in the community, we will continue to see \npeople in jail who shouldn't be in jail, we will continue to see \nfamilies and individuals not getting the help they need, and in some \ncircumstances we will see more tragedies occur as well.\n  Over the course of this week, we are going to hear a lot of debate \nabout different aspects of gun safety. Colleagues are going to disagree \nabout the manner of background checks or limits on assault weapons. But \nI hope there will be no disagreement that people with serious mental \nillnesses should be given effective treatment and that we can do a \nbetter job in our country to make sure treatment is readily available \nin a community setting. That should be the hopeful part of this whole \ndebate.\n  Science has shown us significant advances in the study of the brain \nand the most effective mental health treatments. There are solutions if \npeople get the help they need. They can live healthy, productive lives \nrather than struggling with their illness. And I applaud President \nObama's historic brain mapping initiative to expand that knowledge even \nmore.\n  It is amazing to me that we have so many studies relating to heart \ndisease, kidney disease, or diabetes, and yet all of the issues \nrelating to the brain--whether it is bipolar disorder or Alzheimer's or \nParkinson's disease or schizophrenia--we have not tackled with the same \nvigor. There are solutions. We are finding those every day. There is \nhope. Today, thanks to cutting-edge research, we have answers for \npeople living with severe mental illnesses. We have proven therapies, \ntreatment options, and medicines that truly transform lives.\n  I speak as someone who lived, as a daughter, through a time when we \ndid not have appropriate treatments. When I was growing up, in middle \nschool and high school, my father had bipolar disease. At that time we \ndidn't know what it was. He was misdiagnosed for 10 years. At that time \neverybody was schizophrenic. There was no understanding that we \nactually have chemical imbalances in the brain, just as someone who \nisn't monitoring their sugar because they are diabetic might have. They \nneed to monitor that in order to take medicine to keep them on an \nequilibrium so they do not get sick and have problems. We have the same \nthing with something called mood disorders in our country, and we have \nlearned much about it. If someone is taking the right medicine, it \nstops the imbalance where they are either manic or severely depressed.\n  There are solutions. When my dad was finally diagnosed correctly and \nreceived the help he needed and the medicine--at the time it was \nlithium--he went on to lead a very productive life for the rest of his \ndays. So I have seen both what happens when people don't get treatment \nand when people do, and we literally have the opportunity to take this \nnext step in order to make sure people all across our country get the \nhelp they need.\n  Unfortunately, today one-third of all bipolar disorders do not get \nany treatment even when we know there are absolute answers for \nindividuals and families. Shame on us for not making sure those are \nreadily available. The amendment I will be offering would make sure \nthose are available and close what I believe is the final step in what \nwe have called mental health parity.\n\n  We, as a group, on a bipartisan basis passed legislation authored by \nour dear departed Paul Wellstone and Senator Pete Domenici, with strong \nadvocacy from Senator Ted Kennedy, to provide parity under health \ninsurance between physical and mental health services. We passed that. \nWe have now gone on to strengthen that with the new health reforms that \nare in place. The only place where we don't have mental health parity \nright now is in the community outside of the insurance system. We do \nnot have the same parity between what we do through a community health \nclinic receiving reimbursement for preventive care for health services \nand what we do for behavioral health--mental health, substance abuse--\nwhich is what we are going to fix with this amendment. We want to make \nsure we are focusing comprehensively in the community.\n  As part of this, I also wish to talk about another tragedy facing our \ncountry; that is, the loss of so many of our heroes from Iraq and \nAfghanistan. This is a very important part of this story and part of \nwhat our amendment will address in a very positive way. Men and women \nwho survive the horrors of war are ending up taking their own lives \nwhen they come home. Twenty-two veterans a day commit suicide, 22 a day \ntoday, yesterday, and tomorrow. They and their families, all those in \nthat situation, need to know there is help available for them. That is \nwhy we have very strong support from veterans, the Iraq and Afghanistan \nveterans organizations, which were very pleased to have stood with us \nlast week when we did a press conference with veterans to focus on this \nimportant part of the puzzle.\n  We know that one in four veterans coming home needs some kind of \nmental health support, so we want to make sure that if they are in a \nrural community in northern Michigan and it is 3 or 4 hours to drive to \nthe VA, they instead could receive some help in their own community--\nworking with the VA but receiving help in their own community--and that \nis what this does. We want to make sure that our veterans are fully \nreceiving the services promised them and that comprehensive health care \nwill be available to them when they come home.\n  I would like to share just one story from our press conference.\n  Jennifer Crane joined us. She is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan. \nThis October will mark 10 years since she returned home, but she says, \n``The experiences live inside of me like it was yesterday.'' She \nsuffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. She couldn't sleep. She \nself-medicated and ended up homeless and in trouble with law \nenforcement. But when she got the help she needed at a community mental \nhealth center, it transformed her life. She met the man who would \nbecome her husband. She is now going to have a baby and now works with \nGive an Hour, which is a wonderful organization that helps veterans get \nthe mental health services they need, and they are strongly supporting \nwhat we are doing as well.\n  Jennifer could have ended up a statistic, but she got the help she \nneeded. We need to give every one of our heroes coming home from war \nthe same opportunity. That is why the Excellence in Mental Health Act \nis so important as a part of all of this effort.\n  We have come a long way, in a bipartisan way, to recognize the need \nfor mental health treatment. As I mentioned before, the wonderful \npartnership of Senators Domenici, Wellstone, and Kennedy paved the way \nfor us to more fully understand that when we talk about comprehensive \nhealth services, we shouldn't stop at the neck--from the neck down, one \nset of rules; from the neck up, another set of rules--that, in fact, we \nare talking about comprehensive care. We need to make sure we lose that \nstigma and focus instead on what we can do to help people receive the \nservices they need. This amendment takes those efforts across the \nfinish line by expanding access to community mental health services.\n  I knew there would be a lot of controversial debate, but I hope in \nthe end we will be able to come together, as we have on this amendment. \nI am very appreciative of the bipartisan support. I\n\n[[Page S2635]]\n\nwant to thank Senator Roy Blunt again on our Excellence in Mental \nHealth Act, as well as Senator Marco Rubio, Senator Susan Collins, \nSenator Lisa Murkowski, and others who have expressed their support as \nwell. This is an opportunity for us to come together, as we have in the \npast, and do the right thing for millions of families dealing with \nmental illnesses that are treatable. The good news is there is hope \nnow. There are actually answers now to so many mental illnesses. By \npassing our bipartisan Excellence in Mental Health Act we can prevent \ntragedies from happening in families all over our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, first, I commend and thank my \ncolleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, for her leadership on an \nissue that is among the paramount questions for our time: whether we \nwill meet our obligation to regard mental illness on a par with \nphysical illness, a cause that has occupied me for a long time. So I \nwant to thank the Senator from Michigan for spearheading this \ninitiative, which is a vital part of the effort to stop gun violence in \nour country and, in fact, make our country healthy in so many ways. I \nam proud to join her as a cosponsor and a supporter of these efforts.\n  I come to the floor today to continue the debate on the gun violence \ninitiatives which are central to making America safer and making our \ncountry stronger. This bill is a comprehensive set of provisions that \nwill hopefully be further strengthened by an amendment to be offered \nthis week. We are on the cusp of voting on that amendment, the work \ndone by Senators Toomey and Manchin, our colleagues, to reach a \nreasonable compromise. It is indeed a sensible, commonsense compromise \nthat I am proud to support that will guarantee a criminal background \ncheck system to keep firearms and weapons of war out of the hands of \npeople who are dangerous, people who should not have guns, criminals, \nmentally ill, seriously mentally problem-stricken, and of course \nothers, such as domestic abusers.\n  For too long, criminal individuals and organizations have prospered \nfrom illegally distributing weapons and firearms. So the bill in its \nsecond title takes a great step toward barring illegal trafficking and \nto also ban straw purchases.\n  Too often given short shrift or little attention is the third title \nwhich speaks to school safety, and that is the measure that brings me \nhere today.\n  School safety is not an afterthought. It is central to stopping gun \nviolence. The tragic lessons we have learned from Sandy Hook include \nnot only the courage of the educators, those brave teachers and \nadministrators and school psychologists, who literally threw themselves \nat bullets and cradled the loved ones of families who lost their lives, \ncradled children in their care as they were met by a hail of gunfire--\nthat teaching moment should not only inspire us but obligate us to do \nmore about school safety.\n  That is why I have gone to the schools of Connecticut, most recently \non a tour that I conducted to ten schools around the State, to learn \nfrom our educators what they think those lessons are from Sandy Hook \nand where they think the priorities should be in terms of school \nsafety. That experience provided me with some pillars of a program that \nI believe is important and is embodied in the act that is before us: \nthe School and Campus Safety Enhancement Act. I want to thank Senator \nBoxer for her leadership on it which reauthorizes in effect the Secure \nOur Schools Program, which has been very productive and unfortunately \nwas not reauthorized when it expired.\n  These measures and the pillars of this program can be summarized very \nsimply:\n  First, decisions should be made locally about what best fits the \ncommunity. Those decisions ought to be made by school districts and \ntheir boards, parents, teachers, administrators--all who are involved \nand have the knowledge and expertise and commitment locally, and \nWashington should not impose its judgment on those communities with a \none-size-fits-all set of policies.\n  Second, school safety ideally should involve a partnership between \neducators and law enforcement. In many of the schools I visited, I saw \nthe value of school resource officers. More importantly, educators \npointed out to me the value of their partnership with local law \nenforcement through school resource officers who acted not only as \nsecurity personnel but also as mentors, counselors, and role models, \npreventing crime, not just stopping it in progress or apprehending \ncriminals afterwards.\n  Third, schools must be open, supportive, nurturing environments. They \ncannot be prisons. They cannot be transformed into permanent lockdown. \nWe must commit ourselves to the freedoms and liberties that are \nembodied in our schools and the educative atmosphere that is so \npriceless and essential to real education. We cannot solve this problem \nby simply having more guns in schools, or arming teachers or \nadministrators. Trained school resource officers or others provided \nwith law enforcement support have to be part of a nurturing and open \nenvironment.\n  The act that is before us today embodied in title III is important to \nmove forward school safety, and to embolden, encourage, enable, and \nempower local decisionmaking.\n  Today, I want to provide a very short report to my colleagues on what \nI have learned in my tour; and I encourage my colleagues to do the same \naround their States because it is genuinely a learning experience. The \nteaching moment of this tour changed my perspective on school safety, \nand certainly reinvigorated my appreciation for what happens in the \nclassrooms and schools of our country with the leadership of our \nteachers and administrators. We owe them a great debt of gratitude.\n  The issue of safe and secure schools certainly raised its head last \nweek in the town of Greenwich, CT, when reports of a gunman put \nGreenwich High School in a lockdown. Thankfully, the suspect was \napprehended, unarmed, with no casualties. The fact that a lockdown was \neven necessary underscores that we have made great strides; but our \nyoung people will not be safe in schools unless we know all of the \nbest practices and implement them. This threat proved empty, but it \noffered a learning experience in terms of the training, the locking and \nunlocking procedures for school doors, the types of issues that can be \naddressed through better and more regular coordination with local \npolice and others who can provide that kind of guidance.\n\n  Over the past 3 weeks, the schools I visited were large and small, in \nwidely varying parts of our State: Manchester High School, Kelly Middle \nSchool in Norwich, Middletown's Snow Elementary School, New Britain \nHigh School, West Bristol K-8 School, the Gilbert School in Winsted's \nHigh School, Northwestern Region 7 High School, Waterbury's West Side \nMiddle School, Ross Woodward Magnet School, and Shelton Intermediate \nSchool. In every one of them, I saw different ways of dealing with \nschool safety, and also aspiration for even better procedures and \nequipment--locks, lighting, alarms, cameras--but also training for \nteachers, and more school resource officers. I believe one of the most \nimportant pillars of this program has to be Federal resources that meet \nthose local needs without imposing a one-size-fits-all policy. These \nschools are in widely different areas in terms of geography and \ndemographics, the size of the communities they serve, the size of the \nschools, the qualifications of their staff and their training. That is \nwhy this program has to be individualized in terms of how it meets \nthese needs and, again, empower and enable local decisionmaking.\n  The Secure Our Schools grant program has impacted Connecticut very \npositively. The program has a direct and tangible impact on schools in \nStamford, for example, where the problem of gang violence was \naddressed, and in other schools around the State such as Hartford, \nwhere the grant was used for the purchase of an outdoor intercom \nstation, as well as locks and card readers to control access to school.\n  The Secure Our Schools Program was a success story, and this act now \nwill not only reauthorize but strengthen the Secure Our Schools \nProgram.\n  To give some examples: In Manchester, the swipe card entry program \nnot only provides for better security\n\n[[Page S2636]]\n\nbut better attendance tracking. The Illing Middle School in Manchester \nis considering that system, but the installation costs run about \n$50,000--a small price to pay for greater security that the card system \nprovides. In general, I found security was not only cost effective, it \nwas minimal in its cost compared to many other programs we are \npotentially taking to improve school safety.\n  When I went to see Kelly Middle School in Norwich, I had to buzz in \non an intercom and announce myself. That was true of many other schools \nas well. A Senate pin may allow us access to the floor of the Senate \nwithout passing through security, but it doesn't get you into Kelly \nMiddle School, nor should it. They have a simple, practical system. If \nyou are visiting during school hours, you buzz in and announce \nyourself, and then they decide whether that individual can enter \nthrough another set of locked doors. The double locks are a system that \nsome schools are considering implementing. It is a sensible policy that \nis enabled by an intercom system and a camera--again, minimal in cost \ncompared to many other infrastructure programs we may be considering \nthis year.\n  In Middletown, I visited Snow Elementary School. Principal James \nGaudreau demonstrated how their doors are locked. When a person is \nbuzzed in, video cameras record and archive who is entering. Some \nschools have archiving systems, others do not. Law enforcement knows \nthat archiving is important. As Chief William McKenna and Mayor Dan \nDrew told me, these systems are planning that was undertaken even \nbefore Sandy Hook. School systems, boards, administrators, and teachers \nwere aware of security before Sandy Hook, but their awareness has been \nenhanced and they are planning to devote additional resources to this \nissue. Both Mayor Drew and Chief McKenna extolled the virtues of the \nthree school resource officers, and they are looking for additional \nresources to create afterschool programs and other measures to enhance \nthat partnership and cooperation between police and students, and \nteachers, educators, and law enforcement can collaborate.\n  Visiting New Britain was very important on this tour.\n  When I went to New Britain High School with Mayor Tim O'Brien and \nschool superintendent Kelt Cooper, I saw there the requirement that any \nvisitor is automatically run through a database check--the sex offender \ndatabase check. Using the driver's license they were able to run that \nkind of check virtually instantaneously. They also have, in that single \nhigh school, 150 cameras to know what is going on in that school minute \nto minute and with direct links to the police headquarters so that any \nkind of emergency is immediately apparent to law enforcement. The \nschool is going to install discrete panic buttons, allowing for rapid \nalerts to be sent to law enforcement, a belt-and-suspenders approach \nthat many schools are implementing.\n  At Sandy Hook we know that Adam Lanza ended his massacre and took his \nown life when law enforcement arrived. So the presence of law \nenforcement can often have a powerful deterrent effect. The knowledge \nthat apprehension will be swift, that killing will be stopped, is a \nhuge deterrent.\n  At West Bristol K-8 School, Tim Callahan, who is the school project \nmanager there, pointed out to me how a parent dropoff was configured \nwith visual straight lines. Again, design and architecture is important \nto security so that out in the parking areas there are virtually no \nblind spots. They have integrated security features into this building \nwhile it was constructed. West Bristol also requires visitors to buzz \nin through the main office when they go through the main building. With \ngrant funds made available under this legislation, this school could \ninstall locks on a second set of doors, slowing down potential \nintruders. We know in these dangerous emergency situations that time is \ncritical. Slowing down a killer, stopping an invader at a second locked \ndoor, can gain time for law enforcement to respond and save lives.\n  Adam Lanza killed 26 people, 20 beautiful children and 6 great \neducators, in 5 minutes with 154 bullets. If he had been stopped \nearlier, if a second set of doors had alerted police, if a buzzer had \nbeen available of the most immediate kind available elsewhere, the \nconsequences might have been different. There were alerts to the \npolice. They responded virtually immediately. Their response was heroic \nand profoundly significant to saving even more lives. But we know that \ntime is of the essence in these situations and that is why double \nlocks, buzzer systems, identification, additional checks--all can be \nimportant.\n  The chief operating officer in New Haven Public Schools, Will Clark, \ntold me about that kind of buzzer system there and in Winsted. School \nofficials, including the regional school district school \nsuperintendent, Judith Palmer, and the high school principal, Candy \nPerez, are working hard to improve its security system. But \ninfrastructure there, as they told me, is a continuing challenge. \nWinsted Board of Education member, Mimi Valyo, told me, ``We do not \neven have wifi.''\n  In 2013 we are in a wireless age, and the next generation of security \nsystems may rely on Wi-Fi or smartphones. We need to make sure schools \nlike Winsted have the resources they need to address the security needs \nof the 21st century with the technology of the 21st century. School \nsecurity is too important to be allowed to lag.\n  I thank all of the educators who educated me, who shared with me \ntheir stories of progress, their goals for the future, their hopes that \nwe can improve our schools and make them safer. If we make our schools \nsafe, we make our children safer, and we make America safer. I am \nhopeful--more optimistic than ever in light of the vote we took last \nweek--that we are making progress and that we will have positive votes \nin the days ahead, votes that fully fulfill our obligation to stop the \nplague of gun violence.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for their courageous votes last week and \nurge them to move forward this week in the same way.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, last week Senator Toomey, my dear friend \nfrom Pennsylvania, and I introduced this important piece of bipartisan \nlegislation with our colleagues Senator Kirk and Senator Schumer. It is \ncalled the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act \nbecause that is what it does.\n  This bill protects the safety of the public and our constitutional \nright to bear arms. Since we introduced the bill, there has been a lot \nof misinformation about this legislation. I wish to set the record \nstraight with hard facts about our proposal and what it will do and \nwhat it will not do.\n  I think people need to understand how guns first get into their life, \nwhich is through a commercial sale of some sort. We are not talking \nabout creating any new laws; we are making the laws we have uniform.\n  First of all, today we have on the books FFL--Federal firearms \nlicensed--dealers, and there are approximately 55,000 throughout the \nUnited States of America. We all have one close to us in our \nneighborhood. These are friends of mine and people I know. If a person \ngoes to a licensed dealer today and purchases a gun, they are required \nto do a criminal background check. The background check is basically to \nsee if that person is able to have a gun. That licensed dealer puts \nthat record of the background check they did, and only he or she, as a \nlicensed dealer, can keep it.\n  It is against the law to form some type of registry. The paranoia of \nthose who say someone will know where my guns are and people can take \nthem away cannot happen. In our bill, we double down to make sure it \ndoesn't happen by making it a felony with a 15-year imprisonment, so \nthat myth is gone.\n  The second way to buy a gun is at a gun show. If a person goes to a \ngun show and that same FFL dealer--if that person went to their store, \nhe or she would go through a background\n\n[[Page S2637]]\n\ncheck. If a person goes to a gun show and buys from a dealer there, he \nor she would still have to go through a background check under current \nlaw. If that person goes to the next table, he or she can buy whatever \nthey want and nobody is checking, and that is what we are going to \nstop.\n  Let's say I want to buy a gun through the Internet from Senator \nToomey in Pennsylvania and I am in West Virginia. I see he has a gun \nfor sale, and I want to buy that gun. As the law is stated today, as \nfar as buying interstate--from West Virginia to Pennsylvania--Mr. \nToomey would have to send that firearm to a licensed dealer in West \nVirginia, and I would have to have a background check done before I can \ntake possession of that gun.\n  We are not creating new law. All we are saying is if a person goes to \na gun show, there will be a background check for all guns that are sold \nat the gun show. If a person buys through the Internet, there will be a \nbackground check whether it is instate or out of State. This is not a \nuniversal background check. This is basically a criminal and mental \nbackground check and that criminal and mental background check has to \nshow that person has been found guilty by a court that he or she is a \ncriminal or criminally insane and not allowed to buy a gun and that is \nall.\n  So what everybody is hearing with all this talk is just falsehood. If \na person is a law-abiding, proud gun owner, such as myself, and likes \nshooting and going out in the woods with friends and family, we do not \ninfringe in any way, shape or form on individual transfer.\n  For those transactions which are not commercial transactions--for \nexample, in West Virginia usually your grandfather or uncle or somebody \ngets you your first gun. There are some people who never bought a gun \nbut have a collection of guns that was handed down to them by their \nfamily. Those people will still be able to have that type of \ntransaction. That is not interfered with. A person can sell a gun to \ntheir neighbor without any interference. A person can put a note on the \nbulletin board in their church and say: I have a gun I would like to \nsell and sell it to a church member.\n  So if anyone says we are infringing on somebody's right, we are not. \nAs we worked on the bill, we basically looked at the gun culture in \nAmerica, who we are, how we become who we are, and that is what we took \ninto consideration.\n  I, for one, as a gun owner and a person who enjoys hunting and \nshooting and all the things and camaraderie which that brings, I feel \nsometimes I am looked upon in an objectionable way because I enjoy \nthat. I am a law-abiding citizen and my second amendment right gives me \nthat right. I want to make sure that right is protected. I also have a \nresponsibility to do the right thing, and that is why we are here.\n  If we are looking for ways to keep our citizens safe from mass \nviolence, then shouldn't we look at the culture of mass violence? I \nhave gone around to the schools in West Virginia and talked to some of \nthe students.\n  We can talk to our young pages, the brightest and best of what we \nhave. They have probably become desensitized compared to what the \nPresiding Officer and I would have seen in our generation. If we saw \nwhat they do in a movie--and we didn't have the Internet back then, so \nwe didn't have anything to compare to it.\n\n  If we are going to talk about banning somebody's weapon, such as a \nhand-me-down gun, if you will, don't you think we ought to have people \nwith expertise who can tell what the gun does to make sure it isn't \njust something that might look fancy but doesn't perform any better \nthan a deer rifle? The Commission on Mass Violence is part of this \nbill. Basically, we are going to have people who have gun expertise, \npeople who have mental illness expertise.\n  I have gone to the schools and talked to teachers in kindergarten, \nfirst grade, and second grade. They are saying: Wait a minute. We have \nno help. We have identified kids who are challenged mentally or come \nfrom a home that is unstable and not getting proper support, and we \nhave nothing to do to help them. As a society, I believe we have a \nresponsibility, so we are going to have that Commission with guns and \nmental illness expertise.\n  How about school safety expertise? We had the horrific situation in \nNewtown. That gentleman got in that school, not because he had a key or \nbecause the door was unlocked, he got in that school because he was \nable to shoot the glass out of the front door and stick his arm in, hit \nthe safety bar and let himself in.\n  I have been a Governor for 6 years in the State of West Virginia. We \nbuilt a lot of schools, and we remodeled a lot of schools. Not once did \nan architect come to me and say: Governor, if we are going to build \nthese schools, we need all these safety devices so a person cannot get \ninto the school.\n  They told me about the lockdown for each room so a person would need \nto have a safety code to get into a room. Not one time was I told we \nshould have bulletproof glass on every first floor window. Not one time \nwas that ever brought up to me. We need people who have school safety \nexpertise.\n  There is video violence. Talk to the children and youth of today. If \nyou have not gotten on the Internet lately and flipped to video \nviolence, you should do it. It will amaze you. What you see will \nabsolutely scare you. They are exposed to horrific things, which I can \nnever imagine from my childhood. Don't you think we should have the \npeople who are the first defenders of the first amendment come and talk \nto us about how we can change the culture of violence in our society? \nThat is what we are talking about.\n  I have heard a lot of my colleagues on different talk shows saying \nthey didn't like this or we should be doing that. My good friend \nSenator Pat Toomey and I are going to go through this bill and explain \nwhat it does and what it doesn't do and how we can move the ball \nforward by keeping society safe, treating law-abiding gun owners with \nthe respect they should have and make sure criminals or the mentally \ninsane who have been found to be so by court cannot buy a gun.\n  So if someone is a law-abiding gun owner, they are going to like this \nbill. If someone is a believer in the second amendment right of \nAmericans to bear arms, they are going to like this bill. If someone is \na defender of the rights of our military veterans, they are definitely \ngoing to like this bill. If someone is looking for ways to keep our \ncitizens safe from mass violence, especially our precious children, \nthey are going to like this bill. For those criminals or persons who \nhave been declared mentally insane by the courts, they are not going to \nlike this bill, and that is exactly what we have tried to do.\n  I want to go through much of this, but I want to give my friend \nSenator Pat Toomey an opportunity. I appreciate his input so much. We \nare sister States, West Virginia and Pennsylvania--especially western \nPennsylvania. My family and I grew up in Farmington and Fairmont and \nnorthern West Virginia, which is an hour and a half below Pennsylvania. \nWe have the same slangs and sayings. We say ``you'ns'' instead of you \nall or you. Pat and I understand each other.\n  I would like Senator Toomey to explain the part that is so near and \ndear to him as well as to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I cannot tell you how much I appreciate the Senator from \nWest Virginia. The work we have done together has been challenging and \nconstructive. I think we have come to a\n\n[[Page S2638]]\n\nvery sensible legislative product--something I can be proud of. I want \nto thank Senator Kirk for the work he did on this from way back, and \nSenator Schumer's contribution to this process as well.\n  I wish to start, if I could, with some thoughts about the second \namendment and what it means to me and why I think a proper \nunderstanding is so important in this discussion.\n  Sometimes it is useful to go to the source, and so, as a reminder--\nnot that we are not familiar with it--I am going to read from my pocket \nversion of the Constitution the second amendment to the Constitution, \nwhich simply says:\n\n       A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security \n     of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear \n     Arms, shall not be infringed.\n\n  Today, we often think that the second amendment is about sportsmen, \nit is about hunting. That is an important part of it. But the second \namendment is actually much more profound than a protection for hunters. \nIt is more fundamental to our country and who we are as a people.\n  In my view, the Framers, in writing the second amendment, were \nrecognizing our natural rights, our natural law rights of self-defense \nand self-preservation. In fact, those rights precede the Constitution. \nThey were acknowledging and recognizing those rights in the \nConstitution. They did not create them.\n  I would also suggest that the second amendment is about sovereignty. \nWho is sovereign in this country? Is it the government? Is it the head \nof state or is it the people? I think, as we know, this whole great \nexperiment of ours that is America is an exercise in recognizing the \nsovereignty of the individual people. And a sovereign people, it flows \nlogically, ought to have the right to bear arms, to protect themselves.\n  Ultimately, our Founders intended the second amendment to be the \nmeans by which we would maintain our liberty and prevent tyranny. We \noften take things for granted in a democratic society in which we get \nto select our own government and our constitutionally protected rights \nare respected. But we all know that around the world and in the recent \npast there have been appalling cases where tyranny has destroyed the \nrights of relatively free peoples who in many ways have come from \nsocieties not terribly dissimilar to ours.\n  So these are some of the thoughts that occur to me when I think about \nthe second amendment, why it is so important to me. I see it as a very \nimportant part of our very identity as a Nation and as a people. It is \nwhy it is very important to me personally.\n  In addition to being a gun owner and someone who has always respected \nthese rights, it has a very important philosophical underpinning for \nme.\n  For years, of course, we had many contentious debates. One of the \ncontentious debates we had about the second amendment for many years \nprobably arose from the first phrase about the ``well regulated \nMilitia.'' The debate centered around whether this right, this second \namendment right--that, obviously, is enshrined in the Constitution--was \na collective right that depended on one's membership in a militia or if \nit were an individual right belonging to individual people.\n  It was always clear to me this is an individual right. It is clear to \nme for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is the Founders \nnever recognized the idea of collective rights. For them, it was all \nabout individual rights. But, fortunately, our judicial system put an \nend to that question when a conservative majority of U.S. Supreme Court \nJustices reached the Heller decision. In District of Columbia v. Heller \nthey made it very clear this is not a collective right, this is not \ncontingent upon membership in a militia. The second amendment is an \nindividual right that applies to individual Americans. And I \nwholeheartedly agree.\n  Not too long after that, in the McDonald et al. v. City of Chicago \ndecision, the Court went even further in a way in upholding the Heller \ndecision and referencing that. It affirmed that decision, but it went \nfarther and said this second amendment right is so important and so \nfundamental and so basic that it is binding on States and local \ngovernments as well. So not only can the Federal Government not \ninfringe upon second amendment rights, but neither can a State or a \nlocal government. So that is a pretty impressive conclusion that our \nCourt has come to in resolving a big part of this contentious debate.\n  I would pose a question the Court has also addressed, and that is, is \nthis a right that is enjoyed by all of the people of America? In my \nopinion--and I think this is not controversial--the answer to that \nquestion is no. Young children are not expected to be afforded the same \nsecond amendment rights as adults. Criminals who have been convicted of \ncrimes have foregone many of their rights, including second amendment \nrights, by virtue of their conviction of serious crimes. And \ndangerously mentally ill people are people whom we as a society have \nevery right to protect ourselves from, and so they do not have the same \nsecond amendment rights everyone else has.\n  Now, I would argue, to our Founders this was a given. After all, this \nwas a time when capital punishment was quite common and they fully \naccepted capital punishment. How perverse and absurd would the idea be \nthat someone who was subject to capital punishment would somehow be \nable to enjoy second amendment rights? Of course not. It is obvious \ncriminals forego that right.\n  The Heller decision, the recent Supreme Court decision I referred to, \naddresses this as well. Justice Scalia observed:\n       Nothing in our opinion--\n\n  That is the Heller opinion affirming the individual right of the \nsecond amendment--He says:\n\n       Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on \n     long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by \n     felons and the mentally ill . . . or laws imposing conditions \n     and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\n\n  It seems to me that is a very explicit explanation that it is not an \ninfringement on second amendment rights to attempt to keep firearms out \nof the hands of criminals and mentally ill people.\n  So if the Founders were in agreement on this, and the Supreme Court \nis in agreement, and we have laws in all 50 States that make it illegal \nfor certain criminals and mentally ill people to have firearms, the \nquestion is: Are we willing to take modest measures to try to achieve \nthis goal that I think we all share and that is clearly consistent with \nour Constitution?\n  That is what Senator Manchin and Senator Kirk and I are trying to do \nhere today. What we are trying to do is make it a little bit more \ndifficult for the people who are not supposed to have firearms in the \nfirst place to obtain them. I think Senator Manchin will agree with me \nthere is no panacea here, there is no law anyone could write--certainly \nnot this one--that is ever going to guarantee that a determined \ncriminal will not be able to obtain a weapon one way or another or that \nmaybe even a mentally ill person may not be able to obtain a weapon \neventually if they are sufficiently determined. But can't we take a \nvery modest step to make it more difficult, if we can do it in a way \nthat does not infringe on the second amendment rights of law-abiding \ncitizens whose rights we want to defend?\n  So I think of our bill as doing three broad things. And Senator \nManchin and I will walk through some of the specifics of how we achieve \nthis. But I would suggest one way to think about it is three \ncategories.\n  One is, we simply encourage greater compliance with the background \ncheck system we have in place now. We are not inventing a new one. We \nare not inventing new criteria for it. But the fact is, the \nparticipation in the background check system by the various States--you \nsee, we rely on the States to provide information about the people who \nhave been adjudicated as mentally dangerous, the people who have been \nadjudicated as criminals. They have been convicted. The Federal \ngovernment does not have that information. We rely on the States to \nprovide it. What we do in this bill is create greater incentives for \nthe States to, in fact, participate because the participation varies \ndramatically.\n  A second thing we do is expand background checks to gun sales at gun \nshows and over the Internet. Again, this is not a new system. We are \njust applying this background check to a category that has not been \nsubject to it, but it is the existing system.\n\n[[Page S2639]]\n\n  Then the third thing is--and we will talk about this at a little \nlength, I hope--we have a number of measures in this bill that, \nfrankly, I think are overdue and they enhance the opportunity for law-\nabiding citizens to simply exercise the second amendment rights they \nought to be able to exercise.\n  I think Senator Manchin put this very well. If you are a law-abiding \ncitizen who enjoys exercising second amendment rights, you are going to \nlike this bill. It is going to enhance your ability to exercise those \nrights that you have. If you are a criminal, and you want to get a \nweapon illegally, you probably are not going to like this bill because \nit is going to make it a little harder for you to do that. It will also \nmake it harder for someone who is mentally ill.\n  I am going to yield back for my friend, the Senator from West \nVirginia. But before I do that, I want to make one simple point about \nhow tangible and how real and how important this can be. I am referring \nto enhancing compliance with the NICS background check system.\n  We all remember the Virginia Tech shootings. One of the aspects of \nthis tragedy is that the shooter's ability to obtain a weapon might \nhave been prevented. I say that because the young man, Seung-Hui Cho, \nhad already been adjudicated to be mentally ill, dangerously so, by a \nVirginia judge. They had discovered this. They had figured this out. \nThey knew this was a very unstable and very dangerous man. But the \nState of Virginia never passed that information on. So there was no \ninformation about this man in the national background check system when \nwho knows whatever demons possessed him to go out and obtain guns so he \ncould wreak the havoc he did. He went and submitted himself to a \nbackground check, and he passed with flying colors because the system \ndid not have the data.\n  One of the things Senator Manchin and I are proposing in this \nlegislation is, let's provide greater incentives; and there is a carrot \nand there is a stick and a cost to States so they will be more in \ncompliance.\n  Now, I will be clear: If Virginia had provided this information to \nthe system, then this shooter from Virginia Tech would have been denied \nthat day and we do not know what would have happened after that. It is \npossible he would have found some other way to obtain weapons. But \nthink of all the other things that might have happened. If he had been \ndenied at that moment and he had walked out of that store, who knows \nwhat else might have intervened--whether he would have gotten help, \nwhether he would have been stopped some other way. We will never know \nthat. But it seems to me it is a good idea to try to put that block in \nplace, and that is one of the things we would achieve. Our legislation, \nI think, would go a long way over time to encouraging and, in fact, \nrealizing a greater compliance on the part of the various States.\n  Senator Manchin may want to elaborate a little bit on how we achieve \nthat, and then I would continue in this discussion with him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I come from a State where, like most of \nthe rural States in America, there are an awful lot of people who live \na solid life. There is a thing back home that we call a person having \neither common sense or nonsense, and now we think people ought to have \na little gun sense. It just makes sense when we think about what we are \ndoing--not infringing on anybody's rights but protecting those rights--\nby prohibiting those who shouldn't be able to have a firearm through a \ncommercial transaction from getting one.\n  My good friend Senator Toomey was just talking about second amendment \nrights, which all of us hold near and dear if a person comes from a gun \nculture State such as ours. With that being said--I just talked about \ncommon sense and gun sense--one of the largest progun organizations in \nthe country, the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear \nArms, which is strictly for the right to protect the second amendment, \nhas come out in total support of this legislation--total support. Do my \ncolleagues know why? Because they read the bill. That is all we are \nasking. They read the bill.\n  A lot of our colleagues have been told certain things. We have a lot \nof friends in different gun organizations who have been told different \nthings. All Senator Toomey and I ask is to take the time and read the \nbill.\n  We started out working this bill from so many different angles. \nEverybody had a part in this. What we tried to do was find something \nthat would make a difference.\n  I want my colleagues to think about this: Most of our colleagues have \nbeen visited by those unbelievable families from Newtown. I can't even \nimagine--I really can't, I still cannot--I know the Presiding Officer \nprobably saw the clips when I lost control of my emotions, but I am a \ngrandfather, I am a father, and I can only imagine what these families \nare going through.\n  Let me put my colleagues in that state of mind, of losing a child in \nsuch a tragic way. A child goes to school. A parent would never expect \nthat child not to come home from school--one of the most sacred places \nwe have--but it happens. How would my colleagues feel? What state of \nmind would they be in? Let me tell my colleagues their state of mind. \nTo a person, each one of these family members came in and said: We \ndon't want to take anybody's guns away. We don't want to ban any \nweapons. We don't want to infringe on people's second amendment right.\n  On top of that, they said: We really know and realize the bill the \nSenate is working on right now would not have saved our beautiful \nlittle children. But what we are asking the Senate to do is maybe save \nanother family, just maybe prevent another family from going through \nwhat we went through.\n  We need to think about that. I wish I could be that strong. I said \nthat if 100 of us in this body had 1 ounce of the courage those family \nmembers have, oh, my goodness, what a body we would have. If we weren't \nworried about all of the outside pressure and maybe getting elected, \nmaybe getting the campaign funds it would take for us to go out and get \nelected, if we worried about basically keeping a gun out of the hands \nof a criminal in a commercial transaction--a criminal who has gone \nthrough a court system and has been found guilty--or out of the hands \nof a mentally insane person who has gone through a court and found to \nbe unfit, just maybe we could save one life.\n  Someone says: Well, why would the Senate take this on? I don't know \nwhy else we were sent here other than to try to make a difference. The \neasiest vote I can make while I am a Senator is no. I can vote no on \nabout everything and be fine. I can go home and people won't say: Why \ndid you do that?\n  I am glad you voted that way because I don't like that either.\n  Do my colleagues follow me? ``No'' is the safest vote as a \nCongressperson or a Senator. I understand that.\n  It is wonderful, I guess, to have the title of ``Senator.'' It is a \ngreat honor to be in this unbelievable body with these truly \nmagnificent people. I want to make a difference. I want to do \nsomething, and I think most of my colleagues do as well.\n  The only thing I am asking of my colleagues who have been told \nsomething or have heard something or have gotten pressured phone calls \nand letters is to read the bill. Just read it. It is only 49 pages. \nWhen have we had something that could change the course of our country \nand it is only 49 pages long? I have seen bills that were 1,000 pages, \n500 pages, amendments that were 300 pages. We have an entire bill that \nis 49 pages. That is all we have asked for. That is all.\n  My dear friend Senator Toomey and I are going to be on the floor for \nquite some time. Tomorrow we will probably be joined by our other good \nfriends, Senator Kirk and Senator Schumer. Everybody has come together. \nSenator Schumer started with a piece for the bill, and I said: My dear \nfriend Chuck, I can't support that.\n  He said: Can I work with you?\n  I said: I would love for you to work with me.\n  My dear friend Mark Kirk from Illinois has been steadfast and rock \nsolid. He has been right there.\n  This is bipartisan. Bipartisan--is it Democratic and Republican? This \nis America. I don't want to say it is bipartisan. This is America. This \nis about whether we can make a difference. Can we change something? Can\n\n[[Page S2640]]\n\nwe have the influence of people who are basically the most unselfish, \nstrongest, bravest people I have ever met, including the families of \nthe Newtown children, to be able to come and say: Listen, I want to \nprotect the rights of law-abiding citizens. I want people to have their \nrights. I want people to enjoy their guns. I want people to enjoy their \nhunting trips with their families. I want people to enjoy all the \nthings the second amendment gives us. But I want to protect another \nfamily, protect another child, protect another person in America.\n  That is all we are trying to do.\n  As we look through the bill, there are so many different things we \nhave talked about. I have heard people say: Oh, my goodness, they are \ngoing to start registering, and they are going to give all of those \nrecords to some big fancy computer that is going to know exactly where \nto come and get the gun of the Presiding Officer.\n  Not only does the law prohibit that today, this bill--when we pass \nthis bill, this law will basically say: If any government agency \nintends to do that and abuse that record the law-abiding firearm dealer \nis supposed to keep--and only them--it will not only be a felony, it \nwill entail 15 years of imprisonment. That is why we have these \norganizations basically joining in after looking at and reading the \nbill and saying: My goodness, this is really protecting second \namendment rights.\n  So it is an emotional bill. It is an emotional time in our country, \nbut truly it is a time for us to come together. It truly is. There is \nhealing that must go on, and this bill will help that healing.\n  We want to talk about this, and we are going to go into it detail by \ndetail, step by step.\n  I thank my good friend Senator Pat Toomey from Pennsylvania, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I think it might be useful to discuss some \nof the specific ways in which this legislation would enhance the \ncompliance and the participation on the part of our 50 States with this \nexisting background check system.\n  As Senator Manchin said--as we both said--we are not creating a new \nsystem. We are not creating a new set of rules by which the system \noperates. What we are simply asking is that since States already have \ninformation about people who are criminals and people who are \ndangerously mentally ill, we want them to put that in the database so \nwe can discover when someone attempts to buy a firearm.\n  By the way----\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, if my friend will yield, if I may, I \nwould like to mention that we also discussed including an incentive so \nsomeone can't say that is an unfunded mandate. That provision is not an \nunfunded mandate, I say to my colleague.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I also wish to mention one of the very typical categories \nof mental illness we want to capture, and that is people who have been \npublicly adjudicated. So that would be people who have pleaded not \nguilty to a crime by reason of insanity. That strikes me as a pretty \ngood definition of somebody who is mentally ill. And someone who is \ndeemed not competent to stand trial by virtue of their mental \ndeficiency would be another category.\n  But the idea is that we have a series of specific measures that would \nencourage greater compliance. There is a carrot-and-stick approach. We \nwould authorize some funding. It would have to live within the spending \ncaps we have already agreed to, the overall spending caps, but we \nauthorize funding for grants that States can use to carry out, first of \nall, an assessment of the extent to which they are or are not currently \nin compliance. As I said, some States are probably doing virtually all \nthey can and other States are doing almost nothing in terms of \nproviding the information they have to this database system, and they \ncan start with an assessment of that.\n  We would then ask them to submit a 4-year plan by which they would \ndevelop full compliance or as full as they can achieve in 4 years. They \nwork this out with the Attorney General. There will be benchmarks along \nthe way. They would have a series of steps they would take by which \nthey would start to turn over this information they already have about \npeople who are criminals and people who are mentally ill.\n  If a State refuses to develop such a plan or to achieve the \nbenchmarks they set out in their own plan, then we propose they have a \npenalty and they would lose some funding. That is the mechanism by \nwhich we have an inducement, an incentive for these States. They could \nlose up to 15 percent of what is known as the Byrne/JAG funding, which \nis funding Congress annually makes available to States for fighting \ncrime.\n  So I believe this is a sensible combination of measures to simply \nencourage States to participate as they should.\n  If the Senator from West Virginia has anything more to say about the \nNICS improvement piece of this, I will certainly yield. If not, I want \nto mention a reason why I feel strongly about expanding the background \nchecks. But at this point I yield for the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I thank the good Senator from Pennsylvania. I appreciate \nthat. I think what he said is spot-on. He is basically saying it \npreserves important exemptions of background checks that are in current \nlaw, such as the temporary transfers. That way, for example, a person \ncan lend their hunting rifle. We are hearing all of those misnomers, \nsuch as that people can't even lend their hunting rifle to a friend or \na family member. People can do that. We are not preventing that. There \nare no restrictions in those circumstances. Also under current law are \ntransfers between families, friends, and neighbors, which we have \nalready talked about. That can be done. That is not what we are talking \nabout. Again, it is just common sense.\n  As I said, the Senator from Pennsylvania, as well as our other \ncolleagues, Senator Kirk and Senator Schumer, and I have been talking \nback and forth about this. This is not a bill written by just Senators. \nWe have had input from the outside. We have included people from all \ndifferent walks of life. We would then proceed to do a little research \nto find out if what they suggested made sense and if it had been done \nand if it hadn't, whether an infringement occurred to a person who has \nnot been able to enjoy their rights as a law-abiding citizen. We did \nall of that.\n  I appreciate so much the Senator from Pennsylvania pointing out those \nissues, and we will talk more about it later.\n  I yield for the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, the last point I wish to make is something \nabout the NICS system that I should have mentioned; that is, currently \nthere are States in which someone can be adjudicated as mentally ill, \nfor instance, but that person is left with very few options to \nchallenge that status. That is the current situation. We remedy that. \nOne of the things we require in this bill, in the 4-year plan States \nhave to develop, is that it has to include a program, a mechanism by \nwhich a person who feels they have been wrongly designated as someone \nwho can't own a firearm by virtue of their criminal background or their \nmental health would have an opportunity to challenge that, as they \nshould. There ought to be a process they can go through to challenge \nthat finding so that nobody who doesn't belong on this list ends up on \nthis list.\n  Let me move on to the background checks at gun shows. I am going to \nintroduce this by reading a letter I received from a constituent \nyesterday. This happens to be a woman whom I know very well. I have \nknown her for years. She is a conservative Republican, as it happens. \nShe is a second amendment gun owner. Let me read what she wrote:\n\n       Hello, Pat. I just had to write after watching your \n     leadership with this very difficult issue. I very much \n     understand what you are doing with the gun show checks and \n     appreciate your dealing with this. This issue is very \n     personal to me and if you will indulge me, I will tell you.\n\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       I'm a very strong supporter of the second amendment. I'm \n     the gun owner in my house. I do shoot. My father very proudly \n     passed down his Remington 1100 to me several years before he \n     passed away. He presented it to me with great pride. I \n     accepted it as a very special moment between us. Meanwhile, \n     Pat, I\n\n[[Page S2641]]\n\n     have an adopted daughter who has had emotional troubles her \n     entire life. Much of our journey with her has been difficult \n     and it continues to this day. My daughter has been \n     involuntarily committed twice, and I unfortunately believe \n     that it won't be the last time, as she refuses to get proper \n     treatment. I was the one who had to sign her paperwork the \n     first time. And it was made clear to me that I would be \n     taking away her right to own a gun. I knew that we had no \n     choice but to try and get her some help. But my hands shook \n     and I had to pause quite a long time over that document, \n     because I so strongly believe in our second amendment rights. \n     Nevertheless, I signed it and I would do it again today.\n       At various times, people have been concerned for our safety \n     with the volatile nature of my daughter's problems. The idea \n     that she would be able to purchase a weapon openly in a \n     public venue is not acceptable. I do not believe that she \n     actually would, but I don't find any comfort in the fact that \n     she could have an avenue if she so chose. Once again, I \n     cannot emphasize the importance of the second amendment to me \n     enough. Pat, I thank you for your efforts in D.C. and bless \n     you for all that you're doing. Be well and be strong.\n\n  I think that says a lot about what we are trying to accomplish. Here \nwe have a passionate supporter of the second amendment, a gun owner, \nsomeone who has always been a believer in the second amendment. For \nreasons that she has explained very personally, very important reasons, \nshe does not want her daughter to be able to go into a gun show and buy \na firearm without so much as a background check.\n  Since the mom has the recognition of her daughter's problems, if the \ninformation is provided and if that State complies--in this case it is \nmy State of Pennsylvania--with this background check system, then \nsomeone in the circumstances of her daughter attempting to buy a weapon \nat a gun show would be denied.\n  I think that is the outcome we all want. It is certainly the outcome \nher own mother wants, who loves her dearly and loves the second \namendment.\n  I would yield back to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I think we all have letters such as \nSenator Toomey read right now and people looking for what we call gun \nsense, which goes right along with common sense. There is so much out \nthere about the bill. Let me just reiterate a couple of things the bill \ndoes not do.\n  What the bill will not do: The bill will not in any way, shape, or \nform infringe upon anyone's second amendment right to keep and bear \narms. In fact, it strengthens that, as Senator Toomey has so eloquently \ndescribed.\n  The bill will not take away anyone's guns. Nobody will have their \nguns taken away. The bill will not ban any type of a firearm. It is not \neven in the bill. We are not banning anything. The bill will not ban or \nrestrict the use of any kind of bullet or any size of clip. It is not \nin this legislation.\n  The bill will not create a national registry, which we just spoke \nabout. In fact, it explicitly prohibits that, which would give the \npenalties of a felony and a 15-year sentence. As we talk about this \nbill, we are asking our colleagues to come down and bring their \nquestions, concerns, or what they believe and what they have seen in \ntalking to their constituents.\n  Right now I am very pleased to have with me a colleague of mine from \nthe Big Sky State of Montana. He comes from gun culture like myself and \nSenator Toomey. I yield to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senators from \nWest Virginia and Pennsylvania. I rise to talk about the Toomey-Manchin \namendment, knowing this is not an end-all when it comes to violence in \nAmerica.\n  We have to do some things that revolve around mental health, mental \nillness, how we treat that, how we move forward in ways that make sense \nfor folks who believe strongly in the second amendment, but also \nbelieve in how we make our communities safer. So whether it is the \nToomey-Manchin amendment or whether it is some other amendment that may \ncame up during this debate, or whether it is an amendment that deals \nwith mental health and how we treat it and how we get professionals out \nthere on the ground, this is a very important issue for folks in this \ncountry.\n  The second amendment is very important. I now want to give a little \nbit of background, which most of the Senators know. I come from a \nfarming background. My grandparents came to our farm a little over 100 \nyears ago. When my folks took the place over, my dad set up a custom \nbutcher shop. For 20 years my wife Sharla and I ran that custom butcher \nshop. That means every morning, literally every morning, I would get up \nand we would go knock down a beef or a pork with a gun.\n  I literally made a good portion of my living on the farm with a gun. \nIt was a tool. It was a way that kept us on the farm. It was a way that \nkept our farm economically viable. But you do not have to be a butcher \nto know the value of a gun. In Montana, we have sports men and women \nwho literally start hunting at a very early age and know how to handle \na gun. They know responsible gun ownership when they see it. They know \nirresponsible gun ownership when they see that too.\n  Right now, anybody can go out and buy a gun. In some States where the \nnational instant crime background check is not very good, literally \nanybody, whether they have a criminal record or history of violent \nmental illness, can go out and buy a gun. I think what we are trying to \ndo, what Senators Manchin and Toomey are trying to do with this \namendment is to make the second amendment stronger for the people who \nare law-abiding gun owners but yet trying to keep guns out of the hands \nof folks who cannot handle them in a responsible way, and have a record \nof that--a court-adjudicated record.\n  As we move forward and talk about the things this bill does \npositively and negatively, I want to tell you, I have read it forwards \nand backwards. I have talked to folks. I can tell you this makes my \nsecond amendment rights stronger. For that I thank you.\n  Here is how it does it: My second amendment rights are only put at \nrisk by people who use guns in an improper way. This bipartisan \nagreement makes sure we protect that second amendment for responsible \ngun owners, not just in a willy-nilly way, by the way. This clearly \ndefines what irresponsible gun ownership is. It fixes the underlying \nbill that, quite frankly, I moved to move forward on. But without this \namendment I could not support it.\n\n  It does some positive things like lets gun dealers sell firearms \nacross State lines at gun shows. That is new. It improves the process \nby which someone can get their rights restored. This is a big one for \nme. We have veterans returning from Iran and Afghanistan, by the way, \nwho need treatment, can go get treatment. This bill does not impact \nthem whatsoever.\n  On the other hand, if somebody has a serious problem, gets put on a \nlist, they have the ability through this law to be able to get off that \nlist once they prove they can handle that gun ownership responsibly. \nThere has been a lot of talk about gun registries. This bill prohibits \nit from the Department of Justice. The way the world is right now I \nthink it is fair to say nothing changes: No gun registry now. No gun \nregistry after this amendment is passed. In fact, this strictly \nprohibits it when it comes to the Department of Justice.\n  There are protections in here for veterans to make sure they are \ntreated fairly by the system. I serve on the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee. Montana has the second most per capita number of veterans in \nthe country. It is important--it was true in Vietnam, but especially \nwith Iraq and Afghanistan--that these folks are able to get the \ntreatment they need without impacting their second amendment rights. I \nthink we are clear on that. It does not impact them in a negative way.\n  If you want to give a gun to your son or daughter or you want to sell \nit to your neighbors or friends, there is no background check required. \nActive military can buy a gun in their home State or the station where \nthey are, not just their duty station. It allows for a concealed carry \npermit to be used in lieu of a background check. But the bottom line is \nit does not impact my second amendment rights whatsoever.\n  I was on the tractor this weekend seeding a few peas and a little bit \nof barley. On the radio came a show called ``Tradio,'' where if you \nhave something you want to sell, you put it on the radio. One of the \nthings that was being sold was a .308 rifle. Under this bill, if I put \na .308 rifle on the radio, and Patrick Toomey calls me and says he \nwants to buy that gun, I\n\n[[Page S2642]]\n\ncan. Patrick Toomey is a friend of mine. We can sell it; no background \ncheck.\n  But if someone I do not know calls, then we whip down to the local \nstore, do a quick background check, which takes--well, I will ask \nSenator Manchin from West Virginia. How long does a background check \ntypically take on an individual buying a gun?\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I would say that more than 90 percent of the background \nchecks in America that are done are less than 3 minutes, and probably \neven no more than a minute and a half. So in that range. That tells you \nabout how quick it can be done.\n  Mr. TESTER. Exactly. So you zip down to the local gun store, wherever \nit might be in your town, do the background check. Then you do not have \nto worry about if, in fact, that person has a criminal past or is \nseverely, violently mentally ill. It will be there. There is also \nlanguage in this bill that if a State is not putting information in the \nNational Instant Criminal Background Check System, money is pulled \nback.\n  In the State of Montana, I believe it is about 10 percent. In the \nState of Montana, that is serious dollars. It is well over $100,000 to \nbe pulled back.\n  Would the Senator from West Virginia like to talk about the thinking \nthat went into that and how this could impact the background checks?\n  Mr. MANCHIN. All of the Members who worked on the bill, Senators \nToomey, Kirk, and Schumer, all of us got together on that. There had to \nbe--basically, one of our largest gun organizations brought us to task \nsaying: We supported background checks 10 or more years ago. It just \ndid not work.\n  You know what. They were right. So we said: Fine. Do you throw the \nbaby out with the bathwater or do you change the water and make it a \nlittle bit better?\n  So we went back and looked at it. We said: Fine. We did not want any \nunfunded mandates. We put $100 million a year for 4 years for the \nStates to have grants to get them up and running to where they should \nbe. So there is an incentive. We also said: If you do not do your job \nand you do not turn your records over of your adjudicated criminals or \nmental illness records, then 10 percent the first year, 11 percent--\nthen I think it goes to 13 and up to 15. That is off of the Byrne/JAG \nmoney. Every State depends on that Byrne/JAG money. That is serious. No \none else has ever put that in there.\n  You know what. That concern came from the gun organizations right \nnow, one of them who is not supporting it and should be.\n  Mr. TESTER. Well, the bottom line is, I think this puts into effect \nreal incentives to keep this National Instant Criminal Background Check \nSystem database up to snuff.\n  There is also a Commission on Mass Violence in this bill, which I \nthink is good policy as we move forward, as we find almost on a daily \nbasis some incident which has happened and is unacceptable.\n  The bottom line--and I know the Senator has talked about this a lot \nduring the presentation of his bill. He has spoken about something \ncalled common sense. This would ensure when we do a background check it \nactually is a background check. This bill will not solve all the \nviolence problems in this country, not even close. Is it a step in the \nright direction while protecting my second amendment rights? Yes, it \nis.\n  Does it take away my guns? Does it stop my ability to go out and buy \nany guns I could buy today? No, it does not.\n  Does it have any impact on things like assault rifles or big, large \nmagazine clips? No, it does not.\n  What it does is once the National Instant Criminal Background Check \nSystem is up to snuff, it will contain people who have a history of \nviolence who used guns improperly. It will prevent people who are \nviolently mentally ill from going out there and purchasing a gun.\n  If we are able to work together in a bipartisan way, as the Senator \nfrom West Virginia and the Senator from Pennsylvania have done, \nhopefully, we may move forward with some issues and policies which deal \nwith mental health in this country, an issue we have not dealt with \nwell as a society, or the stigma associated with it. If we can do this \nthere are other amendments we may potentially put on this bill as we \nmove forward.\n  If the amendments have commonsense backing and protect the second \namendment, we should take a hard look at them and have a debate on \nthose also. The bottom line is I want my second amendment rights \nprotected. I want law-abiding citizens in this country to be able to \ncontinue to purchase firearms. I want my kids to be able to do that, my \ngrandkids to be able to do that. I think this bill ensures that. I \nthank the sponsors for their hard work.\n  I yield for the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I wish to thank my good friend, the Senator from \nMontana. I know how many calls he has received and the pressure. I know \nthis because of all of the misconceptions and untruths. He did \nsomething we are asking all of our colleagues to do. He read the bill \nand found out for himself this bill does exactly what we have been \ntrying to do for a long time: most importantly, protect the innocent \nand our people by keeping guns away from people and children who \nshouldn't have them. He read the bill. This is all we have asked for.\n  I yield for my friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Toomey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. The Senator makes a point which may seem basic. This bill \nhas been available online since Thursday night. It is available now and \nin every detail. It is available in summary form and available in any \nway people choose to look at it.\n  The Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, one of \nthe pro second amendment rights groups which endorses this bill, \nstates:\n\n       If you read the Manchin-Toomey substitute amendment, you \n     can see all the advances for our cause, that it contains.\n\n  This ``cause'' refers to defense of the second amendment, which it \ncontains.\n  The bottom line is, as the Senator from Montana pointed out, our \namendment isn't gun control. This is very clear, and I think it is an \nimportant contrast. There are other Members of this body who are not \nhappy with this bill because they want active, aggressive gun control. \nFor instance, they want to ban various categories of weapons. They wish \nto ban various categories of ammunition. They would like to ban various \nkinds of waiting periods and put other restrictions on law-abiding \ncitizens. This is gun control. Restricting the freedom of law-abiding \ncitizens who have never done anything to harm anyone and restricting \ntheir second amendment rights is gun control. I disagree with it. I \noppose it. I will oppose every such amendment which comes before this \nbody.\n  Trying to keep guns out of the hands of people who aren't legally \nentitled to have them--dangerous people, be they criminals or \ndangerously mentally ill people--that is not gun control; this is \ncommon sense.\n  As I started off my comments, there is no dispute this is not an \ninfringement on the second amendment. Our Founders didn't think so. Our \nSupreme Court Justices didn't think so. The laws in 50 States don't \nmaintain this. It is common sense.\n  I wish to point out another difference in the approach Senator \nManchin and I have taken versus some others in this body have taken. \nOthers have said let's make a universal background check, and then we \nwill think about who to make an exception for. Then they carve out very \nnarrow categories.\n  One of the problems with that, in my view, is we will not imagine \nevery sort of set of circumstances we ought to carve out. We took a \ndifferent approach. We said private transactions generally don't need \nto be subject to this. I am not going to try to imagine every \nconceivable private transaction. We said let's have background checks \non commercial transactions. This is where the big volume of commercial \ntransactions occur and where strangers are buying and selling guns from \neach other. This is why we require the background check at gun shows, \nand we require the background check on Internet sales.\n  The private transaction, whether it is with a family member, friends, \nneighbors or colleagues, if it doesn't happen at a gun show and doesn't \nhappen over the Internet, it is not subject\n\n[[Page S2643]]\n\nto the background check. We thought that would be an unnecessary burden \non people who know each other.\n  Let me just run through quickly some of the ways in which this \nlegislation strengthens the ability of law-abiding citizens to exercise \ntheir second amendment rights. I will do this briefly. The Senator from \nMontana touched on some of these. I ought to start off underscoring \nsomething the Senator from West Virginia mentioned earlier.\n  Not only will this not in any way contribute to any kind of national \nregistry, it is explicitly forbidden. Anybody in the Federal Government \nwho did try to create a Federal registry would become a felon and \nsubject to 15 years in prison. This is point No. 1.\n  One of the problems we have heard from our constituents who are gun \nenthusiasts, which we were able to address in this legislation, is \nclarifying and fixing interstate travel laws such as for sportsmen who \nare traveling long distances. Unfortunately, it happens too frequently \nwhen a sportsman is traveling from one State to another State, perhaps \non a hunting trip or going home for Christmas and wishes to give a \nrelative a gun for a present. He is perfectly, lawfully entitled to own \nthis gun. He is following the rules and regulations in his State. He \npacks the gun appropriately in his vehicle. As he is traveling through \nanother State, he discovers he is not in compliance with the other \nState.\n\n  People have gotten themselves into trouble. They have not done \nanything to harm anybody, they are just traveling into a State which \nhas a whole different regime and doesn't respect the regime of the \nother State.\n  We fixed that by clarifying in the legislation if a person is \ntransiting through a State and in compliance with the laws of their \nhome State, they are OK. We permit interstate handgun sales from \ndealers. We provide--and this is very important; the Senator from \nMontana mentioned this--a legal process for restoring veterans second \namendment rights.\n  We have a problem in this country right now for veterans. They come \nback after serving this country, risking their lives, often sustaining \ninjuries, sustaining trauma. They can go to the VA and have a social \nworker decide they are not able to handle their personal financial \nmatters. This alone puts them on the registry, disqualifies them from \nbeing able to own a firearm legally and be able to purchase one.\n  I think this is outrageous, frankly. This is currently happening \nevery day to veterans. We deal with that. We change the system. Under \nour legislation, this couldn't happen. Before anybody at the VA could \ndesignate a veteran as somebody who can't own a firearm, first they \nwould need to inform the veteran 30 days in advance to give the veteran \nan opportunity to challenge the status. This is only fair. We owe that \nto those men and women who have given so much to us. This is in our \nbill.\n  We also have a policy today where the law of the land forbids an \nActive-Duty military person from buying a gun in his home State. I \ndon't know whose idea this was. It doesn't make any sense to me. This \nis the law. We repeal the policy in this bill to enable a man or woman \nserving in uniform in this country to buy a firearm in their home \nState. We also allow a person who has a concealed carry permit to use \nthe permit as the mechanism by which they are approved for a gun sale. \nThis stands to reason. The concealed carry permit process is itself a \nvery cumbersome and onerous process. In many cases it is very thorough \nand very expensive. If someone passes that they should be fine. We have \nit in this bill as well.\n  I wish to underscore that these are the reasons two of the leading \npro second amendment groups have endorsed this bill. It enhances the \nopportunity of law-abiding citizens to exercise their second amendment \nrights. If someone is a criminal or mentally unqualified to have a \nfirearm, they are not going to like this bill.\n  As I said at the beginning, I feel very strongly about this. It is \nnot gun control to try to keep guns out of the hands of people who are \nnot qualified to have them.\n  I, again, wish to thank the Senator from West Virginia, my friend. I \nappreciate the hard work he has put into this. I appreciate the chance \nto share these thoughts and work with him. We will welcome any \nquestions, comments, ideas or suggestions from our colleagues as we \nwrestle with this bill in the coming days and, hopefully, have a vote \nsoon which will be successful on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I wish to thank Senator Toomey for his hard work, to be \ninvolved, informed, and to bring his expertise to the discussion we \nhave had with our colleagues.\n  As he has been speaking we have been joined by our good friend \nSenator Tester from Montana. Those of us who come from a gun culture \nState can put some of these myths to the side, if you will, and allow \nthe facts to come out.\n  I think the most important thing about speaking today for a while is \nthat we are not creating new law, we are improving old law. This is \nwhat we were sent here to do.\n  My father used to say the only thing that is new in this world is a \npair of eyes. Everything else has been pretty much an improvement of \nwhat someone else has done. This is what we are trying to do. We are \nimproving on a system which needed to be improved.\n  We spoke about the veterans, as Senator Toomey has. I didn't know how \nveterans were treated when they came home. We are in a war which has \nlasted longer than 12 years and counting. There are hundreds of \nthousands of men and women who have put their lives on the line for us \nand come back with challenges. If they have been affected by this war, \nthey are almost afraid to be evaluated because if they are not \nevaluated in a positive way, they could be discriminated against.\n  I think that is wrong unless in a process and procedure they are \nfound to not be competent. We have 150,000 who perhaps were not \nnotified of their rights. We need to make sure they have the appeal \nprocess available to them. When this legislation passes, every veteran \ncoming back going through a court proceeding can say: Wait a minute. I \nwent through a field process, and I think your evaluation is wrong.\n  We can't put them in a system they need to work the rest of their \nlives to undo. I think we owe that to our great veterans in this \ncountry. Again, it comes down to simply reading the bill, not making up \nthings, and listening to organizations that may be using this fear \ntactic as a campaign to raise funds, finances, and money. I don't like \nto say that. I am a proud member of organizations. They do a lot of \ngood and informing and teaching safety to young children. We do a lot \nof things.\n  I had the benefit of growing up in a town with a sportsmen's club \ncalled the Farmington Sportsmen's Club. My father was not a big \nsportsman, but he wanted me to be involved. He worked a lot and didn't \nhave time. These people took me under their wing at a very young time \nand taught me to respect and to use firearms safely. They taught me to \nbe totally responsible, such as when I should put a shell in the gun, \nwhen I should not put in a shell, when I should have it in my case. \nAlso, they taught me when I should carry it in the woods and when I \ncross the fence the gun should be unloaded.\n  All of us have heard of horrific accidents. These are just little \nthings. They ingrained this into me. A lot of these organizations do \ngood deeds. When they put misinformation out, they do a disservice to \nlaw-abiding gun owners and the people who respect the right the second \namendment provides. Senator Toomey has eloquently spoken about this, as \nwell as Senator Tester.\n  This is going to continue for some time, I am understanding, and we \nare going to be talking, Senator Toomey and I. We will be joined by \nother colleagues--Senators Kirk, Schumer, and Tester--and we are \ninviting all of our colleagues to come down. If you have heard \nsomething from a constituent or from an organization, come down and \ntalk to us about it. We will show you in the bill that it doesn't do \nwhat they have said.\n  The biggest thing we have heard is about the registration. It doesn't \ndo that. Not only does it not do it, it even protects you more than you \nare protected today by law. We improve upon it. It doesn't take \nanybody's guns away. I think Senator Toomey talked about basically \nthere are things he wouldn't vote for, nor would I. But\n\n[[Page S2644]]\n\nguess what. That is not in this bill. There will be other bills, other \namendments, that all colleagues will have a chance to either support, \nif they are for more gun support, or oppose.\n  What we are saying is, this is one piece of legislation we know will \nmake a difference by keeping guns out of the hands of those who have \nbeen adjudicated through a mental court system or a criminal court \nsystem. And we know about commercial transactions--people have used all \ndifferent types of figures as to how many guns basically are \ntransferred at a gun show or online. With the expansion of the Internet \nthere are going to be more and more. All we are saying is that is the \nleast personal of all transactions--on the Internet. I might not know \nyou, Mr. President, but up in your beautiful State of Maine I may see \nsomething you have that I would like, and with the technology of this \nmodern world today to make contact, hopefully, I would be able to \npurchase that. That is something I could never have done 20, 30, or 40 \nyears ago. But I want to make sure also that gun is sent to a licensed \ndealer who depends on his livelihood by abiding by the law and making \nsure a background check is done on me before I can purchase or pick up \nthat gun I bought from you. That only makes common sense.\n  I have heard a lot of things such as: Well, they can be charging a \nlot. Fees can be charged. We allow the person who is going to be doing \nthat service for you to charge a fee. Let me tell you, as a \nbusinessperson, every one of us in business, especially retailers, \nknows exactly the value of every customer who walks through a door. You \nmight say: Well, they are just shopping. My grandfather says: There is \nno such thing as a shopper. They are all buyers. They just don't know \nit yet. They are going to buy something. They walk through the store \nand they have a value. And if they have a value, you know what is going \nto happen? You are going to see people advertising: Please come and let \nus do your background check free for you. That is a service we want to \ngive you. We want you to be right and make sure the right person gets \nit. And guess what. They might be buying something else. They might buy \nnew boots or some camouflage gear for their son or buy their daughter a \nnew outfit.\n  That is marketing. That is business. That is what it is all about. So \ndon't let the naysayers say: Oh no, too much of a burden. Trust me, the \nmarkets have a unique ability to correct themselves and take advantage \nof a situation. As a retailer, when a customer--a buyer, not a \nshopper--comes through the door, we will sell them something. I know \nthat.\n  So we are going to be happy to talk about this bill for a few days \nhere. We want to invite all our colleagues down. We will be announcing \nthe times we will be coming to the floor. In the meantime, to all of my \ncolleagues, to all who have been hearing all of these things and \ngetting excited about we are going to do something to take your guns \naway or take your rights away or register you, that is false. That is a \nbaldfaced falsehood. All we are saying is go online and read the bill. \nIt is only 49 pages. We have even broken it down for you. If colleagues \nwill do that, and bring those conversations to the floor, that is all \nwe can ask. The facts will set you free. The facts will set you free.\n  We have worked hard. Our staffs have worked exceedingly hard. And I \nappreciate everybody--my good friend Senator Toomey, my good friend \nSenator Tester, and the other Senators; Senator Kirk from Illinois and \nSenator Schumer from New York--who has worked so hard to find a \nbalance. It takes us all, from the right and the left, from both sides \nof the aisle--Republicans, Democrats, and Independents--to work \ntogether to make this an American bill. It is not just bipartisan, it \nis for our country. It is to save children, it is to keep our society \nsafe, and also to protect the rights of law-abiding citizens and law-\nabiding gun owners such as myself and the Presiding Officer.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/15/senate-section/article/S2644-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Beverly Reid \nO'Connell, of California, to be United States District Judge for the \nCentral District of California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, since the American people first elected \nPresident Obama, Senate Republicans have been engaged in a concerted \neffort to filibuster, obstruct and delay his moderate judicial \nnominees. They have already, during the last 4 years, filibustered more \nof President Obama's moderate judicial nominees than were filibustered \nduring President Bush's entire 8 years--67 percent more, in fact--and \nthere is no dispute that President Bush was engaged in an effort to \npack the courts with ideological extremists.\n  In connection with the wrongheaded filibuster of the nomination of \nCaitlin Halligan, an outstanding nominee to the DC Circuit, I urged \nthem to abandon their misguided efforts that sacrifice outstanding \njudges for purposes of partisan payback. Regrettably, their response \nseems to be to expand their efforts through a ``wholesale filibuster'' \nof nominations to the DC Circuit and a legislative proposal to strip \nthree judgeships from the DC Circuit.\n  I am tempted to suggest that they amend their bill to make it \neffective whenever the next Republican President is elected. I say that \nto point out that they had no concerns with supporting President Bush's \nfour Senate-confirmed nominees to the DC Circuit. Those nominees filled \nthe very vacancies for the 9th, 10th and even the 11th judgeship on the \ncourt that Senate Republicans are demanding be eliminated now that \nPresident Obama has been reelected by the American people. The target \nof this legislation seems apparent when its sponsors emphasize that it \nis designed to take effect immediately and acknowledge that \n``[h]istorically, legislation introduced in the Senate altering the \nnumber of judgeships has most often postponed enactment until the \nbeginning of the next President's term'' but that their legislation \n``does not do this.'' It is just another foray in their concerted \nefforts to block this President from appointing judges to the DC \nCircuit.\n  In its April 5, 2013 letter, the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates, chaired by Chief Justice John Roberts, sent us recommendations \n``based on our current caseload needs.'' They do not recommend \nstripping judgeships from the DC Circuit but state that they should \ncontinue at 11. Four are currently vacant. According to the \nAdministrative Office of U.S. Courts, the caseload per active judge for \nthe DC Circuit has actually increased by 50 percent since 2005, when \nthe Senate confirmed President Bush's nominee to fill the 11th seat on \nthe DC Circuit. When the Senate confirmed Thomas Griffith, President \nBush's nominee to the 11th seat in 2005, the confirmation resulted in \nthere being approximately 119 pending cases per active DC Circuit \njudge. There are currently 188 pending cases for each active judge on \nthe DC Circuit, more than 50 percent higher.\n  Senate Republicans also seek to misuse caseload numbers. The DC \nCircuit Court of Appeals is often considered ``the second most \nimportant court in the land'' because of its special jurisdiction and \nbecause of the important and complex cases that it decides. The court \nreviews complicated decisions\n\n[[Page S2645]]\n\nand rulemaking of many Federal agencies, and in recent years has \nhandled some of the most important terrorism and enemy combatant and \ndetention cases since the attacks of September 11. These cases make \nincredible demands on the time of the judges serving on this court. It \nis misleading to cite statistics and to accuse hardworking judges of \nhaving a light or easy workload. All cases are not the same and many of \nthe hardest, most complex and most time-consuming cases in the Nation \nend up at the DC Circuit.\n  As the former Chief Judge of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals \nexplained again recently, ``The nature of the DC Circuit's caseload is \nwhat sets it apart from other courts.'' She correctly noted in her \nrecent column:\n\n       The DC Circuit hears the most complex, time-consuming, \n     labyrinthine disputes over regulations with the greatest \n     impact on ordinary Americans' lives: clean air and water \n     regulations, nuclear plant safety, health-care reform issues, \n     insider trading and more. These cases can require thousands \n     of hours of preparation by the judges, often consuming days \n     of argument, involving hundreds of parties and interveners, \n     and necessitating dozens of briefs and thousands of pages of \n     record--all of which culminates in lengthy, technically \n     intricate legal opinions.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that article again be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Today, the Senate will vote on only one of the 15 judicial nominees \nready for final action. While I am glad that we are being allowed to \nfill one of the 86 judicial vacancies around the country, I wish we \nwere allowed to make more progress more quickly. After all, there are \n14 judicial nominees voted out of the Judiciary Committee without \nobjection who are currently pending before the Senate. All members of \nthe committee, Republicans and Democrats agreed that they were \nqualified and should be confirmed. Some were held over from last year. \nIndeed, there are still five judicial nominees pending on the Executive \nCalendar who could and should have been confirmed last year.\n  There are currently three times as many judicial nominees on the \nExecutive Calendar as there were at this point in President Bush's \nsecond term. Of course by then the Senate had proceeded to confirm \nalmost two dozen more judges than we have been allowed to proceed to \nconsider. Before Senate Republicans pat themselves on the back too \nhard, they should help us clear the nominees backlogged from last year \nand acknowledge that there was just one judicial nominee confirmed this \nyear whose hearing was held this year. The others were all nominees \nthey needlessly held over for months and who should have been confirmed \nlast year.\n  It is really incomprehensible that so many judgeships were forced to \nremain vacant for so long when there was no actual opposition to these \nconsensus nominees. That is not what Democratic Senators did during the \nBush administration. This is a new and destructive tactic. Despite the \nprogress we have been allowed to make this year, we remain more than 20 \ncircuit and district nominees behind the pace set during President \nBush's administration. Just 183 of President Obama's circuit and \ndistrict nominees have been confirmed, compared to 206 of President \nBush's at the same point, and vacancies today are nearly double what \nthey were in April 2005. We can make up much of that ground if Senate \nRepublicans would just agree to a vote on all 15 nominees currently \npending on the Executive Calendar. All of them received bipartisan \nsupport in committee, and all but one were unanimous. There is no good \nreason for further delay.\n  At this point in President Bush's presidency, when his district \nnominees were reported by the Judiciary Committee, it took, on average, \njust 35 days for them to receive a vote. The comparable average for \nPresident Obama's district court nominees is nearly three times as \nlong, 102 days. This number is has a firm foundation-- arithmetic. It \nis derived simply by adding up the number of days each nominee waited \nand dividing by the number of nominees. That is how an average is \ncalculated.\n  During President Bush's first term alone, 57 district nominees were \nconfirmed within just 1 week of being reported. By contrast, during his \nfirst 4 years only two of President Obama's district nominees have been \nconfirmed within a week of being reported by the Committee. Just before \nthe Thanksgiving recess in 2009, when Senator Sessions of Alabama was \nthe ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, we were able to get \nRepublican agreement to confirm Judge Abdul Kallon, a nominee from \nAlabama, and Judge Christina Reiss, our Chief Judge for the Federal \nDistrict Court for the District of Vermont. They had their hearing on \nNovember 4, were voted on by the Judiciary Committee 2 weeks later on \nNovember 19, and were confirmed by the Senate on November 21. They were \nnot stalled on the Senate Executive Calendar without a vote for weeks \nand months. They were confirmed 2 days after the vote by the Judiciary \nCommittee. That should be the standard we follow, not be the exception. \nIt should not take being from the ranking Republican's home State to be \npromptly confirmed as a noncontroversial judicial nominee.\n  Digging deeper into the numbers, the Congressional Research Service \nhas found that during President Bush's first term, 85 percent of his \ndistrict nominees waited 60 days or fewer for a vote. In President \nObama's first term, 78 percent of his district nominees waited 60 days \nor longer. What these data show is that President Obama's district \nnominees have been facing unprecedented delays. There is an undeniable \npattern of Republican obstruction and delay that has faced district \nnominees during the last four years, a pattern that is without \nprecedent.\n  While these delays and backlogs are without precedent, Republicans \npoint to April 2004 as the one time that there were a number of \nPresident Bush's nominees pending on the floor. Of course back in April \n2004, President Bush had bypassed the Senate and recess appointed two \nindividuals to be circuit judges, while Republican Committee staff \nhacked into a shared server to pilfer Democratic files. Still, we were \nable to clear the backlog that resulted by confirming more than 20 \nconsensus nominees in just 1 month. There is nothing like that to \nexplain the years of backlogged judicial nominees during this \nadministration. In truth, 17 of the judicial nominations for which \nSenate Republicans take credit over the past 2 years should have been \nconfirmed more than 2 years ago in the preceding Congress. They allowed \nonly 60 judicial confirmations to take place during President Obama's \nfirst 2 years in office, the lowest total for a President in over 30 \nyears. This is not a new phenomenon. During President Obama's first \nyear in office, Senate Republicans stalled all but 12 of his circuit \nand district nominees. That was the lowest 1-year confirmation total \nsince the Eisenhower administration, when the Federal bench was barely \none-third the size it is today.\n  The fact is that we have these 15 nominees waiting for a vote. All \nSenate Democrats are prepared to vote on all of them today.\n  Before Republicans take refuge in the number of vacancies without a \nnominee, they should be honest about their slow-walking the President \non recommendations for nominees from their home States. For example, \nthere are 24 emergency vacancies in States represented by Republican \nSenators. Over 40 percent of all judicial emergency vacancies are in \njust 3 States, each of which is represented by 2 Republican Senators. \nThose Senators should be working with the White House to fill those \nvacancies. I encourage Republican Senators to work with this President, \njust as I encouraged Democratic Senators to work with President Bush, \nto find good nominees for those important vacancies and to allow \nqualified nominees to move forward. I take very seriously our \nresponsibilities of both advice and consent on nominations.\n  Today, the Senate is being allowed to confirm Judge Beverly O'Connell \nto a judicial emergency vacancy on the Federal trial court for the \nCentral District of California, one of the busiest courts in the \nNation. She currently serves on the Superior Court for the County of \nLos Angeles in California, where she has served for the last 8 years. \nShe is also currently an Adjunct Professor of Law at Loyola Law School \nand at Pepperdine University School of Law. Prior to becoming a judge, \nshe served in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of \nCalifornia for 10\n\n[[Page S2646]]\n\nyears and worked in private practice as an associate at Morrison & \nFoerster LLP. She received the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary's highest possible rating, unanimously ``well qualified,'' \nand has the support of her home State Senators, Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Boxer. She originally had her hearing last December, was \nunanimously approved by the Judiciary Committee, will be overwhelming \napproved by the Senate, and should and could have been confirmed last \nyear.\n  Finally, last month, I spoke about the damaging effect of \nsequestration on our Federal courts and our system of justice and how \nthese indiscriminate cuts have caused both Federal prosecutors and \nFederal public defenders to be furloughed. The effects have become all \ntoo real as even terrorism prosecutions are being delayed. Chief Judge \nLoretta Preska of the Southern District of New York called these cuts \n``devastating.'' The head of the Federal Defenders Office stated: ``On \na good day, we're stretched thin. . . . Sequestration takes us well \nbeyond the breaking point. You simply can't sequester the Sixth \nAmendment.'' He is right. Sequestration is causing grave harm to our \njudicial system. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of an article \ndated April 8 be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 28, 2013]\n\n               Senate Must Act on Appeals Court Vacancies\n\n                         (By Patricia M. Wald)\n\n       Patricia M. Wald, who is retired, served as a judge on the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1979 to 1999, \n     including five years as chief judge.\n       Pending before the Senate are nominations to fill two of \n     the four vacant judgeships on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n     the District of Columbia Circuit. This court has exclusive \n     jurisdiction over many vital national security challenges and \n     hears the bulk of appeals from the major regulatory agencies \n     of the federal government. Aside from the U.S. Supreme Court, \n     it resolves more constitutional questions involving \n     separation of powers and executive prerogatives than any \n     court in the country.\n       The D.C. Circuit has 11 judgeships but only seven active \n     judges. There is cause for extreme concern that Congress is \n     systematically denying the court the human resources it needs \n     to carry out its weighty mandates.\n       The court's vacancies date to 2005, and it has not received \n     a new appointment since 2006. The number of pending cases per \n     judge has grown from 119 in 2005 to 188 today. A great many \n     of these are not easy cases. The D.C. Circuit hears the most \n     complex, time-consuming, labyrinthine disputes over \n     regulations with the greatest impact on ordinary Americans' \n     lives: clean air and water regulations, nuclear plant safety, \n     healthcare reform issues, insider trading and more. These \n     cases can require thousands of hours of preparation by the \n     judges, often consuming days of argument, involving hundreds \n     of parties and interveners, and necessitating dozens of \n     briefs and thousands of pages of record--all of which \n     culminates in lengthy, technically intricate legal opinions.\n       I served on the D.C. Circuit for more than 20 years and as \n     its chief judge for almost five. My colleagues and I worked \n     as steadily and intensively as judges on other circuits even \n     if they may have heard more cases. The nature of the D.C. \n     Circuit's caseload is what sets it apart from other courts. \n     The U.S. Judicial Conference reviews this caseload \n     periodically and makes recommendations to Congress about the \n     court's structure. In 2009, the conference recommended, based \n     on its review, that the circuit's 12th judgeship be \n     eliminated. This apolitical process is the proper way to \n     determine the circuit's needs, rather than in the more highly \n     charged context of individual confirmations.\n       During my two-decade tenure, 11 active judges were sitting \n     a majority of the time; today, the court has only 64 percent \n     of its authorized active judges. This precipitous decline \n     manifests in the way the court operates. And while the D.C. \n     Circuit has five senior judges, they may opt out of the most \n     complex regulatory cases and do not sit en banc. They also \n     choose the periods during which they will sit, which can \n     affect the randomization of assignment of judges to cases.\n       There is, moreover, a subtle constitutional dynamic at work \n     here: The president nominates and the Senate confirms federal \n     judges for life. While some presidents may not encounter any \n     vacancies during their administration, over time the \n     constitutional schemata ensures that the makeup of courts \n     reflects the choices of changing presidents and the ``advise \n     and consent'' of changing Senates. Since the circuit courts' \n     structure was established in 1948, President Obama is the \n     first president not to have a single judge confirmed to the \n     D.C. Circuit during his first full term. The constitutional \n     system of nomination and confirmation can work only if there \n     is good faith on the part of both the president and the \n     Senate to move qualified nominees along, rather than \n     withholding consent for political reasons. I recall my own \n     difficult confirmation 35 years ago as the first female judge \n     on the circuit; eminent senators such as Barry Goldwater, \n     Thad Cochran and Alan Simpson voted to confirm me regardless \n     of differences in party or general political philosophy.\n       The two D.C. Circuit nominees before the Senate are \n     exceedingly well qualified. Caitlin Halligan served as my law \n     clerk during the 1995-96 term, working on cases involving the \n     Department of Health and Human Services, the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service, the Federal Communications Commission \n     and diverse other topics. She later clerked for Supreme Court \n     Justice Stephen Breyer. She also served as New York solicitor \n     general and general counsel for the Manhattan district \n     attorney's office, as well as being a partner in a major law \n     firm. The other nominee, Sri Srinivasan, has similarly \n     impressive credentials and a reputation that surely merits \n     prompt and serious consideration of his nomination.\n       There is a tradition in the D.C. Circuit of spirited \n     differences among judges on the most important legal issues \n     of our time. My experience, however, was that deliberations \n     generally focused on the legal and real-world consequences of \n     decisions and reflected a premium on rational thinking and \n     intellectual prowess, not personal philosophy or policy \n     preferences. It is in that vein that I urge the Senate to \n     confirm the two pending nominations to the D.C. Circuit, so \n     that this eminent court can live up to its full potential in \n     our country's judicial work.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 8, 2013]\n\n           Citing Cuts, Lawyers Seek Relief in Terrorism Case\n\n                          (By Benjamin Weiser)\n\n       Federal public defenders who are representing a son-in-law \n     of Osama bin Laden on terrorism charges urged a judge on \n     Monday not to hold an early trial because automatic \n     government budget cuts were requiring furloughs of lawyers in \n     their office.\n       The request, which seemed to take the judge, Lewis A. \n     Kaplan, by surprise, follows requests that five or six \n     federal judges in Manhattan have received from public \n     defenders to be relieved from cases in the wake of the \n     automatic cuts, known as sequestration, said Loretta A. \n     Preska, the chief judge of the Federal District Court in \n     Manhattan.\n       ``It's devastating,'' Judge Preska said late Monday. She \n     praised the work of the federal defenders and said their \n     replacement in cases with publicly paid court-appointed \n     lawyers would probably lead to delays and higher costs.\n       Judge Kaplan said in court on Monday that he was \n     considering holding the trial of bin Laden's son-in-law, \n     Sulaiman Abu Ghaith--a onetime Al Qaeda spokesman charged \n     with conspiring to kill Americans--in September. After the \n     defense requested a later date, he said: ``It's extremely \n     troublesome to contemplate the possibility of a case of this \n     nature being delayed because of sequestration. Let me say \n     only that--stunning.''\n       The judge did not set a trial date, saying he would \n     consider the request, but the exchange shows how the forced \n     budget cuts are beginning to have an effect on the \n     administration of justice in federal courts in New York.\n       About 30 trial lawyers with the federal defenders office \n     handle around 2,000 criminal cases a year in federal courts \n     in Manhattan, Brooklyn and other locations, according to \n     David E. Patton, who heads the office.\n       The forced cuts, he said, will mean each lawyer in the \n     office will be furloughed for five and a half weeks through \n     the end of September, when the fiscal year ends.\n       ``On a good day, we're stretched thin,'' Mr. Patton said. \n     ``Sequestration takes us well beyond the breaking point. You \n     simply can't sequester the Sixth Amendment.''\n       ``Investigations have to be conducted,'' Mr. Patton added. \n     ``Evidence must be reviewed. Law must be researched. Those \n     things don't just happen by themselves.''\n       In seeking the delay, lawyers for Mr. Abu Ghaith, who was \n     arraigned in March, cited the need for overseas \n     investigation, the translation of voluminous materials and \n     other issues. ``We would urge the court to find a later \n     date,'' one lawyer, Martin Cohen, said.\n       Judge Preska said that lawyers had been allowed to leave \n     one of the cases in which the furlough problem had been \n     cited; the issue is pending in the others.\n       Newly appointed lawyers would have to ``get up to speed'' \n     on their cases, and because they are paid by the hour \n     (federal defenders are salaried), the public would probably \n     end up paying more, Judge Preska said. ``There's no \n     resolution,'' she said. ``Time is of the essence, and we're \n     very, very concerned.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in the midst of another tragic occurrence \nin our country, where we are all holding our breath to learn the facts, \nand praying, I wanted to say the business of the Senate is moving \nforward in terms of judges and how important it is to have judges in \nplace so criminals can be prosecuted and justice is served.\n  Tonight in front of the Senate is Judge Beverly Reid O'Connell to be \ndistrict court judge for the Central District Court of California. \nJudge Reid O'Connell was approved in the Judiciary Committee by a voice \nvote. She has\n\n[[Page S2647]]\n\nhad a very diverse legal career. She served as an exemplary superior \ncourt judge in Los Angeles. She will be an excellent addition to the \nFederal bench. She is a lifelong Southern Californian. She grew up in \nNorthridge, where she was valedictorian of her high school. She went on \nto attend UCLA and Pepperdine Law School, where she was managing editor \nof the Law Review and graduated magna cum laude.\n  She began her career in private practice, spending 5 years as an \nassociate at Morrison and Foerster. In 1995, she joined the Department \nof Justice as an assistant U.S. attorney, where she spent 10 years \ngaining critical criminal law and trial experience.\n  Judge O'Connell excelled as an assistant U.S. attorney. She was the \ndeputy chief of the general crimes section, responsible for supervising \nall the attorneys in the criminal division. She was the lead attorney \non a case that led to the indictment of the highest ranking member of a \nmajor drug trafficking organization on U.S. soil.\n  For her work on this case she was awarded the DEA Administrator's \nAward for Exceptional Service.\n  She has also received numerous other awards from the DEA, FBI, and \nlocal governments.\n  She was appointed Superior Court Judge in Los Angeles in 2005 by \nGovernor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Judge O'Connell is the Assistant \nSupervising Judge of the North Valley Judicial District where she is \nresponsible for supervising 3 court houses and 22 bench officers.\n  An expert in criminal law, she presides over all aspects of felony \ncriminal cases before the Superior Court.\n  In addition to being well-respected for her demeanor on the bench and \nher stellar legal intellect, she is known by her colleagues as a great \nmanager and supervisor, attributes which will serve her well at the \nbusy central district.\n  Judge Reid O'Connell is also very active in the Southern California \nlegal community.\n  She created a program that brings inner-city students to the Superior \nCourt to educate them about the legal process and to spend time with \njudges and lawyers.\n  She also teaches continuing education courses to California judges on \ncriminal law, and is an adjunct professor at the law schools of \nPepperdine and Loyola.\n  Judge Reid O'Connell received the ABA's highest possible rating--\nunanimously ``well qualified and they said she will make an excellent \nFederal judge.\n  While we are in the midst of some very contentious debates--and I \nhope and pray we will move forward with the background check amendment \nthat was crafted by our colleagues Senator Manchin and Senator Toomey--\nand while we are worried about everything that has happened in the \ncountry, particularly what has happened today at the Boston Marathon, I \nknow we can move forward tonight because we need to make sure we have \nqualified judges on the benches to deal with crimes, to deal with \njustice every single day.\n  I believe Judge Reid O'Connell is a wonderful choice for these very \ndifficult times and I urge my colleagues to support her nomination.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support \nfor Superior Court Judge Beverly Reid O'Connell's nomination to be a \ndistrict judge for the Central District of California.\n  Born in Ventura, CA, Judge O'Connell graduated from the University of \nCalifornia, Los Angeles in 1986 and earned her law degree from \nPepperdine University School of Law magna cum laude in 1990. She was \nmanaging editor of the Pepperdine Law Review.\n  Following law school, she worked on complex civil litigation in \nprivate practice at the law firm Morrison & Foerster for 5 years. She \nthen joined the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Central District of \nCalifornia, where she served for 10 years, from 1995 through 2005. She \nhandled a number of high profile cases, such as the prosecution of a \nhigh ranking member of the Arellano Felix drug cartel.\n  She was appointed to the Superior Court by former Governor Arnold \nSchwarzenegger in 2005. She has been an outstanding judge, presiding \nover literally thousands of cases and approximately 150 jury trials. \nShe also has been a proven administrator, serving with great skill as \nan assistant supervising judge for the North Valley District of the \nSuperior Court.\n  Simply put, Judge O'Connell has outstanding credentials and an \nimpeccable reputation, and she has received a rating of ``well \nqualified'' from the American Bar Association--the ABA's highest \nrating.\n  I will conclude by saying that I have met with Judge O'Connell, and I \nhave no doubt she will be an excellent addition to the Central \nDistrict.\n  I commend Senator Boxer for recommending such a fine candidate to \nPresident Obama, and I am pleased her nomination is on the floor today. \nI hope my colleagues will support her nomination.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before I yield the floor I want to say, \nfor the note of anyone who has been following that on Monday nights I \nusually speak about climate change, I am not going to do this tonight. \nI am going to put that off until next week.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Boston Marathon Tragedy\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I, like every Member of the Senate, am \nshocked and saddened by the news from Boston today. There were \nexplosions near the finish line at the Boston Marathon. My thoughts go \nout to all those who were injured, and my condolences go to the \nfamilies and friends of those affected by this tragedy.\n  I commend the first responders and the observers who rushed toward \ndanger to help those who were hurt. We will continue to monitor the \nnews from Boston.\n  President Obama has spoken to a number of people, including the mayor \nof Boston and Governor Deval Patrick. They have pledged every resource \navailable to help those who were affected and to find and bring to \njustice the perpetrators. The President will be speaking to the Nation \nin about 20 minutes.\n  I will do whatever I can to support the people of Boston and the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, as we all will, during this difficult \ntime.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back on the \nnomination, and following a moment of silence in observance of the \ntragic events which took place in Boston earlier today, the Senate then \nproceed to vote on the confirmation of the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senate will observe a moment of \nsilence.\n  (Moment of Silence.)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Beverly Reid O'Connell to be United States District Judge for the \nCentral District of California?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President. On April 21, 88 World War II veterans from \nMontana will be visiting our Nation's Capital.\n  With a great deal of honor and respect, I extend a hearty Montana \nwelcome to each and every one of them.\n  Together, they will visit the World War II Memorial and share stories \nabout their service. This journey will no doubt bring about a lot of \nmemories. I hope it will give them a deep sense of pride as well.\n  What they achieved together almost 70 years ago was remarkable. That \nmemorial is a testament to the fact that a grateful nation will never \nforget what they did or what they sacrificed. To us, they were our \ngreatest generation. They left the comforts of their family and their \ncommunities to confront evil from Iwo Jima to Bastogne. Together, they \nwon the war in the Pacific by defeating an empire and liberated a \ncontinent by destroying Hitler and the Nazis.\n  To them, they were simply doing their jobs. They enlisted in \nunprecedented numbers to defend our freedoms and our values. They \nrepresented the very best of us and made us proud.\n  From a young age, I remember playing the bugle at the memorial \nservices of veterans of the first two World Wars. It instilled in me a \nprofound sense of respect that I will never forget.\n  Honoring the service of every generation of American veterans is a \nMontana value. I deeply appreciate the work of the Big Sky Honor \nFlight, the nonprofit organization that made this trip possible.\n  To the World War II veterans making the trip, I salute you. We will \nalways be grateful, and we will never forget your service or your \nsacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/15/senate-section/article/S2648-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO ANNA JO GARCIA HAYNES\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate Anna Jo \nGarcia Haynes, a remarkable Coloradan, who has made helping kids her \nlife's work. Anna Jo rises every morning and before she greets the day, \nasks, ``What can I do to improve the lives of kids today?'' She began \nher work with the founding of the Mile High Montessori Early Learning \nCenter, which operates eight centers in Denver's inner city for \nchildren from families with limited resources.\n  Anna Jo has received many accolades over her career, and she has been \nrecognized by foundations, elected officials, including both houses of \nthe Colorado legislature, and many others. She is often praised with \nflowery language and many whereas clauses to acknowledge her service to \nColorado's kids.\n  I know that Anna Jo would want me to say in my remarks today that she \nis very proud of her humble, pioneer roots in Colorado and that she \nraised five children, who were secure in their mother's love and grew \nup to become leaders in their own right. She would further want me to \nsay that she lives for kids--and has worked to create hope and success \nfor kids who were not born into educational or economic opportunity but \nwho have achieved it due to the programs she has worked to create and \nsupport.\n  This month, Anna Jo is receiving due recognition from the Girls \nAthletic Leadership School in Denver, CO, for being a champion for \nColorado education. I join the Girls Athletic Leadership School and the \nState of Colorado in thanking Anna Jo for working to create educational \nopportunity and for enriching our community and our State. I look \nforward to whatever Anna Jo tackles in the future and the positive \ninfluence she will continue to have in our community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/15/senate-section/article/S2648-4", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/15/senate-section/article/S2648-5", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/15/senate-section/article/S2648-6", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2013, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on April 12, 2013, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the House has passed the following bill, without \namendment:\n\n       S. 716.

A bill to provide a taxpayer bill of rights for small \nbusinesses; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to reintroduce the Small Business \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights Act of 2013, SBTBOR.\n  As millions of taxpayers across the country race to meet today's \ndeadline to file their Federal tax return, it is important to note that \ntheir tax burden is more than just the amount of tax paid to the \nFederal Government. Taxpayers also bear the compliance cost of \ncomplying with a byzantine tax code. Analysts predict that taxpayers \nwill spend over $350 billion this year alone to comply with the tax \ncode. An analysis of IRS data by the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate \nshows it takes taxpayers more than 6.1 billion hours to compete filings \nrequired by a tax code that contains almost four million words and \nthat, on average, has more than one new provision added to it daily.\n  A dispute over a complex tax code with the IRS can become an \nexpensive endeavor for small businesses, who have limited resources to \nfight off frivolous IRS claims. With the passage of the 2010 health \ncare act, this burden is expected to increase in the future. At a time \nwhen job creation remains weak, small businesses should be spending \ntheir time and resources creating jobs, not cutting through miles of \nburdensome IRS red tape. The Small Business Taxpayer Bill of Rights \nseeks to mitigate this problem. It would ensure that small businesses \nspend less time dealing with the IRS and more time creating jobs.\n  The Small Business Taxpayer Bill of Rights, among other things, \nprovides more protections and safeguards for small businesses during \nadministrative procedures with the IRS. It would lower the compliance \nburden on small business taxpayers; strengthen safeguards against IRS \noverreach; increase taxpayer compensation for IRS abuses and; improve \ntaxpayer access to the court system. Amid the weakest economic recovery \nsince World War II, American job creators urgently need such relief.\n  The Small Business Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act will reduce the \ncompliance and administrative burdens faced by small business taxpayers \nwhen it comes to dealing with the IRS. The bill provides an alternative \ndispute resolution procedure through which a small business taxpayer \nmay be able to request arbitration with an independent, neutral third \nparty not employed by the IRS. In addition, the bill will make more \nsmall businesses eligible to recoup attorney's fees when a court finds \nthat the IRS's action taken against a taxpayer is not substantially \njustified.\n  The legislation also reinforces the independent nature of the IRS \nAppeals Office by prohibiting it from discussing the merits of a \ntaxpayer's case with any other department at the IRS, unless the \ntaxpayer is afforded an opportunity to participate. Second, the bill \nwill prevent an Appeals Officer from raising a new issue that was not \ninitially raised by the IRS in the examination process. The SBTBOR \nwould help to ensure the Appeals Office remains a neutral entity that \neffectively facilitates the taxpayer's appeals process.\n\n  The Small Business Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act will make the IRS more \naccountable to taxpayers by increasing the amount of damages taxpayers \nmay receive for any collection action the IRS takes against them that \nis reckless, or by reason of negligence disregards the law or its \nregulations. Second, it increases the amount of damages taxpayers may \nbe awarded when the IRS improperly discloses their tax returns and tax \ninformation. Third, the bill raises the monetary penalty on IRS \nemployees who commit certain unlawful acts or disclose taxpayer \ninformation.\n  Finally, the legislation will improve taxpayer access to the Tax \nCourt by expanding the role of the current ``small tax case'' \nprocedure--an informal and efficient method for resolving disputes \nbefore the Tax Court--to include a wider variety of cases. The bill \nwill permit taxpayers to obtain judicial review from the Tax Court when \nthe IRS fails to act on their claim for interest abatement due to an \nerror or delay by the IRS. And taxpayers whose property has been \nwrongly seized to satisfy a tax debt will have more time to claim \nrelief and bring a civil suit against the IRS. It also makes procedural \nimprovements for taxpayers who request innocent spouse relief. By \nrequesting innocent spouse relief, taxpayers can be relieved of the \nresponsibility for paying tax, interest, and penalties if their spouse \nimproperly reported items or omitted items on their tax return.\n  This legislation is also supported by the Texas Association of \nBusiness, National Federation of Independent Business, U.S. Hispanic \nChamber of Commerce, Americans for Tax Reform, and the National \nTaxpayers Union, among others.\n  Small business owners face an especially crushing burden of \npaperwork, but they lack the key financial and legal resources that \nmultinational corporations do when dealing with the tax code and the \nIRS. This legislation will provide relief for small businesses and will \nallow small businesses to spend more time expanding their business and \ncreating jobs and less time dealing with the IRS.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 725\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

John Cornyn,\n     Senate Minority Whip, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: The United States Hispanic Chamber of \n     Commerce (USHCC) would like to express its support and thank \n     you for introducing the Small Business Taxpayer Bill of \n     Rights Act of 2013 (SBTBOR). As our organization advocates \n     for legislation that helps Hispanic owned businesses grow the \n     economy and create jobs, it is encouraging to see the SBTBOR \n     introduced on the Senate floor during the 113th Congress.\n       As you are aware, Hispanic-owned firms are the fastest \n     growing segment of American enterprise. We applaud you for \n     recognizing this fact and, as a result, taking the initiative \n     to provide sensible solutions for the USHCC constituency of \n     Hispanic entrepreneurs. The four pillars of the SBTBOR--\n     lowering compliance burden for taxpayers, strengthening \n     taxpayer protections, compensating taxpayers for IRS abuses, \n     and improving taxpayer access to the judicial system--are \n     crucial for the financial health of small businesses across \n     the country, and we hope that your Senate colleagues join in \n     your efforts to pass common sense, pro-growth legislation.\n       In the USHCC's 2012-2014 Legislative Agenda, regulatory \n     reform is noted as a critical part of the Hispanic small \n     business community's potential for job creation and economic \n     development. The SBTBOR, by addressing problematic regulation \n     and interaction with the IRS, is in line with the USHCC's \n     view for a full economic recovery. In order for the Hispanic \n     community to continue leveraging its entrepreneurial spirit, \n     we cannot allow for these job creators to be subject to slow \n     and costly resolution of audits, low civil damages when the \n     IRS disregards the law, fees on installment agreements for \n     low-income taxpayers, and many other harsh burdens that exist \n     for small businesses.\n       The SBTBOR could have an immediate, positive impact on the \n     Hispanic business community and American economy as a whole. \n     Please let us know how we may assist in your effort to \n     promote an environment where entrepreneurs focus more on \n     growing their businesses rather than dealing with \n     unreasonable regulations. We are here to help.\n           Respectfully Submitted,\n     Marc Rodriguez,\n       Chairman of the Board, USHCC.\n     Javier Palomarez,\n       President & CEO, USHCC.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHATZ (for himself and Ms. Hirono):\n  S. 726.
