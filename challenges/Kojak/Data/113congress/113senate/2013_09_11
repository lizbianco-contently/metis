Mr. President, I can remember events 12 years ago so \nclearly. I was not far from here at the time. I was in S-219, which is \na meeting room. That is where Leader Daschle held his leadership \nmeetings every Tuesday morning at 9 a.m. I was the first one in the \nroom. Senator John Breaux from Louisiana came in and said: Flip on the \nTV. There is something going on in New York.\n  We turned on the TV, and it looked as though something happened in \nNew York. We just thought an airplane had malfunctioned or something \nhad gone wrong to cause the plane to hit that tower.\n  So the meeting started and the TVs were off. We were doing our \nbusiness of the day when suddenly a group of police officers came in \nand grabbed Senator Daschle and took him outside. He came back very \nquickly and said: There is an airplane headed for the Capitol. We have \nto get out of here.\n  There was a lot of confusion, to say the least, as staff and Senators \nwere ordered out of the buildings--plural. As we left S-219, we looked \nout the window toward the Pentagon, and smoke was billowing out of it. \nWe could see it so very plainly. At that time we didn't\n\n[[Page S6338]]\n\nknow what was happening; we just knew we had been ordered to get out of \nthe building.\n  Of course, we all have memories of what took place that day. I was \nthe assistant leader, as was Senator Nickles from Oklahoma. Senator \nLott was the Republican leader, and Senator Daschle was the Democratic \nleader. We were taken in helicopters from the west front of the Capitol \nto a secure location. When I was taken to the west front of the \nCapitol, the scene was eerie to say the least. There were lots of \npeople in black uniforms trying to create order out of confusion. \nWithout going into a lot of detail, we went to a location, and the Vice \nPresident was there. He met with us and kept us informed as to what was \ngoing on with the President. We spent the day there and then came back \nto the west front of the Capitol, where all Members of Congress \ngathered. Barbara Mikulski, for lack of anyone having a better \nsuggestion, said: We should sing ``God Bless America.'' She got the \nsong started, and that was extremely memorable.\n  We are going to have a ceremony in a few minutes out front, and I \nwill talk a little bit there. The four leaders have been asked to talk \nout there.\n  We did have a moment of silence regarding the more than 3,000 people \nwho were killed in New York, Pennsylvania, and the Pentagon. In \naddition to those 3,000 people who were taken from us permanently, \nthousands of other people were injured, some of them permanently \ninjured. Some of them have missing legs, some are blind, and some \nsuffer from paralysis. So we raise our voices today in celebration of \nAmerica's spirit and perseverance. May we never forget 9/11.\n  It is also worth mentioning that on this day we also honor what took \nplace a year ago in Libya, where one of our stellar Ambassadors was \nmurdered along with three of his brave colleagues. They were all killed \nin Libya. Our country remains committed to seeking justice for them and \nevery American victim of terrorism, and that is what the debate of \nSyria is all about--terrorism.\n  Before I began the caucus yesterday, when the President came, my \nintroduction to the President was a film that was created by Senator \nFeinstein and others. It is about 12 or 13 minutes long, and it shows \nwhat went on in graphic detail with the brutal chemical weapons attack \nin Syria where these children were left to die. Remember, these poisons \nget the little kids first.\n  Senator Durbin has a Palestinian on his staff. We all know Reema. She \ndoes the whip count for Senator Durbin and for me. I had her listen to \nthe film. I watched it and she listened so she could give me some idea \nof what people were saying there. They were yelling. It was so sad. \nMostly they were praying. It was very, very sad to see people holding \nlittle babies and saying: Breathe, breathe. They couldn't breathe. We \ncould see the perspiration on some of them. They dumped water on them--\nanything to give them some relief. The video showed rows of dead \npeople. Hundreds of them were little children. Some of them were \ndressed in their play clothes, little fancy, colorful T-shirts.\n  Even as we pay tribute to America's tradition of freedom for every \ncitizen across the globe, an evil dictator denies its citizens not only \ntheir right to liberty but also their right to live. The Asad family is \npretty good at killing people. The New York Times had an article over \nthe last 24 hours about his dad, because of the failed assassination \nattempt, killing 30,000 people he thought needed to be killed--30,000. \nThat country, Syria, denies its citizens the right to liberty, but even \nmore significant the right to live.\n  Yesterday I showed the video at the caucus. No one wanted to see it. \nI didn't want to see it again. It was all I could do to glance up. I \nhad already seen it. Those visions will always be in my mind. I showed \nmy Senators a video of this: little boys and girls and grown men with \ntheir eyes crusted, frothing from the mouth. It was such unspeakable \nscenery. They were convulsing, writhing, spasms from the poison gas he \nused to murder his victims. It was hard to watch, but it confirmed all \nof our conviction that the United States must not let the Syrian regime \ngo unpunished for using something that is outlawed. Those weapons are \nnot to be used in a war, let alone used on a bunch of innocent people.\n  Yesterday the President spoke to two caucuses. He spoke last night \nand made a compelling case for military action against the Asad regime. \nAs the President said, we have to send an explicit message not only to \nSyria but the rest of the world. Remember--who has more chemical \nweapons than Syria? Only one country--North Korea. Think about that. If \nthey get away with this, what is North Korea going to do? Then are we \ngoing to have a marketplace for purchasing chemical weapons? The use of \nchemical weapons by anyone, any time, anywhere, including the \nbattlefield, should not be tolerated.\n\n  Preventing these weapons from being used is not only in our own \nnational interests, but it is in the interests of the world. Diplomacy \nshould always be the first choice. That is who we are as a country. So \nwe have been asked to temporarily suspend consideration of the Syria \nresolution to allow for these conversations to take place around the \nworld.\n  Tomorrow our Secretary of State is meeting with the Russian Secretary \nof State, Mr. Lavrov, to explore in fact if this is a legitimate \nproposal. Talking and action are two separate things. So what the \nRepublican leader and I have spoken about--and we will talk more about \nit today--is to see what we can do to give the President the time and \nspace our country needs to pursue these international negotiations. We \nwill report back at a later time. America must remain vigilant and \nready to use force if necessary, and Congress should not take the \nthreat of military action off the table.\n  I want to spend a little time talking to Senator Menendez, the chair \nof the committee. I want to talk to other Senators who are trying to \nwork something out on their own, and I will do that.\n  Leaders in Damascus and Moscow should understand that Congress will \nbe watching these negotiations very closely. If there is any indication \nthis is not serious--that it is a ploy to delay, to obstruct, to \ndivert--then I think we have to again give the President the authority \nto hold the Asad regime accountable. So it is our determination not to \nlet Asad's atrocities go unanswered. How we answer is a question we \nwill continue to pursue. But it is very clear that we wouldn't be where \nwe are today--even my friend, the junior Senator from Kentucky, today \nsaid the reason we are having the possibility of a deal is because of \nthe President threatening force.\n  It is interesting. Asad has even denied, until just recent hours, \never even having had chemical weapons. So it is in Syria's power to \navoid these strikes, but that will require swift and decisive action on \nthe part of the Asad regime to relinquish these weapons. We need a \ndiplomatic solution to succeed, but saying we want one doesn't mean it \nwill happen. So he must quickly prove the offer to turn over Syria's \nchemical weapons is real and not an attempt to delay.\n  All eyes are on the Russian President, President Putin. We all know \nhe was formerly head of the KGB. We all know about the KGB. He is the \nPresident of that very big country. We are also grateful that even \nthough relations aren't perfect with Russia, they are OK--so much \nbetter than they have been prior to the breakup of that massive \ncountry, the Soviet Union.\n  We hope Russia is a productive partner in these negotiations. Any \nagreement must also assure it is possible to secure these chemical \nweapons in spite of the ongoing civil war, to keep those stockpiles out \nof the hands of terrorists.\n  In short, I am happy we have some conversations going to see if this \ncan be resolved diplomatically. I certainly hope so.\n  I apologize to my counterpart, the Republican leader, for taking so \nmuch time.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/11/senate-section/article/S6338-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Those of us who were there will \nnever forget it.

Our Nation always pulls together in \ndifficult moments;\n9/11 showed us that. It is important we remember it.\n  I look forward to joining congressional leaders and others out on the \nsame steps shortly, on this day that has rightly become a very solemn \none throughout our country.\n  We remember today all those who were killed as well as the families \nthey left behind. We remember them with renewed sorrow. We remember all \nwho lost their lives or who have been injured in the line of duty \ndefending our freedoms since 9/11.\n  Today, we remember the resolve we shared on a clear September morning \n12 years ago.\n  In the days and months that followed the attacks of 9/11, we did not \ncower. We took the fight to the terrorists, while here at home we \nopened our doors, our wallets, and our hearts to those around us. We \npersevered. We maintained what was and is best about our country. And, \ntogether, we will continue to do so as long as this struggle continues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/11/senate-section/article/S6339-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in a few moments we will recess to gather \non the steps of the Capitol. It is an annual event that commemorates 9/\n11. The leaders have spoken to their memories of that day, and I \nassociate myself with their remarks and the sadness we all feel as we \nreflect on the lives lost, some 3,000 Americans--to this blatant act of \nterrorism.\n  We can all recall that moment. I can recall looking down the Mall \ntoward the Washington Monument and watching the black smoke billowing \nacross the Mall from the Pentagon because of the deadly crash there \nthat took the lives of passengers on that plane and innocent people \nworking in defense of America. That was a moment that will never be \nforgotten.\n  Over the weekend there was an indication of a new memorial in New \nYork City that will commemorate 9/11 as well, and soon it will be open \nas a lasting tribute to not only those who fell and the families we \ngrieve with, but also to the paramedics and first responders who did \nsuch a remarkable and courageous job that day.\n\n\n                                 Syria\n\n  It is in keeping with that theme that we reflect today on what the \nmajority leader told us. We had a visit yesterday from the President of \nthe United States who spoke directly to the Senate Democratic caucus \nand Republican caucus luncheons answering questions from Senators. The \nPresident came to speak to us about the situation in Syria, about the \nuse of chemical weapons, the deadly impact it has had on innocent \npeople, and the obvious breach of norms of civilized conduct which the \nworld has agreed to for almost 100 years.\n  The President made it clear that we have a chance now, an opportunity \nfor a diplomatic solution because of the suggestion of the Russians \nthat the Syrians come forward, surrender their chemical weapons, submit \nto inspections, and have real enforcement. Nations around the world are \nworking with the United States to craft a resolution for the United \nNations to consider. I am hopeful and I pray they will be successful. \nIf that occurs, the President will have achieved his goal without the \nuse of military force, which is something he made clear to us yesterday \nthat he hopes to pursue--achieving his goal without the use of military \nforce. Over and over again yesterday he told us: I am not a President \nwho looks forward to the use of military force. I don't want to do it \nunless I have to. I believe that, because I know the man. I have known \nhim for many years and I know what is in his heart.\n  However, we have to acknowledge the obvious. Had the President not \nraised the prospect of military force, this conversation on an \ninternational level would never have occurred. It was the President's \nleadership, even without majority support among the American people, \nthat precipitated this action by President Putin, and I hope it will \nlead to a diplomatic solution. It is where it should be--in the United \nNations. It was only the threat of veto by Russia and China and the \nSecurity Council which kept President Obama from turning to the United \nNations first. But we have a chance, and I pray it is successful.\n  We will now move forward with other items on the Senate agenda very \nquickly, as we should, and still the possibility that if this \ndiplomatic effort fails, we will have to return to this critically \nimportant debate about the future of Syria.\n  It is important to recall, though, even after the chemical weapons \nare gone--and I pray that happens with diplomatic efforts soon--there \nwill still be a civil war in that country that has claimed 100,000 \nlives over the last several years. The sooner that comes to an end, the \nbetter. The humanitarian crisis on the ground in Syria is terrible, but \nthe impact on surrounding nations is awful as well.\n  Last year I visited a refugee camp in Turkey where Syrians, fearing \nfor their lives, moved by the thousands into Turkey. I reflected on the \ngenerosity and compassion of the people of Turkey, accepting 10,000 \npeople in one of these refugee camps, providing for them shelter and \nfood and medical care and education for their children. It was an \namazing humanitarian gesture on their part.\n  Then we go to the nation of Jordan. Jordan is overrun with refugees \nfrom the Middle East, and it has created serious economic challenges \nfor that country and threats to political stability. The sooner this \nwar ends in Syria, the sooner normalcy comes to the Middle East, the \nbetter for Jordan and the better for the entire region. So we pray that \noccurs soon.\n  This has been a rough few weeks as we have considered chemical \nweapons in Syria. As Senator Reid said yesterday, the objects and \nvisions we saw on this film and video--the victims of these chemical \nweapons--remind us of how horrible this is. When those who turn to \nweapons of mass destruction are not held accountable, there are more \ninnocent victims.\n  I hope we can solve this issue on a diplomatic basis. We will stand \ndown now in terms of any congressional effort until that effort in the \nUnited Nations has a chance to reach fruition, and I pray it will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/11/senate-section/article/S6339-3", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6339-S6340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            REMEMBERING 9/11\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise to speak in morning business to \nremember 9/11, 2001, a day every American citizen and every citizen in \nthe world remembers. They remember where they were. They remember what \nthey thought. And they remember the tragedy we all watched on \ntelevision that day.\n  It is appropriate that on every 9/11 of every year we pause for a \nmoment and pray for the victims of that tragedy and their families, \nthat we remember what happened on that day, and that we commit \nourselves to see to it that it never happens again.\n  It is important that it not just be a memory. It needs to be a \nseminal moment in our lives that allows us to never forget the tragedy \nof what I believe is the first battle in the greatest war between good \nand evil. Terrorism is the ultimate enemy of freedom, liberty, and \ndemocracy, and it is something we must stand up to and never cower to.\n  Sometimes people ask me: What can I do? What can I do on 9/11, 2013, \nto remember those who died, to remember those who saved lives, and to \nremember what happened? I say there are three important things for us \nto always do.\n\n[[Page S6340]]\n\nNo. 1 is to give thanks for the EMTs, the firemen, the law enforcement \nofficers who risked their lives and, in many cases, died to save people \nwho were victims of the Twin Towers tragedy. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2 is to remember we are a soldier in the army to fight terrorism. \nEvery American should remember to be vigilant, to watch where they go. \nIf they see something unusual, if they see something out of character, \nreport it. We can be the second security force for our country.\n  Third, and most importantly, pray for our country. Pray that we have \nthe strength to continue to confront terrorism. It is important for us \nto remember that terrorists win when we fear them. When we change what \nwe do in our lives because we fear terrorism, they have won that great \nbattle. We must stand up to, be vigilant for those signs that indicate \na terrorist attack may happen, and let them know that no matter where, \nno matter when, or no matter what, the people of the United States of \nAmerica stand ready to confront it and see to it that never does our \ncountry cower in fear because of terrorism. So on this tragic day, when \nalmost 3,000 citizens of the world lost their lives in New York City, \nShanksville, PA, and Washington, DC, it is appropriate that we pause \nand remember those victims, their families, and all of those who worked \nto save lives on 9/11, 2001. We must also remember those three things: \nPray for America and those who were victims, remember to be vigilant \nand part of the army that keeps our eyes open and reports things that \nare seen, and always remember that when we cower to terrorism in fear, \nthe terrorists have won. America must always be what America is: the \nstrongest democracy on the face of this Earth.\n  May God bless our country and may God bless the souls who died on \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/11/senate-section/article/S6340-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6340-S6348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 SYRIA\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise to speak to the grave issue of the \nSyria resolution currently pending before the body.\n  It is September 11. I know many Members have expressed thoughts, and \nwe are all thinking about that day and what it means to our country. In \na few minutes I will leave and go to the Pentagon to be with Pentagon \nstaffers and family members as they commemorate the anniversary of this \nhorrible tragedy in American life. The shadow of that tragedy and its \nrippling effects even today, 12 years later, definitely are a matter on \nmy mind and heart as I think about this issue with respect to Syria.\n  Also on my mind and heart as I think about this grave issue is its \nconnection to Virginia. I believe Virginia is the most militarily \nconnected State in our country. Our map is a map of American military \nhistory: the battle at Yorktown, the surrender at Appomattox Court \nHouse, the attack on the Pentagon on 9/11. Our map is a map of American \nmilitary history. We are more connected to the military in the sense \nthat one in nine of our citizens is a veteran. We have Active Duty at \nthe Pentagon, training to be officers at Quantico, the largest \nconcentration of naval power in the world at Hampton Roads. We have DOD \ncontractors. We have DOD civilians such as Army nurses. We have ROTC \ncadets, Guard and Reserve members, and military families, all of whom \ncare very deeply about the issue we are grappling with as a nation.\n  I am sure in the Presiding Officer's State, as in mine and across the \ncountry, there is a war weariness on this 12th anniversary of 9/11, and \nthat affects the way we look at this question of whether the United \nStates should potentially engage in military action.\n  I cast a vote last week in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to \nauthorize limited military action, and I have spent the days since that \nvote talking to Virginians and hearing from them and hearing from some \nwho aren't happy with the vote I cast.\n  I spent 1 day talking to ROTC cadets at Virginia State University, \nfolks who are training to be officers who might fight in future \nconflicts for this country. Then I spent Friday in Hampton Roads with \nveterans and military families talking about the choices before us.\n  I heard a teenager last night say something that truly struck me. \nThis is a teenager who doesn't have any direct connection to the \nmilitary herself, no family members in service. But at an event I was \nattending, she stood and said: I don't know war, but all my generation \nand I know is war. Think about that: I don't know war, but all my \ngeneration and I know is war. During her entire life that she has been \nkind of a thinking person, aware of the outside world, we have been at \nwar. That makes us tremendously war-weary, and I understand that. So \ntrying to separate out all those feelings and do what is right is hard.\n  Similar to many Virginians, I have family in the military who are \ngoing to be directly affected by what we do or what we don't do. I \nthink about those family members and all Virginians and all Americans \nwho have loved ones in service as I contemplate this difficult issue.\n  I wish to say three things. First, I wish to praise the President for \nbringing this matter to Congress, which I believe is courageous and \nhistoric. Secondly, I wish to talk about why I believe authorizing \nlimited military action makes sense. Third, I wish to talk about the \nneed to exhaust all diplomatic opportunities and openings, including \nthe ones that were reported beginning Monday of this week by Russia and \nSyria.\n  First, on the President coming to Congress. This was what was \nintended by the Framers of the Constitution; that prior to the \ninitiation of significant military action--and this would be \nsignificant by all accounts--that Congress should have to weigh in. The \nFramers wanted that to be so. They had read history. They knew \nexecutives might be a little too prone to initiating military action, \nand they wanted to make sure the people's elected representatives had a \nvote about whether an action should be initiated. Once initiated, there \nis only one Commander in Chief. But at the initiation, Congress needs \nto be involved. That was the intent from the very beginning of this \nNation from 1787. There was an understanding that in an emergency, a \nPresident might need to act immediately, but even in that case there \nwould need to be a reckoning, a coming back to Congress and seeking \napproval of Presidential action.\n  In my view, the President, by bringing this matter to Congress, has \nacted in accord with law, acted in accord with the intent of the \nFramers of the Constitution, and actually has done so in a way that has \ncleared up some sloppiness about the way this institution and the \nPresident has actually done this over time.\n  Only five times in the history of the Nation has Congress declared \nwar. Over 120 times Presidents have initiated military action without \ncongressional approval--at least prior congressional approval. \nPresidents have overreached their power, and Congress has often made a \ndecision to avoid being accountable for this most grave decision that \nwe make as a nation.\n  I praise the President for bringing it to Congress, the people's \nbody, because I think it is in accord with law. But I praise him for a \nsecond reason. It is not just about the constitutional allocation of \nresponsibility. Responsibilities were allocated in the Constitution, in \nmy view, for a very important moral reason. The moral reason is this: \nWe cannot ask our men and women in service to put their lives on the \nline if there is not a consensus of the legislative and executive \nbranches that the mission is worthwhile.\n  That is why it is important for Congress to weigh in on a decision to \ninitiate military hostility because, absent that, we face the situation \nthat would be a very real possibility in this instance that a President \nwould make a decision that an action or a war was worth fighting but a \nCongress would not support it. That would put the men and women who \nhave to face the risk\n\n[[Page S6341]]\n\nand potentially risk their lives in a very difficult situation. If we \nare going to ask people to risk their lives in any kind of a military \naction, we shouldn't be asking them to do it if the legislative and \npolitical branches haven't reached some consensus that it should be \ndone.\n\n  That is the first point I wish to make. I wish to thank the President \nfor cleaning up this sloppiness in the historical allocation of \nresponsibilities between a President and Congress, for taking a \nhistoric step--as he said he would as a candidate--of bringing a \nquestion such as this to Congress.\n  We may be unable to act in certain cases because we are divided. But \nif we act and we act united, we are much stronger both militarily and \nin the moral example that we pose to the world. It is the right thing \nto do for the troops who bear the burden of battle.\n  Second, I wish to talk about the actual authorization. We grappled \nwith this. The news came out about the chemical weapons attack on \nAugust 21, and 18 of us members of the Foreign Relations Committee \nreturned last week. The Presiding Officer came and attended some of our \nclassified meetings. We grappled with the question about whether in \nthis circumstance a limited military authorization was appropriate, and \nI voted yes. I voted yes for a very simple reason. I believe there has \nto be a consequence for using chemical weapons against civilians.\n  It is pretty simple. There are a lot of nuances, a lot of subtleties, \nand a lot of questions about whether the plans might accomplish the \nparticular objective we hope. Those are all legitimate questions. But \nat the end of the day, I feel so very strongly that if chemical weapons \nhave been used--and in this case they were and used on a massive scale \nand used against civilians--there must be a consequence for that. There \nmust be a sharp consequence for it. If there isn't, the whole world \nwill be worse off.\n  I believe that if the United States acts in this way to uphold an \nimportant international norm--perhaps the most important international \nnorm that weapons of mass destruction can't be used against civilians--\nif we act to uphold the norm, we will have partners. How many partners? \nWe will see. Maybe not as many as we would wish, but we will have \npartners. But I am also convinced that if the United States does not \nact to uphold this principle, I don't think anyone will act. If we act, \nwe will have partners; if we don't, I don't think anyone will act. That \nis the burden of leadership that is on this country's shoulders.\n  We know about the history of the chemical weapons ban, and we are so \nused to it that it seems normal. But just to kind of step back from it, \nif we think about it, it is not that normal at all.\n  The chemical weapons ban came out of World War I. World War I was a \nmechanized slaughter with over 10 million deaths, a slaughter unlike \nanything that had ever been seen in global history. There were all \nkinds of weapons used in World War I that had never been used before, \nincluding dropping bombs out of airplanes. Dropping bombs out of \nairplanes, new kinds of artillery, new kinds of munitions, new kinds of \nmachine guns, chemical weapons, all kinds of mechanized and \nindustrialized weapons were used in World War I. The American troops \nwho served in 1917 and 1918 were gassed. They would be sleeping in a \ntrench, trying to get a couple hours of sleep, and they would wake up \ncoughing their lungs out or blinded--or they wouldn't wake up because \nsome of the gases were invisible and silent. With no knowledge, you \ncould suddenly lose your life or be disabled for life because of \nchemical weapons.\n  The number of casualties in World War I because of chemical weapons \nwas small as a percentage of the total casualties. But it is \ninteresting what happened. After World War I, the nations of the world \nthat had been at each other's throats, that had battled each other, \ngathered a few years later. It is interesting to think what they banned \nand didn't ban. They didn't ban aerial bombardment. They didn't ban \nmachine guns. They didn't ban rockets. They didn't ban shells. They \ndidn't ban artillery. But they did decide to ban chemical weapons. They \nwere able to all agree, as combatants, that chemical weapons were \nunacceptable and should neither be manufactured nor used.\n  It can seem maybe a little bit illogical or even absurd: Why is it \nworse to be killed by a chemical weapon than a machine gun or by an \nartillery shell? I don't know what the logic is to it. All I can assume \nis that the experience of that day and moment had inspired some common \nspark of humanity in all of these cultures and combating nations, and \nthey all agreed the use of chemical weapons should be banned heretofore \non the Earth.\n  Nations agreed with that ban. The Soviet Union was on board. The \nUnited States was on board. So many nations were on board. Syria \nultimately signed that accord in 1968. Even in the midst of horrific \nwars where humans have done horrific things to each other, since 1925 \nand the passage of the ban, the ban has stuck. The international \ncommunity has kept that ember of humanity alive that says these weapons \nshould not be used, and only two dictators until now have used these \nweapons--Adolph Hitler using these weapons against millions of Jews and \nothers and Saddam Hussein using the weapons against Kurds, his own \npeople, and then against Iranians in the Iraq-Iran war.\n  When we think about it, it is pretty amazing. With all the barbarity \nthat has happened since 1925, this has generally stuck, with the \nexception of Adolph Hitler and Saddam Hussein, until now. The \nbeneficiaries of this policy have been civilians, but they have also \nbeen American service men and women. The service men and women who \nfought in World War I were gassed from this country, but the Americans \nwho fought in World War II, in Europe and North Africa and the Pacific, \nwho fought in Korea, who fought in Vietnam, who fought in Afghanistan, \nwho fought in Iraq, who fought in other minor military involvements \nhave never had to worry about facing chemical weapons. No matter how \nbad the opponent was, American troops haven't had to worry about it, \nand the troops of other nations haven't had to worry about it either. \nThis is a very important principle, and it is a positive thing for \nhumanity that we reached this accord and we have honored it.\n  So what happens now if there isn't a consequence for Bashar al-\nAssad's escalating use of chemical weapons, to include chemical weapons \nagainst civilians.\n  What happens if we let go of the norm and we say: Look, that may have \nbeen OK for the 20th century, but we are tougher and more cynical now. \nThere are not any more limits now, so we don't have to abide by any \nnorms now. What I believe the lesson is--and I think the lessons of \nhistory will demonstrate that this will apply--is that an atrocity \nunpunished will engender future atrocities. We will see more atrocities \nin Syria against civilians and others. We will see more atrocities \nabroad. We will see atrocities, and we will have to face the likely \nconsequence that our servicemembers, who have not had to face chemical \nweapons since 1925, will now have to prepare to face them on the \nbattlefield.\n  If countries can use chemical weapons and there is no serious \nconsequence, guess what else they can do. They can manufacture chemical \nweapons. Guess what else. They can sell chemical weapons and \nproliferate chemical weapons. It is not just a matter that the use of \nchemical weapons would be encouraged, but the manufacture and sale of \nchemical weapons by individuals or companies or countries that want to \nmake money will proliferate.\n  This has a devastating potential effect on allies of the United \nStates and the neighbors around Syria such as Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, \nand Turkey. It would have a devastating impact on other allies, such as \nSouth Korea, that border nations that use chemical weapons. It could \nencourage other nations that have nonchemical weapons of mass \ndestruction, for example, nuclear weapons, to think that the world will \nnot stand up, there is no consequence for their use so they can violate \ntreaties, violate norms, and no one is willing to stand and oppose it.\n  That was the reason I voted last week in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee for this limited authorization of military force. I was fully \naware the debate on the floor might amend or change it, and I was open \nto that possibility. But I thought it was important\n\n[[Page S6342]]\n\nto stand as a representative of Virginia and a representative of this \ncountry to say: The use of chemical weapons may suddenly be OK in the \n21st century for Bashar al-Asad, it may suddenly be OK to Vladimir \nPutin and others, but it is not OK to the United States of America, and \nwe are willing to stand and oppose them.\n  The limited military authorization that is on this floor, as the \nPresiding Officer knows, talks about action to punish, deter, and \ndegrade the ability of the Syrian regime to use chemical weapons. The \ngoal is to take the chemical weapons stockpile of that nation out of \nthe battlefield equation. The civil war will continue. We don't have \nthe power, as the United States, to dictate the outcome of that war. \nBut chemical weapons should not be part of that war, and they should \nnot be part of any war.\n  The authorization was limited. There will be no ground troops. It was \nlimited in scope and duration, but make no mistake, the authorization \nwas a clear statement of American resolve that there has to be a \nconsequence for use of these weapons in violation of international \nnorms that have been in place since 1925.\n  Finally, I want to talk about diplomacy and the urgent need that I \nknow we all feel in this body, and as Americans, to pursue diplomatic \nalternatives--including some current alternatives on the table--that \nwould be far preferable to military action. It is very important that \nwe be creative. It is very important that we have direct talks with the \nperpetrators and enablers of these crimes, but also important to look \nto intermediaries and independent nations for diplomatic alternatives.\n  We have been trying to do so until recently and have been blocked in \nthe United Nations. But the authorization for military force actually \nhad that as its first caveat. The authorization said: Mr. President, if \nthis passes, we authorize you to use military force, but before you do, \nyou have to come back to Congress and stipulate that all diplomatic \nangles, options, and possibilities have been exhausted.\n  So on the committee, and with the wording of this authorization, we \nwere very focused on the need to continue a diplomatic effort, and that \nis why it was so gratifying on Monday, on my way back to DC after a \nlong week, to hear that Russia had come to the table with a proposal \ninspired by a discussion with administration figures. It is a proposal \nthat the Syrian chemical weapons stockpile--one of the largest in the \nworld--would be placed under international control.\n  Then a few hours later--and this was no coincidence--Syria, \nessentially Russia's client state, spoke up and said: We will very much \nentertain placing our chemical weapons under international control. \nSyria has even suggested, beyond that, they would finally sign on to \nthe 1990s-era Chemical Weapons Convention. They are one of six nations \nin the world that refused to sign it. Syria would not even acknowledge \nthey had chemical weapons until 2012--even though the world knew it.\n  Over the last 48 hours, we have seen diplomatic options emerge that \nare very serious and meaningful. In fact--and it is too early to tell--\nif we can have these discussions and find an accord where Syria will \nsign on to the convention and put these weapons under international \ncontrol, we will not only have avoided a bad thing, such as military \naction, which none of us want unless it is necessary, but we will have \naccomplished a good thing for Syrians and humanity by taking this \nmassive chemical weapons stockpile off the battlefield and submitting \nit to international control and eventually destruction.\n  The offer that is on the table, and the action that has happened \nsince Monday is very serious, very significant, and very encouraging, \nand it could be a game changer in this discussion. I said it is \nserious, but what we still need to determine is if it is sincere. It is \nserious and significant, but obviously what the administration needs to \ndo in tandem with the U.N. is to determine whether it is sincere.\n  I will conclude by saying I think it is very important for Americans, \nfor citizens, and for the Members of Congress to understand--we should \nmake no mistake about this--that the diplomatic offer that is on the \ntable was not on the table until America demonstrated it was prepared \nto stand for the proposition that chemical weapons cannot be used.\n  I have no doubt that had we not taken the action in Congress last \nweek in the Foreign Relations Committee to show America is resolved to \ndo something, if no one else in the world is resolved to do something, \nat least we would be resolved to do something, had we not taken that \naction, Russia would not have suddenly changed its position--they have \nbeen blocking action after action in the Security Council--and come \nforward with this serious recommendation. Had we not taken that action, \nand had they not been frightened of what America might do, Syria--which \nwas willing to use with impunity these weapons against civilians--would \nnot have come forward either.\n  So American resolve is important. American resolve is important to \nshow the world that we value this norm and we will enforce it, even to \nthe point of limited military action. But even more important, American \nresolve is important because it encourages other nations--even the \nperpetrators and enablers of the use of these weapons--to come forward \nand shoulder the responsibilities they have, or so we pray, in the days \nahead.\n  What I ask of my colleagues and my countrymen is that because it has \nbeen our resolve that has produced a possibility for a huge diplomatic \nbreakthrough and win, I ask we continue to be resolved, continue to \nshow strength, continue to hold out the option that there will be a \nconsequence for this international crime, that America will play a \nleading role in making sure there is a consequence, and as long as we \nstand strong with this resolve, we will maximize the chance that we \nwill be able to obtain the diplomatic result we want.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The minority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, my dad was a pilot in the Army Air Corps \nin World War II. He served in the Eighth Air Force, the 303rd Bomb \nGroup stationed in Molesworth, England. On his 26th bombing mission \nover Nazi Germany, he was shot down and captured as a prisoner of war \nwhere he served for the remainder of the war. So I learned at a very \nyoung age that when we start talking about matters of war and peace, we \nmust take these very seriously.\n  I appreciate the fact that President Obama came to Capitol Hill \nyesterday and spoke to both the Democratic conference and the \nRepublican conference. I further appreciate very much the fact that \nPresident Obama spoke to the American people last night. I actually \nwish he had done it a little earlier since the chemical weapons attacks \noccurred on the 21st of August. It was roughly 3 weeks after that that \nhe finally spoke to the American people. I think it would have been \nbetter for him and better for the country if he had done it sooner and \ndemonstrated a greater urgency, but I am glad he did it.\n  When a President asks the American people to support our U.S. \nmilitary and the use of military force, he has a solemn obligation to \ncommunicate to the American people how it will protect America's vital \ninterests. He has an obligation to tell the American people why going \nto war is absolutely essential to U.S. national security. He has an \nobligation to lay out clear and realistic objectives; and finally, he \nhas an obligation to explain how military intervention fits within \nAmerica's broader foreign policy strategy.\n  I have used the word war advisedly because sometimes I think we get \ncaught up in political correctness around here--talking about workplace \nviolence at Fort Hood and overseas contingency operations.\n  As a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps who served 40 years told me \nlast week when I asked for his advice on what the President was asking \nus to do, he said: Anytime you kill people in the name of the U.S. \nGovernment, it is an act of war.\n  So like others in this Chamber over the last few weeks, I have \nattended meetings with the President where I had the honor of being in \nhis presence and listening to him in person on two occasions. I \nlistened to other administration officials. Like all of us, I sat\n\n[[Page S6343]]\n\nthrough hours of classified briefings with the Central Intelligence \nAgency, the Department of Defense, and the State Department.\n  I have listened intently as Senator Kerry described in what I thought \nat first was an inadvertent statement made as a result of fatigue. I \ncan only imagine what he must have been going through. He has been \nshuttled back and forth around the world to try to resolve this issue. \nBut he described this strike as unbelievably small. I was further \nsurprised when I heard the White House press secretary say: No, it \nwasn't a gaffe; he didn't misspeak. I mean, we all misspeak from time \nto time, so I expected him to say: Well, he should have used other \nwords or might have used other words. Then Senator Kerry himself--now \nSecretary Kerry--said: No, I didn't misspeak.\n  I was encouraged to hear the President address the Nation because I \nbelieve before we take our case overseas to American allies, we should \nfirst make the case here at home to the American people.\n  In making their case for a brief, limited attack against Syria, \nadministration officials have repeatedly said U.S. military \nintervention would not seek to topple the Asad regime even though \nregime change has been the policy of the U.S. Government since at least \nAugust 2011. They said their military campaign would not seek to change \nthe momentum in Syria's civil war, even though, as I mentioned a moment \nago, our government's official policy is one of regime change, that \nAsad must go.\n  My view is a U.S. attack that allowed Asad to remain in power with \none of the world's largest stockpiles of chemical weapons would not \npromote U.S. national security interests. Indeed, it is not hard to \nimagine how that kind of intervention could actually backfire and end \nup being a propaganda disaster.\n  Many of us are concerned about upholding America's credibility, \nparticularly when it comes to matters such as this, and I share their \nconcern. But it would help if before we launch a halfhearted, \nineffectual attack which gives our enemies a major propaganda victory \nthat we come up with a more coherent plan and strategy for \naccomplishing our public policy goals.\n  Murphy's law says what can go wrong will go wrong. Well, there is a \nMurphy's law of war too--perhaps many of them but one of them is no \nplan to go to war survives the first contact intact. In other words, we \ncan plan to shoot the first bullet, but we can't control what happens \nafter that.\n  In all likelihood, such an attack would hurt our credibility and \nreduce U.S. public support for future interventions. This is what I \nmean: If we were to undertake a limited military attack against Asad in \norder to punish him for using chemical weapons--which is a horrific act \non his part, a barbaric act on his part--but it left Asad in power, \nwhat is he going to tell the rest of the world? He is going to say: The \nworld's greatest military force took a shot at me and I am still here. \nI am still in power. I won and America lost. That is how I can see this \nbackfiring in a very serious way, undermining America's credibility--\ncredibility we must keep intact, particularly as we look at larger, \nlooming threats such as the Iranian aspiration for nuclear weapons.\n  I wish to be clear, though: I would be willing to support a military \noperation in Syria but only if our intervention met certain criteria. \nNo. 1: If it directly addressed the nightmare scenario of Asad's use of \nchemical weapons falling into the hands of terrorists. It is not just \nhis use of chemical weapons on his own people; it is the potential that \nthose chemical weapons could get into the hands of Al Qaeda and other \nterrorist organizations and harm either Americans or American interests \naround the world.\n  No. 2: I could support a resolution if it involved the use of \ndecisive and overwhelming force, without self-imposed limitations, and \nwithout leaking to our enemies what our tactics are and what it is we \nwould not do, and ruining one of the greatest tools in war, which is \nthe element of surprise. Why in the world would we tell Asad what we \nare going to do--and Secretary Kerry said it would be a small attack--\nand why would we tell Asad what we won't do, thereby eliminating both \nthe ambiguity of our position and the potential threat of even more \nserious and overwhelming military force?\n  No. 3: I would be willing to support an authorization if it were an \nintegral part of a larger coherent Syria policy that clearly defined \nthe political end state. I still remember General Petraeus, the head of \nCentral Command covering Iraq and Afghanistan, talking about our policy \nin those countries. He said, The most important question, perhaps, when \nwe go to war is how does this end. We need a clearly defined political \nend state that we are trying to achieve by what the President requested \nand we need an outline of a realistic path to get there.\n  No. 4: I believe it is important that we have a sizable international \ncoalition of nations, each of which is contributing to the war effort.\n  This is an amazing reversal for the President since the time he was a \nSenator and a Presidential candidate. To say we are not going to the \nUnited Nations--and I understand why; because of China and Russia, \ntheir veto of any resolution out of the Security Council, we are not \ngoing to go to NATO. Indeed, the President seemed content, or at least \nresigned, to going it alone. And if it is true this redline is the \ninternational community's redline, then the international community \nneeds to contribute to the effort to hold Asad accountable.\n  The problem is President Obama's requested authorization for the use \nof military force under these circumstances fails to meet each of those \ncriteria. He has failed to make the case that a short, limited military \ncampaign would promote our vital interests and our national security. \nHe has failed to lay out clear and realistic objectives that could be \nobtained through the use of military force. And he has failed to offer \na compelling description of how his proposed intervention would advance \nAmerica's broader foreign policy strategy; indeed, how it would advance \nhis own policy of regime change. Therefore, if we were asked to vote on \nan authorization under these circumstances, I would vote no.\n  I am under no illusion--none of us are--about the utter depravity of \nBashar al-Asad. Over the last 2\\1/2\\ years his regime has committed \nunspeakable acts of rape, torture, and murder. The chemical weapons \nattacks, by the way, as described by Secretary Kerry's own testimony in \nthe House of Representatives, included 11 earlier uses of chemical \nweapons, but they were smaller. Can we imagine the difficulty of trying \nto impose a redline when that redline is crossed 11 times before the \nPresident finally decides to try to enforce it? But there is no \nquestion that the use of chemical weapons shows an appalling disregard \nfor human life and a cruel desire to terrorize the Syrian population. \nI, as others, have consistently demanded that Russia stop arming Asad \nand stop defending him and blocking U.N. Security Council resolutions, \nand aiding and abetting his barbaric atrocities against his own people. \nI want to see a free democratic Syria as much as anyone else. But that \ndoes not mean I will vote to support a reckless, ill-advised military \nintervention that could jeopardize our most important national security \ninterests.\n  There have been a lot of people who have opined on the President's \nrequest, some better informed than others. One opinion I found \nparticularly convincing was that of retired Army MG Robert Scales who \nhas written that the path to war chosen by the Obama administration \n``violates every principle of war, including the element of surprise, \nachieving mass and having a clearly defined and obtainable objective.''\n  As I said, we know the latest chemical weapons attack occurred on \nAugust 21. Yet President Obama didn't address the Nation until 3 weeks \nlater. The Syrians, of course, have now had weeks to prepare for any \npending military intervention and no doubt have moved the chemical \nweapons to other locations and their military equipment to civilian \npopulation centers in order to protect them from any attack. With no \nelement of surprise, it makes the potential for success of any military \nintervention much less and reveals there is no real coherent policy in \nthis regard.\n\n  Consider what happened last Monday. Secretary of State Kerry made \nwhat he calls an off-the-cuff remark about the possibility of canceling \na missile strike if Asad turned over all of his chemical weapons. In \nthe same statement he\n\n[[Page S6344]]\n\nsaid he wasn't sure that would work or that he would ever be serious \nabout it, but he did say it. Russia, of course, immediately responded \nby offering to broker a transfer of Syria's WMD to international \nmonitors.\n  After spending weeks trying to make the case for war, President Obama \nhas asked that the vote in this Chamber be canceled and is apparently \ntreating the Russian-Syrian proposal as a serious diplomatic \nbreakthrough. I would caution all of us--the American people and all of \nour colleagues--to be skeptical, for good reason, at this lifeline \nVladimir Putin has now thrown the administration. I would remind the \nPresident and our colleagues that Russia itself is not in full \ncompliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention, nor is it even in \ncompliance with nuclear arms control obligations that are subject to an \ninternational treaty. The litany of Russian offenses is long, but I \nwould remind President Obama that since he launched the so-called \nRussian reset, Moscow has vetoed U.N. resolutions on Syria, sent \nadvanced weaponry to the Asad regime, stolen elections, stoked anti-\nAmericanism, made threats over our possible deployment of missile \ndefense systems; it has expelled USAID from Russia, pulled out of the \nNunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program; it has banned U.S. \ncitizens from adopting Russian children, and offered asylum to NSA \nleaker Edward Snowden. In short, we have very little reason to believe \nMoscow is a reliable diplomatic partner. The Russians are part of the \nproblem in Syria, not part of the solution. Let me say that clearly. \nThe Russians are part of the problem in Syria; they are not credibly \npart of the solution.\n  Moreover, I am curious to learn how international monitors would \nadequately confirm the disposal of chemical weapons by a terrorist-\nsponsoring dictatorship among a ferocious civil war. While this strike \nthe President talked about might have been limited in his imagination, \nif you are Bashar al-Asad, this is total war, because he realizes the \nonly way he will leave power is in a pine box. He knows that. This is \ntotal war. I asked the President yesterday: What happens if, in order \nto punish Asad, we intervene militarily and it doesn't work? In his \nfight for his survival and the survival of his regime, he uses them \nagain in an act of desperation? The President said, We will hit him \nagain. Well, clearly, what had become a limited strike could quickly \nspiral out of control into a full-blown engagement in Syria. I think \nthe President's own words suggest that.\n  But, of course, the Asad regime is the same one that refuses to \nacknowledge the full extent of its chemical arsenal--and this is \nsomething we will be hearing more about. It has bioweapons capability. \nBioweapons capability is actually a much greater threat to American \ninterests than chemical weapons, which are more difficult to transport \nand much harder to handle. And this is the same dictatorship that was \nsecretly working on a nuclear weapons program before the Israelis took \ncare of it in 2007.\n  We have been told that however unfortunate President Obama's \n``redline'' comment might have been, upholding his threat is about \nmaintaining American credibility. And I admit, American credibility in \nmatters of war and peace and national security are very, very \nimportant. But America's credibility on the world stage is about more \nthan just Presidential rhetoric. It is about defining clear objectives \nand establishing a coherent strategy for achieving them. In the case of \nSyria, President Obama has not offered a clear strategy or clearly laid \nout his objectives.\n  Given all that, I am not surprised that the American people do not \nsupport the President's call for the use of limited military force in \nSyria. Those are the calls I got in my office. As I went back to Texas, \nI kept hearing people--who I would think under almost any other \ncircumstances would say: If America's national security interests are \nat stake, then we are behind the President, we are behind military \nintervention, but they simply saw an incoherent policy and objectives \nthat were not clearly laid out to obtain the result the President \nhimself said is our policy.\n  Well, the most recent experience we have had as a country with \nlimited war has been Libya, and I have heard the President tout that as \nperhaps an example about how we can get in and get out. The 2011 \nmilitary operation that deposed Muammar Qadhafi was supposed to be a \nshowcase example of a limited operation in which America led from \nbehind and still obtained its objectives without putting U.S. boots on \nthe ground. Unfortunately, the administration had no real plan for what \nhappened after Qadhafi fell.\n  We all know it was 1 year ago today in Benghazi when terrorists \nlinked to Al Qaeda massacred four brave Americans, including U.S. \nAmbassador Chris Stevens. Today Libya is spiraling into chaos and \nrapidly becoming a failed state. Earlier this month a leading British \nnewspaper reported that ``Libya has almost entirely stopped producing \noil as the government loses control of much of the country to militia \nfighters.'' All sorts of bad actors, including terrorist groups, are \nflooding into the security vacuum, and ``Libyans are increasingly at \nthe mercy of militias which act outside the law.''\n  Before I conclude, I want to say a few words about America's Armed \nForces and America's role in the world.\n  We all know and are extraordinarily proud of our men and women who \nwear the uniform of the U.S. military. No military in history has been \nmore powerful. No military has ever been more courageous. No military \nhas been more selfless and fought and bled and died to protect innocent \npeople in far-flung places across the planet. No military has ever done \nmore to promote peace and prosperity around the world. I have every \nconfidence that if called upon to act our men and women in uniform will \ndo just that. They will perform their duties with the utmost skill, \nbravery, and professionalism. But we should never send them to war \ntying one hand behind their back and ask them to wage limited war \nagainst a dictator for whom, as I said earlier, this is total war. This \nis win or die. Military force is like a hammer, and you cannot thread \nthe needle President Obama wants to thread with a hammer.\n  I would like to conclude by saying that this debate--which is \nimportant and serious and one the American people expect us to have--is \nnot about isolationism versus internationalism. Believe me, I am no \nisolationist, and I fully support the global security role America has \nplayed since World War II, since my dad was a POW. A world without \nAmerican military dominance would be, as Ronald Reagan noted, a much \nmore dangerous place. I believe peace comes with American strength. \nHowever, it will be harder to maintain our global military dominance if \nwe waste precious resources, our credibility, and political capital on \nhasty, misguided, unbelievably small interventions.\n  Once again, I would be willing to support an authorization for a \nmilitary strike against Syria if it met certain basic criteria I have \nlaid out. But I cannot support an operation that is so poorly \nconceived, so foolishly telegraphed, and virtually guaranteed to fail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Good afternoon, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \n25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I rise to speak on the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime \nand the decision that is before the Senate on how to respond to such \ninhumanity. I also come to the floor with the hope that the use of \nmilitary force will not prove necessary and that the proposal to place \nSyria's chemical weapons program under United Nations control will, in \nfact, be successful.\n  Last night, in my view, the President delivered a strong, \nstraightforward speech that directly outlined the current situation in \nSyria. He asked that a vote by the Congress to authorize military force \nagainst the Asad regime be delayed so that a strategy could be \ndeveloped with Russia and the United Nations Security Council that \nwould eliminate Syria's deadly chemical weapons program. I believe this \nis the appropriate path forward, and I appreciate very much the \nmajority leader's holding off on bringing this resolution\n\n[[Page S6345]]\n\nfor a vote so that negotiations can continue. Here in the Senate, there \nare discussions going on about how to amend the resolution passed by \nthe Foreign Relations Committee to provide time for diplomacy.\n  I would also like to take a minute to give Russia credit for bringing \nforward this plan for a negotiated solution to the conflict. I disagree \nwith the Senator from Texas. As the Russian Ambassador described to me \non Monday of this week, he said Russia is sincere, wants to see a \nUnited Nations resolution, and supports the Geneva II process which \nwould accompany a negotiated settlement to Syria's civil war. Based on \nmy conversation with Ambassador Kislyak, I believe Russia's goal is \nnow, in fact, to eliminate these weapons, and I would point out that is \nalso our goal.\n  So I very much hope that the path to settlement--although \ncomplicated, no doubt, but if well-intentioned by all participants, it \ncan be accomplished, and I deeply believe that. If the United Nations \nSecurity Council can agree on a resolution to put this proposal into \npractice, it would put the world's imprimatur on an important plan to \nsafeguard and then to destroy Syria's chemical weapons program.\n  Russia's responsibility to get this done is enormous, and they must \nmove with all deliberate speed. I think Russia and Syria must \nunderstand that the only way to forestall a U.S. strike on Syria is for \nthere to be a good-faith agreement and process underway to put all of \nSyria's chemical weapons--including munitions, delivery systems, and \nchemicals themselves--under international control for eventual \ndemolition.\n  Syria's chemical weapons program is maintained and stored across \nSyria in more than three dozen sites. There are indications that Syria \ncurrently has chemical weapons loaded and ready for immediate use in \nbombs, artillery, and rockets and already loaded on planes and \nhelicopters. All of it needs to be inventoried, collected, and then \ndestroyed as soon as possible if the effort is to succeed. This will be \na large and complicated process, and the agreement may take some time \nto put in place. But if it can be done, we should take the time to get \nit done right. At the same time, we cannot allow there to be so much \ndelay and hesitation, as has characterized some arms control efforts in \nthe past.\n  It is clear to me that the United States is moving quickly already. \nTomorrow Secretary Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov \nwill meet in Geneva to discuss the specifics of how to move forward.\n  I cannot stress enough the importance of this process. Not only is it \na possible solution to the specter of future use of chemical weapons by \nthe Syrian regime and a way to ensure that extremist elements of the \nopposition do not gain control of these weapons, but it also sets an \nimportant precedent for the United Nations to act to resolve conflict \nbefore there is large military confrontation.\n  But it should be clear by now that the Asad regime has repeatedly \nused chemical weapons. So I would like to speak as chairman of the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence and lay out some of the \nunclassified intelligence that shows the regime was indeed behind this \nlargest use of chemical weapons in more than two decades. The \nunclassified assessment is based on classified intelligence we have \nseen on the Intelligence Committee and it has been available to all \nSenators. So here is the case.\n  The intelligence community assesses today, with ``high confidence,'' \nthat the Syrian regime used chemical weapons--specifically sarin--in \nthe Damascus suburbs in the early morning of August 21. This assessment \nis supported by all 16 of our intelligence agencies as well as other \ncountries, including the United Kingdom and France.\n  The Obama administration has publicly laid out its case at an \nunclassified level, and I have carefully reviewed the classified \ninformation that supports those findings.\n  First, there is intelligence indicating that the Asad regime--\nspecifically its military and the Syrian Scientific Studies and \nResearch Center, which manages its chemical weapons program--has used \nchemical weapons roughly a dozen times over the past year.\n  On June 13, 2 months before this latest attack, the administration \nstated that it had completed a review of all available intelligence and \nhad concluded that the intelligence community had ``high confidence'' \nthat the Asad regime used chemical weapons, ``including the nerve agent \nsarin, on a small scale against the opposition multiple times.'' This \nfollowed similar assessments by France, the United Kingdom, Israel, and \nTurkey earlier this year. In some of these cases the regime may have \nbeen testing its delivery vehicles or various amounts of chemical \nagents. Some were small-scale tactical uses against the opposition. \nPerhaps Asad was just trying to find out how the world would react to \nhis use of chemical weapons.\n  It has been more than a year since top intelligence officials learned \nof Syrian preparations to use sarin in large quantities. Since then, at \nnumerous other briefings and hearings, the Intelligence Committee has \nfollowed this issue closely. On September 11, 2012--exactly a year \nago--while protests against our Embassy in Cairo were underway and the \nattack on our diplomatic facility in Benghazi was imminent, I was again \nbriefed on the administration's plans should Asad conduct such an \nattack.\n  So the attack on August 21 in Damascus was not a first-time use, \nrather it was a major escalation in the regime's willingness to employ \nweapons long held as anathema by almost the entire world population.\n  Let me lay out the intelligence case that the Asad regime used \nchemical weapons on August 21. Much of this is described in a four-page \nAugust 30 unclassified document entitled ``U.S. Government Assessment \nof the Syrian Government's Use of Chemical Weapons on August 21, \n2013.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the document be printed in the Record.\n  We know that 3 days before the attack of August 21, Syrian officials \ninvolved in the preparation and use of chemical weapons and associated \nwith the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center were ``preparing \nchemical munitions'' in the Damascus suburb of Adra. That is according \nto the intelligence community.\n  The intelligence specifically relates to an area in Adra that the \nregime has used for mixing chemical weapons, including sarin. The \nSyrian chemical weapons personnel were operating and present there from \nAugust 18 to the early morning of August 21, and finished their work \nshortly before the attack began.\n  Some of the intelligence collected on the preparations for the attack \nis highly sensitive. So the details of the Syrian actions cannot be \ndescribed publicly without jeopardizing our ability to collect this \nkind of intelligence in the future. But in numerous classified \nbriefings over the past 2 weeks, Members of Congress have been provided \nwith additional detail on the names of the officials involved and the \nstream of human signals and geospatial intelligence that indicates that \nregime was preparing to use chemical weapons. So we actually have \nnames.\n  It is from the specificity of this intelligence reporting that the \nintelligence community has drawn its high level of confidence that the \nregime was behind the use of chemical weapons. The strike began in the \nearly morning hours on Wednesday, August 21. It is beyond doubt that \nlarge amounts of artillery and rockets were launched from regime-\ncontrolled territory in Damascus and rained down on the opposition-\ncontrolled areas of the Damascus suburbs. There is satellite imagery \nactually showing this, as well as thousands of firsthand accounts that \nbegan showing up on social media sites at around 2:30 a.m.\n  The barrage continued for 5 days, though the use of chemical weapons \nappears to have been deliberately suspended by the regime after the \nfirst few hours. Since the attack, physical samples from the area have \nbeen analyzed. The intelligence community assesses with high confidence \nthat ``laboratory analysis of physiological samples obtained from a \nnumber of individuals revealed exposure to Sarin.''\n  More than 100 videos were posted online showing the effects of the \nchemical weapons on hundreds of men, women and, most troubling, \nsleeping children who were dead or showing the\n\n[[Page S6346]]\n\nsigns of exposure to the nerve agent. At my request, the intelligence \ncommunity compiled a representative sample of 13 videos which have been \ncorroborated and verified. According to the intelligence community, \n``At least 12 locations are portrayed in the publicly available videos, \nand a sampling of those videos confirmed that some were shot at general \ntimes and locations described in the footage.''\n  These videos clearly show the suffering and death caused by these \nweapons. The intelligence committee has posted these videos on our Web \nsite, www.intelligence.senate.gov. I would urge all Americans to look \nat this. They are absolutely horrendous and should shock the conscience \nof all humanity.\n  The videos show the physical manifestations of a nerve agent attack: \nfoaming mouth, pinpointed and constricted pupils, convulsions, gasping \nfor breath, all happening as the nervous system begins to shut down.\n  One video shows a lifeless toddler receiving emergency respiratory \nassistance. Another shows a young boy struggling to breathe, gasping \nwhile his eyes are swollen shut and covered in mucous. A third heinous \nvideo shows rows and rows of bodies lined up in an improvised morgue. \nAnother shows a man foaming at the mouth and convulsing, both \nindications of sarin exposure. It goes on and on.\n  Last night, the President urged all Americans to watch these videos \nto see how hideous the use of these chemicals actually is. Seeing these \nimages firsthand makes clear why chemical weapons have been banned and \nwhy Asad must be prevented from using them again.\n  What truly affected me was a video I saw of a little Syrian girl with \nlong dark hair who was wearing pajamas. The little girl looked just \nlike my daughter at that age--same hair, same pajamas, same innocence, \nexcept the little Syrian girl was lifeless. She had died from exposure \nto sarin, a chemical the world has essentially outlawed. For me, \nwatching the videos shows the abhorrence of chemical weapons. It shows \nwhy we must do something. Fired into densely populated areas such as \ncities, they have an indiscriminate effect, killing everyone in their \npath and causing suffering and eventual death to others nearby.\n  We have evidence that the chemical attack was premeditated and \nplanned as part of the regime's heinous tactics against the rebels. \nSpecifically, there is intelligence that Syrian regime personnel were \nprepared with gas masks for its people in the area, so it could clear \nthese areas in the Damascus suburbs that were attacked in order to \nwrest control from the opposition. Additional intelligence collected \nfollowing the attacks includes communications from regime officials \nthat confirms their knowledge that chemical weapons were used.\n  Let me repeat that. Additional intelligence following the attack \nincludes communications from regime officials that confirms their \nknowledge that chemical weapons were used. The official unclassified \nintelligence assessment distributed by the administration states: ``We \nintercepted communications involving a senior official intimately \nfamiliar with the offensive who confirmed that chemical weapons were \nused by the regime on August 21 and was concerned with the U.N. \ninspectors obtaining evidence.'' On the afternoon of August 21, we have \nintelligence that Syrian chemical weapons personnel were directed to \n``cease operations.'' This is specific evidence.\n  To sum up the intelligence case, I have no doubt the regime ordered \nthe use of chemical weapons on August 21. I also have no doubt the use \nof these weapons by the military and under the guidance of Syria's \nchemical weapons team, Branch 450, operates under the command and \ncontrol of the regime, under the ultimate leadership and responsibility \nof President Asad.\n  Let me move now from the intelligence case of Syria's use of sarin on \nAugust 21 to the question before the Senate of how to respond. As I \nsaid in the beginning, it would be my strong hope that the United \nStates and Russia can come to an agreement with other U.N. Security \nCouncil members on a way to resolve this situation peacefully.\n  Not only is a peaceful solution preferred to the use of force, but if \nSyria's chemical weapons program, including all of its precursors, \nchemicals, equipment, delivery systems, and loaded bombs, can be put in \nthe custody of the United Nations for its eventual destruction, that \nwould provide a much stronger protection against future use.\n  It also sets an important precedent for the future for the world to \nsettle other disputes of this nature. I have urged the Obama \nadministration to take all possible steps to make this proposal work. I \nappreciate the President's decision to ask us to delay any use-of-force \nresolution so diplomacy can be given a chance. However, the Senate may \nstill face a resolution to authorize the use of force in the event that \nall diplomatic options fail. Many of my colleagues have noted that the \nthreat of force has helped push forward the diplomatic option.\n  The Asad regime has clearly used chemical weapons to gas its own \npeople. I believe it will most likely do so again, unless it is \nconfronted with a major condemnation by the world. That now is \nbeginning to happen.\n  The regime has escalated its attacks from small scale ones that \nkilled 6 or 8 to 10 people with sarin to an attack that killed more \nthan 1,000. We know the regime has munitions that could kill tens of \nthousands of Syrians in Aleppo or Homs. If the world does not respond \nnow, we bear the responsibility if a larger tragedy happens later.\n  Of course, it is not only Syria who is looking at preparing and using \nweapons long banned by the international community. Iran is watching \nintently what the world will do in Syria and will apply the lessons it \nlearns to its current development of nuclear weapons.\n  North Korea, which has refrained from using both the nuclear weapons \nit has and the chemical weapons stockpile that actually dwarfs that of \nSyria, may well use the Asad example to fire on South Korea. Remember, \nwe have 28,000-plus troops right over the border of the DMZ, within a \nhalf hour.\n  More generally, countries around the world will see the United States \nas a paper tiger if it promises to take action but fails to do so. \nFormer Secretary of Defense, Bob Gates, whom I have great respect for, \nwho worked in both the Bush and Obama administrations, said exactly \nthat when he came out in support on the resolution for use of force \nagainst Syria.\n  Gates said this:\n\n       I strongly urge the Congress, both Democrats and \n     Republicans, to approve the President's request for \n     authorization to use force. Whatever one's views on the \n     current United States policy towards Syria, failure by \n     Congress to approve the request would, in my view, have \n     profoundly negative and dangerous consequences for the United \n     States, not just in the Middle East, but around the world \n     both now and in the future.\n\n  I strongly believe the major powers in the world have a \nresponsibility to take action when a country not only slaughters \n100,000 of its own citizens, makes millions homeless within Syria, and \nmakes millions into refugees in Turkey and Jordan, but especially when \nit is willing to use weapons against them that have been banned as an \naffront to all humanity because they are outlawed by a treaty joined by \n189 nations representing 98 percent of the world's population.\n  If the United Nations does not act in such cases, I believe it \nbecomes irrelevant. If nothing is done to stop this use of chemical \nweapons, they will be used in future conflicts. I am confident of that.\n  American servicemen in World War I were gassed with their allied \npartners. In our briefings over the past week, the military has made \nclear to us that if we allow the prohibition on chemical weapons use to \nerode, our men and women in uniform may again suffer from these weapons \non the battlefield.\n  Chemical weapons are not like conventional weapons. Consider for a \nmoment how sarin, for example, can kill so indiscriminately. The closer \nyou are to the release, such as from a mortar or an artillery shell, \nthe more certain you are to death. It spreads over a wide geographic \narea. It can shift from one neighborhood to another if the wind shifts.\n  During World War I, chemical weapons, primarily chlorine, phosgene, \nand mustard gas were used by both sides of the war. They caused an \nestimated 100,000 fatalities and 1.3 million injuries, 1,462 American \nsoldiers were killed, and 72,807 were injured by chemical weapons, \nwhich represented one-\n\n[[Page S6347]]\n\nthird of all U.S. casualties during World War I.\n  Since World War I, not a single U.S. soldier has died in battle from \nexposure to chemical weapons. However, according to the United Nations \nOffice for Disarmament Affairs, ``since World War I, chemical weapons \nhave caused more than 1 million casualties globally.''\n  During World War II, Nazi Germany used carbon monoxide and pesticides \nsuch as Zyklon B in gas chambers during the Holocaust, killing an \nestimated 3 million people.\n  An additional document will be printed in the Record that details the \nhistory and uses of chemical weapons around the world since World War \nI.\n  These past uses of chemical weapons make clear that they should never \nbe used again and that the entire world must stand up and take action \nif they are.\n  In Syria, the intentional use of chemical weapons on civilians, on \nmen, women, and children gassed to death during the middle of the night \nwhile they were sleeping, is a travesty that reflects hatred and \nincreasing desperation of the Asad regime. I also believe there are \nother chemical weapons that have been mixed and loaded into delivery \nvehicles with the potential to kill thousands more.\n  Think about that. If Asad can slaughter 100,000 of his own people \nwithout a second thought, what is he going to do next if we do nothing \nto hold him accountable? What is he going to do next if the United \nNations does nothing? What is he going to do next if this effort to \nreach consensus on the Security Council doesn't work? He will use them \nagain. I believe they are ready to go.\n  Why would the Asad regime load bombs with chemical weapons and not \nuse them?\n  If the United States does nothing in the face of this atrocity, it \nsends such a signal of weakness to the rest of the world that we are, \nyes, a paper tiger. That is going to be the conclusion in Iran and in \nNorth Korea.\n  The answer is we cannot turn our backs. The use of chemical weapons \nis prohibited by international law and it must now be condemned by the \nworld with action.\n  Albert Einstein said in a well-known quote: ``The world is a \ndangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but \nbecause of the people who don't do anything about it.''\n  For more than 90 years, our country has played the leading role in \nthe world in prohibiting the atrocities of World War I and then World \nWar II. We are the Nation that others look upon to stop repressive \ndictators and massive violations of human rights. We must act in Syria. \nWe cannot withdraw into our own borders, do nothing, and let the \nslaughter continue.\n  I hope military force will not be needed, that we will allow the time \nfor the United Nations and the parties on the Security Council to put \nan agreement together, and that the threat of force will be sufficient \nto change President Asad's behavior.\n  If these diplomatic efforts at the U.N. fail, I know we are going to \nbe back here on the floor to consider the authorization for use of \nmilitary force, but I sincerely hope it won't be necessary.\n  When the Ambassador from Russia described Russia's intentions to me \non Monday, he told me it was sincere. Now the ball is in Russia's \ncourt. Russia and the United States will need to come together, bring \nthe other parties together, and make it possible for the United Nations \nto act so the United States won't have to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n U.S. Government Assessment of the Syrian Government's Use of Chemical \n                       Weapons on August 21, 2013\n\n       The United States Government assesses with high confidence \n     that the Syrian government carried out a chemical weapons \n     attack in the Damascus suburbs on August 21, 2013. We further \n     assess that the regime used a nerve agent in the attack. \n     These all-source assessments are based on human, signals, and \n     geospatial intelligence as well as a significant body of open \n     source reporting. Our classified assessments have been shared \n     with the U.S. Congress and key international partners. To \n     protect sources and methods, we cannot publicly release all \n     available intelligence--but what follows is an unclassified \n     summary of the U.S. Intelligence Community's analysis of what \n     took place.\n\n\n         Syrian Government Use of Chemical Weapons on August 21\n\n       A large body of independent sources indicates that a \n     chemical weapons attack took place in the Damascus suburbs on \n     August 21. In addition to U.S. intelligence information, \n     there are accounts from international and Syrian medical \n     personnel; videos; witness accounts; thousands of social \n     media reports from at least 12 different locations in the \n     Damascus area; journalist accounts; and reports from highly \n     credible nongovernmental organizations.\n       A preliminary U.S. government assessment determined that \n     1,429 people were killed in the chemical weapons attack, \n     including at least 426 children, though this assessment will \n     certainly evolve as we obtain more information.\n       We assess with high confidence that the Syrian government \n     carried out the chemical weapons attack against opposition \n     elements in the Damascus suburbs on August 21. We assess that \n     the scenario in which the opposition executed the attack on \n     August 21 is highly unlikely. The body of information used to \n     make this assessment includes intelligence pertaining to the \n     regime's preparations for this attack and its means of \n     delivery, multiple streams of intelligence about the attack \n     itself and its effect, our post-attack observations, and the \n     differences between the capabilities of the regime and the \n     opposition. Our high confidence assessment is the strongest \n     position that the U.S. Intelligence Community can take short \n     of confirmation. We will continue to seek additional \n     information to close gaps in our understanding of what took \n     place.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       The Syrian regime maintains a stockpile of numerous \n     chemical agents, including mustard, sarin, and VX and has \n     thousands of munitions that can be used to deliver chemical \n     warfare agents.\n       Syrian President Bashar al-Asad is the ultimate decision \n     maker for the chemical weapons program and members of the \n     program are carefully vetted to ensure security and loyalty. \n     The Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC)--\n     which is subordinate to the Syrian Ministry of Defense--\n     manages Syria's chemical weapons program.\n       We assess with high confidence that the Syrian regime has \n     used chemical weapons on a small scale against the opposition \n     multiple times in the last year, including in the Damascus \n     suburbs. This assessment is based on multiple streams of \n     information including reporting of Syrian officials planning \n     and executing chemical weapons attacks and laboratory \n     analysis of physiological samples obtained from a number of \n     individuals, which revealed exposure to sarin. We assess that \n     the opposition has not used chemical weapons.\n       The Syrian regime has the types of munitions that we assess \n     were used to carry out the attack on August 21, and has the \n     ability to strike simultaneously in multiple locations. We \n     have seen no indication that the opposition has carried out a \n     large-scale, coordinated rocket and artillery attack like the \n     one that occurred on August 21.\n       We assess that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons \n     over the last year primarily to gain the upper hand or break \n     a stalemate in areas where it has struggled to seize and hold \n     strategically valuable territory. In this regard, we continue \n     to judge that the Syrian regime views chemical weapons as one \n     of many tools in its arsenal, including air power and \n     ballistic missiles, which they indiscriminately use against \n     the opposition.\n       The Syrian regime has initiated an effort to rid the \n     Damascus suburbs of opposition forces using the area as a \n     base to stage attacks against regime targets in the capital. \n     The regime has failed to clear dozens of Damascus \n     neighborhoods of opposition elements, including neighborhoods \n     targeted on August 21, despite employing nearly all of its \n     conventional weapons systems. We assess that the regime's \n     frustration with its inability to secure large portions of \n     Damascus may have contributed to its decision to use chemical \n     weapons on August 21.\n\n\n                              Preparation\n\n       We have intelligence that leads us to assess that Syrian \n     chemical weapons personnel--including personnel assessed to \n     be associated with the SSRC--were preparing chemical \n     munitions prior to the attack. In the three days prior to the \n     attack, we collected streams of human, signals and geospatial \n     intelligence that reveal regime activities that we assess \n     were associated with preparations for a chemical weapons \n     attack.\n       Syrian chemical weapons personnel were operating in the \n     Damascus suburb of Adra from Sunday, August 18 until early in \n     the morning on Wednesday, August 21 near an area that the \n     regime uses to mix chemical weapons, including sarin. On \n     August 21, a Syrian regime element prepared for a chemical \n     weapons attack in the Damascus area, including through the \n     utilization of gas masks. Our intelligence sources in the \n     Damascus area did not detect any indications in the days \n     prior to the attack that opposition affiliates were planning \n     to use chemical weapons.\n\n\n                               The Attack\n\n       Multiple streams of intelligence indicate that the regime \n     executed a rocket and artillery attack against the Damascus \n     suburbs in the early hours of August 21. Satellite detections \n     corroborate that attacks from a regime-controlled area struck \n     neighborhoods\n\n[[Page S6348]]\n\n     where the chemical attacks reportedly occurred--including \n     Kafr Batna, Jawbar, Ayn Tarma, Darayya, and Mu'addamiyah. \n     This includes the detection of rocket launches from regime \n     controlled territory early in the morning, approximately 90 \n     minutes before the first report of a chemical attack appeared \n     in social media. The lack of flight activity or missile \n     launches also leads us to conclude that the regime used \n     rockets in the attack.\n       Local social media reports of a chemical attack in the \n     Damascus suburbs began at 2:30 a.m. local time on August 21. \n     Within the next four hours there were thousands of social \n     media reports on this attack from at least 12 different \n     locations in the Damascus area. Multiple accounts described \n     chemical-filled rockets impacting opposition-controlled \n     areas.\n       Three hospitals in the Damascus area received approximately \n     3,600 patients displaying symptoms consistent with nerve \n     agent exposure in less than three hours on the morning of \n     August 21, according to a highly credible international \n     humanitarian organization. The reported symptoms, and the \n     epidemiological pattern of events--characterized by the \n     massive influx of patients in a short period of time, the \n     origin of the patients, and the contamination of medical and \n     first aid workers--were consistent with mass exposure to a \n     nerve agent. We also received reports from international and \n     Syrian medical personnel on the ground.\n       We have identified one hundred videos attributed to the \n     attack, many of which show large numbers of bodies exhibiting \n     physical signs consistent with, but not unique to, nerve \n     agent exposure. The reported symptoms of victims included \n     unconsciousness, foaming from the nose and mouth, constricted \n     pupils, rapid heartbeat, and difficulty breathing. Several of \n     the videos show what appear to be numerous fatalities with no \n     visible injuries, which is consistent with death from \n     chemical weapons, and inconsistent with death from small-\n     arms, high-explosive munitions or blister agents. At least 12 \n     locations are portrayed in the publicly available videos, and \n     a sampling of those videos confirmed that some were shot at \n     the general times and locations described in the footage.\n       We assess the Syrian opposition does not have the \n     capability to fabricate all of the videos, physical symptoms \n     verified by medical personnel and NGOs, and other information \n     associated with this chemical attack.\n       We have a body of information, including past Syrian \n     practice, that leads us to conclude that regime officials \n     were witting of and directed the attack on August 21. We \n     intercepted communications involving a senior official \n     intimately familiar with the offensive who confirmed that \n     chemical weapons were used by the regime on August 21 and was \n     concerned with the U.N. inspectors obtaining evidence. On the \n     afternoon of August 21, we have intelligence that Syrian \n     chemical weapons personnel were directed to cease operations. \n     At the same time, the regime intensified the artillery \n     barrage targeting many of the neighborhoods where chemical \n     attacks occurred. In the 24 hour period after the attack, we \n     detected indications of artillery and rocket fire at a rate \n     approximately four times higher than the ten preceding days. \n     We continued to see indications of sustained shelling in the \n     neighborhoods up until the morning of August 26.\n       To conclude, there is a substantial body of information \n     that implicates the Syrian government's responsibility in the \n     chemical weapons attack that took place on August 21. As \n     indicated, there is additional intelligence that remains \n     classified because of sources and methods concerns that is \n     being provided to Congress and international partners.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     Chemical Weapons Usage Since \n                              World War I\n\n       1,462 American soldiers were killed and 72,807 injured by \n     chemical weapons in World War I, one-third of all U.S. \n     casualties during the war.

Madam President, 12 years ago Al Qaeda terrorists \nattacked our homeland, killing nearly 3,000 people. I will never forget \nthe heroes of that day, many of whom laid down their lives for others.\n  Their courage is epitomized by the words spoken by a fire department \ncaptain at the World Trade Center. He radioed in to say, ``We're still \nheading up.'' Indeed, these firefighters were still heading up while \nothers were fleeing the flames and the acrid smoke. Where that kind of \ncourage and determination comes from is hard to contemplate, but we are \nso grateful our first responders have that kind of dedication and \ncourage.\n  Nor will I ever forget the many people who continue to live with the \nscars, whether they are civilians who lost a loved one that day, \nfirefighters, police officers, or other first responders who rushed to \nthe scene, or our brave military servicemembers who answered the call \nto defend our country in the years that followed. We must never lose \nsight of their sacrifice.\n  This week we have been considering the weighty issue of whether to \ngrant the administration the authority to use military force against \nSyria. This day, the anniversary of those horrific attacks on our \ncountry 12 years ago, should not pass without our calling attention to \nanother important matter of unfinished business critical to our \nnational security and to our Nation's conscience.\n  A year ago today terrorists with links to Al Qaeda attacked our \ndiplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya. Despite a steadily escalating \nstream of threat reporting, and an obvious inability of Libyan security \nforces to protect\n\n[[Page S6349]]\n\nour diplomatic personnel and our facilities, the State Department had \ndenied urgent requests for increased security measures. Officials kept \nthe woefully vulnerable Benghazi compound open, setting the stage for \nattackers to essentially walk right into the compound and set it \nablaze.\n  Tragically we lost four brave, dedicated diplomats and security \npersonnel that terrible day and night: Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods, Sean \nSmith, and Ambassador Chris Stevens. We laud their courage and we honor \ntheir memory, but we must also remedy the security failures and punish \nthose responsible for their deaths.\n  Today I draw attention to the lessons that must be learned from the \nattacks in Benghazi and to the work that still must be done to bring \nthe attackers to justice. First we must ensure that such wholesale \nfailure to read the signs of escalating danger and to respond to urgent \nsecurity needs never happens again.\n  Last year, as chairman and ranking member of the Senate Homeland \nSecurity Committee, former Senator Joe Lieberman and I conducted an \ninvestigation into the terrorist attacks at Benghazi. In our bipartisan \nreport entitled ``Flashing Red,'' we found the State Department \ndownplayed the terrorist threat in Benghazi despite numerous previous \nattacks on western targets, that they ignored repeated requests for \nadditional security, and that they insufficiently fortified a \nshamefully ill-protected American compound. The Benghazi facility \nshould either have been closed until security was strengthened or the \nthreat abated.\n  We identified changes that must be made, including greater attention \nto security at high-risk posts around the world and better management \nto ensure that the recommendations of previous security reviews are \nfully implemented. It was discouraging to read previous accountability \nreview board reports after the attacks in Africa, for example, back in \nthe late 1990s and see similar patterns of requests for security being \ndenied in Washington.\n  Second, Secretary of State John Kerry should hold personnel \naccountable for the problems identified in our committee report and by \nthe Accountability Review Board. After our committee and the ARB \nidentified systemic failures and leadership deficiencies that \ncontributed to the grossly inadequate security in Benghazi, it is \ntotally unacceptable for the State Department to hold no one \nresponsible for the broader mismanagement that occurred prior to the \nattack.\n  Finally, a year after the attack, the terrorists who invaded the \nBenghazi compound still have not been brought to justice despite \nrepeated promises and pledges by President Obama to do so.\n  After a long-delayed investigation, including a period of weeks when \nthe FBI agents were not allowed to even access the Benghazi facility, \nFederal authorities have recently filed criminal charges against \nseveral suspects. But serious questions remain about the pace, the \nextent, and the effectiveness of these investigations and charges.\n\n  A major problem is the willingness--or lack thereof--of the Libyan \nGovernment to fully cooperate. I am told that the whereabouts of one of \nthe prime suspects is known and that he is walking about fully, openly, \nand freely. Yet he has not been picked up. He has not been arrested. He \nhas not been taken into captivity. Why not?\n  The administration must follow through on its commitment by taking \nthe steps necessary to bring the attackers to justice, as the President \npromised. And the State Department, in the meantime, must implement all \nof the actions needed to prevent a Benghazi-like attack from taking \nplace again. Surely, on the anniversary of the attacks on our Nation 12 \nyears ago and the attacks 1 year ago in Benghazi, we owe it to Chris \nStevens and his colleagues and to the American people.\n  Madam President, seeing no one seeking recognition, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE.

I also rise today to speak about the need for continued \nattention to our Nation's fiscal health and to encourage my colleagues \nto seize the opportunity to take the necessary steps to rein in our \nout-of-control spending. As so often happens this time of year, talk \nhas turned to the need for a continuing resolution for at least part of \nthe next year, and I urge my colleagues to join me in pushing for a CR \nthat respects the commitments we have already made.\n  As we all know, the President and the Congress approved the Budget \nControl Act in 2011, putting in place annual spending caps and \nestablishing a deficit reduction commission to find additional savings \nand solutions to ensure the solvency of our entitlement programs. With \nthe failure of that commission, a sequester that forced $1.2 trillion \nin automatic spending reductions was put in place. In the absence of an \nagreement to replace them, the caps and sequester guarantee at least $2 \ntrillion in deficit reduction.\n  Seventy-four Members of the Senate believed these enforcement \nmeasures were needed to put us on the right fiscal track. The President \nsigned the Budget Control Act into law, saying that, ``It's an \nimportant first step to ensuring that, as a Nation, we live within our \nmeans.'' Yet there are continuing conversations about passing a short-\nterm continuing resolution that would fund the government at a level \nabove that established by the Budget Control Act for next year.\n  I should have to remind no one that under the Budget Control Act, \npassing a continuing resolution at anything higher than the $967 \nbillion limit would trigger another statutory, across-the-board \nsequester cut in January that would bring spending down to the $967 \nbillion level for the next fiscal year of 2014.\n  I can see why there are those who would like to take such action. \nPassing a CR at a higher-than-BCA-appropriate level would create yet \nanother fiscal cliff, with hopes, I am sure, of causing enough pressure \nto finally do away with the sequester. That is what some would like. \nHowever, such a scenario does little to add pressure to address the \nsequester, provides the pretense that the BCA levels don't mean \nanything if even for a short while, and it further complicates agencies \nimplementing what are sure to be the required cuts.\n  Make no mistake, I understand the sequester process is a blunt \ninstrument and not a preferred method of fiscal restraint. However, it \nwas put in place because Congress failed to do what is needed to rein \nin reckless spending.\n  I also understand the difficult position it puts agencies in, \nparticularly the Department of Defense. I am open to allowing \nreasonable flexibility and to replacing the sequester, albeit with \nchanges to mandatory spending and entitlements, and not hikes in taxes. \nBut that deal, much like the supercommittee's success, has been \nelusive, and to seek to pass a CR that doesn't reflect the reality of \nthe post-BCA world raises itself a set of problems. However, such a \nscenario does little to add pressure to address the sequester, as I \nmentioned. It simply would make it more difficult for agencies to \naddress their needs and to bring down their own spending.\n  Certainly, passing any budget bill for next year at levels in excess \nof those that are outlined in the Budget Control Act breaks any promise \nto ``live within our means.''\n\n[[Page S6350]]\n\n  In addition, passing a short-term CR that will allow agencies to \nspend money as if the sequester isn't imminent early next year only \ncomplicates their situation. This would force agencies to squeeze all \nthe necessary spending reductions in just over 9 months instead of an \nentire year. We can imagine the burdens that puts on agencies, \nparticularly the Department of Defense, with unique procurement \nrequirements.\n  A less charitable view of why anyone would seek to ignore, even for a \nshort time, the realities of the BCA would be that they might think \ndeficits have fallen and attention to our fiscal state is no longer \nneeded. In fact, the President recently told an audience that, ``We \ndon't have an urgent deficit crisis. The only crisis we have is one \nthat is manufactured in Washington.''\n  I beg to differ. Our fiscal problems aren't solved. In fact, we are \nstill on track to add $753 billion to our national debt in 2013. There \nis no doubt this is an improvement from past years. Yet the trillion-\ndollar deficits of the past 4 years are hardly appropriate benchmarks \nfor today. Even at $753 billion, this year's deficit is larger than any \nof those under any previous administration.\n  Meanwhile, our entitlement programs are still on track to be \ninsolvent, with Social Security Disability set to go broke by 2016, \nMedicare by 2026, and Social Security by 2033. This is simply not the \ntime to backpedal, by any means, on the agreement we made in 2011.\n  Congress and the President agree that the Budget Control Act is the \nfirst step needed toward budget deficit reduction. We must complete the \nfirst stride to set our Nation on the right course and prove to the \npublic we can address the even larger looming challenges we face, such \nas the solvency of our entitlement programs.\n  There is no doubt this is going to be a difficult job in the days to \ncome, and we must address it. I urge my colleagues to keep their \npromise and push for appropriations bills that responsibly respect the \nspending limits outlined in the Budget Control Act. To that aim, I \ninvite my colleagues to join me in sending a letter to the majority \nleader asking him to bring to the Senate floor a fiscal year 2014 \nspending bill that abides by the $967 billion discretionary limit that \nis required by law.\n  Let us continue the progress that has been made so far and keep our \npromise to fight for a more sound fiscal future.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have spoken with the White House, I have \nspoken with the Republican leader, and we have agreed on a way forward \nbased on the President's speech last night.\n  As the President told the Nation last night, the President has asked \nCongress to postpone a vote to authorize the use of force in Syria and \npursue instead a diplomatic path to see if that works.\n  Tomorrow sometime, in Geneva, Secretary Kerry is meeting with Russian \nForeign Minister Lavrov. So it is right that the Senate turn from the \nSyria resolution while the Secretary of State pursues these important \ndiplomatic discussions.\n  As I said this morning, Congress will be watching these negotiations \nvery closely. If there is any indication that they are not serious, or \nthat they are being used as a ploy for delay, then the Congress stands \nready to return to the Syria resolution to give the President the \nauthority to hold the Asad regime accountable for the pain, suffering, \nand death it caused with those chemical weapons.\n  In the meantime, the Republican leader and I have agreed the Senate \nwill return to the Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency bill. Senator \nShaheen, Senator Portman, and the chairman of the committee, Senator \nWyden, have talked to me many times over a period of more than a year \nto move this legislation forward. So I think it is appropriate that, \nrather than us sit here and tread water, doing nothing, we should move \nforward on this legislation.\n  As the agreement will indicate, so as not to interfere with the \ndiplomatic discussions going on, we have agreed that the Senate will \nconsider no amendments on the energy efficiency bill relative to Syria \nor the use of force. I have talked to a number of the Republican \nSenators and that is certainly fine with them.\n  We look forward to considering amendments on issues domestic in \nnature and passing this important piece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/11/senate-section/article/S6350-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the motion to \nproceed to S. 1392 is agreed to and the clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1392) to promote energy savings in residential \n     buildings and industry, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, let me thank \nthe leader for making sure we could have this opportunity to deal with \none of the crucial issues of our time. Leader Reid has a long history \nin energy efficiency, in renewable energy. I thank him for his \nleadership and particularly the opportunity to be on the floor this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, today the Senate has the chance to put \nmore points on the board for the creation of good-paying jobs, a more \nproductive economy, and greater energy security.\n  Before the August recess, the Congress put some initial points up by \npassing hydropower legislation. This legislation was called, by the New \nYork Times: The first significant energy legislation to become law \nsince 2009. Those hydropower bills might have been called small by \nsome, but experts say they can generate a large amount of power.\n  Hydropower is 60 percent of the renewable, clean power in America. \nAnd hydropower has the potential to add 60,000 more megawatts of \ncapacity by 2025, according to the National Hydropower Association. \nThat is enough energy to power more than 46 million homes. Hydro helps \nto make our economy less dependent on fossil fuels, and it does it in a \nway Democrats and Republicans can come together on.\n  Today, as we look at another critical part of modernizing energy \npolicy, I want to start by saying it has almost become obligatory for \nMembers of Congress to say they are for an ``all of the\n\n[[Page S6351]]\n\nabove'' energy policy. It is almost as though a U.S. Senator has to say \nthat on energy they are for ``all of the above'' three or four times \nevery 15, 20 minutes or else it is not a real discussion about energy \npolicy.\n  But here is what is important and I think critical as we start the \ndebate--where I see my friend from New Hampshire and my friend from \nOhio--the reality is, you cannot have an ``all of the above'' energy \npolicy in this country without energy efficiency. It is that simple. If \nyou are serious about an ``all of the above'' energy policy--and we \nhave essentially several Democrats and several Republicans on the floor \nnow to demonstrate the seriousness of this issue--you cannot have an \n``all of the above'' energy policy without energy efficiency.\n  So this legislation is on the floor today thanks to the tireless \nbipartisan efforts of Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman.\n  I am also very pleased the ranking minority member of the committee \nis here, Senator Murkowski of Alaska. She consistently meets me halfway \nin terms of trying to deal with these kinds of issues. As we begin this \ndebate--which I would also mention to colleagues is essentially the \nfirst stand-alone energy bill to be debated on the floor of the Senate \nsince 2007--it would not be possible without the cooperation and the \ngood counsel of the ranking minority member, Senator Murkowski. I want \nher to know how much I appreciate our partnership. We just got through \nour weekly session this morning as we look at various kinds of \nbusinesses. We hope to be able to bring to the Senate helium \nlegislation, which we know a lot of Senators care about, very quickly \nas well. But there is a reason we are back to energy policy in the \nSenate, and that is, to a great extent, because of the cooperation \nSenator Murkowski has shown.\n  This bill--and one of the reasons it is bipartisan--gives us a chance \nto cut waste in our energy system and create jobs. This bill would take \nthe biggest step in years toward tapping the potential for energy \npolicy.\n  The legislation saves about 2.9 billion megawatt hours of electricity \nby 2030, according to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient \nEconomy. I say to my colleagues, I thought I would start by translating \nthat into something that becomes a little easier to put your arms \naround.\n  To generate those kinds of savings in electricity--2.9 billion \nmegawatt hours--the United States would have to build 10 new nuclear \npowerplants at a cost of billions of dollars each and run them for more \nthan 20 years.\n  The heart of this bill is updating voluntary building codes to make \nhomes and businesses more efficient, and it is about installing new \nwires and pipes and machines and insulation. Here is what I want \ncolleagues to know as we start this discussion: There is money to be \nmade in those pipes and that installation. Businesses know that. That \nis why more than 250 companies and associations have endorsed this \nbill, including the Chamber of Commerce.\n  When you look at those who have endorsed this piece of legislation, \nit is not a who's who of sort of bleeding-heart environmental folks. I \nwas particularly struck by the headline in a Forbes article last month. \nThey say: ``The Shaheen-Portman Energy Savings Act: It's The Economy, \nStupid.'' They sure got that right.\n  If the Congress passes this bill, it is going to immediately become a \nsignificant job creator, generating an estimated 136,000 new jobs by \n2025.\n  It will also make a significant difference in our country's energy \nproductivity, and that means savings for families, building fewer \npowerplants, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n  If we continue business as usual--people say: Oh, gee, we are not \nreally going to pursue this now--the U.S. Energy Information \nAdministration--that is really our statistical arm of the Energy \nDepartment--predicts that our country would use 30 percent more \nelectricity by 2040.\n  But there is an alternative, and that is harnessing the potential of \nefficiency technologies that actually reduce electricity from today's \ndemand and reduce the use of energy even as our economy and population \ngrows.\n  The amount of new energy productivity we gain would be like doubling \nthe number of houses in America and then powering all of them without \never adding a new powerplant to the grid.\n  Choosing the more efficient path we are going to advocate for on the \nfloor of the Senate would mean adding 1.3 million jobs by the middle of \nthe century. Families could shave off one-third of their electricity \nbills, an average savings of about $600 per year, according to experts \nin the field, a big increase in productivity.\n  So already we have talked about job creation, we have talked about \nproductivity, two areas where I do not see some kind of artificial line \nbetween Democrats and Republicans here in the Senate. I see areas we \nall feel strongly about.\n  On the other hand, meeting our country's projected electricity demand \nwith today's energy mix and 40 percent coal requires building at least \n100 new coal-fired powerplants over 25 years.\n  We are also going to make the case during this debate that the \nFederal Government ought to be a leader in this. It is one thing to \ntalk about how everybody in America ought to do something, and then \nsay, oh, the Federal Government might get around to it someday. So we \nare saying, this is a chance for the Federal Government to save \ntaxpayers money and to play a strong role, a strong leadership role, \nparticularly by improving efficiency at the Federal data centers.\n  As more and more businesses move to the cloud, reducing energy use \nthere is extremely important. Again, the experts estimate these steps \non data center efficiency would save about 35 million megawatt hours of \nelectricity by 2030. We would save the same amount of energy by \npowering down 60 of the NSA's newest data centers for a year, but I am \ngoing to save that one for another day.\n  There is obviously room for Federal agencies to do more. The \ngovernment owns nearly 500,000 buildings. The Federal Government is the \nlargest landlord in America. Agencies are directed to buy and use \nhighly efficient equipment under two different executive orders. But \naccording to staff at the Energy Department, less than half of \ncommercial building equipment that agencies buy actually even complies \nwith the government's own rules. So I am going to be offering an \namendment to the bill that at least will provide some incentive to \nensure that agencies actually follow the rules of the government.\n  This bill, as I have indicated, is bipartisan. We have been able to \npass 62 bills out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, each \none with bipartisan support. This is what Senators have said they care \nabout, this is what the other body has said they care about.\n  Congressman Kevin McCarthy, the third ranking House Republican, said \nearlier this year, ``All American energy independence means taking a \nhard look at energy production, distribution, reliability and \nefficiency.'' In the House there is a bipartisan companion to this. In \nother words, we have the good fortune of having Senator Shaheen and \nSenator Portman working in a bipartisan way.\n  In the other body--and Senator Murkowski and I have met with the \nHouse Members interested in this issue--you have Congressman Peter \nWelch and Congressman Cory Gardner actually creating a bipartisan \ncaucus to promote new financing tools that aid energy efficiency \nprojects. Congressman Welch and Congressman McKinley have introduced \ncompanion legislation to the one we debate today.\n  If anything, one of our challenges is there is a pent-up demand to \ndebate energy issues in this Congress. If we voted for all of the \namendments I hear people say they want to do, we would probably be here \nuntil New Year's Eve being fed intravenously trying to figure out how \nto process all of them. We may not have time to address each and every \namendment, but I know of at least a dozen bipartisan amendments that \ncolleagues plan to offer that will produce even more energy savings for \nbusinesses and consumers, produce more jobs for the U.S. economy.\n  Nobody is going to be able to say this is part of a dumb Federal \nmandate or some kind of ``run from Washington, one size fits all'' \napproach. These are approaches that look to productivity, the private \nsector for leadership and fresh ideas. For example, Senator Bennet and \nSenator Ayotte have a better building amendment. It strikes me as a \nvery sensible one.\n\n[[Page S6352]]\n\n  Senator Inhofe and Senator Carper have an amendment on thermal \nefficiency. Senator Klobuchar and Senator Hoeven have an amendment to \nhelp our nonprofits save energy. How can you make a logical case that \nwe should not try to work that out? Our nonprofits are being stretched \nto the limit. I saw that when I was in Alaska with Senator Murkowski. \nWe talked to some of the nonprofits. We see it in Oregon as well.\n  We have a bipartisan amendment from Senators Hoeven and Klobuchar to \ntry to help these nonprofits save energy. These are just a few of the \ngood amendments, in my view, that build on the outstanding work done by \nSenators Shaheen and Portman lo these several years. These amendments \nand the bill are going to help homes and businesses use less energy, \nsave money, create jobs, without mandates, without spending new Federal \nmoney.\n  It got out of our committee by a 19-to-3 vote. I believe the reason \nit did is because people said this is a commonsense approach to cutting \nenergy waste and showing folks across the land that there are things \nyou can agree on in the Senate and come together.\n  I am pleased to be here with Senator Murkowski. We have talked about \nthis a long time, to get the Senate back in the business of a modern \nenergy policy that creates jobs, that promotes energy security and \nproductivity. We started that with the hydropower legislation that was \nsigned into law right after we broke for the August recess. This is the \nnext logical step.\n  I will say to colleagues, I do not see how a Senator can say they are \nfor an ``all of the above'' energy policy in America without supporting \nenergy efficiency. This is the time. This is the bill.\n  I look forward to working with our colleagues. I hope they bring us \ntheir various and sundry amendments.\n  I yield the floor. I know Senator Murkowski has important comments to \nmake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the chairman of \nthe Energy Committee, for his comments on not only this very important \nlegislation but his leadership on energy issues as we have worked \ntogether on the Energy Committee, a committee that I know the Presiding \nOfficer enjoyed his time on, recognizing that there is so much we can \nbe doing as a Nation on a bipartisan basis to make a difference within \nour communities, across our regions, not only for the economy and jobs \nbut to make a difference globally in terms of how we handle our energy \nand our energy resources.\n  We talk a lot about the ``all of the above'' strategy, and perhaps \nthat has different interpretations depending upon what part of the \ncountry you are from. But one of the slogans that was going around a \nfew years back was: Produce more. Use less. Well, now we are talking \nabout the ``use less'' side of that ledger, equally important. I come \nfrom a producing State. But let me tell you when you come from a State \nwhere our energy costs are some of the highest in the Nation, if not \nthe highest in the Nation, we are also pretty good and wise about how \nwe use less.\n  I am very pleased that we are at this point today where we are \nfinally taking up the energy efficiency bill. The chairman has \nmentioned it has been a long time since we have seen energy legislation \ndebated here on the floor. I do find it troubling that we have gone so \nlong without meaningful and sustained debate about energy policy.\n  Each year our committee sends dozens of bills to the floor with our \nsignature stamp of bipartisan approval which I think is key. Yet for \nyears we have kind of seen the bills come to the floor and that has \nbeen the end of the road for those particular efforts. While a small \nnumber of our public lands bills are able to pass through by unanimous \nconsent, those that are related to energy, those that often need a \nlittle more work to pass this Chamber, are virtually never brought up \nfor further consideration.\n  I do understand we have all kinds of pressing matters in front of \nus--obviously the debate over the Syria resolution clearly one of them, \nthe continuing resolution that we will have in front of us as we work \nto fund the government, critically important. If we do reach agreement \non how we should proceed to either of those measures, I will certainly \nbe the first to agree they need to be brought forward for debate. But \nwhen we have finished those, I am hopeful we will return, if we have \nnot yet concluded, to energy legislation because it has been too long \nneglected in this Chamber.\n  I came to the position as ranking member of the Energy Committee back \nin 2009. I was very optimistic about what we would accomplish in this \narea. All of those of us on the committee had worked to deliver three \nmajor energy bills during the proceeding years I had been on the \ncommittee. We had the Energy Policy Act of 2005, we had the Gulf of \nMexico Energy Security Act of 2006, we had the Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act of 2007. All of them were partially or entirely written by \nour committee. They all received strong support in the Chamber, and \nthey all eventually became law.\n  Fast forward to where we are today. Our floor debate in 2007 remains \nthe last time, the last time the Senate truly engaged on energy policy. \nIn the interim, about the best we have seen are some amendments here \nand there along the process or perhaps dueling side-by-sides that seem \nare inevitably voted down.\n  But the lack of action on energy legislation is not because we have \nabandoned a bipartisan approach in committee. It is not because we have \nperhaps run out of good ideas. It is certainly not because we are \nsomehow unable or unwilling to report legislation to the full Senate. \nWe reported a comprehensive bill back in 2009 that sat on the calendar \nuntouched for 17 months. We unanimously reported a bill to help prevent \nanother offshore spill in 2010. That too was ignored.\n  The reality is we have one of the most bipartisan and active \ncommittees in the Senate. But, unfortunately, we are almost regularly \nin a situation where we are not provided the floor time needed to \ncomplete our work.\n  I am not complaining here, I am just pointing out some facts. But the \nchairman noted there has been this pent-up demand, this frustration, \nabout not only where we are in the process but the opportunities that \nare lost. When you think about the changing dynamic in this country \nsince 2009, I think about what has changed in the energy sector during \nthat course. The fact that we have not addressed real, fulsome energy \nlegislation is quite telling.\n  But I am hopeful the Senate is now finally on the verge of reversing \nits unfortunate approach to energy policy. As the chairman has noted, \nwe have already ordered more than 50 bills--50 bills--to be reported to \nthe Senate this year alone. Today, as we begin debate on the Energy \nSavings and Industrial Competitiveness Act--I do not even know why we \nare calling it that; we just call it Shaheen-Portman around here. The \nwork the authors of this legislation have done I certainly applaud.\n  But we are here at this point because of the very concerted efforts \nof the authors of this bill, Senators Portman and Shaheen, their great \nbipartisan work, months and months of negotiation, months of waiting. \nSo to be here today, to stand in support of this bill, is wonderful.\n  I have spent some time on this floor talking about an energy \nblueprint I had crafted back at the beginning of the year, Energy 20/\n20. I said this is 115 pages of energy policy, but it can be summed up \nin one bumper sticker. It says: Energy is good. The fact we are here on \nthe floor talking about energy efficiency is absolutely key.\n  When I mentioned that 20/20 blueprint, in it I make the point, I make \nthe push that we need to strive to make our energy more abundant, more \naffordable, clean, diverse, and secure. While we often focus on the \nmore obvious efforts to advance energy policy, in my case more \nproduction on Federal lands, passage of approval of the Keystone XL \nPipeline, the restoration of some real balance in new regulation, and I \nthink a much greater focus on innovation, it is also critically \nimportant that we look to the efficiency side. It must be a larger part \nof our energy debate. It deserves to be a larger part of our Nation's \nenergy policy.\n  The reasons why are no mystery. Efficiency is good for the economy \nand for our environment. It enables us to waste less and to use our \nresources\n\n[[Page S6353]]\n\nmore wisely--great conservative principles.\n  At the same time it can help create jobs and deliver lasting \nfinancial benefits. Study after study--and the chairman has pointed out \nsome of those--has shown we could save billions of dollars every year \nthrough reasonable efficiency improvements, whether in small \nappliances, large buildings, or someplace in between. These potential \nsavings cannot be overlooked at a time when we see so many of our \nfamilies and businesses are struggling to make ends meet, when our debt \nis escalating and the price of energy remains well above where most of \nus want it to be.\n  As policymakers, I can't think of efficiency as an energy issue \nalone. It is also a bottom-line issue that affects every one of us and \nevery one of our constituents back home.\n  While we can all agree on the importance of efficiency, we can also \nagree there is a legitimate debate over the Federal Government's role \nin this area. In my judgment, that role should be limited and the costs \nassociated with it should be minimal.\n  The Federal Government must itself be efficient as it pursues \nefficiency. I think these are areas we can work to enhance. We cannot \nsimply lavish subsidies, pass bill after bill, or impose mandate after \nmandate, and suggest that is somehow a pursuit of a greater good.\n  Instead, I think the Federal Government should strive to fulfill \nthree pretty distinct roles. It can act as a facilitator of information \nthat consumers and businesses need to make sound decisions. It can \nserve as a breaker of barriers that discourage or prevent rational \nefficiency improvements from being made. As the largest consumer of \nenergy in our country, it can lead by example by taking steps to reduce \nits own energy usage.\n  Those are the criteria by which we can evaluate whether the Federal \nGovernment is on the right track on energy efficiency and also the \ncriteria by which we can judge whether this particular bill, the \nShaheen-Portman bill, would improve our current policies.\n  Let me move to the bill for a moment and explain why I support it. \nFirst, the scope. The scope is both limited and appropriate. It does \nnot contain new mandates for the private sector, not for buildings, not \nfor appliances, not for anything. The provision on building codes is a \ngood example of what the bill does and does not do.\n  I would not be supporting a provision if it required the mandatory \nadoption of those codes, but in this bill it is voluntary, with the \nFederal Government stepping in to help facilitate new models that \nothers can choose to follow.\n  The second point here is the cost. We are all focusing on costs \nnowadays. The costs of this bill are fully offset. It contains no \ndirect spending. The only provision that received a score from the \nCongressional Budget Office has been dropped. A grants program that \npassed our committee has now been dropped as well. Some of these things \nwe look at and say we would rather they had been in there, but we are \ntrying to deal with the cost side.\n  I appreciate both Senators Shaheen and Portman for working with us on \nthat. The authorizations that remain in the bill have been fully offset \nby cutting a provision from the 2007 Energy bill. Any Federal dollars \nthat are ultimately spent on this legislation will have to be secured \nthrough a future appropriations process within the context of our \nlarger debate about the overall Federal budget.\n  The third point here is I support this bill because of the process \nthat was followed to bring it to this point. Again, I wish to give the \nchairman credit, and clearly Senators Shaheen and Portman. It was \nbipartisan from the beginning. The Senator from New Hampshire got \ntogether with the Senator from Ohio to lead its development.\n  I can remember the conversation years ago when he said: I am working \non this. It was long before there was any draft. It was working through \nin the kind of good old-fashioned, roll up your sleeves, let's work on \ndoing good things in energy policy when it comes to efficiency. I give \nhim full credit.\n  The committee held a hearing on this bill. We had testimony from the \nDepartment of Energy and other experts. We moved through to a markup. \nThis could be considered regular order. We improved the bill in the \nmarkup. We reported it favorably by a vote of 19 to 3. Possible \namendments have been worked on by members and staff alike over these \npast several months. I think there are many good amendments we all \nassume will easily win passage.\n  At the same time the bill's sponsors have continued to work to refine \nand improve the legislation leading to the product we have before us \ntoday. On scope and substance, on cost and on process, this bill has \nbeen a good example. This has been an example of regular order, working \nas usual, showing how the Senate can work, showing the Senate at its \nbest. The only trouble we have encountered is securing the floor time \nnecessary to try to secure its passage.\n  It is my hope with the efforts of the sponsors of this bill, with the \nefforts of the chairman of the Energy Committee continuing to push to \nbuild good things--rather than trying to blow up things--we will have \nan opportunity to see this measure enacted into law.\n  As I mentioned, we don't have an opportunity here on the floor of the \nSenate to debate energy often or as often as I would wish. By the looks \nof what we have pending in front of us, we recognize there may be \ninterruptions. It is my hope we can move quickly and take up many of \nthese bipartisan amendments Chairman Wyden has mentioned.\n  Let us make the most of the opportunity we have before us now. Let us \nweigh the Federal Government's proper role in efficiency. Let us make \nsure this bill reflects all of that. Let us start working through the \namendments that have been filed and move forward with a process that \nwill yield good policy for this country.\n  Again, I thank the sponsors for their yeoman's work in getting us to \nthis point, and I look forward to the discussion and the debate we will \nhave in the days ahead. I know Senator Shaheen, with all the work she \nhas put into this, is anxious to finally discuss her bill in the \nChamber.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. As my colleague Senator Murkowski said, I am thrilled \nto be here on the floor of the Senate today after 3 years of work with \nSenator Portman and so many other people to be talking about the Energy \nSavings and Industrial Competitiveness Act.\n  I wish to begin by thanking Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member \nMurkowski for all of the support and great work the Energy Committee \nhas done to help get this bill to the floor.\n  As they pointed out, and as I know the Presiding Officer knows, the \nEnergy Committee in the Senate has been very bipartisan. I had the \nopportunity to spend my first 4 years here on the Energy Committee and \nI can attest to that. I know what great work they have done. The fact \nthey have moved so many bills through the committee already speaks to \nthe consensus they have been able to build on the committee around \nenergy policy. Thank you both very much for all of that great work.\n  Thank you to my partner in this effort, Senator Portman of Ohio. He \nis not on floor right now, but I sort of claim him in New Hampshire \nbecause he went to Dartmouth, so we figure he has some New Hampshire \nroots. We have worked in a partnership on this legislation. It has been \na very bipartisan effort.\n  It reflects what I believe is an affordable approach to the use of \nenergy efficiency technologies. It will help create private sector \njobs. It will save businesses and consumers money. It will reduce \npollution, and it will make our country more energy independent.\n  I know we are all very aware of the crisis in Syria and how that \nlooms over this discussion. It couldn't be more timely over how we can \nmake this country more energy independent.\n  This bill, which Senator Portman and I have been working on for 3 \nyears, has been the result of years of meetings and negotiations, of \nbroad stakeholder outreach. It has been an effort to craft the most \neffective piece of energy legislation, efficiency legislation, with the \ngreatest chance of passing both Chambers of Congress and of being \nsigned into law.\n  The legislation will have a swift and measurable benefit to our \neconomy and our environment. In fact, as Senator\n\n[[Page S6354]]\n\nWyden pointed out, we had a recent study by experts at the American \nCouncil for an Energy-Efficient Economy, which found this legislation, \nif it is passed, has the potential to create 136,000 domestic jobs by \n2025. They did a study in the last Congress, when we first introduced \nthe bill, which showed in addition to that job creation, it would also \nsave consumers $4 billion by 2020 and be the equivalent of taking 5 \nmillion cars off the road. It is a huge benefit to our environment and \nto job creation, which is probably at the top of our agenda right now, \nand also for savings to consumers.\n  Simply put, as my colleagues have said, we need a comprehensive \nnational energy policy. We have been overly dependent on foreign oil. \nWe have been reliant on an outdated energy infrastructure. This is a \nsituation that hurts business and that also gives our overseas \ncompetitors an advantage.\n  We have to think about an ``all of the above'' strategy, as everybody \nhas commented, that utilizes a wide range of energy sources: natural \ngas, oil, nuclear, and renewables such as wind, biomass, and solar. \nThis will give us a stronger and more stable economy. We can't just \nfocus on the supply side, we also need to think about how we consume \nthe energy once we have it, the demand side.\n  Efficiency is the cheapest, fastest way to address our energy needs. \nEnergy savings techniques and technologies, lower costs--they free up \ncapital that allows business to expand and our economy to grow. I have \nbeen to so many businesses throughout New Hampshire in the last 3 years \nthat, because of their ability to save on their energy costs, have been \nable to stay competitive and have been able to add jobs. This has a \nreal benefit to our economy and to businesses.\n  Efficiency, as I said, is the fastest way to address our energy \nneeds. I think a lot of times people think about energy saving and \nenergy efficiency as turning down the thermostat, turning off the \nlights, putting on a sweater, but energy efficiency today is about a \nwhole lot more than that. We can start by improving our efficiency by \ninstalling ready and proven technologies. These are off the shelf. They \nare already available, such as modern heating and cooling systems, \nsmart meters, computer-controlled thermostats, and low-energy lighting. \nThese are all available today for the benefit of people who wish to \nsave on their energy consumption and their energy bills.\n  There are substantial opportunities that exist across all sectors of \nour economy to conserve energy and to create good-paying private sector \njobs. As we have already said, I think efficiency has a great shot at \npassing both the House and Senate and becoming law. Energy efficiency \nhas emerged as an excellent example of bipartisan and affordable \nopportunity to immediately grow our economy and improve our energy \nsecurity.\n  In addition to being affordable, efficiency is widely supported \nbecause its benefits aren't confined to a certain fuel source or a \nparticular region of the country. So much of the energy debate over the \nlast few years has been about who benefits, whether it is fossil fuels, \nalternatives, whether it is the Northeast, the South, the West. \nEverybody benefits from energy efficiency. It is one of the policy \nareas where we can come to a real agreement.\n  It is no wonder that this legislation, Shaheen-Portman, enjoys such \nlarge and diverse support. It has received more than 250 endorsements \nfrom a wide range of businesses, environmental groups, think tanks, and \ntrade associations, from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers to the National Resources Defense Council. \nThese are the types of nontraditional alliances that have helped us get \nthis bill to the floor.\n  Senator Portman and I worked with diverse groups to craft this year's \nbill, and we maintained a transparent and open process in which we \ntried to make sure all stakeholders had a meaningful opportunity to \ncomment on existing and proposed provisions and to suggest their \nsubstantive additions. So using that process of coalition building, we \nwere able to find common ground on a number of important provisions, \nincluding commercial and residential building efficiency codes, \nworkforce training, and language that aims to create a more robust \npublic-private partnership between DOE's Advanced Manufacturing Office \nand industrial energy consumers.\n  To talk a little about what is actually in the legislation, this bill \nprovides incentives and support but, as we have all said, no mandates \nfor residential and commercial buildings in order to cut energy use. \nThat is very important because buildings consume about 40 percent of \nthe energy used in the United States.\n  The bill strengthens voluntary national model building codes to make \nnew homes and commercial buildings more energy efficient, and it works \nwith State and private industry to make the code-writing process more \ntransparent.\n  The legislation trains the next generation of workers in energy \nefficient commercial building design and operation through university-\nbased building training and research assessment centers.\n  Shaheen-Portman assists our industrial manufacturing sector, which \nconsumes more energy than any other sector of the U.S. economy. The \nbill would direct the Department of Energy to work closely with private \nsector industrial partners to encourage research, development, and \ncommercialization of innovative energy efficient technology and \nprocesses for industrial application. This is something we heard very \nclearly from businesses throughout the country. They really need and \nthey want a more collaborative effort with the Department of Energy. \nThey want to feel as though the Department of Energy is working with \nthem. So hopefully these provisions will help make that happen.\n  It also helps businesses reduce energy costs and become more \ncompetitive by incentivizing the use of more energy efficient electric \nmotors and transformers.\n  It also establishes a DOE voluntary program called SupplySTAR, which \nis modeled on something that has been a great success, the ENERGY STAR \nProgram, to help make companies more aware of their supply chains and \nhow to make them more efficient as well.\n  The legislation requires the Federal Government, which is the single \nlargest user of energy in the country, to adopt more efficient building \nstandards and smart metering technology. The bill would require the \nFederal Government to adopt energy-saving technologies and operations \nfor computers. Our data centers are huge users of energy. It would \nallow Federal agencies to use existing funds to update plans for new \nFederal buildings using the most current building efficiency standards.\n  Finally, as has been said, this legislation is fully offset, so there \nis no new spending in this bill. We reallocate authorization from \nexisting programs.\n  To conclude--and I know we are going to have a lot of amendments to \nthis bill--we have a number of bipartisan amendments that are going to \nmake this bill better, that will make it more substantive, and I look \nforward to those amendments and to the debate we are going to have. I \nthink this is a bipartisan, affordable, and I believe widely supported \nfirst step as we begin addressing our Nation's very real energy needs, \nparticularly not just on the supply side but on the demand side.\n  As I have said, a lot of people have worked very hard to get this \nbill to the floor, and while I am not going to walk through who all of \nthose people are, I again thank Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member \nMurkowski for all of their support, and I thank Majority Leader Reid \nand Republican Leader McConnell for their support in reaching an \nagreement to get the bill to the floor.\n  I also thank three staff members whose hard work has really made this \npossible--first, someone who was in my office earlier but who has now \nmoved on, Trent Bauserman, who worked very hard to get us started on \nthe legislation; Robert Diznoff, who has now taken over in my office to \nwork on the bill; and Steve Kittredge from the office of Senator \nPortman. Without the three of them and without all of the other \nstaffers both in my office and in the office of Senator Portman and all \nof the people on the committee who have worked so hard, we would not be \nhere to have this debate today.\n  So I thank all of them, and I look forward to hearing the amendments\n\n[[Page S6355]]\n\nand the robust discussion on the floor and to continuing to work with \nmy colleague Senator Portman as we try to move this bill through the \nprocess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, we are finally here on the floor, and I \nwould like to thank my colleague Senator Shaheen for her comments and \nfor working with me over the last few years to get to this point where \nwe can be talking about something that brings us together, I hope, as a \nSenate, which is this effort to ensure that we have an energy plan for \nAmerica that can help bring back jobs, help fix our trade deficit, and \nhelp spark an American manufacturing renaissance, and that is the \nEnergy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act.\n  This is about energy efficiency. It is about using what we have more \nefficiently, and I think that makes a lot of sense for us to move \nforward. As Senator Shaheen said, it is a first step, but it is an \nimportant step.\n  I thank the chair and ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee--Senator Wyden, who spoke earlier, and Senator \nMurkowski, who is with us on the floor and who spoke earlier--for all \nthe support they have given us over the last few years to get this \nthrough the committee process and the markup process and to add some \nimportant elements to the legislation, and we will see more as the \namendment process proceeds. I also thank Leader Reid for helping us \nbring this bipartisan legislation to the floor today, and I thank \nSenator McConnell, who has been very supportive of us moving this \nprocess forward.\n  As has been said on the floor this afternoon, this is really the \nfirst substantive energy legislation we have seen on the floor in a \nwhile--maybe 6 years--and it requires help from both sides of the aisle \nto get to this point. It is bipartisan.\n  It is also supported, by the way, on both sides of the Capitol. We \nhave people in the House, including some House Members I spoke to \nearlier today, who are very interested in what we are doing over here \non this legislation because they have companion legislation--not \nidentical but similar legislation--in the House they are working on on \na bipartisan basis.\n  So this is one that I think has a good shot of getting through the \nSenate. I think it also has a good shot of getting through the House \nand going to the President for signature and helping to move America \nforward with a more sensible energy policy.\n  We are going to see a lot of amendments on the floor, and I think a \nnumber of these amendments will be bipartisan and will help improve the \nbill. In fact, I am looking at a list here of about a dozen bipartisan \namendments. These are amendments--some of which we talked about in \ncommittee, some of which have come since the process--that involve some \nvery thoughtful work done by our colleagues, and I am looking forward \nto having a debate on some of those. Actually, I have a list of 41 \nenergy efficiency-related relevant amendments here. So this is an \nopportunity for us to have a broader debate on energy but also to \nimprove the energy efficiency legislation before us.\n  Those of us on this side of the aisle talk about the need for an \n``all of the above'' energy policy, and I certainly believe in it. I \nthink we need to do everything we can to make ourselves more energy \nindependent so that we are not dependent on dangerous and volatile \nparts of the world, including the Mideast. We have certainly seen that \nhere in the last couple of weeks where what is happening in Syria and \nwhat is happening in Egypt affects what goes on here in this country in \nterms of our energy costs and certainly our economy. So this need for \nenergy efficiency should lead us to want to be sure we are including \nthis legislation in the mix.\n  We need a policy that harnesses more of our domestic resources. I \nbelieve in that. I believe we should be producing more energy in the \nground here in America. I am for producing more, but I am also for \nmaking sure we don't miss the other part of the equation, which is \nusing less. So I believe producing more and using less is a good \npolicy.\n  This is part of the using-less part that maybe we don't talk about as \nmuch on this side of the aisle, but it is also very important. It is \nimportant in part because it creates jobs. It is a bill that is \nsupported, by the way, by over 260 businesses, business association \nadvocacy groups, from the National Association of Manufacturers and the \nchamber of commerce to the Sierra Club and the Alliance to Save Energy. \nThe Christian Coalition is supporting it.\n  I have here a list of these 260 trade associations and business \norganizations because there are too many names to go through on the \nfloor, but it is a very impressive list.\n  I think the legislation got through the Senate Energy Committee with \na vote of 19 to 3 partly because of this support because members \nrealize this will help them and their constituents.\n  Simply put, I think this legislation that the senior Senator from New \nHampshire and I have worked on and proposed makes good environmental \nsense, I think it makes good energy sense, and I think it makes good \neconomic sense too.\n  I spent time visiting with businesses throughout my State of Ohio on \nthis bill and on this whole issue of energy, and they all say the same \nthing, which is pretty obvious, and that is that energy is an important \ncomponent of their business, it is part of the cost of doing business, \nand energy efficiency makes them more able to compete in the global \neconomy.\n  We do live in a global economy, and every day businesses in my State \ngo up against businesses not just in other States but in other \ncountries. We are not going to be able to compete on everything. We \ndon't want to compete on wages with developing countries, for instance. \nWe want to have good wages and good benefits in this country. We can \ncompete on the quality of the goods we produce. We want to keep that \nquality high. But we have to be sure we are giving these businesses the \nability to compete by helping to keep their energy costs low--again \nproducing more and using less.\n  What this legislation does--and it is very significant--is it helps \nthe private sector develop the energy efficiency techniques, \ntechnologies of the future. We make it easier for employers to use \ntools that will reduce their costs, enabling them to put those savings \ntoward expanding jobs, plants, equipment, and hiring new workers. The \nproposals contained in our bill are commonsense reforms we have needed \nfor a long time.\n  The bill contains no mandates. Let me repeat that. There are no \nmandates in this legislation on the private sector, period. In fact, \nmany of our proposals come as a direct result of conversations we have \nhad with folks in the private sector about how the Federal Government \ncan help them to become more energy efficient and to save money, which \nthey can then reinvest in their businesses and communities.\n  Here is a brief overview of some of the major parts of the \nlegislation, some of which have already been described ably by my \ncolleague from New Hampshire, but I just want to review them quickly.\n  First, it does specifically help manufacturing. It reforms what is \ncalled the Advanced Manufacturing Office at the Department of Energy by \nproviding clear guidelines on its responsibilities, one of which ought \nto be to help manufacturers develop energy-saving technologies for \ntheir businesses. This is a shift. We think it is important. We think \nthey have gotten away from that a little bit--the Department of \nEnergy--and we need to be sure they get back to it.\n  It facilitates the already existing efforts of companies around the \ncountry that are trying to implement cost-saving energy efficiency \npolicies by streamlining the way government agencies in this arena work \nwith them.\n  It also increases partnerships with national labs. The national \nlaboratories have a lot of great research, and we want to be sure it is \ncommercialized and shared with the private sector.\n  Also, it increases partnerships with energy and service technology \nproviders and the national labs together to leverage private sector \nexpertise toward energy efficiency goals.\n  The legislation strengthens the model building codes so that builders \nin States that choose to adopt them will have the most up-to-date \nenergy efficient codes developed anywhere--best practices.\n  The legislation establishes university-based building training and \nassessment centers. Industrial assessments centers are located around \nthe country.\n\n[[Page S6356]]\n\nThere is one in Dayton, OH. I had the opportunity to visit with one of \nthe researchers there recently, who was out working with midsized \nsmaller companies, helping make them more energy efficient. They are \nstrongly in support of this legislation because they want to expand the \ngood work they are doing to help more businesses be more energy \nefficient, be more competitive, and add more jobs.\n  Under this legislation, these centers also will be helping to train \nthe next generation of workers in energy efficient building design and \noperation. Not only will these programs save energy, but they will also \nhelp provide our students and unemployed workers who need these skills \nwith the skills they will need to compete in this growing energy field.\n  To repeat, this bill is not about forcing companies to become more \nenergy efficient or imposing mandates. It is about incentives, and it \nis about giving these companies the help they are asking for. And we \ncan do it at no additional expense to the taxpayer. Why? Because the \ncost of this legislation is fully offset. In other words, we change \nother programs at the Department of Energy to pay for the cost of this \nlegislation.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, it has no impact. It is \ndeficit neutral. But in fact it will save taxpayers money, because all \nof us as taxpayers will save money because of another provision of the \nlegislation, and that is because we go after the largest energy user in \nthe world to try to make them more efficient. That is the United States \nGovernment. We want to be sure the United States Government starts to \npractice what it preaches, because as it talks to the rest of us about \nthe need for more energy efficiency, we find that at the Federal \nGovernment there are lots of opportunities to make them less wasteful \nand more efficient.\n  It directs the Department of Energy to issue recommendations that \nemploy energy efficiency on everything from computer hardware to \noperation and maintenance processes.\n  Senator Wyden had some good examples earlier of some of the waste in \nthe Federal Government that this bill will go after. This is smart \nbecause it is the right thing to do in order to save energy, but also \nit helps taxpayers because it is going to reduce the cost at the \nFederal Government.\n  It also takes an interesting commonsense step of allowing the General \nServices Administration to actually update the building designs they \nhave to meet energy-efficient standards that have been developed since \nthese designs were finalized, some of them many years ago, and they \ncan't update them. We certainly want to be sure the new Federal \nbuildings that are being constructed are using the most up-to-date \nefficiency standards. This legislation permits that to happen. The \ngovernment has been looking for places to tighten its belt. This is \none. Energy efficiency is a great place to start.\n  All this adds up to a piece of legislation that Americans across the \nspectrum can support. It is fully offset, it contains no mandates, it \nrequires the Federal Government to be more efficient.\n  According to a recent study of our legislation, in 12 years, by 2025, \nShaheen-Portman is estimated to aid in the creation of 136,000 new \njobs. The report says it is going to save consumers $13.7 billion a \nyear in reduced energy costs by 2030. A vote on this legislation is a \ncritical step for achieving this goal of a true ``all of the above'' \nenergy strategy. It produces more energy at home, yes, but also uses \nless energy--and uses it more efficiently.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come down to the \nfloor, offer their amendments, let's have a good debate and discussion, \nand let's support this underlying bill. Let's be sure it leaves the \nSenate with a strong vote and, with it, rigorous debate to ensure it \ncan pass the House of Representatives where, as I said earlier, there \nis a lot of interest, and that it can go to the President for his \nsignature to take this important step toward making this country more \ncompetitive, more energy efficient, less dependent on foreign oil, and \ncreating more jobs in the process while improving the environment. It \nis a win-win-win.\n  I thank my colleague from New Hampshire and the chair and ranking \nmember of the Energy Committee. We look forward to entertaining some \namendments and look forward to being here on the floor talking about a \nway to move our country forward in a way that provides a model on \nmoving the Senate forward on other bipartisan measures.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1858\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for a study and report on standby usage power \nstandards implemented by States and other industrialized nations)\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1858.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden] for Mr. Merkley, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1858.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in my view, this is a very practical \namendment offered by my friend and colleague from Oregon Senator \nMerkley. It involves a study on standby power.\n  The amendment would, in effect, fund the study at the Department of \nEnergy to look at standby power standards in States and other parts of \nthe world to determine what is the most feasible and practical way to \napproach it. There is no authorization here.\n  I think it is pretty obvious to Members of the Senate, there are a \nlarge number of electronic products, from televisions, cell phone \nchargers, to microwaves, that cannot be completely turned off without \nbeing unplugged, and we ought to find ways to reduce wasted standby \npower.\n  It is my intention to support this amendment. I think it is a \npractical idea. I yield any time to Senator Merkley to explain his \nthoughtful amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I thank my senior colleague from Oregon. \nI appreciate very much his calling up this amendment and for his \nleadership on energy, and specifically energy efficiency.\n  I would also like to compliment my colleagues from Ohio and New \nHampshire, who have worked so hard on this very valuable piece of the \nenergy puzzle: How do we more efficiently utilize energy that we \ngenerate?\n  Specifically, this amendment is related to standby power, the power \nthat is wasted keeping devices ready to use at a moment's notice. I \nprefer the term ``vampire'' power or ``vampire'' electronics. This is \nthe power our electronics suck out of our power system when they are \ndoing absolutely nothing. So this challenge of loss to vampire \nelectronics is certainly something we ought to take on.\n  Many electronic devices, from televisions to desktop computers, cell \nphone chargers, microwaves, use energy when they are turned off but are \nstill plugged in. Often, you will see that little light that tells you \nit is still plugged in. This wasted energy accounts for roughly 5 \npercent of residential electricity use. So about 1 kilowatt in every 20 \nor $1 in every $20 is utilized to keep those little lights blinking.\n  The United States has yet to establish standards for efficiency in \nproducts related to standby power. Some States have done so, and other \nindustrialized nations have taken action. This amendment would simply \ntell the Department to look at the standards established elsewhere in \nthe world, or in individual States, compare them and analyze them, so \nwe can consider whether a lot more could be done in\n\n[[Page S6357]]\n\nthe United States to make us more efficient. That efficiency is like \nproducing free, available power by ending the waste. In fact, the EPA \nestimates 100 billion kilowatt hours of electricity are wasted by \nvampire electronics each year. That adds up to $10 billion in extra \nenergy costs.\n  Depending on the age of components, running a cable box or large-\nscreen TV, a DVD player, a gaming console, surround sound setup, could \nbe like running a significant refrigerator, a significant power draw, \nand DOE believes it is feasible to reduce this waste from standby power \nby about 75 percent.\n  The value of that 75-percent reduction would be equivalent to \nerecting 25,000 3-megawatt wind turbines for free. That is a lot of \nwind power being utilized. So let's do it.\n  Under this amendment, the Department of Energy is instructed to \nconduct a study of standards of standby power appliances and electronic \ndevices that have been implemented by other States or other \nindustrialized nations, and to evaluate which of the standards studied \nwould be feasible and appropriate in the United States. It is a simple \nidea and an important study that can contribute substantially to the \nuse of power effectively here in our economy.\n  I thank my colleagues for bringing this amendment forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, we are not going to vote on this amendment \nat this time. But when we do, I hope colleagues will support it. I \nthink it is a very fine amendment.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think there is a little confusion on the \nfloor. I have an amendment. I have talked to virtually everyone. In \nfact, I can't find one person opposed to it. It is very simple.\n  What I would ask is that I be able to set aside the pending amendment \nfor the purpose of considering my amendment No. 1851. Let me make that \nand see if there is objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me go ahead and tell the floor what it \nis all about. I know I am going to be wanting to come back to the floor \nand get this in the queue.\n  It is very rare in this body that we come up with something everyone \nis for, something that wasn't a part of the original legislation, for a \nvery good reason. We are talking about geothermal.\n  Right now we all recall in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, there is a \nprovision that requires the Federal Government have a percentage of its \nenergy be from renewable sources. The problem is this: Geothermal \ndoesn't create any new energy. It lets you use the energy that is \nthere, recover it, heat our homes, cool our homes, put it back, and \nthen reuse it again.\n  As I say, it is something everyone is for. It is 100 percent \nrenewable. The only oversight originally was that it did not actually \ncreate energy. The amendment would change this to allow geothermal heat \npumps to be among the renewable energies that could be used by the \nFederal Government to meet its obligation under the 2005 Energy law.\n  This amendment doesn't cost anything, it doesn't mandate anything. It \nsimply provides another acceptable way for the Federal Government to \nmeet its obligations in a cost-effective way. It is noncontroversial \nand something everyone wants.\n  It would be my hope after that explanation the Senator from Louisiana \nwould be willing to let me bring it up for the purpose of considering \nit, putting it in the queue, and then going back to where we were, \nacknowledging objections that he might have to other amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Unfortunately, I am going to have to sustain my \nobjection. But I am very hopeful this can be worked out in short order, \nas soon as a vote on my amendment is locked down. In fact, I will go \nthis far. It doesn't even have to be on this bill. It does have to be \nin the near future, because the issue with regard to which I am very \nconcerned happens on October 1. So this is an extremely time-sensitive \nissue.\n  I have had good discussions with the majority, and it seems as though \nwe are going to be able to lock down that agreement hopefully very \nsoon. But until then, I am going to have to object.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I intend to support the Inhofe-Carper \namendment. In my view, this is really a commonsense clarification of \nexisting law. I want colleagues to have a sense that this is the kind \nof bipartisan work that Senator Murkowski talked about earlier, that we \nhave been trying to do to try to come to the Senate with ideas that \nreally pass the smell test. I mean they are common sense, they are \npractical.\n  In that context, this amendment modifies the existing definition of \nrenewable energy to provide that thermal energy that is generated \nfrom--from renewable energy sources ought to be considered renewable \nenergy for Federal energy purchase requirements. For example, if a \nFederal agency has access to thermal energy from groundwater to heat or \ncool its facilities, under the Inhofe-Carper amendment that thermal \nenergy would be considered renewable energy produced just as if the \nbuildings had solar or wind power to produce electricity.\n  I hope colleagues, in this spirit, will bring us these kinds of \nsuggestions and ideas. Senator Inhofe brought this to us early on. I \nknow we are going to have some more discussion because of its \nconnection to other matters, but I hope we will get a vote. It is \ncommon sense. It is practical. I intend to support it. I want the \nrecord to reflect that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, as author, with Senator Shaheen, of the \nunderlying bill, I have a list of a dozen or so bipartisan amendments \nthat I would love to see us have a debate on, including the Inhofe \namendment. The Inhofe-Carper amendment is a great example, as the \nchairman just said, of one that actually improves the bill. As I said, \nthere are some amendments we may not find bipartisan, but this is one, \nand it is common sense. I appreciate him working with the committee and \nworking with us, and I just wish we could get it up for a vote and get \nit filed today.\n  I hope we can work out our differences on other amendments that are \nnot relevant to the legislation so we can go ahead with some of this \ndebate. My sense is that we have a good chance of doing that. Let's \nfigure out how to come together with a practical solution to be able to \nprovide a vote but also to allow us to proceed with this debate.\n  Senator Inhofe came over here to offer his amendment. He wasn't able \nto. I hope we can, for the next good bipartisan amendment, have that \nopportunity.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, let me offer this truly friendly \nsuggestion. I think we can proceed with this debate. Senator Portman \nsaid proceed with the debate. We can proceed with this debate right \nnow. We can bring amendments to the floor, we can talk about them, we \ncan have a full debate on any amendment folks want to bring to the \nfloor. I encourage that. I think that will move the process along \nbecause we can basically do all of the substantive debate on these \namendments. The only\n\n[[Page S6358]]\n\nthing I am talking about is a technicality, which is making the \namendment pending. That is a technicality that does not have to stop or \ndelay or prohibit any debate.\n  My suggestion is to move full forward with that debate as we work out \nthis agreement. I am fully prepared in the same way to discuss and \ndebate my amendment. I am ready to do that whenever it is appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I don't recall this happening before. Regarding the very \namendment that is an obstacle, keeping me from the vote, I ask \nunanimous consent right now to become a cosponsor of that amendment, \nthe Vitter amendment I am talking about.\n  I know what he is trying to do. I know he is going to make an effort \nto get this done maybe in other legislation if it does not happen here. \nI will be joining him in his cause. I see this as a separate matter \nhere, as I say. We want to move this along. Everyone agrees to. I will \nstand by and see if anyone changes their mind.\n  Thank you, I say to the chairman and ranking member. Thank you for \nthe very kind comments on my amendment.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I was next going to ask \nunanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and call up my \namendment No. 1845. I understand the Senate is in an a bit of an \nimpasse, but, if I might, I would like to talk about my amendment \nwithout calling it up with the hope that later my friend and colleague \nSenator Wyden will be able to call up my amendment and put it on the \nlist of pending amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I am going to talk a little bit about this \nimportant effort which has been authored in partnership with my good \nfriend from the wonderful State of Maine, Senator Collins. I wish to \ntake a minute before I do that and say how important it is that we are \nfinally debating, for the first time in years, an energy bill in the \nSenate. The fact that we are here today beginning this important debate \nis a huge testament to my colleague from the great State of New \nHampshire, Senator Shaheen, and my good friend from the days I served \nin the House and now fellow Senator from the great State of Ohio, \nSenator Portman, and the leadership of Chairman Wyden and Ranking \nMember Murkowski.\n  I think Senator Portman and Senator Shaheen are saying this in every \nway possible: For our country to truly realize energy independence, \nenergy security, we need to efficiently use the energy we have. That is \nexactly what Senators Portman and Shaheen envision with their \nlegislation. We support energy security, and we save Americans money.\n  With that background, let me turn to our amendment. Improving the \nenergy efficiency of our schools is a no-brainer, and that is why I am \nproud to partner with Senator Collins to make sure our efforts have the \nbiggest bang for the buck. This is a bipartisan amendment. It will help \nstreamline efforts to improve the energy efficiency of our Nation's \nschools while, most importantly, strengthening our children's \neducation.\n  Our schools are often confused by where to go and whom to work with \nto pursue energy efficiency efforts and education, and this is in part \nbecause of how many agencies, departments, State governments, and the \nlike are involved. By providing a coordinating structure for schools to \nbetter navigate existing Federal programs and the financing options \navailable to them, we are going to pare back duplicative efforts and \nmake it easier for schools across my State of Colorado and across the \nUnited States to save thousands of taxpayer dollars each year that then \ncan be reinvested in strengthening our education system.\n  The amendment also has the dual benefit of making Federal programs \nwork better for our schools while still leaving decisions to the \nStates, school boards, and local officials to determine what is best \nfor their schools.\n  This is a commonsense amendment. I truly hope we get a chance to \ndebate it and to have an up-or-down vote on it.\n  Before I yield the floor, I would also like to point out--I know my \ncolleague Senator Wyden is well aware of this, as are Senator Shaheen, \nSenator Portman, and Senator Murkowski--that when we have schools that \noperate on an energy efficient basis, studies show our young people, \nour children learn more effectively because if you are in an \nenvironment that is comfortable, where the light is appropriate, where \nyou can see, where you can take in what is being taught, you are, of \ncourse, going to have a better educational experience.\n  A better educated America means a stronger America, means a more \nproductive America, a more competitive America. This has benefits \nacross the board in every way imaginable--the broader effort that \nSenators Shaheen and Portman brought forth but also that Senators Wyden \nand Murkowski are handling here on the floor of the Senate.\n  I wish to draw attention to this important amendment. I thank my \ncolleague Senator Collins. I know she will be here later to talk about \nher perspectives and the other good work she is going to do when it \ncomes to this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor of the Senate, I \nwish to commend my colleague from Colorado, Senator Udall. This is a \npractical, commonsense amendment. There is no new expenditure of \nFederal funds. I am very pleased my colleague brought it to the floor. \nIt is reflective of the approach we see in the Energy Committee in a \nhost of areas where the Senator from Colorado consistently tries to \nfind common ground and act in a bipartisan way.\n  One of the reasons I wanted to speak for just a minute is now we are \nseeing these bipartisan amendments are starting to sort of pile up. \nThat is because colleagues are listening to what folks at home are \nsaying. They are saying to Senator Udall and Senator Shaheen and \nSenator Portman and myself--Senator Murkowski, they are saying when you \nall are back there in the fall: Try to find some ways to get things \ndone. Get people to work together.\n  I think we all understand how important energy is--and energy \nsecurity. It is about jobs. It is about a cleaner environment. It about \nproductivity. When I look at the specifics of this amendment Senator \nUdall and Senator Collins are pursuing, sometimes I think it is maybe \ntoo logical for the beltway. People say it makes too much sense. When \nschools do retrofits under the Collins-Udall amendment to become more \nenergy efficient and use cleaner power, the kids come out winners, the \nenvironment comes out a winner, and the taxpayers come out winners. \nThat is the whole reason the Federal Government provides assistance to \nschools for these types of projects in the first place.\n  It is an opportunity for the Federal Government to save money and \nensure that we maximize educational opportunities for the kids. The \nreality is that Federal school efficiency programs are now strewn, \nreally, all over the Federal Government. They are scattered among more \nthan six different agencies. The States have all these different \nprograms and incentives. What Senator Collins and Senator Udall seek to \ndo is to have a straightforward mechanism for improved Federal \ncoordination. In the real world that means we are going to have more \nenergy projects built, and it means more schools are going to save \nenergy and money.\n\n  I would also note--because my friend Senator Murkowski is here--that \nthe Udall-Collins amendment pretty much tracks something we have been \ninterested in. The committee has been looking at S. 1048, which was \nheard by the Energy Subcommittee on June 25.\n  Again, no authorization. The minimal costs are covered by existing \nDOE funds. I wish to commend the Senator from Colorado for his good \nwork and particularly the bipartisan focus he has put on this and \neverything else that has to do with his Senate business. I hope we will \nbe able to vote on it.\n\n[[Page S6359]]\n\n  As this debate starts, I want colleagues to see that we are going to \nstart stacking up good, commonsense, bipartisan amendments, and that is \nwhy there is so much value in energy efficiency.\n  Before Senator Udall came to the floor, I said we all get worked up \naround here by saying we are for ``all of the above'' energy policy. It \nis almost obligatory for a Senator to say they are for ``all of the \nabove'' three times every 10 or 15 minutes. A Senator can't be for an \n``all of the above'' energy policy unless they are for energy \nefficiency, and Senator Udall is bringing some of that sensible \nthinking to the schools.\n  I am looking forward to getting up this amendment so we can vote on \nit, and I commend Senator Udall for his good work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I, too, wish to thank the Senator from \nColorado and the Senator from Maine for their leadership in this area. \nWhen we talk about being efficient, we think: OK. Let's coordinate, \ncollaborate, and cooperate so we do better with what it is we are \nutilizing.\n  I will give an example of how something such as this can make a \ndifference in my State. I have noted before that our energy costs in \nAlaska are some of the highest in the Nation. Far too often our schools \nare in remote areas where basically they are not part of anybody's \ngrid. They are in communities that are diesel powered. It is a tough \nway to heat a community. Think about how expensive it then becomes for \nthe schools. The school has to absorb these energy costs.\n  Where do these dollars come from? Effectively, they come out of the \neducation budget, and the State does step in. The State provides \nsubstantial assistance, but anywhere, anytime or anyplace we can work \ntogether to, again, be more collaborative in our approach as to how we \ndeal with our efficiency opportunities will ultimately help our \nschools.\n  This is going to help the schools whether they are in Maine or Alaska \nor Colorado. Why these places are all colder I am not sure, but maybe \nit forces us to be a little more efficient. Maybe it forces us to \nfigure out ways to work together better. I want to make sure we are \nable to get the education dollars into the classroom and not basically \nfueling the boilers to keep the kids warm.\n  I applaud my colleagues in this effort. The goal to increase \ncoordination and cooperation at Federal, State, and local agencies to \nbe operating more efficiently and utilizing existing relationships is a \npositive.\n  Again, I commend my colleagues for their efforts in bringing us \nforward on this particular aspect of energy efficiency. I look forward \nto the opportunity where we will be able to show a good bipartisan vote \non this amendment and on others.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, I wish to congratulate the bill's \nsponsors, Senators Shaheen and Portman, for crafting the underlying \nbipartisan, commonsense energy efficiency bill.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of their legislation, and I am pleased \nto see that the bill is being considered and look forward to the debate \non energy efficiency.\n  I would hope that as we consider amendments to this bill, we could \nconsider amendments that relate to the issue of energy so we can make \nreal progress and that we don't end up--as happened before the recess \nwhen I was managing a bill on the transportation and housing \nappropriations for the minority side--distracted on two issues that had \nnothing to do with the underlying bill, important though it was.\n  I am very pleased to join my colleague, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Colorado Mr. Udall in sponsoring an amendment to help streamline \nthe available Federal Energy Efficiency Financing Program to help \nimprove the health and lower energy costs of our Nation's schools.\n  There are a number of Federal initiatives already available to \nschools to help them become more efficient. However, in many cases \nschools are not taking full advantage of these programs. I think this \nis particularly a problem in rural States such as Alaska or Maine, \nwhere the schools don't have the luxury of having grant writers who can \nspend all day searching for Federal funding that might allow them to \nupgrade their energy efficiency or reduce emissions from their energy \nsystems.\n  Large urban schools may have the ability to hire those full-time \ngrant writers, but I know in my State of Maine it is very difficult for \nschools to even become aware of these programs. One of the purposes of \nthe amendment that Senator Udall and I are offering is to help schools, \nregardless of their size, take advantage of existing programs.\n  I wish to stress that we are not creating a whole lot of new \nprograms. All we are doing is providing a streamlined coordinating \nstructure for schools to help them better navigate available Federal \nprograms and financing options. I also wish to emphasize--particularly \nto my Republican colleagues--that our amendment still leaves all the \ndecisions to the States, local school boards, and local officials about \nhow best to meet the energy needs of their schools.\n  So what does our amendment do? Specifically, the amendment would \nestablish the Department of Energy as the lead agency in coordinating a \ncross-developmental effort to help initiate, develop, and finance \nenergy efficiency, renewable energy, and retrofitting projects for our \nschools. It would also require a review of existing Federal programs \nand financing mechanisms, the formation of a streamlined process of \ncommunication and outreach to the States, local education agencies, and \nschools of these existing programs to make them more aware of their \nexistence, and the development of a mechanism for Governors, State \nenergy programs, and local educational and energy officials to form a \npeer-to-peer network to support the initiation of these projects.\n  Finally, the amendment would require the Department of Energy to \nprovide technical assistance to help schools navigate the financing and \ndevelopment of these projects. Assisting our Nation's schools in \nnavigating and tapping into existing Federal programs that will help \nthem lower their energy usage and save the taxpayers' money at a time \nof very tight and constrained educational budgets simply makes good \ncommon sense.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the Udall-\nCollins amendment numbered 1845. I thank not only the sponsors of the \nbill but the leaders of the energy committee, Senator Wyden and Senator \nMurkowski, for their help and assistance to us.\n  I hope we can start the debate on this bill on a positive note by \nadopting a bipartisan amendment that is going to help our schools save \nmoney, reduce energy costs, and also lower emissions. That is the way \nto start the debate on this bill.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senators Collins and Udall \nfor coming to the floor with their positive amendment, laying it out, \nand debating it. I encourage everyone with an interest in this bill--\nDemocrats and Republicans--to do the same. Come to the floor, lay out \namendments, and have that debate so we can move forward in a productive \nway as the first vote agreement is being worked on and finalized, and \nthat is what I am going to proceed to do with regard to my amendment.\n  My amendment is not related to this bill, but I have to bring it up \nnow because it is very time sensitive. It is about something that is \nvery wrong, in my opinion, that is happening October 1.\n  Many of us in this Chamber, and certainly myself, regularly talk \nagainst the exemptions under ObamaCare that are created for the rich \nand powerful and politically connected. Many in this body, including \nmyself, regularly talk about the abuses of this administration going \nbeyond their legitimate authority and what is in the law. They are \nmaking up stuff through Executive orders, rulemaking, and Executive \nfiat. As I said, I am certainly in that group.\n  I believe an action was taken recently that is a horrible, dangerous,\n\n[[Page S6360]]\n\nand offensive example of both of those things, and my amendment would \ncorrect that situation. I will back up and explain what I am talking \nabout.\n  Right after all of Congress left for the August recess--a little over \n1 month ago--the Office of Personnel Management, part of the Obama \nadministration, issued a draft rule. This draft rule was basically \ndesigned to take any of the sting of ObamaCare away for Washington \ninsiders--specifically Members of Congress and congressional staff.\n  During the ObamaCare debate, we debated an amendment on the Senate \nfloor, and it, to my pleasant surprise, was actually adopted. The \namendment said that every Member of Congress and all congressional \nstaff have to go to the exchange. They have to leave their very \ngenerous Federal employee health benefit coverage and go to the \nexchange. They have to go to the fallback position in terms of health \ncare coverage that millions of Americans are dealing with and have to \ngo to them right now or over the next several months. They have to live \nunder those same rules and under those same circumstances of those tens \nof millions of Americans.\n  I supported that. I think it is important that the ruling elite, if \nyou will, need to live under the same laws they created across the \nboard. Specifically, under ObamaCare, I think it is very important that \neverybody in Congress and in Washington--and I think this should be \nexpanded to the administration--live under the same system in terms of \nthe exchange that many of those folks created.\n  That was the statute that was supposed to govern. After ObamaCare \npassed, to quote Nancy Pelosi, folks started looking and reading the \nbill to figure out what was in it. Lots of folks in Washington got very \nconcerned once they read that revision and figured out what was in it. \nThey understood it would create real dislocation and sting, not for \nAmerica--although it does do that, but they were not concerned enough \nabout that--but for Washington.\n  For months, many people lobbied the administration to try to get \naround this and make up some regulation that would take the sting out \nof that provision. After intense lobbying, sure enough, the Obama \nadministration issued this rule--again, as I mentioned a minute ago--\nright after we left town and safely away at the start of the August \nrecess.\n  The rule did a few things, all of which I think are beyond the law, \ncontrary to law, and outrageous. First of all, it says the statute, \nwhich says all official staff of Members of Congress need to go to the \nexchanges--the first thing the rule says is we don't know what official \nstaff means, so we are going to leave it up to each individual Member \nof Congress to decide if any member of their staff is official staff. \nSo each Member of Congress can decide whether anybody on their staff \nhas to go to the exchange at all. I think that is ludicrous on its face \nand completely contrary to the statute.\n  But then the second big thing the rule did is made, out of thin air, \nthe rule that the present subsidy we get from the taxpayer for our \npresent health care coverage is going to somehow miraculously turn into \na subsidy on the exchange, which doesn't exist. It doesn't exist for us \nunder the law; it doesn't exist for any American. So they made up out \nof thin air this rule that the taxpayer-funded subsidy would follow all \nof these folks--Members of Congress and the staff who are required to \ngo there--to the exchange. Again, that is not in the law. That is \ncontrary to the letter and spirit of this provision. There is a \nseparate provision of ObamaCare that specifically says with regard to \nall individuals going to the exchange that when they do this, when they \ngo to a plan on the exchange, they lose their employer-provided \nsubsidy. So that is specific about the situation of folks going to the \nexchange and directly contrary to this law.\n  As I suggested at the beginning, I think this is a special exemption \nfor Washington, a special bailout for Washington, to ensure Washington \ndoesn't have to live by the same rules, in this case with regard to \nObamaCare and the exchanges, that all of America does, and it is beyond \nthe statute and it is beyond the President's constitutional authority. \nHe can't make things up out of thin air. For that reason, I have joined \nwith many colleagues to draft a bill which would make an amendment to \nthis bill to propose that would fix that, and it is no Washington \nexemption from ObamaCare.\n  Specifically, the bill would do three things: First of all, it does \naway with this OPM rule and it clarifies that Members don't get to pick \nand choose who is official staff. Congressional staff is congressional \nstaff.\n  Then it says, all Members of Congress, all congressional staff--and \nwe expand it to the President and Vice President and all political \nappointees of the Obama administration--all of those folks have to go \nto the exchanges, the clear language of present law with regard to \nMembers of Congress and their staff.\n  Finally, we fix the other part of this illegal rule. We say this \nsubsidy Members of Congress and staff currently enjoy under their \npresent health care coverage can't follow them to the exchange. That is \nnot the case for any other American. That is not in the law. In fact, \nin ObamaCare, there is a broader provision completely contrary to that, \nso we say that cannot happen.\n  That is what our bill and our amendment is.\n  I think it is a fundamental, a threshold, and a very important rule \nof democracy that the governors have to live by the same laws they pass \nand impose on the governed. I think that should be the case across the \nboard and certainly that should be the case under ObamaCare.\n  Tens of millions of Americans are experiencing having to go to the \nexchanges. Many of them didn't want to go there. Many of them had good \ncoverage with their employer that they are losing because of the \neconomics of this new situation, and they are being forced to the \nexchange. The clear language and intent of that provision in ObamaCare \nwas for Members of Congress and staff to have to experience the same \nthing, and that is the clear language and that is the clear intent. So \nwe should live by that, not get around it. And, in my opinion, we \nshould expand it to the President, who has volunteered to go to the \nexchange, to the Vice President, and to all of their political \nappointees. That is what our amendment does. That is what our bill \ndoes.\n  I wish to thank all of the Members, Senate and House, who were \nworking hard on this proposal, including Senators Enzi, Heller, \nJohnson, and many others. I know I am missing several. There are \nseveral House Members, led by Congressman Ron DeSantis of Florida, who \nare working on identical House language. They are hard at work, \nparticularly in the context of the CR.\n  The bottom line is this: There should be no special Washington \nexemption from ObamaCare. All laws we pass should apply to us every bit \nas much as other Americans, and certainly we, as is the clear language \nand is the clear intent, should live under that fallback plan of the \nexchanges just as every other American does. No other American gets \nthis special subsidy the OPM rule gives to us.\n  Folks in this class under my amendment and bill would be able to \nqualify for a subsidy, if it is the same subsidy that is available to \nother Americans, according to income category. So if a person qualifies \nby income, fine. But this is way beyond that. This is a special deal, a \nspecial exemption for Congress, and we need to say there should be no \nWashington exemption. This bill, this amendment does that clearly and \ncategorically.\n  I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to support this.\n  Let me end by talking about a vote. I am bringing up this amendment \non this bill. The reason is this issue is very time sensitive. This \nrule, which was made up out of thin air, in my opinion, goes into \neffect and all of this is set to happen October 1. So this debate has \nto happen, a change to this rule has to happen before October 1. That \nis why I am bringing it up now and demanding a vote. But, actually, \nthat vote doesn't have to be on this bill. I will accept any fair, \nreasonable, substantive vote before October 1. But we need to lock that \ndown. I think we are well on our way to locking that down, and I look \nforward to that.\n  In the meantime, let me again urge my colleagues who have amendments\n\n[[Page S6361]]\n\nto this bill on the subject of energy or on any other subject to come \ndown and present those on the floor, talk about them and debate them, \nas I have, as Senators Udall and Collins have. Let's move forward with \nthe process as we nail down this first vote agreement.\n  As we get to a vote on this amendment, I urge my colleagues to follow \nthe first and, in many ways, most basic rule of democracy: that the \nrules we impose on the governed we should live by. That is absolutely \nessential. That should be the case across the board, certainly \nincluding ObamaCare, and in the case of ObamaCare, there is specific \nlanguage which says that. That is what it says. That is what it is \nsupposed to be about. This illegal OPM rule completely invalidates and \ngets around that rule, so we need to act to fix that now, well before \nOctober 1.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1847.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Bennet] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1847.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, as I made clear previously but I will \nrestate, I objected to and I continue to object to laying aside any \namendment and making another amendment pending. We made that clear \nbetween the floor staff of the minority and majority side. That was \ncrystal clear, so I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the amendment from the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the calling \nup of the amendment be vitiated out of respect for my colleague from \nLouisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to very briefly thank the Senator. \nThat is a very generous and gentlemanly thing to do. This was the \nunderstanding between the floor staff. I know apparently it wasn't \nproperly communicated to the Chair, but that was the clear \nunderstanding, and I appreciate that gesture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, through the Chair, I would say to the \nSenator from Louisiana that my understanding was he would object. He \nwas on the floor when I offered it and I thought he was going to \nobject. So knowing of his objection, I withdraw the amendment.\n  Having said all of that, I think it is a shame that we can't get \ngoing with this bipartisan bill. I wish to thank the chairman and the \nranking member for their incredibly great bipartisan work on this \nenergy bill. I wish to thank Senator Jeanne Shaheen from New Hampshire \nand Senator Portman from Ohio for the bipartisan work that has been \ngoing on for months, if not years, on this bill.\n  I am pleased to come to the floor--I wish to introduce my amendment \nbut not today because of the objection, but to at least talk about a \nbipartisan amendment we would like to get on this bill. I wish to thank \nmy colleague Senator Ayotte for joining me in this important effort.\n  Our amendment is based on stand-alone legislation we have written \ncalled the Better Buildings Act, which encourages energy efficiency in \ncommercial buildings. Over the last several years we worked with \nbuilding owners across Colorado and the country to craft the \nlegislation. The economic and environmental benefits of improving \nenergy efficiency in buildings are clear.\n  A well-publicized retrofit of the Empire State Building in New York \nreduced energy usage by 38 percent--almost 40 percent--and it saved an \nestimated $4.4 million annually for the building owner. The retrofit \nalso created over 250 construction jobs right here in the United States \nthat can't be sent overseas.\n  It is this example, and these ideas, that helped form the basis for \nthe Better Buildings Act and this amendment.\n  In crafting the measure, we started to think about efficiency in \nbuildings not only from the top down where a building owner makes the \nimprovements, but also from the bottom up where a tenant would see \nadvantages from designing and configuring their rented office space in \nan energy-efficient manner. With all of that in mind, the amendment we \nhave introduced accomplishes two principal goals. First, it allows for \na first-of-its-kind study by the Department of Energy to chronicle \nprivate sector best practices as tenants build out their lease spaces \nin commercial buildings. This study would then inform a voluntary \nDepartment of Energy program to recognize tenants, to acknowledge \ntenants that design and construct high-performance lease spaces in the \nfuture.\n  The second provision, called Tenant Star, would expand on the popular \nENERGY STAR Program and make it available to tenants, not just \nlandlords. Under our amendment, tenants will be recognized for the \nefficient performance of their leased office space. This will provide \nvalue to their customers, their investors, and ultimately to the \nbuilding owner.\n  The ENERGY STAR label has proven a very powerful tool to achieve \nwhole building efficiency. Our language takes the next logical step and \nconfers this recognition on tenants as well.\n  This bipartisan amendment is broadly supported--from the Alliance to \nSave Energy to the Real Estate Roundtable, to the Sierra Club. It also \nreceived a favorable hearing in the Senate Energy Committee in June, \nand I thank the chairman for that. The Congressional Budget Office has \nconfirmed it has no score.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and commonsense \namendment. I hope we can get to the business of legislating around this \nincredibly important bipartisan bill.\n  With that, I thank the Presiding Officer for his patience, I yield \nthe floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Colorado on a \nfine amendment. I hope we are going to get a chance to vote on it. I \nthink he mentioned that commercial buildings consume almost half of the \nenergy used in the United States.\n  What I think is important for the Senate to see is the bipartisan \namendments are now piling up. We started off with a very good \namendment, the Inhofe-Carper amendment in terms of thermal power, \nSenator Udall and Senator Collins talking about retrofitting schools, \ngetting more for the kids and for a better environment without spending \nnew Federal money, and now we have the Bennet-Ayotte proposal to deal \nwith commercial buildings consuming almost half of the energy consumed \nin the United States.\n  You have bipartisan amendments, I say to my colleagues, in effect, \nstacking up on the floor of the Senate. I think the reason that is the \ncase is because Senators are coming back from the August break. They \nwere home having community meetings and talking to folks, and people \nsaid--whether you are from Ohio, like the Presiding Officer, or Oregon \nor New Hampshire, different parts of the country--you go back there and \nfind a way to deal with some real challenges, and do it in a bipartisan \nway. So that is what the underlying bill does. That is what the three \namendments we seek to be able to vote on do.\n  In the case of this particular amendment, the voluntary ENERGY STAR \nProgram has created an incentive for commercial building owners to \nincrease the efficiency of their buildings by recognizing the most \nefficient. So today there are over 20,000 commercial buildings in the \ncountry certified as highly efficient ENERGY STAR buildings.\n  The challenge, however, is that about half of the energy used in \ncommercial buildings is under the control of the tenants, not the \nowners. This amendment would promote efficiency in commercial buildings \nby establishing a\n\n[[Page S6362]]\n\nTenant Star program to recognize the energy efficiency achievements of \nbuilding tenants, as ENERGY STAR does for the owners.\n  We looked at this in the committee, particularly in the Energy \nSubcommittee on June 25. To me, again, trying to build on successful \napproaches is simply what the country wants us to be doing here in the \nSenate. It is the focus of the underlying bill. It is the focus of the \namendments that are pending--each one of them supported in a bipartisan \nway.\n  This amendment, as far as I can tell, has a real cross section of \nbusinesses interested, for obvious reasons. It constitutes almost half \nthe buildings in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support we \nreceived be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 24, 2013.\n     Re Better Buildings Act (S. 1191--``Tenant Star'').\n\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     Chair, Committee on Energy & Natural Resources, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Al Franken,\n     Chair, Subcommittee on Energy, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Michael Bennet,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Lisa Murkowski,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy & Natural Resources,U.S. \n         Senate.\n     Hon. Jim Risch,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Energy, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Kelly Ayotte,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senators: We represent real estate owners, developers, \n     building managers, energy service companies, efficiency \n     financing sources, environmental and efficiency advocates, \n     and other stakeholders who support market-based solutions to \n     lower energy consumption in our built environment. As the \n     Senate considers energy legislation, we support proposals \n     that encourage cooperation by landlords and tenants in our \n     nation's commercial buildings to save energy as leased spaces \n     in these structures are designed, constructed, used, and \n     occupied.\n       We thus commend Senators Bennet and Ayotte for introducing \n     S. 1191, the ``Better Buildings Act of 2013.'' The act takes \n     a market-driven, voluntary, ``best practices'' approach to \n     align building owners and their tenants to reduce demands on \n     the energy grid. As this proposal fits within existing \n     voluntary programs, it has no regulatory impact and does not \n     require new appropriations.\n       To date, bills addressing energy efficiency have focused on \n     how real estate owners and developers may lower energy \n     consumption at the ``whole-building'' level. But in fact, \n     owners and managers of large buildings control only about 50% \n     of their structures' total energy; tenants consume at least \n     half. The Better Buildings Act takes a holistic approach by \n     considering office tenants' impact on energy consumption and \n     behaviors. Notably, the act brings the voluntary ENERGY STAR \n     rating for whole-buildings to the next level by authorizing a \n     ``Tenant Star'' program to certify leased spaces in buildings \n     as energy efficient. Considering the overwhelming success and \n     private sector acceptance of ENERGY STAR for buildings--which \n     are located in all 50 states, represent billions of square \n     feet of commercial floorspace, and saved American businesses \n     over $2.7 billion in utility bills in 2012 alone--it is sound \n     energy policy to evolve this program to the ``Tenant Star'' \n     level of leased spaces.\n       We strongly support the Better Buildings Act and its \n     ``Tenant Star'' provisions. We urge the Senate to enact S. \n     1191 whether on its own or as part of any energy package that \n     may be put to a vote.\n\n\n  better buildings act (s. 1191/h.r. 2126)--``tenant star'' endorsers\n\n       Alliance to Save Energy, American Council for an Energy-\n     Efficient Economy, American Hotel & Lodging Association, \n     American Institute of Architects, American Resort Development \n     Association, American Society of Interior Designers (ASID), \n     ASHRAE, Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), Bayer \n     MaterialScience LLC, Boston Properties, Brandywine Realty \n     Trust, Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) \n     International, CBRE, Inc., CCIM Institute, Danfoss, EIFS \n     Industry Members Association (EIMA), Empire State Building \n     Company/Malkin Holdings, Energy Systems Group, First Potomac \n     Realty Trust, Illuminating Engineering Society (IES).\n       Institute for Market Transformation, Institute of Real \n     Estate Management, International Council of Shopping Centers, \n     Johnson Controls, Inc., Jones Lang LaSalle, LBA Realty, \n     LonMark International, Metrus Energy, Inc., NAIOP, the \n     Commercial Real Estate Development Association, National \n     Apartment Association, National Association of Energy Service \n     Companies (NAESCO), National Association of Home Builders, \n     National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, \n     National Association of REALTORS', National \n     Association of State Energy Officials, National Electrical \n     Manufacturers Association, National Fenestration Rating \n     Council (NFRC), National Multi Housing Council, Natural \n     Resources Defense Council.\n       OpenADR Alliance, Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors--\n     National Association, Prologis, Inc., Real Estate Board of \n     New York, Related Companies, Rising Realty Partners, Rudin \n     Management Company, Inc., Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning \n     Contractors National Association, Inc., Shorenstein \n     Properties LLC, Sierra Club, Spray Polyurethane Foam Alliance \n     (SPFA), SUN DAY Campaign, The Real Estate Roundtable, The \n     Stella Group, Ltd., Tishman Speyer, Transwestern, U.S. Green \n     Building Council, USAA Real Estate Co., Vinyl Siding \n     Institute, Vornado Realty Trust.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am going to stay here to see if other \ncolleagues would like to bring over their amendments. As I indicated in \nopening comments a couple hours ago, I think there are at least a dozen \ngood amendments here--amendments that are going to be good for American \nproductivity, they are going to create good-paying, high-skill jobs, \nand they are going to be winners for the environment. That is a \ntrifecta of valuable concerns being addressed with one piece of \nlegislation, being done in a bipartisan way.\n  I know the popular wisdom is you cannot thread the needle on \nlegislation and that even on something such as energy efficiency, these \nfolks are going to try to see if they can get their bipartisan \namendments passed, but at the end of the day, the forces who want to \nblock legislation, because they care about a particular issue, are too \nstrong. I hope Senators are going to see we are going to make sure \npeople have a chance to have their issues heard. But we also want them \nto see that to lose the ability to have a key part of an ``all of the \nabove'' energy policy--I have said you cannot have an ``all of the \nabove'' energy policy if you are not for energy efficiency. To not \nadvance this particular cause--and we passed the hydropower bill. It is \na good bill. People said it was the first major energy bill since 2009. \nThis is the next logical step. We ought to take it.\n  I see the Senator from Ohio here, who has done so much good work, and \nI will yield at this time. I know he has a great interest in this \ntopic. I hope, when we get a chance to vote on the Bennet-Ayotte \namendment, Senators will support it.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I stand to strongly support this \namendment. I think it is exactly as the chairman has suggested. It is \nbipartisan. It helps to solve a problem we have right now, and I \napplaud Senator Bennet who spoke earlier, and also Senator Ayotte from \nNew Hampshire, who has joined with him to take a lead on this. They \nhave worked with us. They have, again, by this amendment, I believe, \noffered a good opportunity to improve the underlying legislation. I \nthink it is consistent with the underlying legislation.\n  By the way, it is an amendment that makes sense because there is \nright now a disconnect between those who own commercial buildings and \nthose who are tenants in those buildings. We have heard this around the \ncountry as we have talked about efficiency. It kind of gets the \nlandlords and the tenants in sync with lowering energy costs. It is \nmarket driven. It is nonregulatory. It takes a ``best practices'' \napproach to address this issue.\n  Owners and managers of large commercial buildings report that their \ntenants consume over 50 percent of the total energy in the structure, \nbut again there is this disconnect because owners lease the space, but \nthey do not pay the bills; therefore, there is often no motivation to \ncut energy costs by making the space more efficient. The owners do not \nhave that incentive. The tenants do. They pay the bills. But they often \nhave very limited choices in the design or the operation of the energy-\nconsuming aspects of the structure they lease.\n  This is an attempt to address that issue, and I think it is a smart \nrealistic approach. It encourages tenants to make structural \ninvestments when they enter into new leases or renew existing leases. \nThe act asks the Department of Energy to study and learn from private \nsector ``best practices'' to achieve high-performance, cost-effective \nmeasures with viable payback periods on efficiency.\n  It also builds on the success of the voluntary ENERGY STAR Program\n\n[[Page S6363]]\n\nthat a lot of folks are familiar with and kind of moves ENERGY STAR \ninto the tenant space, creating a tenant-oriented certification called \nTenant Star for leased spaces, again, with the goal of transforming the \nway building owners and their tenants think about energy.\n  By the way, this legislation is supported by the Real Estate \nRoundtable, a group that has looked at this underlying legislation, \nthis amendment, and thinks this helps them to accomplish some of their \ngoals in energy efficiency. It is also supported by the Restaurant \nAssociation, the National Association of Manufacturers, and others.\n  So this better buildings amendment Senator Ayotte and Senator Bennet \nhave offered I think is strong. I wish they could have actually taken \nthe amendment today off the calendar and actually been able to \ntechnically offer it. But we did have a good debate on it, and I am \nhoping soon we will be able to resolve these other issues and be able \nto move forward with an actual vote on this because this is a classical \nexample of where we can come together as Republicans and Democrats, \nfinding common ground on how to have a true ``all of the above'' energy \nstrategy, not just produce more energy, which I strongly support, but \nalso use the energy we have more efficiently.\n  Since buildings are about 40 percent of energy usage, this is very \nsmart legislation, building on the other amendments we heard about \ntoday--on using geothermal, being sure it is part of renewable energy; \nensuring that our schools have the best information to be able to \nbecome more energy efficient; and other amendments. Again, I count \nabout a dozen of them here that are bipartisan amendments that we hope \nto have on the floor as part of this underlying bill to help create \nmore jobs, have a cleaner environment, make us less dependent on \nforeign oil, and move forward on this important leg of our national \nenergy strategy.\n  With that, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside, and I call up my amendment No. 1856.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I object on behalf of my colleague who \nhas an arrangement with the majority staff on this on the basis of his \ninterest in objecting until he gets a unanimous consent agreement that \nI think is being worked on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I would still like to talk about this \namendment. And I want to thank both Senator Wyden for working with us \non this amendment and also Senator Murkowski for working with us on \nthis amendment. I appreciate their support.\n  This is an amendment Senator Hoeven and I have submitted together. I \nwill describe it to you because I think it is such a good amendment. We \nwant to make sure we get moving on this very important bill that I \nsupport, as well as these amendments.\n  The Nonprofit Energy Efficiency Act would provide assistance to \nnonprofit organizations to help make the buildings they own and operate \nmore energy efficient.\n  Nonprofit organizations are the heart of our country and serve \nmillions of Americans every day. Nonprofits include hospitals, schools, \nhouses of worship--particularly supportive of this amendment--and youth \ncenters. They face the choice of making facility improvements or \nserving more people, which is also difficult for them.\n  That choice is clear for so many organizations. Nonprofits often \noperate in older, less efficient buildings, and because of their \nnonprofit status, they cannot participate in energy efficiency programs \ndespite the financial benefits of energy efficiency retrofits and other \nimprovements.\n  This amendment is about allowing the Department of Energy to make \ngrants of up to $200,000 for energy efficiency projects over the next 5 \nyears. The amendment requires a 50-percent cost share and includes \nprovisions to ensure that the projects achieve significant amounts of \nenergy savings and are done in a cost-effective manner.\n  This amendment, the Klobuchar-Hoeven amendment, is fully offset. I \nappreciate the work of the committee and the committee staff on this \namendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Nonprofit Energy Efficiency Act \namendment.\n  Before I yield the floor, I again want to thank Senator Shaheen and \nSenator Portman for their tireless efforts to move this important \nlegislation forward. I believe energy efficiency is an area we can all \nagree is good for the economy, it is good for consumers, and it is an \nissue where we can find common ground, as you can see by the amendment \nI have done with Senator Hoeven.\n  Senator Hoeven from North Dakota knows a little bit about producing \nenergy with their oil production, natural gas production, the biofuel \nproduction they share with Minnesota. We are some of the top biofuel \nproducers in the country. But in our States we also believe in \nconserving energy and in energy efficiency. We believe this bill is a \ngood bill and also that this amendment is a very good addition to the \nbill, as it allows nonprofits, such as places of worship, to also share \nin the energy efficiency program, and they are very interested in \nmoving ahead with this amendment.\n  So I thank you. I thank the authors, and I thank the chair and the \nranking member of the committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to commend Senator Klobuchar on her efforts. This is another \none of the great bipartisan amendments that has been worked on to add \nto this energy efficiency legislation. It shows how great the \nopportunity is for this legislation to provide for savings for people, \nto get people engaged in the idea of how much energy they are using and \nwhat the costs of that energy are, and also what the environmental \nbenefits and the benefits to consumers and the benefits to our national \nsecurity are in encouraging energy efficiency. So I want to commend her \nand thank her for all of her efforts, and we will continue to have this \ndiscussion on the floor as we wait for some kind of an agreement from \nSenator Vitter.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am very hopeful that when we get a chance \nto vote on this amendment the Senate accepts it. I want to put it in \nthe context of where we are, because we are seeing this pattern of \nSenators--and I was in North Dakota for Senator Hoeven a few days ago. \nWe were listening to constituents, I am sure very similar to the kinds \nof concerns reflected by folks in Minnesota. They all were saying: Go \nback there in September and focus on real problems and come up with \nreal solutions. We have seen all of this bickering. We have seen all of \nthis quarreling. What we want to see is on the concerns that most \naffect us: our pocketbook, our environment, in this case national \nsecurity.\n  Senator Shaheen made an excellent point several hours ago when she \npointed out that with the backdrop of Syria and national security \nissues, if there ever was a time while we wait for the next step in \nthis debate to look at another issue, energy and energy efficiency \nwould be a logical one, because we all understand how inextricably \nlinked national security and energy security are.\n  So, now, after we have had the thoughtful Inhofe-Carper amendment on \nthermal power, we had the Udall-Collins amendment in terms of school \nretrofits, we had the Bennet-Ayotte amendment which deals with \ncommercial buildings, which comprise almost half of the energy used in \nAmerica, we now have a very good bipartisan amendment brought to the \nfloor of the Senate by the senior Senator from Minnesota, Senator \nKlobuchar, and Senator Hoeven.\n  There are literally hundreds of thousands of museums in this country, \nhouses of worship, youth organizations. All of these programs are \nlooking at ways in which they can save energy. The reality is lots of \nthe tools are not available to them because they are tax exempt. So \nwhat we have here is a pilot project. Let me kind of underline. \nEverybody talks about big programs and their ``one size fits all,'' \nthey are ``run\n\n[[Page S6364]]\n\nfrom Washington'' and it is kind of one dastardly plot after another \nfrom the Federal Government.\n  The Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from Minnesota come and \nsay they want to have a pilot project, a pilot project to award grants \nof up to $200,000, with a match by the Federal Government, to make \nefficiency improvements to these buildings and these houses of worship, \nmuseums, all of these institutions that every Member of the Senate \ncares a great deal about.\n  I was especially appreciative, because Senator Klobuchar and Senator \nHoeven were supportive of some of the ideas Senator Murkowski and I had \nto revise this. This is a good amendment. This is already the fourth in \nthe queue of thoughtful, commonsense, low-cost proposals that have come \nto the floor of the Senate.\n  I hope my colleagues will shortly give us the opportunity to get to \nthis bill. This is the Senate. Senators like to address a variety of \nissues. But the reality is, while we had a very good hydropower bill \npassed right before the August recess, 60,000 megawatts of hydropower, \nresponsible for 60 percent of the clean energy in the country, this \nbill is the first major piece of energy legislation on the floor of the \nSenate since 2007. That is light years ago in terms of the dramatic \nchanges we have made in so many reforms in other areas.\n  For example, I saw in North Dakota over this weekend dramatic changes \nin terms of natural gas policies. We have a host of issues to talk \nabout there. We are ready to go on energy efficiency. So I am very \nappreciative to the Senator from Minnesota who has been working with \nthe Senator from North Dakota.\n  I would like to see somebody explain to houses of worship and museums \nand youth organizations why it does not make sense to start a pilot \nproject so they can squeeze more value out of the scarce dollars they \nhave for running their incredibly valuable programs. I do not think any \nMember of the Senate, Democrat or Republican, can make the case that \nthat makes any sense. I appreciate the Senator from Minnesota coming \nover. I am prepared to stay here until all hours so Senators who are \nwilling to do what we heard all summer the American people want us to \ndo, which is to address real issues, do it in a bipartisan way. I hope \nother Senators will come over and approach this the way the Senator \nfrom Minnesota and the Senator from North Dakota have done.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I think the chairman outlined it well. \nThis is a thoughtful amendment to the underlying bill. Senator Shaheen \nand I are delighted to accept it and support it, but also to say this \nsort of fits a part of the overall energy efficiency effort we did not \ncover in the legislation, which is these nongovernmental organizations \nthat own buildings, where they do not have the ability to get the kind \nof market-based support that is in our legislation.\n  This is faith-based organizations, but it is also Boys and Girls \nClubs, and it is all kinds of different groups that are interested in \ndoing efficiency retrofits. They need a little help. This gives them a \nmatch.\n  Significantly, what maybe we have not focused on earlier is the fact \nit is paid for. So we are not talking about any impact on the deficit. \nIt is deficit neutral because they went out of their way to try to find \ngood ways to reduce spending at the Department of Energy to have the \noffsets.\n  Having a local match is important because that gets the local buy-in. \nI think that is important, that it be a full match. But it also does \ngive them access to some of this expertise we talked about earlier to \nbe able to have more energy efficiency and also ultimately to save \nenergy in this country but also save money for those nonprofit \norganizations. So I commend my colleagues, Senator Klobuchar and \nSenator Hoeven. Senator Hoeven wants to come over and speak on this \nlegislation. He is tied up right now but hopes to come over later. \nCertainly when it is actually offered and brought up on the floor he \nwill have a chance to talk about it as well.\n  I commend him and commend his colleague from Minnesota for again \noffering another bipartisan amendment on top of the geothermal \namendment, the schools amendment, the amendment to encourage tenants to \nbe more energy efficient, and now we have this amendment on nonprofits \nthat own buildings that want to do the efficiency retrofits. I \nappreciate them working with us to find offsets and being sure it does \nnot add to the deficit and that it is a responsible approach on the \nfiscal side as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I cannot help but join the bouquet \ntossing that is going on here today, about not only the amendment \nSenator Hoeven and Senator Klobuchar have introduced as it relates to \nour nonprofits, but again the other measures that have been brought up \nfor discussion here this afternoon--geothermal, school efficiency. It \nreally does drive us to the point of this energy efficiency \nlegislation, how it is not just in one section or sector, it is \neconomywide. It is all aspects of our lives.\n  If we focus on how we live from day to day, the things that are \nimportant to us, we can incorporate greater efficiency into all aspects \nof it and we are better off, whether it is through our schools, our \nbusinesses, our government buildings, or through those nonprofits I \nthink we all recognize give so much enrichment to our general lives. \nBut when you think about some of the struggles our nonprofits are \ncurrently facing right now, as they are seeing declining budgets, \nFederal, local, State levels, they are looking to squeeze as much as \nthey can out of every dollar. So when you have proposals such as we \nhave here with pilot programs to award these grants of up to $200,000 \nto help make these efficiency improvements to their buildings, this is \nsignificant stuff, if you will. This translates into real dollars, \nallowing them to do what it is they are providing so much better, \nwhether it is Boys and Girls Clubs at a clubhouse, the ability to \nperhaps have other facilities, whether it is your church facilities, \nyour faith-based organization, the outreach and all they are able to do \nand those they are able to serve. It is all made better when you do not \nhave to spend as much for your energy costs to meet your energy \ndemands. So it does seem somewhat common sense. It does seem rational \nand reasonable.\n  Good heavens, what are we doing here on the floor of the Senate \npromoting something that is rational and reasonable and common sense? \nWe need to do more of this. This is a good amendment and joins several \nother good amendments we are seeing as we look to the numerous \namendments we talked to colleagues about and that we are anticipating \nwill be up here in the next several hours.\n  I do hope folks realize that what has been put together by the \nsponsors of this bill, the Senator from Ohio, the Senator from New \nHampshire, is worthy of our consideration, not only on these \namendments, but, again, the fuller spectrum of how we are more wise in \nour energy consumption, how we are better stewards of that which we \nhave when it comes to energy and our energy resources. So I will throw \nthe bouquet to those who have got us to this point.\n  I see the Senator from Wyoming has joined us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I filed an amendment to S. 1392 that will \nprevent the Environmental Protection Agency from a massive regulatory \noverreach. It has been cosponsored by Senators Barrasso and Flake.\n  My amendment is simple and straightforward. It promotes the right of \na State to deal with its own problems. It returns the regulation of \nregional haze to where it properly belongs, in the hands of State \nofficials who are more familiar with the problem and the best ways to \naddress it.\n  I hope my colleagues will support my effort.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency's move to partially disapprove \nthe State of Wyoming regional haze plan will create an economic and \nbureaucratic nightmare that will have a devastating impact on western \neconomies. The proposal by EPA ignores more\n\n[[Page S6365]]\n\nthan a decade's worth of work on this subject by officials in my home \nState and seems to be more designed to regulate coal out of existence \nthan to regulate haze. The haze we most need to regulate, in fact, \nseems to be the one that is clouding the vision of the EPA, as it \npromotes a plan that imposes onerous regulations on powerplants, that \nwill, in turn, pass those increased costs in the form of higher energy \nprices on to consumers.\n  That tells me the EPA's purpose is to ensure no opportunity to impose \nits chosen agenda on the Nation is wasted. It does not seem to matter \nto them that their proposed rule flies directly in the face of the \nStates' traditional and legal role in addressing air quality issues.\n  When Congress passed the 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act to \nregulate regional haze, it very clearly gave the States the lead \nauthority. Now the EPA has tossed them in the back seat and grabbed the \nsteering wheel to head this effort in its own previously determined \ndirection.\n  That is not the kind of teamwork and cooperation Congress intended. \nThe goal of regulating regional haze is to improve visibility in our \nnational parks and wilderness areas. The stated legislative purpose for \nthe authority is purely for aesthetic value and not to regulate public \nhealth. Most importantly, the EPA should not be using regulations to \npick winners and losers in our national energy market. This is a State \nissue. Congress recognized that States should know how to determine \nwhat the best regulatory approach would be to find and implement a \nsolution to the problem.\n  The courts reaffirmed this position by ruling in favor of the State's \nprimacy on regional haze several times. Unfortunately, that is not what \nhappened in this case. The EPA ignored all of the clear precedents and \ninstead handed a top-down approach that ignored the will and expertise \nof the State of Wyoming.\n  This inexplicable position flies in the face of the strong and \ncommonsense approach of the State of Wyoming to addressing regional \nhaze in a reasonable and cost-effective manner. The EPA's approach \nwould be much more costly, and it would have a tremendous impact on the \neconomy and quality of life not only in Wyoming but in the neighboring \nStates as well. Clearly, we can't allow this to happen.\n  Preliminary estimates by the State of Wyoming show that the best \navailable retrofit technologies and long-term strategies under the \nproposed rule would cost well over $1 billion--plus millions more every \nyear in additional operational costs that gets passed on to the \nconsumer.\n  I mentioned that Cheyenne needed some additional powerplants. They \nwent out and found the best natural gas technology available and then \nfound it wouldn't meet the new requirements. This is the best worldwide \ntechnology, and it won't meet the new requirements they wish to put on \nit. Again, those costs would be passed on to the consumers in the form \nof higher energy prices. Every family knows that when the price of \nenergy goes up, it is their economic security, as well as their hopes \nand dreams for the future, that is threatened and all too often \ndestroyed.\n  The EPA's determination to take such an approach would be \nunderstandable if it would create better results than the State plan. \nIt doesn't. It admits that. One billion dollars in costs and then \nmillions more each year, and it isn't going to give any better results \nthan what the State plan is? What sense does that make? This is another \nreason why it makes no sense for the EPA to overstep its authority \nunder the Clean Air Act to force Wyoming to comply with an all-too-\ncostly plan that in the end will provide the people of Wyoming with no \nreal benefits. Again, it is $1 billion up front, millions a year, and \nno real benefits.\n  The plan doesn't even take into account other sources of haze in the \nState, such as wildfires. We have those every year. They are a problem \non Wyoming's plains and mountains. They are a major cause of haze in my \nhome State. It makes no sense for the EPA to draft a plan that fails to \ntake into consideration one of the biggest natural causes of the very \nproblem they are supposed to be solving.\n  This is one that can be solved. The State of Wyoming has spent over a \ndecade producing a plan that is reasonable, productive, cost-effective, \nand focused on the problem. The EPA has taken an unnecessary and \nunreasonable approach that violates the legislatively granted job of \nState regulators to address this issue. We cannot afford to increase \nthe cost of energy to families, schools, and vital public services by \nimplementing an EPA plan that won't adequately address the issue of \nregional haze. Again, there will be no noticeable effect--$1 billion up \nfront, millions each year, and no noticeable effect. What sense does \nthat make?\n  I know my colleagues will see the importance of this matter and \nsupport my amendment that will stop the EPA in its tracks and end its \ninterference with Wyoming's efforts to address this very issue. It only \nmakes sense to me that Wyoming's plan, which results from a more than \n10-year effort, be given a chance to work. It is not only fair, it is \nthe right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here on what we are calling the \nShaheen-Portman bill, the energy efficiency bill, and I note that the \nlead sponsor of the bill, Senator Shaheen of New Hampshire, as well as \nthe ranking member of the energy committee, Senator Murkowski, are both \nhere. I have been cleared by them to take a minute on the floor right \nnow and talk about an amendment I would like to have offered and voted \non and added to this bill. We call it the pay for success amendment. It \nis amendment No. 1852.\n  What this amendment would do is something that is quite simple and \nbombproof for taxpayers. Ultimately, it would save money and save \nenergy; that is, for the properties managed by the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, if they do not have the capital to go \nback into that property and do retrofits and install efficiency \nmeasures that will bring down their cost of electricity, this amendment \nwould allow them to contract with the private sector to bring in \nprivate capital to achieve those energy savings.\n  There are significant restrictions in here that will protect \ntaxpayers. Any money that goes back to these investors comes out of \nenergy savings and only out of energy savings. If something goes wrong \nand the energy savings don't materialize, the investors lose. The \ntaxpayers and the government are held harmless.\n  Thanks to an amendment by Senator Coburn of Oklahoma, as we were \ndrafting the amendment, we have even specifically exempted the \nadministrative costs of HUD in administering the legislation. Those \nhave to be paid before the investors take their profits. But once the \ninvestors are paid back, there is now a more efficient building and \nsavings for taxpayers over the long haul.\n  In addition, the result is a reduction of our energy footprint, \nincreases our energy independence, and reduces the contribution of ill \neffects, such as pollution and climate change, by HUD buildings.\n  Now is not the time to call it up--we are at too early a stage in the \nproceedings--but I did want to take a moment to urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment. We discussed it at length with Senator Collins \nof Maine when we were trying to add it to the Transportation and HUD \nappropriations bill, and I believe we have worked through issues \npresented by her office and issues presented by Senator Coburn. If \nanybody else has any concerns, we look forward to hearing from them, \nbut I think this is a bombproof piece of legislation, from the \ntaxpayers' point of view. It opens up a niche for private capital to \ncome in and earn a return on their investment by capitalizing on the \nopportunity we have for energy savings in these buildings.\n  With that, I yield the floor and look forward to a future opportunity \nto discuss the amendment further and, with any luck, call it up for a \npositive vote. I thank Senator Shaheen and yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6366]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Before the Senator from Rhode Island leaves, I wanted \nto commend him for this effort. I think it is a great proposal. I \nhaven't had a chance to look at all the details, so I look forward to \nthat, but using performance contracting to provide for savings on \nenergy costs is a very effective way to address the upfront costs for \nthese kinds of retrofits.\n  As the Senator points out, the person who is doing the contracting--\nthe private company--is assuming the burden of those costs. Yet the \nbenefits are going to taxpayers. Ultimately, the contractor that does \nthe retrofits is also going to benefit over the long term, and those \nsavings will keep coming back year after year. So once the initial cost \nis paid off, taxpayers will continue to get those savings year after \nyear.\n  As Governor, we started retrofitting State buildings exactly this \nway, and it saved the taxpayers of New Hampshire hundreds of thousands \nof dollars a year--it is still saving them that--and also thousands of \npounds of pollution because, as we know, 40 percent of our energy is \nused by buildings. So if we save on that energy use in buildings, then \nthat saves not only on those costs, but it also saves on the pollution \nthat comes from heating and cooling those buildings.\n  So I commend the Senator for his effort and I look forward to having \na chance to debate it on the floor and to having a chance to review the \nproposal in greater detail.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for those \ncomments. I wish to commend her for her leadership on this bill. This \nis a wonderful bill to have gotten to, and she and Senator Portman have \nput in an enormous amount of effort in getting us here. So that is \nimmensely commendable.\n  I would add something I omitted in my remarks earlier because the \nSenator from New Hampshire brought this up in a private discussion we \nhad on the floor a moment ago; that is, how does CBO--the Congressional \nBudget Office--feel about this amendment. We have an e-mail from the \nCongressional Budget Office saying this will not add to the deficit. It \nis deficit neutral. In point of fact, it actually is viewed as \nnegative--it shrinks the deficit in the long haul, but all we needed \nfrom them was the assurance it was deficit neutral and they would treat \nit as deficit neutral.\n  As the Senator from New Hampshire very properly pointed out, the \nbenefit of this isn't just on the energy side or on the pollution side. \nSomebody goes in and installs the new energy efficiency equipment, \ninstalls the new windows, insulates the roof, and does whatever it is \nthat will achieve these savings and that is work and those are jobs and \nthat is helpful to our economy.\n  I will again yield the floor.\n\n\n                        Voluntary Certification\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I wish to discuss the Sessions-\nPryor Amendment No. 1879 to S. 1392, the Energy Savings and Industrial \nCompetitiveness Act. I would like to recognize the excellent work of my \nfriend, the senior Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Pryor, who is an original \nco-sponsor of this amendment, and I would ask him for permission to \nengage in a brief colloquy concerning our amendment.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I would welcome an exchange for the Record.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank my colleague for his willingness to discuss \nthis amendment. I would ask my colleague, what is the purpose of our \namendment?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Senator from Alabama for his question. In an \neffort to encourage energy efficiency compliance, reduce regulatory \nburdens, and save taxpayer dollars, the Sessions-Pryor amendment would \nrequire the Department of Energy to recognize voluntary certification \nprograms for air conditioning, furnace, boiler, heat pump, and water \nheater products. Federal law requires these heating, cooling, and water \nheater products to comply with a complex set of Federal energy \nconservation and efficiency standards. Similar specifications apply to \nparticipants in the Energy Star program. The Energy Department \ncurrently spends millions of taxpayer dollars annually to conduct \nverification testing of these covered products. At the same time, U.S. \nmanufacturers of these covered products spend millions of dollars \nthemselves to participate in comprehensive voluntary certification \nprograms that use independent, third-party laboratories to ensure \ncompliance with applicable standards. Our amendment would require the \nEnergy Department, when conducting routine testing to verify product \nratings, to rely on data submitted through voluntary, independent \ncertification programs that meet the robust list of criteria set forth \nin the amendment. To qualify, the voluntary certification program must \nbe (among other things) nationally-recognized, maintain a publicly \navailable list of certified models, and conduct verification testing on \nat least 20 percent of the product families using an ``independent \nthird-party test laboratory.'' The amendment would require the Energy \nDepartment to reduce regulatory burdens for manufacturers participating \nin a voluntary certification program, as well as require testing of \nproducts that are not covered by a voluntary program.\n  So, I greatly appreciate the leadership of my colleague Senator \nSessions on this amendment. I would ask him: what are some of the \npolicy reasons for supporting our amendment?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Arkansas. Our amendment is \nsound policy for at least three reasons. First, the amendment saves \ntaxpayer dollars by reducing redundant testing of products when already \ncovered by a comprehensive, voluntary third-party testing program. At a \ntime of record debt and deficits, this government needs to consider \nevery option for making government lean and fiscally responsible. We \nhave been informed by the Congressional Budget Office that our \namendment does not impact the deficit.\n  Second, the amendment reduces regulatory burdens on American \nmanufacturers. We need to do all we can to help make U.S. manufacturing \nmore competitive on the world stage. Our amendment promotes domestic \nmanufacturing and competiveness.\n  Third, our amendment increases DOE's enforcement capabilities to \nensure that a greater number of products are verified every year. This \nwill help achieve the kinds of energy efficiency improvements the law \nwas intended to achieve. So I think this amendment should garner the \nsupport of this body.\n  I recently received a letter from Rheem Manufacturing Company, which \nhas a large manufacturing facility in Montgomery, AL that employs over \n1,000 people and manufactures heating and cooling products in Fort \nSmith, AR. The Rheem letter expresses support for our amendment and \nexplains that it ``will enhance our ability to sustain American \nmanufacturing jobs and competitiveness while conserving taxpayer \nresources and allowing federal agencies to focus enforcement on \nentities that do not voluntarily participate in rigorous industry-led \nefficiency certification programs.''\n  I would, in turn, ask Senator Pryor: who else is supportive of this \namendment?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Senator from Alabama for his remarks. I would \nanswer his question by noting that a broad coalition of industry, \nenergy efficiency, and environmental stakeholders are supportive of our \namendment. As you referenced, employers in the State of Arkansas, your \nState of Alabama, and around the country are supportive. We are also \npleased to have the support of the leadership of the Senate Energy \nCommittee, Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Murkowski. I am pleased \nthat we have been able to work together on this amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would ask Senator Pryor one additional question. One \nof the purposes of this amendment is to reduce the testing burden on \nmanufacturers for a number of Federal government programs. For \ninstance, manufacturers who utilize accredited, independent third \nparties for testing and certification should not be compelled to \nundertake duplicative testing to demonstrate compliance with other \nFederal programs so long as the test methods used for evaluating \nproduct performance are the same. Additionally, this amendment does not \nintend to limit competition between private sector testing and \ncertification programs, provided that accreditation and\n\n[[Page S6367]]\n\nother legitimate government requirements for recognizing such efforts \nare clearly defined. Would you agree?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Yes, I would agree with that characterization.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Pryor for his work on this issue.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning business \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Honoring the Life of Jesse Owens\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of Jesse Owens, \nan Olympic recordbreaker and pioneer on the track and off the track, \nwho was born 100 years ago tomorrow.\n  Born in Alabama as the youngest of 10 children, James Cleveland Owens \nmoved with his family to Cleveland, OH, at the age of 9. Leaving the \nSouth during the great migration of those several decades between 1910 \nand 1970, Jesse's family came north seeking economic opportunity and \ngreater personal freedom. His father left his work as a sharecropper in \nthe South--something difficult to do because so often the landowner \nheld those sharecroppers by holding real or imagined debt over their \nheads--and found a job in the steel industry in Cleveland, OH.\n  James Cleveland Owens enrolled in Bolton Elementary School on the \neast side of Cleveland. Because of his strong southern accent, when the \nteacher asked his name and he said J.C., the teacher misheard it and \nstarted calling him Jesse--a name that stuck.\n  While in junior high, he met Charles Riley, who taught physical \neducation and coached the track team. Charles Riley nurtured Jesse's \nobvious talent, helping him to grow stronger athletically and to set \nlong-term goals that served him well as he went on to Cleveland East \nTechnical School.\n  In 1927, my hometown of Mansfield, OH started hosting the storied \nMansfield Relays--maybe the biggest in the country--a sporting event \nthat drew athletes from six States and Canada. I remember in the 1960s \nmy family hosting many of the athletes who came to our town to compete.\n  Obviously prior to my parents doing that, among these many promising \nathletes none shone brighter than the sprinter from an hour up north. \nAt the Mansfield Relays, Jesse Owens sharpened his focus and won the \n1932 and 1933 relays for East Tech, setting records that lasted into my \nchildhood in the 1960s and 1970s.\n  He later went on to attend the Ohio State University, where he was \nknown as the Buckeye Bullet, winning a record eight individual NCAA \nchampionships. The story goes that at the Big 10 track meet 1 year in \nAnn Arbor, MI, while competing in a 45-minute period, Jesse Owens set 3 \nworld records.\n  We are used to seeing college athletes who are revered today. But in \nhis day, Owens could not live on campus due to a lack of housing for \nBlack students, and he could not stay at the same hotels when his track \nteam traveled or eat at the same restaurants as the White players on \nthe team who traveled with him. But he achieved global fame and heroism \nstatus because of what he did in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.\n  While a hateful regime in Germany hoped to use the Olympics to \npromote the Aryan race and promulgate a wrongheaded, dangerous, and \ninherently racist belief in the superiority of that race, Jesse Owens \nturned this theory on its head. He won four gold medals in Berlin, and \nhe set world records in three events while tying for a world record in \na fourth event. He showed that talent and sportsmanship transcend race, \nand he embarrassed an evil dictator who hoped to manipulate the Olympic \nGames to further his political agenda.\n  Interestingly, Adolph Hitler refused to shake hands with Jesse Owens \nwhen he won one of those events. The International Olympic Committee \ntold the German Government that Hitler must either shake hands with all \nthe winners or none of the winners. The story goes that Hitler refused \nto come back and observe the Olympics--again, a testament to the \nheroism, courage, and discipline of James Cleveland ``Jesse'' Owens.\n  Despite these achievements--and the Rose Garden and Oval Office \ngreetings that today's Olympians are accustomed to--Jesse Owens never \nreceived congratulations or recognition by President Roosevelt or \nPresident Truman. It was only during the presidency of Dwight \nEisenhower, beginning to be a different time in race relations in this \ncountry, that a President of the United States actually recognized \nJesse Owens' achievements.\n  He was, by most measures, the best athlete in the world, but he \nreturned to the United States of America a Black man in the 1930s to \nface economic challenges and racial discrimination that are far too \nfamiliar to far too many Americans. But he continued to travel and \ninspire athletes and fans across the globe. I had the honor of meeting \nJesse Owens when he was the speaker at my brother Bob's high school \ngraduation in 1965, when I was 12 years old.\n  Jesse Owens worked alongside the State Department to promote good \nwill in Asia, and worked in 1950 to promote democracy abroad as part of \na Cold War effort.\n  Think about that. A Black man who is the best athlete in the world, \nwas a hero to large numbers of Americans--Black and White--in 1936, \nstanding up in many ways against the Fascist machine of Adolph Hitler, \nnot being recognized by a President of the United States who was \nwinning a war against Hitler ultimately. Yet he went out 5 years later \nafter that war to promote democracy abroad as part of a Cold War \neffort, still proud of his country, still knowing our country had work \nto do.\n  In 1973 he was appointed to the board of directors of the U.S. \nOlympic Committee, where he worked to ensure the best training and \nconditions for U.S. athletes. He lent his skill and his talents to \nvarious charitable groups, notably the Boys Club of America.\n  In 1976 Jesse Owens finally received the Presidential recognition he \ndeserved. He was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom from \nPresident Ford.\n  Jesse Owens was a pioneer. Despite facing adversity, he had the \nstrength of mind and the discipline, common to almost all great \nathletes, to become the most elite of athletes. Despite being treated \ndifferently and shamefully from other athletes of his stature, he went \non to shatter records. Despite the darkest of days globally, he did his \npart, standing up to fascism, dispelling racism, and promoting unity.\n  Tomorrow we celebrate the 100th birthday of a hero to all Americans, \nJames Cleveland ``Jesse'' Owens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the decision on whether to authorize the \nPresident of the United States to use the military might of our great \nNation against another country is the most significant vote a Senator \ncan cast. The Constitution vests this responsibility in Congress--a \nduty that rests heavily on the shoulders of each and every Member.\n  We are now engaged in a serious debate about what the appropriate \nresponse should be to the horrific use of\n\n[[Page S6368]]\n\nchemical weapons by the regime of Syrian President Asad who killed his \nown people using chemical weapons on August 21. This was not the first \nuse of chemical weapons by President Asad. He launched several smaller \nscale attacks, murdering his citizens, and, notably, many, if not all, \nof those attacks occurred after the President drew his redline a year \nago. But it was not until the large-scale August 21 attack of this \nyear, which resulted in the deaths of approximately 1,400 people, that \nPresident Obama decided a military strike against Syria was warranted. \nThe fact is Asad violated the international convention prohibiting the \nuse of chemical weapons and crossed President Obama's redline many \ntimes during the past year.\n  Deciding whether to grant the President this authority is a very \ndifficult decision. I have participated in numerous discussions with \nthe President, the Vice President, and experts in and out of \ngovernment. I have attended many classified briefings as a member of \nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and I have carefully \nweighed the assessments of the intelligence community and military and \nState Department officials. My constituents have also provided me with \nvaluable insights that have helped to guide my decision. After much \ndeliberation and thought, I have decided I cannot support the \nresolution that was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nlast week.\n  One of the criteria for the use of military force is surely whether \nthe adversary poses an imminent threat to the American people. More \nthan once President Obama has stated Syria's chemical weapons and \ndelivery systems do not pose a direct imminent threat to the United \nStates. Neither the United States nor any of our allies have been \nattacked with chemical weapons. Instead, President Obama justifies the \nattack he is proposing as a response to the violation of international \nnorms, despite the fact that we currently lack international partners \nto enforce the Convention on Chemical Weapons through military means.\n  Although the term ``limited air strikes'' sounds less threatening, \nthe fact is even limited air strikes constitute an act of war. If bombs \nwere dropped from the air or cruise missiles were launched into an \nAmerican city, we would certainly consider that to be an act of war, \nand that is why this decision is fraught with consequences.\n  American military strikes against the Asad regime, in my judgment, \nrisk entangling the United States in the middle of a protracted, \ndangerous, and ugly civil war. GEN Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, has warned us that the use of U.S. military \nforce ``cannot resolve the underlying and historic ethnic, religious, \nand tribal issues that are fueling this conflict.''\n  The introduction of American Armed Forces into this violent conflict \ncould escalate to the point where we are perceived to be, or actually \nare, involved in a Syrian civil war or a proxy war with Hezbollah or \nIran.\n  In this complex conflict, it is also becoming increasingly difficult \nto sort out the good guys from the bad. There is no doubt that Asad is \na brutal, ruthless dictator who murders his own citizens and who is \nsupported by thousands of Hezbollah terrorist fighters. The opposition, \nhowever, is not pure. It has now been infiltrated by not one but two \naffiliates of Al Qaeda as well as by criminal gangs. Caught in the \nmiddle are millions of Syrians who simply want to lead peaceful lives. \nThe tragic result has been more than 100,000 people killed, 4 million \ndisplaced internally, and 2 million refugees.\n  We do not know how Asad or his allies would respond to a U.S. \nmilitary attack, but an asymmetric attack by Hezbollah aimed at one of \nour bases or at other American interests abroad certainly is one \npotential response. My concern is that reprisals, followed by \nsubsequent retaliations, followed by still more reprisals could lead to \nan escalation of violence which never was intended by the President but \nwhich may well be the result of the first strike.\n\n  I have raised this issue directly with administration officials since \nthe ``one and done'' strike, as retired GEN Michael Hayden puts it, may \nwell not work. I have asked the administration what they would do if \nAsad waits until the 91st day, when the authorization for the use of \nmilitary force expires, and then conducts an attack using chemical \nweapons that kills a much smaller number of people. What will we do \nthen? In each case where I have raised this question, I have been told \nthat we would likely launch another military strike.\n  In addition to my concern about being dragged into the Syrian civil \nwar, I question whether the proposed military response would be more \neffective in achieving the goal of eliminating Asad's stockpile of \nchemical weapons than a diplomatic approach would be.\n  Let's be clear. The strikes proposed by the President would not \neliminate Asad's chemical weapons, nor his means of delivering them. In \nthe President's own words, the purpose of these strikes is ``to degrade \nAsad's capabilities to deliver chemical weapons.'' Indeed, you will not \nfind any military or intelligence official who believes that the strike \ncontemplated by the administration would eliminate Syria's chemical \nweapons stockpile or all of the delivery systems. General Dempsey wrote \nto Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin that even if an \nexplicit military mission to secure Syria's chemical weapons were \nundertaken, it would result in the control of ``some, but not all'' \nchemical weapons in Syria, and that is not what is being discussed \nbecause that would undoubtedly involve boots on the ground.\n  According to the President, the purpose of his more narrow objective \nis to deliver a calculated message to convince Asad not to use his \nremaining chemical weapons and delivery systems ever again. But would \nsuch a strike be effective in preventing Asad from using these weapons \nagain on a small scale after he has absorbed the strike just to deliver \nhis own message that he retains the capability to do so? Asad would \nretain a sufficient quantity of chemical weapons, and he knows that we \ndid not respond to smaller chemical weapons attacks that he undertook \nbefore the August 21, 2013, event.\n  So on the one hand, the President is seeking to conduct a precision \nmilitary strike that is sufficient to deter Asad from using any \nchemical weapons again. On the other hand, he wants to narrow the scope \nof a military strike so that Asad does not perceive this act of war as \na threat to his regime. Yet the President has previously stated that \nU.S. policy is the removal of Asad.\n  While administration officials have gone out of their way to state \nthat the military strikes are only to deter and degrade Asad's chemical \nweapons use and are not intended to pick sides in the civil war, the \ntext of the resolution before us is at odds with the administration's \nrepresentations. The text states that it is the policy of the United \nStates to ``change the momentum on the battlefield in Syria so as to \ncreate favorable conditions for a negotiated settlement that ends the \nconflict and leads to a democratic government in Syria.'' Well, no one \ncould ever consider the Asad dictatorship to be a democratic government \nin Syria.\n  Furthermore, on September 3 Secretary of State John Kerry testified \nthat ``it is not insignificant that to deprive [Asad] of the capacity \nto use chemical weapons or to degrade the capacity to use those \nchemical weapons actually deprives him of a lethal weapon in this \nongoing civil war, and that has an impact.''\n  That is a very mixed message from this administration about the \npurpose of these strikes.\n  All of us want to see a peaceful Syria, no longer led by Asad, nor \ncontrolled by the radical Islamic extremists who are part of his \nopposition. But is military action that could well get us involved in \nSyria's civil war the right answer?\n  When I think about the proper response to Asad's abhorrent use of \nchemical weapons, I am mindful of the suffering and death that has \noccurred as well as the international conventions banning chemical \nweapons. Since this is an international norm, however, where are our \ninternational partners--the United Nations, NATO, the Arab League?\n  I have grave reservations about undertaking an act of war to enforce \nan international convention without the international support we have \npreviously had when undertaking similar action in the past, such as in \nKosovo,\n\n[[Page S6369]]\n\nAfghanistan, and even Iraq. While NATO's Secretary General has \nexpressed support for consequences, NATO's North Atlantic Council, \nwhich is the body that approves military action for NATO, has not \napproved this military action. The Arab League has condemned with words \nthe use of chemical weapons, but there is yet to be any Arab League \nstatement that explicitly endorses military action or promises to be \nengaged in that action. Even our ally who has been most supportive, \nFrance, has asked for a delay to allow the U.N. inspectors to deliver \ntheir report next week.\n  Let me add that I believe that report early next week will verify \nthat it was the Asad regime that used sarin gas. That is my \nexpectation.\n  A military strike may well enforce the international norm with \nrespect to chemical weapons, but at the same time it would weaken the \ninternational norm of limiting military action to instances of self-\ndefense or those cases where we have the support of the international \ncommunity or at least our allies in NATO or the Arab League.\n  In addressing this difficult and tragic crisis in Syria, the \nadministration initially presented us with only two choices: Take \nmilitary action or make no response at all. I reject and have rejected \nfrom the start the notion that the United States has only two choices--\nundertaking an act of war or doing nothing in response to President \nAsad's attack on his citizens. There are a variety of nonmilitary \nresponses to consider that may well be more effective. The most \npromising of these options, proposed by the Russians--one of Asad's \nstrongest allies--would place Syria's chemical weapons stockpile in the \ncustody of the international community before they would ultimately be \ndestroyed.\n  I am not naive about ``trusting'' the Russians. My point is that this \noption may well be in Russia's own interests, would be more effective \nin securing the stockpile of chemical weapons in Syria, and would \ninvolve the international community. This diplomatic alternative would \nput Syria's chemical weapons under verified international control and \nwould once and for all prevent Asad or anyone else in Syria from using \nthose weapons. A risk of attacking Asad's facilities is that the \nchemical weapons could fall into the hands of terrorist elements in the \ncountry. That risk would be eliminated if the weapons were removed \ncompletely from Syria.\n  One of the arguments advanced by proponents of the authorization for \nthe use of military force resolution is that America's credibility is \non the line. This is a legitimate concern. To be sure, it was \nunfortunate that the President drew a line in the sand without first \nhaving a well-vetted plan, consulting with Congress, and obtaining the \nnecessary support for doing so. I would maintain, however, that the \ncredibility of our great Nation is beyond that of just one statement by \nthe President, even in his important capacity as Commander in Chief. \nThe credibility of the United States is backed by a military that is \nthe most advanced and capable in the world. The strength of our \nmilitary sends the clear, unmistakable message that the United States \nis capable of exerting overwhelming force whenever we decide it is the \nright thing to do and it is necessary to do so. It would be a mistake \nfor our adversaries to interpret a single vote regarding a military \nresponse to Syria's chemical weapons program as having ramifications \nfor our willingness to use force when our country or our allies face \ndirect imminent threats, especially with regard to the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities.\n  At the very least we have an obligation to pursue all nonmilitary \noptions that may well be more effective in preventing the future use of \nAsad's chemical weapons than the military option the President has \nproposed to undertake.\n  For these reasons, should the authorization for the use of military \nforce approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee come to the \nSenate floor, I shall cast my vote in opposition.\n  My hope, however, is that the negotiations underway with the Russians \nwill pave the way for the removal of chemical stockpiles from Syria and \nfor their verified ultimate destruction. That is the best outcome for \nthis crisis. That would lead to a safer world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand that Members can speak for \nup to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/11/senate-section/article/S6369-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6369-S6370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  WRDA\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to speak about an issue \ncompletely separated from the international concerns we all share \nbecause closer to home there was an action taken today by the House of \nRepresentatives that has me extremely concerned as the senior Senator \nfrom Louisiana and a leader in our delegation and is an issue I have \nworked on literally since the first day I came to the Senate now almost \n17 years ago.\n  Today, the House of Representatives, unfortunately, in presenting \ntheir WRDA bill, which was a bill that was negotiated at great length \nwith great skill by Senator Barbara Boxer, the chair of the committee \nof jurisdiction, and the ranking member, Senator Vitter, who did an \noutstanding job for the country and for Louisiana, negotiated quite \nskillfully a bill that was very balanced.\n  It contained no earmarks, as have been eliminated by the majority of \nthe Congress. It did give a green light for projects that had received \na positive Chief's report, which is the signal to go forward with the \nproject for flood protection or navigation or dredging under the \njurisdictions of the Corps of Engineers.\n  Unfortunately, for unexplained public reasons today, which we will \nfind out as soon as we can and report, the House of Representatives, \nthe leadership, decided to drop probably the most important project in \nthe bill for Louisiana, and that project is Morganza to the Gulf. The \nsaddest part about all of this, the House removing this project, this \nproject has already been authorized three times in the last 15 years by \nthe Senate and twice by the House of Representatives.\n  The people who would be benefited by this project, about 200,000 \npeople who live in south Louisiana, Lafourche Parish and Terrebonne \nParish, the same area that was battered by Katrina, Rita, Gustav, Ike, \nand the oilspill, the same people who have suffered through flood after \nflood after flood, the same people who have taxed themselves, gotten \n$200 million of their own money to build phase 1, have now been told no \nby the House of Representatives.\n  For what reasons I cannot understand. They have gone through all of \nthe processes required. They have waited in line, a line that should \nnever have been there because they were given a yes. But as the \nPresiding Officer knows, under the Corps of Engineers' rules, they can \nsay yes to your project initially and then it takes so long to get to \nyour project because we have a very inefficient system. If the \nestimates then come in at 20 percent over the original estimate, the \nlaw kicks you out and you have to start all over. So they started all \nover. That is the tragedy of this action. We were furious they had to \nstart all over, but that was the law. So they did. They got a positive \nChief's report in June.\n  The House of Representatives just arbitrarily decides, even with a \npositive Chief's report, they are taking Morganza to the Gulf out of \nthe bill. I am calling on the Louisiana delegation to stand, \nparticularly members who are in the study committee. I think we have a \nleader of that committee, Congressman Steve Scalise, who was my partner \nin the RESTORE Act and has been a very able leader in our delegation, \nto absolutely put their foot down on this WRDA bill moving any further \nin the House of Representatives until we can get justice for this \nproject.\n  Our people are doing everything we can to elevate our homes, to fight \nfor fair flood insurance, to tax ourselves to build levees. We have \ntraveled all over the world to find the best engineers in the \nNetherlands because we do not seem to have enough engineers in \nWashington who understand that you can live safely below sea level. \nSometimes you have to because that is where the ports are. We do not \nhave the luxury of living on tops of mountains. We are running the \nMississippi River. We are not running a ski lodge\n\n[[Page S6370]]\n\nin Vail. So our people have to live there. They are not living in \nmansions. They are not living in condos. They are living in fishing \nvillages and fishing camps and in very middle-class neighborhoods, \ntrying to make a living for themselves, their families, their \ncommunities and keep this country operating.\n  We are running the biggest oil and gas operations out of Houma, LA, \nthe town the House of Representatives has just literally made \ndefenseless. They have no levees. New Orleans now, after Katrina, and \nJefferson Parish, and Saint Bernard Parish have $14 billion of taxpayer \nmoney invested. That is a lot of money. I know some people in the \ncountry get very aggravated about that. Why did they get $14 billion?\n  The country should have given us $1 billion 10 years ago and we could \nhave saved them 14. But the Congress decided not to do that. We asked. \nWe begged. We pleaded. No. No. No. No. So one day the levees broke. \nThen the bill came due. It was a big bill, $14 billion. Wait until the \nnext bill comes through. In that whole timeframe, that whole timeframe \nwhere our people are begging, drowning, houses going underwater, \nbegging for help, the government keeps telling us no, no, we sent $161 \nbillion to this Treasury from off our shore, from offshore oil and \ngas--$161 billion.\n  We come up here and try to get $1 billion for this levee, $2 billion \nfor that. We are told: We cannot afford it. I tell you, I do not have \nthe power to do this. I do not. But if I did, and if I were the \nGovernor, I--and I do not think he has the power--but if I could, I \nwould shut down every rig in the Gulf of Mexico until this Congress \ngives the people of Louisiana the money we need to keep ourselves safe \nfrom drowning, from flooding.\n  I would turn the lights off in Washington and in New York and in \nMaine. We are tired of it. The people in our State cannot survive \nwithout levees. The country cannot survive without our people living \nwhere we do, to run the maritime, to run the oil and gas industry. \nHouma, LA, does not deserve this. Terrebonne Parish does not deserve \nit. Lafourche Parish does not deserve it. Our delegation is not going \nto stand for it.\n  So my message to the Speaker of the House and my delegation in the \nHouse and the House is that bill will never see the light of day unless \nMorganza is put back. I do not know who is going to do it or how they \nare going to do it.\n  Please do not tell me there is not enough money. We send alone, \nLouisiana--forget Texas, forget Alabama, forget Mississippi--Louisiana \nalone every year sends about $5 billion to the Federal Treasury just \nfrom oil and gas severance taxes, not counting sales tax, income tax, \nproperty taxes, other taxes--property taxes would not come here, but \nincome taxes would come here, corporate income taxes would come here. \nThat is not even counting that.\n  I am tired of begging for nickels and dimes. So the House of \nRepresentatives better put Morganza to the Gulf back into that bill. \nNo. 2, I have not read the whole bill. I was just informed about it. So \nI may have to take this back off the record. But I was told also what \nthey did is say: We are not going to approve projects that had a \nChief's report after our committee meeting in June. Then they put some \nlanguage in that says something like: No project can go forward until \nthey have a committee meeting of the House of Representatives.\n  So they are basically engaging in earmarks again. In other words, \nhaving voted to take earmarks out--I was not for that. I did not go \nalong with that, but they did, the leadership of the House, take \nearmarks out. They are now trying to put earmarks back in. So the only \nway you get back in is if you go through their committee and get your \nproject approved, which is earmarking in a different way.\n  So on two fronts I think the House is wrong. I think they were wrong \nto take Morganza out, wrong to put this new system in.\n  The third and final thing I am going to say about this, which is the \nsaddest thing, because Morganza has to go back in, there are some other \nprojects they might have taken out that I am simply not aware of. But I \nknow that the bill that left this Senate was very fair. It was without \nearmarks. It was based on the science and the process of the Corps of \nEngineers. But to all of my friends in the Senate, even when I get \nMorganza back in there, and our delegation does, the problem for all of \nus is that there is still going to be $60 billion of authorized \nprojects for all of our States. The total budget of the Corps of \nEngineers next year that Senator Feinstein chairs--and I serve on the \nappropriations committee for the Corps of Engineers--will have only \n$1.6 billion for new construction.\n  The total Corps budget is only about $5 billion. So think about it. \nIs this not the silliest thing? We have $40 billion of already \nauthorized WRDA projects. The WRDA bill now has $20 billion minus \nMorganza to the Gulf, which they just took out for no good reason, \nafter 20 years of our people suffering. So they are going to add that \n20 plus Morganza which will get back in there. Then we are going to \nhave $60 billion, and all we have is a few billion to fund it.\n  It is a system that is so broken and so unfair. Every State feels \nthis. It is not just Louisiana. What people hear is my strong voice, I \nhope, for the people of Louisiana. We feel it the most. We feel it most \nfrequently just because of our geography. But every community in the \ncountry is suffering from this. We do not have enough infrastructure, \nwater infrastructure. Our ports are not where they need to be. Our \nrivers are not dredged to the depths they need to be. We do not have \nenough to maintain our maritime industry in this country.\n  This is undermining our economic strength and our international \ncompetitiveness, besides being terribly unfair to people who happen to \nlive along the coast, which is 60 percent of our population. So I am \njust sending a little warning signal to the House of Representatives: \nThere is no way, no way, that this WRDA bill is going to go anywhere \nwithout the Morganza to the Gulf in it. It is not happening. This is \none of those sort of do or die kind of issues for the Louisiana \ndelegation.\n  We have waited 20 years for this project. It is justified from every \nangle, shape, form. It has been studied to death. The local people have \nput up $200 million of their own money. I am not going home to tell \nthem they are not going to get the project. So I would strongly suggest \nour House delegation, particularly our leader Steve Scalise, the \nCongressman from Jefferson Parish, who is the chairman of the \nRepublican study group, go have a long talk with the chairman of the \ncommittee and figure out how to get this project back in the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/11/senate-section/article/S6370-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6370-S6371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ENERGY EFFICIENCY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I wish to move to another subject. I wish to offer at \nthis time two amendments to the underlying bill that we are trying to \ndebate, which is a very important bill on energy efficiency. I know we \ncannot debate any amendments, but I think I can offer two amendments.\n  I wish to tell my colleagues, the first I am offering with Senator \nWicker and Senator Pryor. It would ensure that the Green Building \nRating System, which is adopted by GSA currently, and new ones under \nthis bill that are put forth by Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman--I \nsupport the bill--do not put at a disadvantage the materials that meet \nthe new standard of energy efficiency in the underlying bill.\n  There was some question about the way the bill was initially worded \nwhen it came out of the Energy Committee that it would disqualify some \ndomestic materials that meet the energy efficient standards from being \nincluded. This would have a very devastating effect on our lumber and \nforestry industry, as well as others. I will send that amendment to the \ndesk when I am able and hope that we will get through this skirmish \nover health care and get to some very important amendments that will \nhelp us create jobs in America, Louisiana, and help our industries.\n  Secondly, I wish to speak about an amendment Senator Wicker and I \nwill offer that would ensure that small companies are excused from the \nrequirements to submit their products for expensive third-party testing \nto achieve ENERGY STAR certification.\n  This is really a small business issue. I think this is acceptable to \nall parties. I am not sure there is any opposition, actually, to either \none of these amendments, which is good. We have worked very hard with \nthe parties who might\n\n[[Page S6371]]\n\nhave a different view to see if we can find some common ground, and I \nthink we have.\n  I have spoken about these amendments which I will submit for the \nRecord when possible, and I hope we can get to the bill of Senator \nShaheen and Senator Portman. They have worked very hard, and they have \nbuilt a great coalition.\n  Again, this is a bill that could create many jobs and opportunities \nfor our people. While there are a lot of Members talking about how so-\nand-so should focus on jobs and he or she should do this or that, we \nhave a bill whose essence is to create very good jobs in America and to \nsave us energy costs and to reduce costs to taxpayers and consumers.\n  I believe this bill was voted unanimously out of the energy committee \nand, if not, it had overwhelming support from Republicans and \nDemocrats. Ron Wyden, the chairman our committee, who was a very able \nand centrist leader on these matters, has worked very hard. I am very \nfamiliar with the benefits of this bill. I am sorry it has become \ncaught up in the politics of health care, but it is important that we \nget to this Energy bill.\n  It is most important that the House of Representatives fix a terrible \nthing for Louisiana which happened just a few hours ago when they \nstripped, now for the 20th year in a row, a project that has been \ncertified, stamped, sealed, and approved by the Corps of Engineers. For \nwhatever reason they did this, I do not know. I hope they will fix it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/11/senate-section/article/S6371-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6371-S6372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMARKS OF JUDGE CHRISTINA REISS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on August 16, I had the honor of attending \na naturalization ceremony at the Ethan Allen Homestead Museum in \nBurlington, VT, conducted by the Chief Judge of the United States \nDistrict Court for the District of Vermont, Christina Reiss. This \nnaturalization ceremony was especially timely as the Senate had in June \nvoted strongly in favor of passing a comprehensive immigration reform \nbill. I am proud of the Senate's work on that legislation, and \nespecially proud of the thorough process we had in the Judiciary \nCommittee to give that legislation a fair and public hearing.\n  I have attended many naturalization ceremonies over the years and \nnever fail to come away inspired by the process and by the \nparticipants. Judge Reiss' most recent naturalization ceremony was a \nreminder of how meaningful American citizenship is, and of what an \naccomplishment it is for those who earn it. Judge Reiss invited me to \naddress the new Americans, but I was particularly moved by her remarks \nto the 10 new Americans who were naturalized as citizens of the United \nStates that day.\n  Judge Reiss delivered a positive, uplifting, and powerful message to \nthese men and women about what it means to be an American. Her message \nto them was one of hope. It was also a challenge to be the \ntransformative force that so many immigrants have been for America \nthroughout our history. Judge Reiss encouraged their civic \nparticipation and commitment to our constitutional values. She called \nupon them to be full participants in our democracy, to exercise their \nrights and their responsibilities by voting, and to embrace the rule of \nlaw. And Judge Reiss' remarks were a warm Vermont welcome to the 10 new \ncitizens who chose to make Vermont their home.\n  As I listened to Judge Reiss deliver her remarks, I reflected on my \nown family's history of immigration and the experience of my wife \nMarcelle's mother and father who became citizens and made Vermont their \nhome. I hope the message they heard when they swore the oath to become \ncitizens was as inspirational as the one Judge Reiss delivered this \nsummer in Vermont. And I hope the 10 new American citizens we welcomed \ntogether on August 16 will take her words to heart as they begin this \nnew chapter in their lives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Judge Reiss' remarks of August \n16, 2013, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Remarks by United States District Judge Christina Reiss\n\n Delivered at the Ethan Allen Homestead Museum in Burlington, Vermont, \n                            August 16, 2013\n\n       Ladies and Gentlemen:\n       It is my honor as Chief Judge of the United States District \n     Court for the District of Vermont, and as an American \n     citizen, to address you on this special occasion. You are \n     about to undergo an important transformation for which you \n     have carefully and thoughtfully prepared. By the end of this \n     ceremony, you will be a United States citizen.\n       I am sure that you had many thoughts and feelings as you \n     went through the process of becoming a United States citizen. \n     I want to assure you that you are not alone. Most people \n     here, including me, have had family members who went through \n     this very same process. America is a land of immigrants. With \n     the exception of Native Americans, we all come from other \n     places. Like you, our family members made sacrifices and \n     faced challenges in order to live in this country. We made \n     this country our home. You have made the important decision \n     to make it your home. This is exciting and important for both \n     you and for our country. Your transformation is our country's \n     transformation. Our country gains strength and becomes a \n     better place with the contributions of our new citizens.\n       You are about to take a solemn oath. In that oath, you will \n     claim the United States as your own country and you will \n     renounce allegiance to all others. You will swear to support \n     and defend the Constitution, and the laws of the United \n     States. And you will promise that you will bear true faith \n     and allegiance to this country. I want to talk with you \n     briefly about what some of those promises mean.\n       As you know, the United States of America was created \n     through a declaration by its citizens that it would, from now \n     on, be a free and independent nation. The Declaration of \n     Independence also recognizes that we are all created equal, \n     and that we are all entitled to ``life, liberty and the \n     pursuit of happiness.'' Those rights are not just something \n     written on a piece of paper. Those rights represent an \n     agreement between us, as fellow citizens, regarding how we \n     will treat each other. Those rights also represent an \n     agreement between us and our Government, regarding what we \n     may expect from our Government, and what it may expect from \n     us in return.\n       You, too, will be able to enjoy the freedoms guaranteed by \n     the United States Constitution. But as always, with any right \n     comes responsibilities. In accepting the benefits of American \n     citizenship, you likewise accept its responsibilities.\n       Our society, our freedom, depends on the rule of law. The \n     rule of law requires that every person obey the laws of this \n     country. No person and no organization is above the law. The \n     rule of law is thus an agreement of the citizens of this \n     country to obey the law, to defend it, and to uphold it. The \n     rule of law is what makes our country safe, free, and \n     productive.\n       If you disagree with a law, you may work to change it. You \n     may vote, you may exercise your freedom of speech, you may \n     seek elected or appointed office, and you may petition the \n     Government. In this country, we encourage citizens to get \n     involved and to work to change the country and its laws for \n     the better.\n       I know that some of you may come from countries where this \n     opportunity was not available to you. Indeed, you may come \n     from places where by seeking to change a law, you put your \n     life in danger. Here, your right to lawfully seek change will \n     be fully protected.\n       I urge you to exercise all of your rights and \n     responsibilities as a United States citizen. The right to \n     vote is endangered each time you fail to vote. The freedom of \n     speech is threatened when you do not express your opinions, \n     and stand silent when you should speak up. It is also \n     threatened when you do not tolerate the views of others, or \n     allow their rights to be violated. The rights of all citizens \n     must be protected, if you expect your own rights to be \n     protected.\n       Before I end my remarks, I want to say a few things about \n     Vermont because I believe that you have chosen to live in a \n     very special place. As you know, Vermont was not one of the \n     original 13 colonies to sign the Declaration of Independence, \n     but it was the first state to forbid slavery in its own \n     constitution in 1777. Vermont has often been at the forefront \n     of this country in protecting human rights. This is a special \n     place. It is a beautiful place. Enjoy it, cherish it, and \n     make it your home. You are welcome here. President Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower said something about Vermonters which I think is \n     very true. In speaking to the people gathered at the State \n     Dairy Festival in Rutland, he said:\n       ``There are certain things I do know about you. I know that \n     Americans everywhere are the same, in their longing for \n     peace, a peace that is characterized by justice, by \n     consideration for others, by decency above all, by its \n     insistence on respect for the individual human being.''\n       It is my hope that your life in the United States is \n     characterized by justice, by consideration for others, by \n     decency, and by insistence on respect for all human beings.\n       In conclusion, I wish simply to say, ``Welcome my fellow \n     American citizens. Welcome, my American brothers and \n     sisters.'' I wish you success and happiness in pursuing the \n     American dream.\n\n[[Page S6372]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/11/senate-section/article/S6372-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            REMEMBERING 9/11\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleagues in \ncommemorating the anniversary of the terrorist attacks on September 11, \n2001. Twelve years ago America was dealt a blow, but in the years \nsince, we have continued to rebuke the message of hate that was brought \nto our doorstep. What is more is that we affirm our core American \nvalues that were magnified in the days following those attacks.\n  We are still `` one Nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and \njustice for all.'' We are still a diverse nation of many races, \nreligions, and ideas united under the same flag. Maybe most important, \nwe are still at our best when we come together.\n  Every year we are reminded that though we are a strong and determined \nnation, we are still healing from the wounds we suffered that day 12 \nyears ago. No amount of time can rationalize the senseless violence or \nbring back a loved one. It is important to note that we have brought \nmany of the terrorists, including Osama bin Laden, to justice, and we \nhave made great strides in ensuring that those who wish to do us harm \nlike they did on 9/11 will be unable to do so.\n  Our men and women in uniform, the intelligence community, Foreign \nService officers, and the people entrusted with safeguarding our \nborders, bridges, air and seaports and key infrastructure, have made \ngreat sacrifices to ensure our continued safety in a \npost-9/11 world and we owe so much to these men and women, and the \nfamilies who support them.\n  Today, we join together to show the world that our Nation is united \nand firmly resolved to defend our freedom and safeguard our liberty \nagainst any enemy.\n  We also take time to remember those Americans who perished on 9/11 \nand to remember them and their families with a special prayer. We \nreflect on the heroism of the firefighters, police officers, medical \nworkers, city officials, and ordinary citizens who gave their own lives \ntrying to save others. Who could ever forget the images of firefighters \nand other first responders going up the stairs of the World Trade \nCenter as everyone else was heading to safety? Each of us has been \naffected by 9/11. It is a day seared into the national memory.\n  We cannot forget 9/11 because the virtues that carried us though the \ndays, weeks, and years have been with us since the beginning: 9/11 did \nnot teach firefighters and police to sacrifice, nor did it teach unity \namong neighbors. It did not teach empathy toward strangers or \ncompassion toward friends.\n  Rather, these quintessential American virtues were with us all along; \n9/11 just put them under a spotlight for all to see. On 9/11 we showed \nthe world a brand of resilience, compassion, and strength that could \nonly be ``made in America''.\n  And so, 12 years after the most heinous attacks in our Nation's \nhistory, we stand tall. We stand tall, not weighed down by the gravity \nof 9/11 but made stronger by it. We remain united in our diversity like \nno other nation on Earth, `` one Nation, under God, indivisible, with \nliberty and justice for all.''\n  Mr. CHIESA. Mr. President, I vividly recall, as do most Americans, \nexactly where I was 12 years ago this morning. My son, Al, who had only \nrecently celebrated his third birthday, was beginning his very first \nday at preschool. It was a big day for my wife Jenny and me, filled \nwith that mixture of excitement and trepidation that is familiar to all \nyoung parents.\n  Shortly after waving goodbye to Al, we heard the shocking news--an \nairplane had hit the South Tower of the World Trade Center.\n  As a native New Jerseyan, raised in the shadow of the Twin Towers, I \ncould picture the scene in my mind's eye.\n  My first assumption was that a small plane--perhaps one of the \nsightseeing planes that provided visitors with a bird's-eye view of the \nwonders of Lower Manhattan and the harbor--had somehow flown off course \ninto the building.\n  Less than 20 minutes later, however, when the second plane hit, I \nknew, as we all did, that this was no accident. America was under \nattack. And as the morning unfolded and the horror increased--the \nPentagon was hit, the towers fell, United flight 93 was brought to the \nground near Shanksville, PA--my thoughts turned to faith and family.\n  I thought of my son--young and innocent, starting his very first day \nin school--and I realized the world that existed when we dropped him \noff that morning had changed.\n  I thought of so many friends and neighbors who might very well have \nbeen on the plane that flew out of Newark that morning or in those \nproud buildings that had been reduced to rubble. I hoped and prayed \nthat they were safe.\n  I thought of the people who had surely lost their lives in the \nattacks--in numbers more than any of us could bear, as Mayor Giuliani \nso eloquently put it--and prayed for them and their families.\n  And as the day drew to its awful conclusion, I knew that for so many, \nthe terrible anguish of this day was just beginning, and the reminders \nof that were everywhere: the children whose parents would never arrive \nto pick their children up from school, the empty place at the dinner \ntable, the gaping hole in the hearts of those who loved those who \nperished.\n  Twelve years later, the passage of time has, for many, helped to \nbring some measure of healing. But the scars remain, and they will \nnever completely fade away.\n  So today we remember, as we do every year and as we should every day, \nall those who lost their lives, both in the terrorist attacks \nthemselves and also on foreign fields of battle in the defense of our \nfreedom and our way of life.\n  We remember today, as we do every year and as we should every day, \nall those who were injured in the attacks and on the battlefield.\n  We remember today, as we do every year and as we should every day, \nall those who responded to the attacks with bravery and determination \nand many of whom still struggle with the aftermath of their courageous \nactions.\n  And we remember today, as we do every year and should every day, all \nthose who lost friends, colleagues, and family members in the attacks \nand in the years since. Their suffering is our suffering and we must \nnever forget that.\n  Today is also a day for renewal, for renewing the sense of purpose \nthat united our nation in the aftermath of the attacks, for renewing \nthe spirit of cooperation that made it possible for our country to move \nforward, both through individual acts of courage, kindness, and \ncompassion and through acts of governance that helped us meet the \nchallenges we faced, and for renewing our determination to keep America \nsafe while also safeguarding our liberties.\n  Twelve years ago today, when Jenny and I dropped off our son for his \nvery first day of school--he is, by the way, now a high school \nfreshman--we could never have imagined how much the world would change \nbefore he had even settled in to his new preschool routine.\n  But although so much has changed, one thing remains constant: \nAmerica, is, as she always had been, a beacon of hope to the world. No \nact of terror--no matter how brutal--will ever diminish the bright, \nshining light of the American spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/11/senate-section/article/S6372-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6372-S6373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING NICOLAE GHEORGHE\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, on August 8, Nicolae Gheorghe, one of the \nleading figures of the Romani civil rights movement, passed away. He \nwas devoted to improving the situation of Roma, ultimately playing a \npivotal role on the international stage and especially within the OSCE. \nGheorghe lived an extraordinary life and will be long remembered for \nhis singular contribution to the advancement of human rights.\n  Nicolae Gheorghe was born in 1946 in Romania during the aftermath of \nthe fascist regime led by Marshall Ion Atonescu. His mother had \nnarrowly escaped the mass deportations of 25,000 Roma planned and \nimplemented by the Antonescu regime.\n  Members of the Helsinki Commission first met Nicolae Gheorghe when \nSenator Dennis DeConcini and Representative Steny Hoyer, then-Chairman \nand Cochairman, led a delegation to Romania in April 1990. At that \ntime, Gheorghe was emerging as one of the clearest and most compelling \nvoices sounding the alarm about the deplorable situation of Roma. \nAlthough the\n\n[[Page S6373]]\n\nfall of communism in Central Europe ushered in an era of \ndemocratization, it also gave free rein to old bigotry against Roma. In \nfact, only a few months after that visit, police efforts to remove \ndemonstrators from Bucharest degenerated into brutal attacks on the \noffices of opposition papers, opposition leaders' homes, and members of \nthe Romani minority.\n  At almost the same time, the OSCE participating States were meeting \nin Copenhagen negotiating what would become one of the most ambitious \nagreements of the Helsinki process: the seminal 1990 Copenhagen \nDocument. I was part of a delegation Representative Hoyer led to that \nhistoric meeting where we raised our concerns about religious and \nethnic minorities directly with the delegation from Romania.\n  It was also in Copenhagen where Nicolae Gheorghe pressed--\nsuccessfully--for the adoption of the first reference in any \ninternational human rights agreement to the specific problems faced by \nRoma. The U.S. delegation to that meeting, headed by the late \nAmbassador Max Kamplemen, helped secure the inclusion of that text in \nthe final document.\n  But in the context of post-Communist economic and political \ntransition, Roma became targets of ethnically motivated attacks. In \nRomania, dozens of pogroms against Roma were carried out between 1990 \nand 1997, prompting Gheorghe and others to found Romani CRISS in 1993. \nThe name is a Romanian acronym for Center for Social Intervention and \nStudies but also a play on the Romani word ``kris,'' which is a kind of \ncouncil of elders. In the 1990s, he worked with the New Jersey-based \nProject on Ethnic Relations and served on the board of the European \nRoma Rights Center.\n  He also brought his concerns to the United States. In 1994, the House \nCommittee on Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, \nInternational Organizations, and Human Rights, chaired by \nRepresentative Tom Lantos, convened the first hearing before Congress \non the situation of Roma. Gheorghe, joined by Romani activists Ian \nHancock, Andrzej Mirga, and Klara Orgovanova, testified, along with \nLivia Plaks of the Project on Ethnic Relations.\n  Gheorghe argued that anti-Roma attitudes and behaviors could serve as \na barometer to gauge the success of countries building democratic \ninstitutions, the rule of law, and ``the consolidation of civil \nmovements and associations and societies and states deeply distorted by \nthe decades of pro-fascist, authoritarian and communist totalitarian \nregimes.''\n  He presciently surveyed the scope and implications of anti-Roma \nmanifestations including in Bosnia, Germany, the Czech and Slovak \nRepublics, and Romania. ``[T]he most important assistance which can be \nbrought to or sent to our region is the rule of law, the breeding of \ndemocratic institutions, and careful implementation of individual human \nrights.'' Gheorghe testified at Helsinki Commission briefings and \nhearings in 2002 and 2006.\n  Nicolae Gheorghe also became a fixture at OSCE human rights \nmeetings--first in his capacity as an NGO, then as the first senior \nadviser on Romani issues for the OSCE Office for Democratic \nInstitutions and Human Rights. In whatever capacity he worked, he was a \nrelentless advocate for the human rights of Romani people.\n  His appointment coincided with the deterioration of the situation in \nKosovo, the NATO air campaign against Milosevic's Serbia, and the \nsubsequent deployment of a large OSCE mission to Kosovo. As a \nconsequence of developments in the Balkans, he became immediately \nengaged on issues relating to the displacement of Kosovo Roma to \nMacedonia and elsewhere. Throughout his tenure with the OSCE, which \nlasted through 2006, his work was driven by the need for crisis \nmanagement stemming from acts of violence and other extreme \nmanifestations of prejudice against Roma--not only in the Balkans but \nelsewhere in the OSCE region as well.\n  In his 2006 testimony before the Helsinki Commission, he observed \nthat international organizations had largely focused on the situation \nof Roma in Central Europe, neglecting Western countries such as Greece, \nFrance, Spain, and Italy. ``I don't think that Europe for the time \nbeing realizes the depth of the racism and racist attitudes in its \nstructures, [in] Europe as a whole.'' The mass fingerprinting of Roma \nin Italy in 2008 and the expulsions of Roma from France in 2010 would \nillustrate that Gheorghe had spoken with typical insight.\n  I wish that I could say Nicolae Gheorghe's work to advance the human \nrights of Roma was complete. Clearly, it is not. Each day, it must be \ncarried on by the many people he encouraged and a new generation of \nactivists. Toward that end, our load is lighter because of the burdens \nhe carried, our goals are nearer because of the distance he traveled, \nand we are inspired by his legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/11/senate-section/article/S6373-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6373-S6374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING RANDY UDALL\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I wish to take this \nopportunity to again thank my colleagues for their kind words on the \npassing of Randy Udall. Their condolences, and those of so many people \nwho knew and loved Randy, have been a great source of comfort to our \nfamily. I would also like to share with them Randy's obituary, \npublished in the Aspen Times, as we remember Randy and celebrate his \nlife.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the obituary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       James ``Randy'' Udall, a native son of the American West, \n     died June 20, 2013, on the eve of the Summer Solstice, doing \n     what he loved most, hiking in the remote Wind River \n     Mountains. He was 61 years old. The cause of his death: \n     natural.\n       Randy was both a visionary and a pragmatist. Known for the \n     size of his heart and the breadth of his wild mind, Randy \n     Udall was all about energy: physical and mental. His \n     expertise on domestic and international energy sustainability \n     was singular, both as a free-lance writer and as an advocate. \n     In 1984, he co-founded the nonprofit Community Office for \n     Resource Efficiency (CORE) in Carbondale, Colorado, where he \n     served for 13 years as director. CORE's partnerships with \n     electric utilities and local governments led to Colorado's \n     first solar energy incentive program, the world's first \n     Renewable Energy Mitigation Program and some of the most \n     progressive green power purchasing programs in America.\n       In 2005, Randy co-founded the Association for the Study of \n     Peak Oil-USA to track the shifting balance between world oil \n     supply and depletion. He was a brilliant communicator, owned \n     by no one, plain-spoken, humble, and nuanced. He was a \n     celebrated speaker engaging audiences world-wide on the \n     complexities of energy development. He was the rare thought \n     leader who put his thoughts into action. Randy's home in \n     Carbondale was retrofitted with solar panels that he often \n     shared would keep 300,000 pounds of carbon dioxide out of the \n     atmosphere over 20 years. The energy bill on his 2,000-\n     square-foot home was a mere $300 per year.\n       Randy Udall told hard truths: ``We have been living like \n     gods,'' he often said. ``Our task now is to learn how to live \n     like humans. Our descent will not be easy.''\n       Randy Udall was born on October 29, 1951, in Tucson, Ariz., \n     to former Arizona Congressman Morris K. Udall and Patricia \n     Emery Udall. His education was informed by Prescott College \n     and the University of Denver, but he graduated from neither. \n     He subscribed to what John Wesley Powell called ``a home-\n     grown education'' driven by place and fueled by curiosity. \n     His path of inquiry was grounded in auto mechanics, \n     carpentry, a commitment to writing, environmental studies, \n     and advocacy. He also worked for Outward Bound as a \n     wilderness instructor. Instinct, intuition, and experience \n     became the bedrock of his uncommon wisdom.\n       Randy belonged to a respected political family. Alongside \n     the distinguished political career of his father, he was the \n     nephew of Stewart Udall, Secretary of the Interior during the \n     Kennedy and Johnson administrations, from whom he drew great \n     inspiration. His eldest brother Mark Udall and his cousin Tom \n     Udall currently represent Colorado and New Mexico in the U.S. \n     Senate. With his usual wit and candor, he often apologized \n     for politicians in the West, but he never abandoned his \n     family's commitment to public service and embrace of the open \n     space of democracy.\n       In the 1980s, Randy reported on the Sanctuary Movement for \n     the Tucson Citizen, riding the underground railroad and \n     listening to the plight of the refugees it carried from \n     Central America to the United States. He was the first \n     reporter to break the story of the Tucson Sanctuary Movement \n     nationally and garner support and justice for them. Through \n     his writing, Randy continually sought to give voice to others \n     and to the land. ``I love forms beyond my own, and regret the \n     borders between us,'' wrote Loren Eiseley, one of Randy's \n     favorite authors.\n       In 1987, Randy co-authored ``Too Funny To Be President'' \n     with his father, Mo Udall, and Bob Neuman. And in 1993, he \n     collaborated with his uncle Stewart Udall and renowned \n     photographer David Muench on the book, ``National Parks of \n     America.''\n\n[[Page S6374]]\n\n       He was a man who loved words and big ideas. As much as he \n     loved to climb mountains, he loved the landscape of public \n     discourse. Randy will be remembered as an extraordinary \n     listener and a lively raconteur. He gave dignity to his \n     conversations, be it with a roughneck on an oil patch or \n     testing and charming an environmentalist over beer. He was at \n     home with those who cared. His alliances were creative and \n     brave. He possessed an open mind, and at times, a fierce one, \n     calling for an ethics of a place. Randy did not hesitate to \n     go toe-to-toe with oil executives, calling for \n     accountability, when discussing the realities of peak oil.\n       But most of all, Randy Udall loved all things wild: skiing \n     across Baffin Island in the 1976; casting a line of light on \n     a meandering river; hiking the Colorado Rockies with his \n     children. In an email to his daughter Tarn, when rafting with \n     her brother down the Tatshenshini River in Alaska, he said \n     simply, lovingly, ``Stay warm, stay fed, and feed the morale \n     meter, too.'' He was a man of paradoxes: a loner and a \n     communitarian; joyful and brooding; present one minute and \n     gone, the next. And his vast frame of reference was apparent \n     by the diversity on his bookshelves with Mary Oliver's \n     ``Collected Poems'' next to ``A Field Guide to Geology''; \n     Ivan Doig's nonfiction shelved next to ``The Prize: The Epic \n     Quest for Oil, Money & Power'' by Daniel Yergin. When Wallace \n     Stegner admonished Westerners ``to create a society to match \n     the scenery,'' this was the joyous life work of Randy Udall.\n       Randy is survived by his beloved wife, Leslie Emerson and \n     their three children, Ren, Tarn, and Torrey Udall; his five \n     siblings: Mark Udall (wife, Maggie Fox), Judith Udall \n     (husband, Ben Harding), Anne Udall (partner, Tillie Clark), \n     Brad Udall (wife, Jane Backer), and Kate Udall; and his \n     nephews, Jed Udall and Clay Harding, and niece, Tess Udall. \n     He also leaves behind his cousin, Tom Udall, alongside Denis \n     Udall, Scott Udall, Lynn Udall, Lori Udall, and Jay Udall. He \n     is preceded in death by his father, Morris K. Udall, his \n     mother, Patricia Emery Udall, his uncle Stewart Udall, and \n     his nephew Luke Harding.\n       In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to: The Randy \n     Udall Memorial Fund, Alpine Bank, 350 Highway 133, \n     Carbondale, Colorado, 81623.

Mr. President, today I wish to ask my colleagues to \njoin me in recognizing Warren Easton High School in New Orleans, LA. \nThe students, faculty, staff, school leaders, alumni and community \nmembers are celebrating 100 years of excellence in education and \nservice to the New Orleans community.\n  Warren Easton High School is the oldest public high school in \nLouisiana. Named after a local superintendent of schools in New \nOrleans, Warren Easton represents what excellence in education should \nlook like. The school has transitioned from when it opened as an all-\nboys high school in Uptown New Orleans, then a new location on Canal \nStreet in 1913, to a co-educational setting in 1952 and racial \nintegration in 1967. However, perhaps Warren Easton High School's most \nprofound transformation came in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.\n  After the storm that devastated so many lives, infrastructures, and a \nway of life in New Orleans, Warren Easton was forced to close its doors \nfor 1 year. Fortunately, thanks to the strong and spirited history of \nthis school, Warren Easton was opened as a charter school by a group of \nalumni. Even in the face of challenge, the leaders and alumni created \nan institution that would not only honor the history of Warren Easton \nand its previous success, but will continue to create new opportunities \nfor the students of New Orleans.\n  Since its opening in 2007, Warren Easton High School has seen \ntremendous growth. During the last school year, 925 students attended \nschool there. For the past 2 years, the school has celebrated a \ngraduation rate of 100 percent. Student performance has also \ndramatically increased since the reopening of Warren Easton High School \nwith a school performance score of 64.7 in 2007 and 133.9 in 2012. \nFurther, the 2012 graduating class received over $6.2 million in \nscholarships from more than 20 colleges and universities.\n  Warren Easton is a leading example of excellence in education. Its \nleaders, alumni, and students continue to be an inspiration to their \ncommunity. It is with my heartfelt and greatest sincerity that I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in recognizing Warren Easton High School in New \nOrleans, LA, and its long-time alumni community as they celebrate 100 \nyears of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/11/senate-section/article/S6374-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        NEWINGTON, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to join with the \npeople of Newington, NH, as they celebrate the town's 300th \nanniversary.\n  Located in Rockingham County, Newington is surrounded on three sides \nby water--the Piscataqua River to the northeast, Little Bay to the \nnorthwest and Great Bay to the west. Due to its close proximity to \nwater, agriculture became the way of life in the early years of this \ntown.\n  The town was originally part of Dover and was known as Bloody Point, \nso named because of the battle between men from Dover and Portsmouth \nwho were vying for more land. In 1640 Thomas Trickery established the \nBloody Point Ferry, which crossed the Piscataqua to Hilton's Point and \nwas the only connection between Dover and Portsmouth. Because of the \ndifficulty in getting to the church in Dover, early settlers \nestablished a meetinghouse at Bloody Point in 1712. In 1713 local \nresidents held a meeting to hire a minister, and on May 12, 1714, \nGovernor Dudley granted the request and renamed the parish from Bloody \nPoint to Newington. This meetinghouse is still owned by the town and is \nconsidered the oldest meetinghouse in New Hampshire. In addition to \nthis historic landmark, residents set land aside to create a town \nforest in 1710. This forest is the oldest surviving town forest in the \nUnited States and is listed on the National Register of Historic \nPlaces.\n  The number of farms grew during the late 1800s thanks in part to the \nconstruction of the railroad bridge to Dover point in 1873. The \nrailroad provided the ability to transport perishable commodities, such \nas apples and dairy, to new markets. Today the population has grown to \ninclude over 750 residents, whose patriotism and commitment is \nreflected in part by their record of service in defense of our Nation.\n  Over the past several decades, Newington has seen a dramatic change \nfrom an agricultural community to an industrial and commercial hub. In \nthe 1950s, the Federal Government acquired land to build Pease Air \nForce Base, over half of which is located in the town of Newington. \nAlthough this base closed, the area has been redeveloped into what is \nnow the Pease International Tradeport. Even with these recent changes, \nthe town of Newington has maintained its quaint and historic character.\n  Whether it is the popular Newington Mall, the historic town forest or \nthe Great Bay National Wildlife Refuge, the citizens of Newington have \ncontributed much to the life and heritage of New Hampshire during the \ntown's first 300 years. On this day, we honor the 300th anniversary of \nNewington, salute its citizens, and recognize their accomplishments, \ntheir love of country, and their spirit of independence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/11/senate-section/article/S6374-3", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/11/senate-section/article/S6374-4", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/11/senate-section/article/S6374-5", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6374-S6375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:33 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 130.

A bill to amend the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nAct of 1990 to improve child safety and reduce the incidence of \npreventable infant deaths in child care settings; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Collins, to introduce the Child Care Infant Mortality Act. This \nis bipartisan legislation that would allow states participating in the \nChild Care Development Block Grant, CCDBG, to use part of this funding \nfor child safety training.\n  Currently, states participating in Child Care Development Block \nGrant, CCDBG, are required to set aside at least 4 percent of funds to \nimprove the quality of the programs offered in their states. Our bill \nwould simply ensure that strategies to enhance child safety, including \ndisseminating information related to prevention strategies for sudden \nunexpected infant death, are included in as an allowable use of funds.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, CDC, and the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, half of the approximately 4,500 SUID cases in \nthe United States are entirely preventable with effective training and \nimplementation of correct sleep practices. It is estimated that child \ncare settings account for 20 percent of all SUID fatalities in the \nUnited States. Life-saving sleep strategies, first aid and CPR are \nsuccessful in preventing infant death and are easily implementable; yet \ntraining is not currently an allowable use of funds under the Child \nCare and Development Block Grant Act.\n  Nationally, over 4,500 infants die suddenly with no immediate obvious \ncause every year. These deaths are not highly publicized by the media \nbecause of the severe pain it causes families. A large percentage of \nchild care providers are unaware of the risks of sleep associated \ninfant deaths until they come face-to-face with a death of a child \nunder their care. The more aware providers are of safe sleep practices, \nthe more likely they are to follow suggested guidelines. In particular, \nposting safe-sleep practices and offering required training can further \ncut the number of infants we lose every year to sudden unexpected \ninfant death. Beyond safe sleep practices, child care provider training \nin CPR and first aid will allow providers to identify and address \npotentially harmful situations for infants.\n  The Child Care Infant Mortality Prevention Act of 2013 expands the \nlist of allowable uses for CCDBG funding to permit states to use this \nfunding on activities to improve child care quality. Our bill would \nalso require the Secretary to update and make widely available-\ntraining, instructional materials, and other information on safe sleep \npractices and other sudden unexpected infant death prevention \nstrategies.\n  I am proud that Senator Susan Collins has joined me as an original \ncosponsor of this bill.\n  It is essential that this issue is addressed by building upon the \nexisting structure and capacity of the networks of Child Care providers \nparticipating in the Child Care and Development Block Grant. It is \ncritical that we work to ensure that child safety is a primary goal of \nthe block grant, and that appropriate and adequate training on safe \nsleep practices, first aid, and CPR are included in the training \nregimen promoted by this Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1494\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Care Infant Mortality \n     Prevention Act of 2013''.\n\n[[Page S6380]]\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) For millions of today's working families, child care is \n     an essential ingredient of their success. Child care helps \n     children, families, and communities prosper, and helps the \n     Nation maintain its competitive edge.\n       (2) Close to 12,000,000 children under age 5, and \n     10,000,000 over the age of 5, are in some type of child care \n     setting each day.\n       (3) More than 60 percent of children are cared for \n     regularly in a child care setting.\n       (4) Recent polls of working parents found that parents are \n     primarily concerned about safety and quality of care, \n     followed by cost.\n       (5) Nationally, the most common form of death among post-\n     neonatal infants under age 1 is death occurring during sleep, \n     as a result of incorrect sleeping practices.\n       (6) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, each year in the United States, more than 4,500 \n     infants die suddenly of no immediately obvious cause. Half of \n     these sudden unexpected infant deaths are due to Sudden \n     Infant Death Syndrome, the leading cause of sudden unexpected \n     infant deaths and all deaths among infants who are not \n     younger than 1 month but younger than 12 months.\n       (7) Researchers estimate that child care settings account \n     for at least 20 percent of sudden unexpected infant deaths in \n     the United States.\n       (8) In its 2011 report on child care center licensing \n     regulations, Child Care Aware of America, formerly known as \n     the National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral \n     Agencies, noted that--\n       (A) extensive research and recommendations from \n     organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the \n     National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention favor \n     simple life-saving safe sleep strategies to eliminate serious \n     risk factors for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and sudden \n     unexpected infant death; and\n       (B) the strategies noted in subparagraph (A) are not \n     universally required under the Child Care and Development \n     Block Grant Act of 1990 nor in the majority of State child \n     care regulations.\n\n     SEC. 3. GOALS.\n\n       Section 658A(b)(5) of the Child Care and Development Block \n     Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858 note) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(5) to ensure the health, safety, development and well-\n     being of children in programs supported under this subchapter \n     and to assist States in improving the overall quality of \n     child care services and programs by implementing the health, \n     safety, licensing, and oversight standards established in \n     State law (including regulations).''.\n\n     SEC. 4. APPLICATION AND PLAN.\n\n       Section 658E(c)(2)(F) of the Child Care and Development \n     Block Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 6858c(c)(2)(F)) is amended \n     by striking clause (iii) and all that follows and inserting \n     the following:\n       ``(iii) minimum health and safety training appropriate to \n     the provider setting, including training on cardiopulmonary \n     resuscitation, first aid, safe sleep practices and other \n     sudden unexpected infant death prevention strategies.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE CHILD SAFETY AND IMPROVE THE \n                   QUALITY OF CHILD CARE.\n\n       Section 658G of the Child Care and Development Block Grant \n     Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858e) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``choice, and'' and inserting ``choice,''; \n     and\n       (2) by striking the period and inserting ``training \n     (including training in safe sleep practices, first aid, and \n     cardiopulmonary resuscitation), and other activities designed \n     to ensure and improve the health and safety of children \n     receiving child care services under this subchapter.''.\n\n     SEC. 6. DISSEMINATION OF MATERIALS AND INFORMATION ON SAFE \n                   SLEEP AND OTHER SUDDEN UNEXPECTED INFANT DEATH \n                   PREVENTION STRATEGIES.\n\n       Section 658K of the Child Care and Development Block Grant \n     Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858i) is amended--\n       (1) by striking the section header and inserting the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 658K. REPORTS, AUDITS, AND INFORMATION.''\n\n     ; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c) Information on Sudden Unexpected Infant Death \n     Prevention Strategies.--The Secretary, working with the \n     Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     and the Director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National \n     Institute of Child Health and Human Development, shall--\n       ``(1) update training, instructional materials, and other \n     information on safe sleep practices and other sudden \n     unexpected infant death prevention strategies; and\n       ``(2) widely distribute the training, materials, and \n     information to parents, child care providers, pediatricians, \n     home visitors, community colleges, and other individuals and \n     entities.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KIRK:\n  S. 1496. A bill to enhance taxpayer accountability at public \ntransportation agencies; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I rise to address a crisis of confidence at \nChicagoland's suburban commuter railroad--Metra. Metra plays a vital \nrole for our area--reducing congestion and carrying thousands of \nsuburban residents to and from Chicago each day. But recent \ndevelopments highlight a troubled transit system and a misuse of public \ndollars.\n  Earlier this summer it was reported that Metra CEO Alex Clifford \nreceived a severance package worth nearly $750,000 following \nallegations of political influence at the agency. Clifford received \n$442,237 alone just to buyout the remaining term of his contract, on \ntop of $307,390 for an additional 12 months if he is unable to find new \nemployment.\n  This is a gross misuse of public dollars. With this action, Metra's \nformer CEO makes more than President Obama, who currently makes \n$400,000 a year. I asked the Congressional Research Service how this \ngolden parachute ranks compared to the annual salary of the top ten \nlargest transit agencies in the country, and the results were \nsurprising. Each of the top 10 largest transit systems pays their chief \nexecutive no more than $350,000, meaning Metra, the 24th largest \ntransit agency in the country, had the highest earning CEO.\n  Fortunately federal taxpayer dollars did not contribute to Clifford's \ngolden parachute. But Metra is expected to receive more than $135 \nmillion in federal capital dollars. If our local government bodies \ncan't be trusted to be good stewards of the public, then the Congress \nshould step in to put in place reasonable taxpayer protections.\n  Today I have introduced the Public Transportation Accountability Act \nwhich for the first time will put limits on executive compensation at \npublic transit agencies that receive federal funds. No executive or \nemployee of a transit agency would be able to receive annual \ncompensation that is greater than that of the President of the United \nStates. This is a common sense bill that sadly is necessary to \nsafeguard taxpayers' pocketbooks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/11/senate-section/article/S6380-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6380-S6381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 222--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL SAVE \nFOR RETIREMENT WEEK, INCLUDING RAISING PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THE VARIOUS \n  TAX-PREFERRED RETIREMENT VEHICLES AND INCREASING PERSONAL FINANCIAL \n                                LITERACY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Mr. Enzi) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 222\n\n       Whereas people in the United States are living longer, and \n     the cost of retirement is increasing significantly;\n       Whereas Social Security remains the bedrock of retirement \n     income for the great majority of the people of the United \n     States but was never intended by Congress to be the sole \n     source of retirement income for families;\n       Whereas recent data from the Employee Benefit Research \n     Institute indicates that, in the United States, less than \\3/\n     5\\ of workers or their spouses are saving for retirement, and \n     the amount that workers have saved for retirement is much \n     less than the amount they need to adequately fund their \n     retirement years;\n       Whereas the financial literacy of workers in the United \n     States is important to their understanding of the need to \n     save for retirement;\n       Whereas saving for retirement is a key component of overall \n     financial health and security during retirement years, and \n     the importance of financial literacy in planning for \n     retirement must be advocated;\n       Whereas many workers may not be aware of their options in \n     saving for retirement or may not have focused on the \n     importance of, and need for, saving for retirement;\n       Whereas, although many employees have access through their \n     employers to defined benefit and defined contribution plans \n     to assist them in preparing for retirement, many of those \n     employees may not be taking advantage of those plans at all \n     or to the full extent allowed by Federal law;\n       Whereas saving for retirement is necessary even during \n     economic downturns or market declines, which makes continued \n     contributions all the more important;\n       Whereas all workers, including public and private sector \n     employees, employees of tax-exempt organizations, and self-\n     employed individuals, can benefit from developing personal \n     budgets and financial plans that include retirement savings \n     strategies that take advantage of tax-preferred retirement \n     savings vehicles; and\n\n[[Page S6381]]\n\n       Whereas the week October 20 through October 26, 2013 has \n     been designated as ``National Save for Retirement Week'': \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Save for \n     Retirement Week, including raising public awareness of the \n     importance of saving adequately for retirement;\n       (2) supports the need to raise public awareness of a \n     variety of ways to save for retirement that are favored under \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and that, although utilized \n     by many people in the United States, should be utilized by \n     more; and\n       (3) calls on States, localities, schools, universities, \n     nonprofit organizations, businesses, other entities, and the \n     people of the United States to observe National Save for \n     Retirement Week with appropriate programs and activities, \n     with the goal of increasing the retirement savings and \n     personal financial literacy of all people in the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/11/senate-section/article/S6381-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1852.

Mr. President, I commend the managers of the energy \nefficiency bill, Senator Wyden, chairman of the full committee, Senator \nMurkowski, the ranking member, and the sponsors of this legislation, \nSenators Shaheen and Portman, for their work in bringing this bill to \nthe floor and managing it today.\n  We have had a number of Senators who have tried to offer amendments. \nI was told by Senator Shaheen that she had a dozen or so bipartisan \namendments that were waiting to be offered. There has been an attempt \nto offer amendments dealing with the bill but there is a little hurdle \nhere with something that is totally nongermane that has been offered.\n  One of the amendments Senator Udall of Colorado would like to offer \nis a bipartisan amendment to promote energy retrofitting of schools. \nSenator Bennet of Colorado seeks to offer a bipartisan amendment to \nfacilitate best practices in commercial real estate energy efficiency. \nSenator Klobuchar would like to offer her amendment to promote energy \nretrofitting of nonprofit buildings. But once again, Mr. President, \nonce again my Republican colleagues can't help themselves. They have \nobjected to the consideration of any of these amendments or any other \namendments until the Senate considers an amendment--and not only \nconsiders an amendment but is guaranteed a vote on it.\n  Pretty interesting situation. The Senator's amendment is, of course, \nand everyone knows it, only for looks. It is a ``gotcha'' amendment. \nThe Senator's amendment is the sort of amendment that is to help get \nsome headlines in newspapers or some kind of news story. We recognize \nit is for show. But be that as it may, we will work with managers to \ncraft a way forward on this bill, perhaps, or we may have to take the \nbill down. But we will make that decision at a subsequent time.\n  It is unfortunate, but that is the political world we live in now \nwith the tea-party-driven House of Representatives. And by the way--of \ncourse everyone knows by now--they couldn't pass their continuing \nresolution today, so that is off the table. They were going to do that \nnot today but tomorrow, and they pulled that down. Then we have our \nfolks over here trying to just outmatch what they do over there so we \nwind up getting nothing done. Such a shame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/11/senate-section/article/S6395-5", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 2013\n\n  Mr. REID.
