Mr. President, tonight Members of both parties will \nwelcome the President to the Capitol as he lays out his plans for the \nyear. We look forward to hearing what he has to say. We also look \nforward to hearing what Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers has to say, too. \nShe is a leader in our party with a compelling story, someone who truly \nunderstands what it means to overcome adversity, someone who is \ndedicated to helping every single American realize her greatest \npotential. The people of Washington's Fifth District are lucky to have \nher, and so are we.\n  As for the President's speech, this is a pivotal moment in the Obama \nPresidency. We are now entering our sixth year with President Obama at \nthe helm of our economy, the sixth year of his economic policies. At \nthis point we have seen just about everything in the President's tool \nbox. We had a years-long clinic on the failures of liberalism: the \ngovernment stimulus, the taxes, the regulations, the centralization, \nand the government control. It just has not worked.\n  So 74 percent of the American people say it still feels as if the \ncountry is in\n\n[[Page S494]]\n\na recession because to them it still feels like it. As the majority \nleader likes to say, the rich have gotten richer and the poor have \ngotten poorer, and ladders into the middle class have been kicked away, \nsawed off, and literally regulated into oblivion.\n  This is the legacy of the Obama economy, as we stand here at the \nstart of 2014. But it does not have to be the legacy President Obama \nleaves behind in January of 2017, and that is why tonight's address is \nso important--because it will give us the clearest indication yet of \nwhether the President is ready to embrace the future or whether he \nwill, once again, take the easy route, the sort of reflexive liberal \nroute, and just pivot back to the failed policies of the past. The \nchoice the President now confronts is a pretty basic one. Does he want \nto be a hero to the left or a champion for the middle class? He can't \nbe both. He has to choose.\n  He could double down on the failed policies that brought us to this \npoint. It would make his base pretty happy, I am sure, but we certainly \nknow where that path leads for the middle class. Folks can try to \npackage it any way they like--say it is a new focus on income \nstagnation that has gotten so much worse under this President's watch. \nBut it is essentially the same path we have been on since he took \noffice. The point is this. Americans do not need a new message; they \nneed a new direction. The problem is not the packaging. It never has \nbeen. It is the policies themselves, and President Obama is the only \nperson who can force that turn in direction. He is the only one who can \nlead it.\n  He could reach to the center tonight and embrace change over the \nbroken status quo, embrace hope over stale ideology--ideology that has \nled not just to stagnant incomes but to lower median incomes, to \ndramatic increases in the number of folks forced to take part-time work \nwhen what they really want is full-time work, to greater long-term \nunemployment, and to more poverty. He could ask Members of both parties \nto help him make 2014 a year of real action rather than just a talking \npoint.\n  If he does, he is going to find he has a lot of support from \nRepublicans because we want to work with him to get things done, and we \nalways have. We will be listening closely to see if he is finally \nprepared to meet us in the political middle so we can finally get some \nimportant work done for the middle class. Let's be honest; there is a \nlot that can be done.\n  For instance, he could call on Senate Democrats to stop blocking all \nthe job-creation bills the House of Representatives has already passed. \nHe could call for revenue-neutral tax reform that would abolish \nloopholes, lower tax rates for everyone, and jump-start job creation \nwhere it counts--in the private sector. He could push his party to join \nRepublicans supporting bipartisan trade promotion legislation, \nsomething the President has said is a priority, and work aggressively \nto clinch the kind of job-creating trade agreements our allies in \nplaces such as Canada and Europe and Australia have already been \nseeking.\n  He could work with us to reduce the debt and deficit to ensure the \nprograms Americans count on will be there when they retire, to make \ngovernment smarter and leaner, and to unshackle the growth potential of \nsmall businesses and entrepreneurs to address the massive \ndissatisfaction out there with the size and the scope of government.\n  If President Obama wants to score an easy win for the middle class, \nhe could simply put the politics aside and approve the Keystone \npipeline. The Keystone pipeline is thousands of American jobs very \nsoon. With regard to the Keystone pipeline, he will not even need to \nuse the phone--just the pen. One stroke and the Keystone pipeline is \napproved.\n  I know the Keystone issue is difficult for him because it involves a \nchoice between pleasing the left and helping the middle class, but that \nis exactly the type of decision he needs to make. He needs to make it \nnow. It is emblematic of the larger choices he will need to make about \nthe direction of our country too, because for all of his talk of going \naround Congress, he would not have to if he actually tried to work with \nthe people's elected representatives every now and then. I am saying \ndon't talk about using the phone, just use the phone and please be \nserious when you call.\n  Take the income inequality issue we hear he will address tonight. Is \nthis going to be all rhetoric or is he actually serious, because he is \ncorrect to point out that the past few years have been very tough on \nthe middle class. As I indicated, median household income has dropped \nby thousands since he took office. Republicans want to work with him on \nthis issue but only if he is serious about it. He could show us he is \nby calling for more choices for underprivileged children trapped in \nfailing schools or he could agree to work with Senator Rand and me to \nimplement Economic Freedom Zones in our poorest communities.\n  Here is something else: He could work with us to relieve the pain \nObamaCare is causing for so many Americans across the country, across \nall income brackets. I asked him last year to prepare Americans for the \nconsequences of this law. He did not do it. Today those consequences \nare plain for anyone to see.\n  Just last night I hosted a tele-townhall meeting where Kentuckians \nshared their stories about the stress that ObamaCare is causing them \nand their families: restricted access to doctors and hospitals, lost \njobs, lower wages, fewer choices, and higher costs. I assure you these \nfolks will not be applauding when the President is trying to spin this \nlaw as a success tonight. More than a quarter million Kentuckians lost \nthe plans that they had and presumably wanted to keep, despite the \nPresident's promises to the contrary. This is a law that caused \npremiums to increase an average of 47 percent in Kentucky and in some \ncases more than 100 percent. This is a law that in some parts of my \nState is limiting choices to health care coverage to just two companies \nin the individual exchange market.\n  At what cost to the taxpayer for all of this? It is $253 million. \nThat is how much Washington has spent so far for these results in my \nState--a quarter of a billion dollars to essentially limit care, cancel \nplans, and increase costs.\n  Kentucky has gotten more money to set up its exchange than every \nState except for California, New York, Oregon, and Washington--that is \na lot of money--and they still only enrolled 30 percent of the people \nthey were supposed to at this point. How in the world could that be \nconsidered a success?\n  So President Obama and Governor Beshear can keep telling Americans to \n``get over it'' if they don't like this law, but sooner or later they \nare going to have to come to terms with reality. They are going to have \nto accept that ObamaCare hasn't worked as the administration promised \nin Kentucky and across America, and it is time to start over with real \nreform.\n  That is why tonight I hope the President will make change. I hope he \nwill announce his willingness to work with both parties to start over \nwith real bipartisan reform that can actually lower costs and improve \nquality of care. That is the kind of reform Kentuckians and Americans \nwant, and that is the way President Obama can show he is serious about \nhaving a year of action. This time next year we will be able to judge \nif he was serious.\n  If the President is still talking about unemployment benefits next \nJanuary rather than how to manage new growth, if he is still forced to \naddress the pain of ObamaCare rather than touting the benefits of \nbipartisan health care reform, if we are trapped in these endless cul \nde sacs of Keystone and trade and tax reform, then we will know what \nchoice the President made. We will know the special interests won and \nthe middle class lost.\n  I hope we won't get there. I hope he will reach out tonight. I hope \nhe will be serious. I hope he will help us chart a new path for the \nAmerican people both parties can support. That may sound like a fantasy \nto some on the hard left who think tonight is all about them, but the \nfact is there have always been good ideas the two parties can agree on \nin Washington--ideas that would make life easier, not harder, for \nworking Americans. Until now the President has mostly chosen to ignore \nthem. Here is hoping for something different tonight.\n\n[[Page S495]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/28/senate-section/article/S495-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DIANE SKVARLA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to say a fond farewell to the \nSenate's long-term curator Diane Skvarla, who has been such a \ntremendous asset to the institution over the years and a very good \nfriend to our office as well. All of our dealings with Diane over the \nyears have been marked by her great professionalism and her deep \nknowledge of and respect for the Senate and its history.\n  Diane and her staff have been invaluable in the multiyear restoration \nof the Strom Thurmond room and keeping up the rest of our historic \nsuite. My staff has always enjoyed working with Diane and her staff, \nand I hope we have been as gracious in return.\n  For a lot of young people who wring their hands or wander around for \na while after college, Diane started working full time in the Senate \nthe Monday after she graduated and has been here off and on ever since.\n  She witnessed a lot of changes in the curator's office over the \nyears. When Diane started here full time in 1979, there were only three \nstaffers in the office, but in the years leading up to and after the \nNation's bicentennial when preservation came back into vogue, there was \nno shortage of new work.\n  Diane went on to earn a master's degree in museum studies from George \nWashington University in 1987, and it paid off when she helped put \ntogether a major exhibit for the Senate's own bicentennial in 1989. \nDiane collaborated on the exhibit with Don Ritchie, and together they \nset a new high standard for projects of this kind. At the time Diane \nwas the associate curator and Don was the associate historian. They \nboth rose through the ranks of their respective offices, so it has been \na fruitful collaboration for many years.\n  Diane spent most of her early childhood in England where she first \nlearned the sport of dressage. She gave up horses during college at \nColgate University in upstate New York and went back to England in 1991 \nto become certified in teaching the sport. She kept up her riding after \nshe returned to the States and came back to the Senate as head curator \nin late 1994, replacing the widely admired Jim Ketchum.\n  With Jim's support and encouragement, Diane learned the ropes and has \ndoggedly pursued the legislative mandate of the Senate curator's office \never since, and that mandate is to protect, preserve, and educate.\n  Some of the biggest challenges Diane has faced have involved dealing \nwith disasters. In 1983, a bomb planted near the Senate Chamber \ndestroyed portions of the corridor--including a portrait of Daniel \nWebster. Under Diane's supervision, a conservator put the pieces back \ntogether and restored it.\n  Other projects Diane has been particularly proud of over the years \ninclude the publication of the U.S. Senate Catalogue of Fine Art, a \n481-page book that took years to complete, and the restoration of a \ngiant portrait of Henry Clay, from my State, that was given to the \nSenate after being discovered in the basement of a historical society. \nThis magnificent painting of Clay now hangs in the stairway off the \nBrumidi corridor. The restoration of the Old Senate Chamber was also a \nproud achievement.\n  The entire Senate family is grateful to Diane for her many years of \ndevoted service to this institution. Through her work, she has helped \npreserve and bring to life the shared objects of our collective history \nas a people--precious objects that belong to all Americans and to our \nposterity. Her legacy is literally all around us.\n  We thank her for her work and wish her and her husband Chris all the \nvery best in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/28/senate-section/article/S495-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1926, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 294, \n     S. 1926, a bill to delay the implementation of certain \n     provisions of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act \n     of 2012 and to reform the National Association of Registered \n     Agents and Brokers, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to speak for up to 10 minutes. I \nthink we are in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is moving to proceed to consider S. \n1926.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Wonderful. I thank the Presiding Officer. I will then \nspeak on the bill that is before us.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of so many Members who voted last night \nto move forward on the debate of the fix to Biggert-Waters. We had a \nvery strong and very impressive vote. I think 83 Members, Republicans \nand Democrats, came together from all parts of the country, from all \ndifferent areas and districts and backgrounds to vote to move forward \non the debate on flood insurance. I am grateful.\n  We have been working on this for about a year and a half. It has been \na tough slog because 2 years ago a bill called Biggert-Waters was \npassed, named after the two cosponsors in the House, Congresswoman \nBiggert and Congresswoman Waters. They passed a bill with very good \nintentions. They were thinking they were going to strengthen the flood \ninsurance program. The bill had wonderful intentions, but \nunfortunately, the way it was drafted in the conference committee has \nresulted in disastrous results.\n  Some of us knew that 2 years ago and started working literally the \nmoment the conference bill was passed to begin changing it. So we have \nworked diligently and together and built a great coalition. I thank the \n200 organizations that quickly came together over the last year and a \nhalf--as quickly as any of these things can happen in a practical \nsense--to understand what went wrong in the first bill and how we could \nfix it so we could accomplish two important goals for the National \nFlood Insurance Program: first, that the program could be self-\nsustaining. In other words, it could pay for itself with limited or \nminimal taxpayer burden.\n  The other equally important goal--and the Presiding Officer, who \nrepresents New Jersey, knows, as I do, how important this is--is that \nthe program would be affordable to middle-class families. If it is not \naffordable to middle-class families, they will not participate in it \nand the program will go bankrupt due to lack of participation.\n  The idea of insurance is to have a large pool to spread the risk, and \nthat is how an insurance system works. If we don't fix it, it is going \nto make that pool get smaller and smaller and smaller. Because people \nwill not be able to afford it, the program will collapse and the \ntaxpayers will be saddled with debt.\n  The goal of our coalition--led by Senator Menendez, the senior \nSenator from New Jersey who is on the Banking Committee and has been \none of the great spokesmen and leaders for this bill, and Senator \nIsakson from Georgia, who is literally the most respected Member in \nthis whole body on issues related to real estate because he had one of \nthe largest real estate companies in Atlanta and knows the issue well. \nHe is very respected on both sides of the aisle. These two gentlemen \nhave led this effort and have built a bipartisan coalition.\n  So we are now ready this week, of all weeks. It is the State of the \nUnion week. We would have probably preferred another week, but that is \nhow this worked out. We are ready to debate the bill on the floor of \nthe Senate. At last count, when we left, there were about six or seven \nrelevant amendments. We are only going to accept relevant amendments to \nthis bill. We are not going to accept amendments on other subjects by \nMembers who are attempting to derail the Senate, get us off topic, et \ncetera, et cetera. We will only accept relevant amendments to this \nbill.\n  The happy thing is we think we only have about seven or eight \namendments. Some amendments are Republican, some amendments are \nDemocratic.\n  We just received an amendment from one of the opponents of our bill, \nthe good Senator from Pennsylvania, who has not been supportive of our \nbill and\n\n[[Page S496]]\n\nhas not worked with the coalition and has not cooperated in any way. We \ngot his amendment an hour ago. We have been actually waiting for a year \nand a half.\n  Last May he opposed the bill, and we couldn't even get to the debate \nbecause he wasn't happy with the direction we were going. So that \nhappened in May. What is this month? It is January. We are now in the \nmonth of January, and he opposed the bill in May. It set us back 7 \nmonths. We tried to explain to the Senator from Pennsylvania that \n74,000 people in his State have these policies and they too need help. \nWhether he has been able to reconcile that with his constituents I \ndon't know, but we literally asked him to please let us know what we \ncould do. We told him we would be happy to meet with him. The \nhomebuilders and the realtors were willing to sit down and speak to \nhim. We finally got a draft of his amendment in the last hour. We are \nliterally reading it for the first time. I don't think that is \ncooperation, but he may have a different definition of it. We are \nreading that amendment now. I don't believe this amendment is going to \nhelp our cause. I think it is going to undermine what we are trying to \ndo.\n  I will have more comments about the specifics of it, but the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, for whatever reason, has not been cooperative the \nwhole time. We will be happy to vote on his amendment. I think the \namendment is going to do great harm to the bill, and I think I would \nurge our coalition at this point to vote no, but I am going to look at \nit.\n  Senator Isakson has just received a copy of it in the last hour, and \nall I can do is ask our colleagues to be patient while we review his \n13-page amendment. We have 200 organizations that have been working on \nthis. We are trying to be fair and get their input, and then we will \nknow how to proceed.\n\n  The bottom line is this: This week we are going to pass a flood \ninsurance relief bill off the floor of the Senate. I wish to put \neverybody on notice that we have run out of patience. We have been \nworking on this for a year and a half. We were told before Christmas we \ncould have a vote, and then we were told we could have a vote when we \ngot back. Then we were told we could have a vote before we left.\n  This is it. There is no more time. We are voting on this legislation \nthis week. We are either going to do it the easy way or the hard way. \nWe are either going to have a few amendments the Republicans put up, \nthe Democrats put up, and we get back to legislating as we should or \nthe leader is going to file cloture on this bill and we are going to \npass it without an amendment. If one single Republican comes to this \nfloor and says they did not have time to discuss their amendment, we \nwill debate until the cows come home because I am not leaving this \nfloor until every single person in America knows the games that can be \nplayed here.\n  I have been more than transparent. I have been more than honest. I \nhave come here more than any Senator. I don't know if this is good or \nbad; it is the only way I know how to lead, which is to be forthright \nand honest with myself, with my constituents, and with people who need \nto know what in the heck is going on. I don't know how else to do it. I \nam not going to apologize. I am not going to read about how to do this \nin a book. There are no books on this. This is about leadership from \nthe inside, and the only people who taught me this were my parents.\n  I am just saying, if anyone in this Chamber thinks they are going to \nget away with trying to give some flimsy-limsy excuse about how they \ndidn't get their amendment considered, how they are upset with the \nleader, they will have to go through me, and I am not moving because I \nhave people all over this country who are desperate. We passed the \nwrong bill. We should not have passed it. We must fix it, and we are \ngoing to fix it this week in the Senate.\n  What the House does, what Speaker Boehner does--he made some negative \ncomments about the bill last week. My comments back were the Speaker \nhas his hands full. He has been busy. I understand it. I wouldn't want \nhis job. He has a tough job with a lot of issues to juggle. But I said, \nand I will say again, when this bill goes to the House, which it will \nafter it passes the Senate this week, he will hear from millions and \nmillions of Americans who paid their mortgage every month, who went to \nwork every day, who honor their family by building homes in places they \nhave been for generations, and they are about ready to take those \nfront-door keys and turn them in to the local bank and walk away from \ntheir house. Speaker Boehner is going to hear that. I hope those words, \nthose expressions, those pictures, those letters will hit his heart the \nway they have hit mine and that he will have a softened heart and an \nopen mind and he will consider what we are trying to do.\n  I realize our way may not be the most perfect way, but it is a good \nway, and if somebody wants to improve it, fine. But don't scuttle it, \npretending to be helping. Don't scuttle it by pretending to be for some \nkind of better approach. If there was a better approach, we would have \nfound it in the last year and a half we have been searching. We are not \ngoing to find it in the last 3 minutes of this debate.\n  We are reviewing the Toomey amendment. He has been the lead opponent \nof our effort. I don't believe his amendment is helpful, but until I \nread it, I will not be able to give a definitive assessment. Senator \nIsakson will have to give his views on it, as will Senator Menendez, \nand we will figure it out. But we are going to bring relief to the 5 \nmillion people who have done nothing wrong--middle-class families, some \nof them very poor families--who have been living in these places for \ngenerations, and because FEMA can't get its flood maps right, because \nFEMA can't get the affordability study done, they are going to be \nkicked out of their homes.\n  Talk about misguided regulation. I hope Mitch McConnell, our \nRepublican leader, talking about misguided regulation, will put a \nlittle muscle into helping us. He has been cooperative, and I thank \nhim. Senator Reid has been putting a lot of muscle into this, and I \nthank him.\n  I hope people will come to the floor and speak about the importance \nof this bill. We will figure out this amendment process--all germane \namendments--and get the final vote this week. This is going to get done \nthis week, the easy way or the hard way, and we are done. The vote is \ngoing to happen this week. We are going to move this bill from the \nfloor to the President, who put out a statement--and his \nadministration--they didn't have many positive things to say about \nthis. Let me just say I think their statement is misinformed. It is \nmisguided. I am hoping the White House will reconsider. The President \nis coming here tonight to speak about the importance of strengthening \nthe middle class. I would think that allowing middle-class people to \nstay in their homes would be a good place to start. So I hope the \nadministration will take a second look and join us and help us to let \nmiddle-class families stay in their homes.\n  Let me conclude. Colorado is a beautiful State. I have been there \nmany times. However, not everybody can live in the mountains of \nColorado. There are some of us who have to live along rivers and \nstreams and ports to build and to support the infrastructure that helps \nto make this country grow. My people who fish every day, who harvest \nthe oysters, who put seafood on the table, who bring those huge and \nmagnificent barges up and down the river, can't live in Vail, CO. I am \nsorry. They don't like the snow and they couldn't afford to live there \nanyway. They live in little places such as Burris and Venice and \nPlackman, and the lower ninth ward that got flooded out, every single \nhome destroyed. They can go back if we use our science, our \nengineering, our brains, and lead with our hearts and our heads. This \ncan work. But if people are playing political games, if they are trying \nto score political points or if they are not working hard enough to \nunderstand the issue, then I feel sorry for them because the public \nneeds our help.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk about \nthe\n\n[[Page S497]]\n\nHomeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act. This bill is a bill that \nis designed to fix the damage that has been done by the Biggert-Waters \nAct, and this damage is extensive. This bill would freeze dramatic rate \nhikes, and these rate hikes have several impacts.\n  We have, of course, the impact on families who currently have flood \ninsurance who will be paying much higher levels than they bargained for \nwhen they bought their home and may not be able to afford those much \nhigher levels, raising questions about their ability to stay in those \nhomes.\n  We have the impact on commercial enterprises and the fact that now \nthat they are paying higher rates, they may not feel they can add on to \ntheir business in that location.\n  Then we have the impact, of course, on selling your property, whether \nyou are a homeowner or you are a business, because the folks who might \nbe buying might have to jump to a full rate that would be many times--\nin some cases 10 times--the price the current owner is paying, and when \nthat happens the property becomes unaffordable and, therefore, the \nvalue that one has in their home or business drops dramatically.\n  All of this is of great concern, and we need to reverse the features \nof Biggert-Waters that are causing this economic havoc.\n  This bill comes out of discussions that were in my Subcommittee on \nEconomic Policy several months ago. This discussion is now led by \nSenator Menendez, and he has been ably assisted and partnered with \nSenator Mary Landrieu and Senator Isakson and Senator Vitter and I \ncompliment them all for being vocal advocates and instrumental in \nhelping to move this bill forward.\n  The Biggert-Waters Act, while well intentioned, is creating massive \nburdens for our middle-class homeowners in Oregon and certainly across \nthe Nation. Flooding is something of an equal opportunity disaster. For \nsome, it is the coastlines. For others, it is broad flood plains along \nmajor rivers. For others, it is narrow valleys and flash floods. But in \nall of these situations, the common impact is dramatic devastation.\n  Something is very wrong though when families are more worried about \ndramatic spikes in their flood insurance premiums than they are worried \nabout dramatic floods, and that is where my Oregon families are right \nnow. I wish to share a letter from Kelly. She lives in Tigard. She \nsays, in her own words, she is ``a middle class, single mother \ncurrently working to get [her] daughter through college.''\n  She bought her home 13 years ago to provide stability for her \ndaughter. This is a goal of so many parents, to have a piece of the \nAmerican dream, to have the stability that goes with home ownership, to \nhave the equity that you build in your home as a financial reservoir \nwith which to assist your children going forward in life.\n  She thought about selling a few years ago but decided to stay in that \nhouse and keep that financial foundation. But now, with Biggert-Waters \ngoing into effect, she has been caught between two bad choices. If she \nstays in her home, her flood insurance rates will go up precipitously, \nmaking her home increasingly unaffordable and squeezing an already \ntight budget. But should she try to sell, the new owner will face \nannual flood insurance premiums of $15,000 or more, making her home \ncompletely unaffordable for middle-class buyers.\n  Keep this in mind: For every $1,000 a buyer pays in flood insurance \nper year, the value of a home drops by about $20,000. So if the flood \ninsurance is $15,000, we are talking about a value of a home dropping \n$300,000. Many middle-class homes in Oregon are not priced at $300,000. \nThey might be valued at $200,000 or $220,000 or $250,000 or, in more \nrural areas, $150,000 or $175,000. So we can wipe out the complete \nvalue of a home and certainly easily wipe out the equity a homeowner \nhas built over a number of years. Essentially, you have to give the \nhome away. That makes no sense.\n  To read from Kelly's letter, she says:\n\n       Here is where I see a problem. There is an old saying, \n     ``you can't get blood from a stone.''\n\n  She continues:\n\n       I know I am not alone in my predicament of barely getting \n     by financially.\n       Middle income folks like me are squeezed from all sides. . \n     . .\n       While living expenses rise every year, our income generally \n     does not raise enough to make up for it. . . .\n       We tighten our belts and wait for better times. So, the \n     problem here is, we can't afford to pay these, much higher \n     rates. We just don't have the money.\n\n  She continues in her analysis:\n\n       There are options, of course. We can come up with many 10's \n     of thousands of dollars to raise our houses up and make them \n     flood friendly. . . .\n       But wait--we don't have 10's of thousands of dollars. And, \n     we can't sell--that's the beauty here. Who will buy a small, \n     middle income type home that has a flood insurance bill \n     annually of 15-30k [a year]?\n\n  She continues:\n\n       So what will we do, the over 1 million homeowners in this \n     situation? To our utter frustration and humiliation, many of \n     us have no choice but to walk away. . . .\n       Whatever the attitudes about us are, most of us are good \n     Americans who believe in paying our debts. We have worked \n     hard our entire lives, and asked for little or no help along \n     the way.\n       This will crush us, and since we don't have the money to \n     give, there is no benefit to be had.\n\n  That is how she concludes her letter: ``This will crush us. . . . '' \nShe is right. It will crush her family. It will crush millions of \nfamilies across this country. It will include foreclosures. It will \ninclude equity wiped out. It will result in families having to walk \naway from their home and hope they are not pursued by their mortgage \ncompany that will be unable to sell the home on a secondary market for \nthe debt owed and, therefore, could pursue the owners.\n  It is wrong and counterproductive to squeeze middle-class homeowners \nsuch as Kelly when it will only result in more foreclosures or families \ntrapped in their homes unable to sell them.\n  Making flood insurance more solvent is a laudable goal, but it is one \nwe have to approach in a manner that involves fairness over time. \nAchieving solvency by putting a huge burden, a huge financial shock on \nthe backs of our middle-class families is not just wrong, it is a \nfinancial disaster that is unfolding now and will continue to unfold \nacross this country.\n  We cannot get to solvency by asking families to pay sums they simply \ndo not have or, as Kelly said, ``You can't get blood from a stone.''\n  We need to immediately stop these dramatic rate hikes for our \nhomeowners and our businesses while FEMA goes back to the drawing board \nto figure out how to make this program affordable and effective for our \nmiddle-class families.\n  That is exactly what this bill does. This bill has several important \nprovisions that help ensure affordability and fairness for our middle-\nclass families.\n  The first is it delays implementation of flood insurance rate \nincreases. It does so on primary residences and on businesses until \nFEMA can complete an affordability study, propose regulations to \naddress the problem of affordability, and give Congress time to weigh \nin.\n  Second, unlike Biggert-Waters, the bill ensures that FEMA will truly \nhave the funding they need to complete a comprehensive affordability \nstudy.\n  Third, this bill takes on a catch-22 in the current system, which is \nthat when homeowners face unaffordable rates that they think are \ninaccurate, they have to pay out of their pocket for a flood map appeal \nto prove that their premiums should be lowered. So when someone else \nmakes a mistake, they have to pay for that mistake, and that is wrong.\n  The studies necessary for an appeal can cost between $500 and $2,000. \nIt is a prohibitive cost for many families to undertake. This bill \nensures that any homeowner who can successfully appeal a flood map \nfinding will be reimbursed by FEMA for their expense, making the system \nfairer for the homeowner and giving FEMA an added incentive to get it \nright.\n  Finally, this bill does something very important in creating a flood \ninsurance rate map advocate within FEMA, someone to educate and \nadvocate for homeowners. One of the complaints my office has heard is \nthat FEMA has not been responsive to homeowners' concerns or questions \nabout changes in their policy.\n  It creates this position. An advocate will do several things. The \nadvocate will educate policyholders about their flood risks and their \noptions in choosing a policy. The advocate will assist\n\n[[Page S498]]\n\nthose who believe a flood map is wrong and assist them through the \nappeal process. The advocate will improve outreach and coordination \nwith local officials, community leaders, and Congress.\n  My colleagues Senators Hoeven and Heitkamp have also done great work \non this bill to ensure that homeowners in certain communities are not \nhit by unfair rules on how their basements impact a flood policy.\n  I would like to address one other issue that is not in this bill that \nhopefully I will be able to offer an amendment on; that is, protection \nfor consumers whose policies are purchased by their mortgage servicer \nor their bank rather than by themselves. This is the issue of predatory \nforce-placed premiums.\n  Let me explain. Let's say, for example, that you are notified by your \nservicer that they have reviewed the records and they now consider you \nto be in a flood plain they had not noticed before and you have to get \nflood insurance. But that flood insurance, unsubsidized, is so \nexpensive you cannot afford it. So then the servicer says: Well, we are \ngoing to put on flood insurance for you. The rate might be 5 to 10 \ntimes the market rate. In other words, the homeowner who already cannot \nafford flood insurance is gouged by predatory premiums on force-placed \ninsurance.\n  Let's consider that perhaps you had a transition in your family. \nMaybe you have one partner paying the bills and another partner takes \nit over while the first partner is sick and you miss the fact that your \nannual premium was due on your flood insurance. So what happens? That \nlapse can trigger much higher rates that you cannot afford. Then \nsuddenly you are in the situation of force-placed insurance.\n  How about if new maps are issued. The new maps now put you into a \n100-year flood plain that you were not in previously. It is not that \nthe geography changed; it is that a different set of engineers, doing a \ndifferent study, different assumptions about where the rain will fail, \nwhich creek will swell the quickest, puts you into this 100-year flood \nplain.\n  So now what are you going to do? You are going to be in this \nsituation. You cannot afford that insurance, that newly placed \nrequirement for insurance, so the servicer or bank puts it on for you. \nWell, they should put it in at a fair market rate, not at a rate which \nis 5 to 10 times the fair market rate and which is designed to gouge.\n  I have an amendment that addresses this by saying the servicers or \nbanks cannot take fees--or, as some would say, ``kickbacks''--for \nplacing this insurance and therefore have an incentive to do a \nnonmarket rate policy that is 5 or 10 times higher than the actual \nmarket rate.\n  This is a significant problem in force-placed home insurance. \nCertainly, we do not need to add to this problem by allowing predatory \npremiums on force-placed policies in the realm of flood insurance. I \nencourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a look at \nthis issue, to support banning the anticompetitive features of the \nmarket that have led to these predatory premiums on force-placed flood \ninsurance.\n  In closing, I again thank my colleagues who have worked so hard. This \nis an important issue, an incredibly important issue for families \nacross Oregon. Let's stop these dramatic rate hikes. Let's work \ntogether for an affordable flood insurance program that will be \neffective and fair for all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Income Inequality\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the letters I will be \nspeaking about be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  Recently the Obama administration has been talking a lot about income \ninequality and poverty. Yesterday I spoke about the issue, about the \nwar on poverty, its successes and its failures. As I said yesterday, \nthe United States has spent trillions of dollars in the last 50 years \nfighting the so-called war on poverty. I said yesterday that the \nresults have been marginal, in some cases successful, reducing the \npoverty rate from 19 percent down to the 15 percent it is now. But a \nlot more needs to be done.\n  Now, in the fight against the war on poverty, this administration, \nlike a lot of administrations, wants to spend more money on more \nprograms. Some of that may be justified, but that does not seem to fix \nthe problems. If you just hand this money out with no strings and no \noversight, it gets diverted and misused. That is the purpose of my \nspeaking today on the subject of public housing.\n  Wasted money does not help the poor. There are a lot of people who \nmake a nice profit from the poverty of others. This administration has \nbeen helping a number of these profiteers while the poor suffer. I want \nto be clear as to some of these issues I am talking about--their \ngenesis goes back to previous administrations as well. Through my \noversight work, I have seen this happen over and over, that a few \npeople profit from trying to help the poor, but the money does not go \nthere. The Department of Housing and Urban Development hands out $4 \nbillion in Federal money every year to local housing authorities. This \nmoney is supposed to help provide clean, affordable, safe housing for \nthe poor. But, while no one is watching, much of the money gets spent \non high salaries and perks for the people who run the housing \nauthorities. These housing authorities have other sources of money. For \nmost of them, up to 90 percent of their total funding comes from the $4 \nbillion contributed by the Federal taxpayers.\n  Housing and Urban Development argues that because housing authorities \nare State and local government entities, there is no reason to \nscrutinize them from here in Washington, DC. As far as I am concerned, \nHUD is missing the point for 4 billion reasons. Those are dollar \nreasons. Taxpayer money should come with Federal oversight. We need to \nmake sure that the Federal authorities who disburse it make sure they \noversee that it is spent in the legal way--to help the people who need \nthe help.\n\n  I have been conducting oversight of the wasteful spending at housing \nauthorities for almost 4 years. I have been urging the Obama \nadministration to look at what is happening and to take action. But \nthere is little if any interest in the oversight of these Federal \ndollars by the folks writing the checks here in Washington, DC. They \njust want to send the checks and pat themselves on the back. They do \nnot want to talk about what actually happens to the money once it is \ndisbursed.\n  Federal funds end up feathering the nests of local housing \nbureaucrats instead of housing the poor. I will show you how that is \ndone. Here are some of the most egregious examples of how ineffective \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development has been at policing \nlocal housing authorities.\n  Bradenton, FL, is an area of the country which was hit extremely hard \nduring the foreclosure crisis, but employees at Bradenton Housing \nAuthority only have to work 4 days a week. They get 2 weeks off at \nChristmas, bonuses in June and December, and the option to cash out up \nto a month of sick leave twice per year. They get free use of a car \npurchased by the housing authority. After 15 years of employment, they \nget to keep the car when they leave or take $10,000 instead; it is \ntheir choice.\n  There are generous fringe benefits, but many housing authorities also \nprovide very lucrative salaries. These salaries far exceed the salaries \nof Federal employees right here in Washington, DC, who hand out the \ntaxpayers' money to the housing authorities. The biggest salary jackpot \nwinner I have encountered so far is the Atlanta Housing Authority. At \nleast 22 employees there earn between $150,000 and $303,000 per year. \nThe Atlanta Housing Authority benefits from a special HUD designation \ncalled ``moving to work.'' That program exempts designated housing \nauthorities from certain requirements, including salary justification. \nThis is not just an isolated example. The executive director of the \nRaleigh, NC, housing authority receives about $280,000 in salary and \nbenefits, plus up to 30 vacation days. He also accumulates comp time \nfor any hours he works over 7\\1/2\\ hours per day. He has used over 20 \ndays of comp time per year since 2009. Add that to his regular vacation \ntime, and he is out of the office\n\n[[Page S499]]\n\nnearly 3 months per year. Nine months of work for $280,000 is an \nannualized salary of $375,000 per year. Very few taxpayer-funded jobs \npay anything close to that amount.\n  So what is the justification for such high salaries, particularly \nconsidering the fact that they are supposed to provide safe, affordable \nhousing for low-income people? After years of ignoring the issue, HUD \nfinally capped Federal funding for executive salaries at $155,500 per \nemployee. Of course, this was only after various local media and I \nexposed deep-rooted problems and pushed the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development to act. But now housing authority executives have \nturned to creative accounting tricks to get around that limit of \n$155,500 per employee. Since some of their money comes from other \nsources, the housing authorities simply claim that any salary over the \nFederal limit comes from one of those other sources, whereas the money \nfrom those other sources ought to be used to help low-income people \nhave affordable, clean, and safe housing.\n  Because of my oversight letters on this subject, HUD recently \nnotified the housing authorities that they must document the original \nsource of the funding used to pay salaries over the Federal limit. That \nis good news, but there are still larger problems. The Department is \nstill not making this salary data public in a reasonable timeframe. I \nwill give an example. This administration refused to release the 2010 \nset of data for almost a year. I hope we do not have to wait a year to \nget the most recent data.\n  Like many of our Federal agencies, some housing authorities spend \nlarge amounts of money on travel for conferences and training. Some of \nthat may be legitimate, but I am raising questions about the extent to \nwhich it is done and the amount of money that is consumed. Staff and \nboard members often attend the same conferences throughout the United \nStates year after year. They often attend multiple conferences in a \nsingle year. In addition to travel costs, housing authorities must pay \na conference fee for each attendee they send, often ranging from $400 \nat the low end to $1,000 per employee at the higher end.\n  That money could easily be used to improve conditions and make needed \nrepairs in public housing facilities. Instead, it is frittered away on \nconferences. In other words, forget the low-income people they are \nsupposed to be helping and spend the money someplace else.\n  The Tampa Housing Authority has spent more than $860,000 since 2009 \nfor staff and board members to attend various conferences, seminars, \nand training programs--$860,000 that could have been used to provide \naffordable housing for low-income people. Tampa also has been sending \n20 or more employees per year to conferences sponsored by the National \nAssociation of Housing and Redevelopment Officials. That alone costs \nmore than $177,000 per year.\n  The Atlanta Housing Authority spent more than $480,000 since 2009 for \nthe employees to attend conferences and training sessions. In fact, the \nhousing authority paid over $68,000 in conference fees to a software \ncompany after giving them a multimillion-dollar contract for a new \ncomputer system.\n  I wonder--I don't know, but I think it is legitimate to question--if \nthe housing authority executive director thought to ask for a discount. \nMany of the housing authorities with questionable spending don't limit \nthe abuses to salaries or travel.\n  The Tampa Housing Authority purchased a new $7 million administrative \noffice that includes nearly $3 million in renovations and upgrades. \nThat could have helped hundreds, if not thousands, of poor people \nneeding the housing. They are also paying nearly $800,000 in salary and \nbenefits for a public relations department while at the same time \npaying an employee another $170,369 as a PR consultant.\n  Other housing authorities are also spending exorbitant amounts for \noutside consultants. Some of these consultants are former employees of \nthe local housing authority.\n  In 2013, the Pittsburgh Housing Authority retained 10 law firms for a \ntotal of $3.5 million over 3 years. One law firm has been representing \nthe housing authority during inquiries by the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development Office of Inspector General and the city controller.\n  Think about that. It is bad enough that taxpayers' money meant to \nhelp the poor is wasted, but when the taxpayer also pays the lawyers to \ndefend the very organization from scrutiny about whether the taxpayers' \nmoney was wasted is even more outrageous. Of course, that adds insult \nto injury.\n  In Philadelphia, outside lawyers blocked the inspector general's \noffice from assessing spending data for months, and that cost the \ntaxpayers millions of dollars.\n  The Pittsburgh Housing Authority also paid an outside consulting firm \n$1.25 million in the year 2012. The vice president at the consulting \ncompany billed the housing authority $404,000 for 2,400 hours of work. \nThat is 48 hours a week for a year. It is more than double the $168,000 \nsalary of the housing authority executive director.\n  Harris County, TX, is one of the most egregious examples of out-of-\ncontrol spending. In 2013, the HUD inspector general questioned the \nmismanagement of over $27 million in Federal funding for Harris County. \nThe IG provided the following examples of fraud and abuse: over $1.7 \nmillion in excessive payroll expenses; $190,000 for statues and \nmonuments; $66,000 for employees' shirts embossed with logos; $27,000 \nfor trophies, plaques, and awards; $14,500 for a helicopter, a \nchartered bus, and golf cart rentals for a grand opening; and $18,000 \nfor letters written by Abraham Lincoln.\n  I continue to send my oversight letters to the Senate appropriators \nand the Senate banking committee. These are the letters I received \npermission to put in the Record at the end of my statement.\n  The Senate appropriators and the Senate banking committee members \nhave jurisdiction over the Department of Housing and Urban Development. \nThey have the authority to do something about these abuses. My \ncolleagues need to know the extent of the problems, and that I am ready \nto work with the Members of this body to address these issues.\n  Employment at public housing authorities should be about public \nservice. That is why we have a program serving the needs of low-income \npeople. It is supposed to be providing clean, safe, affordable housing \nfor those in need, not helping bureaucrats live high on the hog on the \ntaxpayers' dime.\n  As I said in my opening, this problem didn't start with this \nadministration. There is a culture here that had to start back a long \ntime ago. But now, bringing these problems to the attention of this \nadministration, I hope it will take them seriously. If this \nadministration is truly serious about income inequality--and not only \nusing it for political purposes--it would stop shoveling taxpayers' \nmoney out the door with practically no oversight, no controls, no \nlimits, and the waste of money I have just expressed. If President \nObama is truly serious about income inequality, he would take the money \nhigh-income public housing authorities waste and give it to the benefit \nof low-income patrons of public housing to provide what the law is \nmeant to provide these people: safe, affordable, healthy housing.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 2013.\n     Hon. Shaun Donovan,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Donovan: The Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development (HUD) awarded high performer status to the Harris \n     County Housing Authority (HCHA) ``for eight consecutive \n     years'' between 2004 and 2011. In the 2009 Consolidated On-\n     Site Review, the HUD field office director, Dan Rodriguez, \n     even stated that, HCHA ``practices are some of the best \n     throughout our region.'' Following revelations of possible \n     mismanagement in 2012, Mr. Rodriguez then told the Houston \n     Chronicle, ``We didn't expect that anything was actually \n     going on here of concern.'' He further stated, ``We in the \n     field office here have always had the privilege of having one \n     of the highest-performing housing authorities in the \n     country.''\n       On June 19, 2013, the HUD Office of Inspector General (OIG) \n     released an audit report raising concerns about HCHA \n     mismanagement of over $27 million in federal funding. In \n     addition to over $7 million spent on an unauthorized disaster \n     assessment and over $8 million for the now-defunct Patriots \n     on the Lake development, the OIG provided numerous examples \n     of fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars. These include:\n\n[[Page S500]]\n\n       Over $1.7 million in excessive payroll expenses;\n       $190,000 for statues and monuments;\n       $66,000 for employee shirts embossed with HCHA logos;\n       $54,000 for apartment rental for housing consultants;\n       $24,000 for a book writing project about disaster housing;\n       $27,000 for trophies, plaques and awards;\n       $14,500 for helicopter, chartered bus and golf cart rentals \n     for a grand opening;\n       $18,000 for letters written by Abraham Lincoln; and\n       Over $150,000 in missing electronic equipment including \n     computers and electronic tablets.\n       The OIG found that both HCHA management and the Board \n     failed to fulfill their oversight responsibilities. \n     Specifically, ``the Authority expended funds for many items \n     that were not reasonable or necessary and did not support the \n     Authority's mission.'' Moreover, ``they neglected their \n     management and oversight responsibilities; wasted Authority \n     funds, at times for personal gain; circumvented existing \n     internal controls; and manipulated accounting records. These \n     conditions occurred because the Authority's management and \n     Board failed to exercise their fiduciary responsibilities and \n     did not act in the best interest of the Authority.''\n       HUD also failed to ensure that millions in Disaster Housing \n     Assistance Program (DHAP) funding, awarded following \n     Hurricane Ike, were used properly or as intended. Instead, \n     HCHA awarded a lucrative consulting contract to the former \n     HCHA Board chairman Odysseus Lanier's firm just two months \n     after he resigned from the Board. The conflict-of-interest \n     waiting period is one year. Mr. Lanier's consulting firm \n     received ``$11.3 million from HCHA, according to agency \n     director Tom McCasland, most of it for work on some sort of \n     multi-state disaster response survey that nobody wanted. \n     Harris County tried to get $7 million in reimbursement for it \n     from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but was denied, \n     according to the audit.'' Additionally, in 2008 the housing \n     authority purchased at least five high-end SUVs which were \n     subsequently donated to the Harris County Office of Emergency \n     Management and earmarked for five specific employees.\n       Purchasing $18,000 historic documents, spending $190,000 on \n     statues and monuments, and paying for chartered helicopter \n     flights is not a hallmark of ``one of the highest performing \n     housing authorities in the country.'' This is money that \n     should have been used to provide clean, safe, and affordable \n     housing for those in need. HUD must take greater steps to \n     safeguard taxpayer dollars, especially during this time of \n     budget cuts due to sequestration. Please provide the \n     following information:\n       1. What steps are being taken by HUD to recoup as much of \n     the $27 million in questionable spending outlined in the OIG \n     audit report?\n       Given the efforts that Mr. Rankin and other officials at \n     HCHA took to hide their questionable spending, have criminal \n     referrals been made to the Department of Justice? If so, for \n     what offenses? Who has been referred?\n       2. I have raised concerns about unreported conflicts-of-\n     interest at HCHA and other housing authorities that have cost \n     taxpayers millions. What steps are being taken by HUD to \n     tighten up conflict-of-interest reporting requirements and \n     increased oversight to reduce the questionable payments in \n     the future?\n       3. It is my understanding that HUD has conducted no \n     oversight of the billions in Disaster Housing Assistance \n     Program (DHAP) funding granted to HCHA and other housing \n     authorities along the Gulf Coast impacted by Hurricanes \n     Katrina, Rita and Ike. Please explain why this has not been \n     done and, given the recent financial problems at HCHA and \n     billions provided for Hurricane Sandy efforts, when we might \n     expect an audit to be conducted?\n       4. It is my understanding that neither the former HCHA \n     executive director, Guy Rankin IV, nor his new company, \n     International Housing Solutions, has been suspended or \n     disbarred from receiving federal funding through HUD. In \n     fact, Mr. Rankin may be trying to obtain or has already \n     received Hurricane Sandy funding even after allegedly wasting \n     millions in Hurricane Ike funding.\n       Please state whether HUD has suspended or disbarred Mr. \n     Rankin and/or International Housing Solutions, as well as \n     other bad housing authority actors, from receiving federal \n     funding.\n       Please also explain what steps HUD is taking to ensure that \n     Hurricane Sandy funding is used as Congress intended and not \n     lost to waste, fraud and abuse.\n       5. What specific changes have been and will be made to the \n     housing authority assessment program that will address the \n     many deficiencies in the current self-assessment program? \n     When will these changes be fully implemented?\n       6. Currently, the housing authorities' financial and \n     management audits are paid for by the housing authorities \n     themselves, which may result in conflicts of interest. What \n     alternatives to auditor contracting awards and payments are \n     being considered by in order to ensure that the auditors are \n     serving the taxpayers instead of housing authority \n     management?\n       Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this \n     matter. I would appreciate receiving your response to this \n     matter by July 31, 2013. Should you have any questions \n     regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact \n     Janet Drew of my staff.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Charles E. Grassley,\n\n                                                   Ranking Member,\n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 20, 2013\n     Hon. Shaun Donovan,\n     Secretary, Department of Housing and Urban Development, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Donovan: I have been raising concerns about \n     questionable spending at public housing authorities (PHA) \n     across the United States. I have questioned excessive travel \n     spending at public housing authorities in the past, but the \n     Tampa Housing Authority (THA), a HUD high performer, appears \n     to have far surpassed those housing authorities in travel and \n     conference spending.\n       Recent investigative reports by Channel 10 News in Tampa \n     found that THA has spent in excess of $860,000 since 2009 for \n     staff and Board members to attend various conferences, \n     seminars and training programs. According to travel documents \n     provided by THA (see attached), staff and board members often \n     attend the same conferences throughout the United States, \n     some for the same organizations year after year, and often \n     attend multiple conferences in a single year. In addition to \n     travel costs, THA pays a conference fee for each attendee, \n     ranging between $400 and $1000. Every dollar that goes to \n     airfare, meals, lodging and conference fees, is another \n     dollar that cannot be used to help house homeless Tampa Bay \n     residents.\n       Additionally, these trips amount to thousands of man hours \n     spent away from the office and not serving the citizens of \n     Tampa. According to the travel documents, THA staff and board \n     members annually spend more than 500 work days outside the \n     office. While THA may argue the necessity for the conference \n     and training attendance, a vast majority of these trips \n     appear to be non-critical to housing authority business and \n     give the impression of being an excuse to take expensive \n     vacations paid for with taxpayer dollars.\n       Like other housing authorities I have been investigating, \n     THA has been spending limited federal funding for other \n     questionable expenses. The executive director, Jerome Ryans, \n     receives an annual salary of $214,000 plus a compensation \n     package which puts him well over the $155,500 salary cap. \n     Additional examples include: a new $7 million administrative \n     office with nearly $3 million in renovations and upgrades, \n     nearly $800,000 on salary and benefits for the public \n     relations department while paying $170,369 for a PR \n     consultant, $2.8 million in outside legal fees since 2009 \n     while one outside lawyer is also married to a housing \n     authority employee.\n       In August, Executive Director Ryans complained that ``the \n     agency will also lose approximately 1 million dollars in \n     administrative fees that cover operational costs due to \n     sequestration.'' He also stated that ``it is our goal to \n     continually find ways or opportunities to reduce overall \n     departmental costs.'' I strongly suggest that Mr. Ryans and \n     HUD start by curtailing attendance at conferences and \n     training seminars, excessive salaries, consulting and legal \n     fees.\n       Please provide the following:\n       1. Please describe the steps being taken by HUD to rein in \n     excessive spending on travel, conferences and training at THA \n     and other housing authorities across the country and explain \n     why those steps have been ineffective in preventing the \n     abuses described above.\n       2. The complete annual compensation packages of all THA \n     employees, including salaries, bonuses and any other \n     compensation (health care, retirement, etc).\n       3. A copy of most recent employment contracts for the \n     executive director and all THA financial statements filed \n     with HUD, including any statements made about executive \n     director salary and all benefits.\n       4. Complete documentation of the remodeling expenditures \n     for the new headquarters building.\n       5. The total number of credit cards issued to THA, \n     including any provided to THA board members.\n       6. All legal bills and professional service and consulting \n     fees paid by the PHAs. Please also document all conflict of \n     interest waivers.\n       7. A list of all take-home vehicles provided by the housing \n     authorities and the names of the employees who drive them.\n       Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this \n     matter. I would appreciate your response by December 6, 2013. \n     Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to \n     contact Janet Drew of my staff.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                    Committe on the Judiciary,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 8, 2014.\n     Hon. Shaun Donovan,\n     Secretary, Department of Housing and Urban Development, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Donovan: The Dayton Daily News recently \n     reported questionable management decisions at the Dayton \n     (Ohio) Housing Authority, renamed Greater Dayton Premier \n     Management (GDPM). I want to ensure that HUD taxpayer dollars \n     are used for safe, affordable housing instead of questionable \n     compensation packages.\n\n[[Page S501]]\n\n       According to the article, the GDPM Board of Commissioners \n     recently fired the interim CEO, Al Prude. Mr. Prude was \n     removed by a Board resolution which stated that the housing \n     authority ``is going to a `new business model' that consists \n     of four agency directors acting as a team that will meet \n     twice a day to run the agency.'' Instead of hiring a new CEO \n     immediately, the housing authority is paying the four \n     department heads each an additional $1,000 per week to cover \n     the CEO duties. At that rate, the housing authority is \n     spending $16,000 per month or $192,000 per year for the \n     department directors to cover the CEO duties, with no time \n     frame for naming a replacement. The former CEO was paid just \n     over $123,000 per year which now looks like a bargain.\n       It also appears that prior to his removal, Mr. Prude \n     received two very lucrative pay raises on one day last year. \n     The first bumped his salary ``from $98,542 to $123,157 on \n     Aug. 30, 2012, along with a check for back pay through June \n     1, when he was appointed interim CEO.'' The second was an \n     increase ``from $81,000 to $98,542, retroactive to the date \n     of his hire on Jan. 31, 2011.'' He also received a lump-sum \n     payment for back pay back to his hire date. The raises were \n     signed by himself, the board chairman and the chief financial \n     officer.\n       Although the GDPM Board decided to terminate Mr. Prude, the \n     decision to pay the department heads to cover his duties \n     indefinitely appears to be even more expensive than the \n     previous CEO. Therefore, I am requesting the following \n     information for the period of 2008 to the present:\n       1. Please provide an explanation for why a housing \n     authority is allowed to pay an additional $16,000 per month \n     for four individuals to act as CEO. Please also document how \n     HUD intends to enforce the $155,000 salary limit when the \n     duties are split among several individuals.\n       2. The complete annual compensation packages of all GDPM \n     employees, including salaries, bonuses, retroactive pay, \n     separation pay and any other compensation (health care, \n     retirement, etc.).\n       3. Provide a list of all legal bills and professional \n     service and consulting fees paid by GDPM.\n       4. Please document any Conflict of Interest waivers filed \n     by the GDPM and Board of Commissioners with HUD.\n       5. What additional oversight is being conducted by HUD \n     regarding payments to outside consultants and law firms by \n     all housing authorities across the country to ensure that all \n     federal funds, including stimulus and disaster funds, are \n     protected against waste, fraud and abuse? Please be specific.\n       6. Provide all travel records for all employees at GDPM as \n     well as the GDPM Board members.\n       7. Please provide the names of all nonprofit affiliates \n     with ties to GDPM. Please include the names of all officers \n     and their salary/benefit packages.\n       Accordingly, please provide responses by no later than \n     January 24, 2014. If you have any questions regarding this \n     letter, please have your respective staff members contact \n     Janet Drew.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 2014.\n     Hon. Shaun Donovan,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Donovan: Recent reports in the Raleigh News \n     & Observer, which we have attached to this letter, have shone \n     a light on the situation surrounding the executive director \n     of the Raleigh, North Carolina Housing Authority (RHA) and \n     his extremely generous salary and fringe benefits. \n     Specifically, we are concerned that the RHA--a HUD ``high \n     performer''--allows its executive director, Steve Beam, to be \n     on paid vacation from the housing authority for nearly three \n     months a year to pursue his outside hobbies and interests.\n       According to the article, Mr. Beam is one of the most \n     highly paid housing authority executive directors in the \n     country. His compensation package, which includes ``salary, \n     bonuses, longevity payments and car allowance,'' totals \n     approximately $280,000 per year. This year, the RHA board \n     also increased his annual vacation time from 24 days to 30 \n     days per year. In return for the high salary, Mr. Beam is \n     only required to work 7.5 hours per day.\n       In addition to the generous salary and vacation days he \n     receives through his contract, Mr. Beam also accumulates \n     comp-time for any hours he works over 7.5 hours. This benefit \n     is extremely unusual for such a highly paid manager and Mr. \n     Beam has used it to rack up over four months of paid vacation \n     from 2010 to the present. In fact, because of Mr. Beam's \n     unique 7.5 hour work day, over the course of one year he \n     accrues an additional two weeks of comp-time simply by \n     working a traditional eight hour day. All told, he used 22.5 \n     comp days in 2009, 23.5 in 2010, 20 in 2011, 20.5 in 2012, \n     and only 14 through October 2013.\n       It appears however, that despite these extremely generous \n     benefits, Mr. Beam still uses government funded time to \n     indulge his interest in magic tricks, which he referred to as \n     his ``business/hobby'' in a statement to the News & Observer. \n     The newspaper spotlighted several examples of Mr. Beam's \n     using work time to pursue his hobby including posting to a \n     website called ``The Magic Cafee.'' Given that the RHA board \n     specifically gives Mr. Beam months of vacation unavailable to \n     other housing authority executives in order to pursue his \n     interest in magic, it is extremely concerning that Mr. Beam \n     was unable to confine his ``business/hobby'' to his multiple \n     months of vacation which suggests the RHA does not have \n     sufficient oversight controls over Mr. Beam's activities.\n       The RHA executive director and board believe that RHA \n     functions well while the executive director is away from the \n     office for nearly three months a year mainly because RHA has \n     a ``capable'' deputy executive director to pick up the slack. \n     As the RHA receives the vast majority of its funds from HUD, \n     it is important for HUD to hold Mr. Beam and the RHA board \n     accountable for their actions. To examine the extent of HUD's \n     oversight over Mr. Beam in the RHA, please answer the \n     following questions and provide the requested documents:\n       1. An explanation for why Mr. Beam is allowed to accumulate \n     up to three weeks of comp time while working less than the \n     standard 40 hour work week.\n       2. An explanation for how RHA is deemed a ``high \n     performer'' when the executive director is away from the \n     office for nearly three months per year.\n       3. The complete list of annual compensation packages of all \n     RHA employees, including salaries, bonuses, longevity pay, \n     car allowance and/or take-home vehicle, vacation and comp \n     time and any other compensation (health care, retirement, \n     etc).\n       4. Please review and document the executive director's use \n     of RHA office equipment to conduct non-RHA business.\n       5. Provide a list of all legal bills and professional \n     service and consulting fees paid by RHA.\n       6. Please provide copies of all employee financial \n     disclosure forms and document any Conflict of Interest \n     waivers filed by the RHA and RHA board with HUD.\n       7. Provide all travel records for all employees at RHA as \n     well as the RHA board members.\n       8. Please provide the names of all nonprofit affiliates \n     with ties to RHA. Please include the names of all officers \n     and their salary/benefit packages.\n       Accordingly, please provide responses by no later than \n     January 24, 2014.

Shaun Donovan,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Donovan: A recent series of articles in the \n     Bradenton Herald describe very serious financial \n     mismanagement issues at the Bradenton (Florida) Housing \n     Authority (BHA). Specifically BHA--a HUD ``high performer''--\n     has provided lucrative employee compensation packages that \n     helped put the housing authority $400,000 in debt. HUD has \n     already removed both employees for attendance and vacation \n     time infractions, but there appear to be other financial and \n     management problems as well.\n       The BHA employee manual contains very questionable \n     provisions for take-home vehicles, lucrative bonus and leave \n     policies, and retirement benefits. According to an October 6, \n     2013 Bradenton Herald article, at least half of the ten \n     person staff have take-home vehicles. According to page 49 of \n     the BHA employee handbook, the take-home vehicles are \n     ``available for both business and personal use,'' and ``BHA \n     issues a fuel credit card for each vehicle user.'' \n     Additionally, the employee is required to ``arrange for \n     routine vehicle servicing . . . through the Development \n     Director'' and the vehicle must be ``cleaned every other week \n     inside and out at a designated car wash.''\n       If employees with fifteen or more years of service like \n     their take-home vehicles, they have the option of keeping \n     them when they retire or voluntarily leave. According to the \n     employee handbook, the employee ``will be entitled to either \n     the vehicle that they are driving at the time of the \n     separation or $10,000.'' Moreover, the policy provides that \n     ``if said vehicle is leased, the Housing Authority will \n     immediately pay the lease in full.'' Interestingly, the \n     policy places no limit on the value of the vehicle or the \n     lease to be paid off.\n       Most BHA employees are given two bonuses every year, one in \n     June and one in December. According to the employee handbook, \n     employees who have been with BHA for at least a year are \n     eligible for a bonus of up to ten percent which is determined \n     by the executive director. The bonus is paid in June and even \n     employees who retire or voluntarily leave during the year \n     receive a prorated bonus. According to an October 20, 2013, \n     Bradenton Herald article, BHA instituted a new bonus policy \n     in February 2013, without Board approval, that gave every \n     employee a ten percent raise in March 2013. The second bonus, \n     a longevity award, is paid in December of each year (see \n     Table below). Even employees who voluntarily left BHA after \n     five or more years of employment are paid a prorated amount.\n\n[[Page S502]]\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    For service of at least:        But less than:      The Amount is:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2 years.........................  3 years...........  $100\n3 years.........................  4 years...........  $200\n4 years.........................  5 years...........  $300\n5 years.........................  10 years..........  1 Weeks Pay\n10 years........................  15 years..........

Although the \n     employee handbook allows for two days off for Christmas and \n     one for New Year's Day, BHA had been closing between December \n     20th and January 2nd for the Christmas and New Year's \n     holidays. Plus, an employee can, according to the employee \n     handbook, cash out between 40 and 160 sick leave hours twice \n     per year and may convert vacation hours to sick leave hours \n     in order to cash them out. In fact, the Bradenton Herald \n     estimates that the former executive could cash out ``between \n     $7127.50 and $28,510 at a time'' so he could have pocketed an \n     extra $14,225 to $57,020 per year.\n       Meanwhile, BHA board members failed due diligence and \n     oversight responsibilities. The board consistently passed \n     ``resolutions without seeing the language'' and the chairman \n     now wants to review employee policies only after the \n     executive director was fired. Another board member stated \n     ``HUD is the official agency.'' And, ``They didn't call me \n     and say, `Did you know your budget is in deficit.'

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Women's Health Protection Act\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, this month we recognize the 41st \nanniversary of the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, a ruling that \nassured every woman her constitutional right to make her own decision \nabout whether and when to have a child based on her fundamental right \nto have her privacy protected.\n  I had the honor to clerk for the author of Roe v. Wade, Justice Harry \nBlackmun, shortly after that decision in 1974. Few of us expected we \nwould be here 41 years later facing the kind of attacks--in fact, the \nonslaught on women's health care and on their right to privacy--that we \nsee again and again and again on the part of States, and even in this \nCongress.\n  Today the House of Representatives will debate and probably vote on a \nbill that would severely restrict--very practically constrict--a \nwomen's right to choose. H.R. 7 is a threat to that right of privacy. \nInstead of moving forward in protecting women's health, all too often \nwe have seen ongoing attacks. After four decades, this judgment is \nthreatened by onerous and ongoing limitations repeatedly passed by \nState legislators and this body.\n  I am very proud to be joined today by two of my most distinguished \ncolleagues, Senator Murray of the State of Washington and Senator \nBaldwin of Wisconsin, who have been tireless champions for women's \nrights--for our constitutional rights--and for women's health care. I \nam humbled and admiring of the work they have already done and the work \nwe have ahead of us.\n  With their support, I have introduced--particularly with the active \nwork of Senator Baldwin--a measure that will proactively and \npreventively protect women's rights against this onslaught at the State \nlevel.\n  The Women's Health Protection Act is designed to stop restrictions \nthat purportedly protect women's health but really use that cause as a \nruse and a ploy to impose physical layouts on clinics, admitting \nprivileges on doctors, and other kinds of severely burdensome \nrestrictions--such as ultrasound requirements when there is no real \nmedical reason for them--and basically apply to abortion health care \nthe same kinds of restrictions with no more limitations than are \nrequired for medically comparable procedures. That is the basic \nprinciple.\n  The goal is to push back the offensive onslaught on women's health \ncare. We want to be on the offense rather than the defense because \nundoubtedly most of these restrictions, if not all, will eventually be \nstruck down by the courts. The resources which are required are \nburdensome on the organizations and groups and individuals who are \nforced to carry on that fight.\n  I know about that fight because I helped to wage it as an attorney \ngeneral in the State of Connecticut for 20 years. I am very proud that \nI enforced many of the laws that are designed to protect a woman's \nright to choose, including the FACE statute. I was the first attorney \ngeneral to enforce the FACE statute.\n  We have many issues that are now before the Supreme Court, such as \nthe McCullen v. Coakley case--which I hope will be decided--to uphold \nthe buffer zone that makes women's rights real against the intimidation \nand deterrents that anti-choice groups try to bring.\n  Making these rights real--the right of privacy, the right to be left \nalone--is the fundamental reason that we have introduced the Women's \nHealth Protection Act.\n  The President tonight will talk about many of the most important \nissues that matter to this country, including economic opportunity, job \ncreation, recovery from the deepest recession in recent history; giving \npeople a greater sense of confidence and trust in their ability to gain \nthe skills they need to move forward in their lives. Economic mobility \nin this country is one of the greatest challenges we face for our \nchildren and our grandchildren. Those issues of job creation and \neconomic growth are what we should be debating, not H.R. 7, not the \nrestrictions at the State level that seek to inhibit and impede the \nability of a woman to exercise her fundamental right to privacy. Let's \nkeep in mind what is important to the American people who sense deeply, \nbecause it is part of our cultural DNA, part of our fundamental reason \nfor being as a nation, that we have a right to privacy over a personal \ndecision that should be made by a woman in consultation with her \ndoctor, her health care provider, and her family, without interference \nfrom government bureaucrats or politicians. That is what is important. \nEnding the chilling effect of those State restrictions is also one of \nthe goals--the chilling effect that deters women from exercising those \nrights, making those rights real, protecting a woman's right to decide \nwhether and when to have a child. Every pregnant woman faces her own \nunique circumstances and challenges, and she has a right to make her \nown decision based on her own values, guidance from a physician she \ntrusts, a family member she loves and her personal goals and what is \nright for her family.\n  In the 40 years since Roe v. Wade, the attacks on this right have not \nbeen slowed; they have merely evolved, and they have taken new forms. I \nstand with my colleagues today and ask that we recognize together these \npervasive threats, that we counter them and stand together in fighting \nback.\n  I am very proud to stand with Senator Baldwin and Senator Murray,\n\n[[Page S503]]\n\nand I am proud to yield for Senator Baldwin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Last week marked the 41st anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court \ndecision in Roe v. Wade, which affirmed that women have the right to \nmake their own personal health care decisions and to have access to \nsafe and legal reproductive care.\n  The anniversary of Roe should commemorate how far our country has \nprogressed in the last 40 years in safeguarding women's reproductive \nfreedoms and access to quality health care. But today I rise to \nrecognize that history has been made in another way; that is, turning \nback the clock.\n  Americans across the country expect to have access to high-quality, \ndependable health care when they and their families need it. \nUnfortunately, for women across this country, this access has come \nunder attack.\n  As my colleagues and I have worked to reform our health care system, \nto expand access to quality, affordable health care, too many States \nhave enacted record numbers of laws that restrict a woman's access to \ncomprehensive reproductive health services and the freedom to make her \nown health care decisions. In the past 3 years, States across the \ncountry have enacted a total of 205 provisions that restrict women's \naccess to safe abortion services. In 2013 alone, States enacted 70 of \nthese measures.\n  In my home State of Wisconsin, we are now ranked as one of the worst \nStates when it comes to a woman's reproductive rights, thanks to our \nRepublican Governor and legislature. Wisconsin women, families, and \ntheir doctors are facing a slew of new and radical restrictions to \nhealth services mandated by one-party--Republican--rule in my State.\n  Most recently, our Governor has enacted four new restrictions on \nwomen's access to safe and legal abortion care in our State. For one, \nhe signed a law that not only forces women to undergo unnecessary \nmedical procedures but also imposes unreasonable requirements on \ndoctors who deliver care to women.\n  I recently heard from a mother in Middleton, WI. She found out her \nbaby had severe fetal anomalies and would not survive delivery. She had \nto undergo an emergency termination, and a clinic in Milwaukee was the \nonly place that would do the procedure. But because the Governor was \nset to sign this law imposing unreasonable requirements on providers, \nthe clinic was preparing to close its doors and wouldn't schedule her \nfor an appointment. She and her husband were forced to find childcare \nfor their two sons and leave the State and travel to Minnesota just to \nget the medical care she needed. If not for a Federal court order \nblocking the law shortly after the Governor signed it, the admitting \nprivileges provision would have reduced women's access to safe and \nlegal abortions in Wisconsin by 66 percent, closing several health care \nclinics and leaving women out in the cold. But unfortunately for this \nwoman in Middleton, the court order did not come fast enough and the \nGovernor's law disrupted her family during a deeply personal and trying \ntime.\n  The threat in Wisconsin and in States across the country is clear. \nPoliticians are doing this because they think they know better than \nwomen and their doctors. The fact is they don't. It is not the job of \npoliticians to play doctor and to dictate how these professionals \npractice medicine, nor is it their job to intrude in the private lives \nand important health decisions of American families.\n  That is why I am proud to stand with my colleagues, including my good \nfriend from Connecticut and my good friend from Washington State, and \nchallenge these attacks on women's freedoms. I am proud to have \nintroduced the Women's Health Protection Act because every American \nwoman deserves the freedom to exercise her constitutional rights by \nmaking personal health decisions for herself and for her family with a \ntrusted doctor and without political interference.\n  Our bill makes it clear that States can no longer enact laws that \nunduly limit access to reproductive health care and that do nothing to \nfurther women's health or safety. The Women's Health Protection Act \ncreates Federal protections against State restrictions that fail to \nensure women's health and intrude upon personal decisionmaking. It \npromotes and protects a woman's individual constitutional rights and \nguarantees that she can make her own responsible health care decisions \nno matter where she lives.\n  Elected officials should not put politics before women's health and \nwomen's safety. Women are more than capable of making their own \npersonal medical decisions without consulting their legislator. Every \nwoman in America deserves the freedom to plan her own family, to make \nher own health care decisions, and to have access to essential and \nquality women's health care services. We need to act now to guarantee \nthat women will continue to have that freedom.\n  Today I stand with 33 of my Senate colleagues and 99 Members of the \nHouse of Representatives to move our country forward with the Women's \nHealth Protection Act and to safeguard women's constitutional rights \nunder Roe. We need to act now to protect a woman's access to care and \nher constitutional rights, no matter where she lives, by enacting the \nWomen's Health Protection Act.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues, in particular my good friend from \nConnecticut, in leading us in this discussion on the Senate floor but \nalso with the introduction of the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank my colleagues from Connecticut \nand Wisconsin for their strong voices in support of a woman's right to \nmake her own health care decisions in this country. I appreciate them \nbeing here today to talk about that and to stand with me to remind our \ncolleagues that 41 years ago last week, just about 400 yards from where \nwe are standing today, the course of history for women in the United \nStates was changed forever.\n  After over one century of struggle, a new generation of American \nwomen had access to safe and legal abortion. With one case, American \nwomen gained the ability to make their own decisions about their own \nhealth care and their own bodies. At a time when some Members of this \nbody were far too young to remember, women stood up to the restrictive \nlaws of States and the Federal Government and to the men who at that \ntime wrote them.\n  I would like to think that after four decades, many of those who want \nto make women's health care decisions for them have come to grips with \nthe fact that Roe v. Wade is settled law. But unfortunately that notion \nis quickly shattered with one look at our legislatures across the \ncountry and efforts right here in Congress. In fact, tomorrow the House \nof Representatives is slated to vote on their misleadingly named ``No \nTaxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.'' That bill severely undermines a \nwoman's access to insurance coverage of comprehensive health care and \nfails to allow her to get the care she needs, even when her own health \nis at risk. It is nothing more than an attempt to eliminate access to \nabortion services while restricting a woman's ability to make personal \ndecisions about her own care. I guess we shouldn't be surprised.\n  The truth is that the tide of these politically driven, extreme, and \nunconstitutional laws continues to rise. In 2013, our Nation saw yet \nanother recordbreaking year of State legislatures passing restrictive \nlegislation barring women's access to abortion services. In fact, in \nthe past 3 years, the United States has enacted more of these \nrestrictions than in the previous 10 years combined. That means that \nnow, more than ever, it is our job to protect this decision for women, \nto fight for women's health, and to ensure that women's health does not \nbecome a political football.\n  For that reason today I will, along with 18 other Members of my \ncaucus, file a brief with the Supreme Court of the United States in the \ncase of Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., v. Sebelius. Just as in the many \nattempts before this case, there are those out there who would like the \nAmerican public to believe that this conversation is anything but an \nattack on women's health care. To\n\n[[Page S504]]\n\nthem, it is a debate about freedom--except, of course, for the freedom \nof women to access their own care.\n  It is no different than when we are told that attacks on abortion \nrights aren't an infringement on a woman's right to choose, they are \nabout religion or States' rights, or when we are told that restricting \nemergency contraception isn't about limiting women's ability to make \ntheir own family planning decisions, it is about protecting \npharmacists, or when last week we were told that a certain former \nRepublican Governor's comments about women's libido was a ``tone'' \nissue rather than a direct reflection of the Republican Party's \nmisguided and arcane policies.\n  The truth is this is about contraception. This is an attempt to limit \na woman's ability to access care. This is about women.\n  Allowing a woman's boss to call the shots about her access to birth \ncontrol should be inconceivable to all Americans in this day and age \nand takes us back to a place in history when women had no voice or no \nchoice.\n  In fact, contraception was included as a required preventive service \nin the Affordable Care Act on the recommendation of the independent, \nnonprofit Institute of Medicine and other medical experts because it is \nessential to the health of women and their families. After many years \nof research, we know ensuring access for effective birth control has a \ndirect impact on improving the lives of women and families in America. \nWe have been able to directly link it to declines in maternal and \ninfant mortality, reduced risk of ovarian cancer, better overall health \ncare outcomes for women, and far fewer unintended pregnancies and \nabortions, which is a goal we should all share.\n  But what is at stake in this case before the Supreme Court is whether \na CEO's personal belief trumps a woman's right to access free or low-\ncost contraception under the Affordable Care Act. Every American \ndeserves to have access to high-quality health care coverage, \nregardless of where they work, and each of us should have the right to \nmake our own medical and religious decisions without being dictated to \nor limited by our employer. Contraceptive coverage is supported by the \nvast majority of Americans who understand how important it is for women \nand families.\n  In weighing this case, my hope is the Court realizes that women \nworking for private companies should be afforded the same access to \nmedical care regardless of who signs their paycheck.\n  We cannot allow for-profit, secular corporations or their \nshareholders to deny female employees' access to comprehensive women's \nhealth care under the guise of a religious exemption. It is as if we \nare saying that because you are a CEO or a shareholder in a \ncorporation, your rights are more important than your employees who \nhappen to be women. That is a very slippery slope that could lead to \nemployers cutting off coverage for childhood immunizations, if they \nobject to it, or prenatal care for children born to unmarried parents, \nif they thought that was wrong, or an employee's ability to access HIV \ntreatment.\n  I am proud to be joined in this effort by 18 other Senators who were \nhere when Congress enacted the religious protections through the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act in 1993 and who also were here when \nCongress made access to women's health available through the Affordable \nCare Act in 2010. They are Senators who know that Congress never \nintended for a corporation--or furthermore, its shareholders--to \nrestrict a woman's access to preventive health care, because we all \nknow that improving access to birth control is good health policy and \ngood economic policy. We know it will mean healthier women, healthier \nchildren, and healthier families. And we know it will save money for \nbusinesses and consumers.\n  So today we are taking another step forward to uphold the promise we \nmade to women and provide this access broadly, and I believe our Nation \nwill be better for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for no \nlonger than 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       State of the Union Address\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, tonight the President of the United \nStates will come before the Congress and make his State of the Union \nAddress. That is an annual ritual we go through around here every year, \nand I have been through State of the Union speeches through multiple \nadministrations. I sort of liken them to somebody making New Year's \nresolutions at the beginning of the new year, filled with lots of \nrhetoric and promises, most of which get left on the cutting-room floor \nwhen the speech concludes. But that being said, it is something that \ngives the President an opportunity to lay out his agenda for the coming \nyear.\n  Rumor has it that this year the President's speech is going to focus \non income inequality and economic opportunity. Well, that is good to \nhear because these last 5 years of the Obama administration have been \ndevastating to Americans who are trying to advance economically.\n  Nobody can deny that the President inherited a difficult economic \nsituation. I think we would all concede that at the very outset. But he \nhas had now 5 years, going on 6, to make things better. Unfortunately, \nhe has not made much progress.\n  For the majority of Americans, things do not look much better today \nthan they did 5 years ago. The economy still is not working; \nunemployment remains at historic recession-level highs; income \ninequality is at the highest point literally in 86 years; household \nincome has dropped by nearly $4,000 since the President took office.\n  I would like to quote from a piece that was published on Sunday. It \nsaid this:\n\n       The last five years have been cataclysmic. . . . The \n     average income of the top 1 percent of earners increased \n     about 31.4 percent from 2009 to 2012, while wages for the \n     other 99 percent essentially stood still. The proportion of \n     economic gains going to the very wealthy under the Obama \n     administration is greater than it was under Mr. Bush.\n\n  Those are not Republican talking points. That is from a column \npublished in the New York Times. The column goes on to state:\n\n       The rich-poor gap in the United States is now greater than \n     in any other industrialized country. Upward mobility, a \n     staple of the American Dream, is eroding compared with more \n     than a few nations.\n\n  That again is from the New York Times.\n  Whether the author intended it that way, it is a pretty damning \nindictment of the economic policies of the past 5 years.\n  So I am glad to hear that the President is planning to focus on \nincome inequality and economic opportunity tonight. These statistics \nmake it very clear just how important it is we have that discussion \nright now. And they also make it clear we cannot continue the economic \npolicies of the past 5 years because these policies have clearly \nfailed.\n  The President has tried throwing taxpayer money at the problem--\nwitness the failed trillion-dollar stimulus bill. He has tried economic \nbandaids that attempt to alleviate some of the symptoms of economic \nstagnation without doing anything to address the cause. Neither of \nthose strategies has been successful in doing the one thing that will \nturn our economy around; that is, creating full-time, well-paying jobs \nfor the American people.\n  Extending unemployment benefits or offering food stamps may provide \nshort-term relief, but no government assistance is going to provide a \nstable, secure, prosperous future like a good job will. Real long-term \neconomic security and prosperity comes when families have access to \nstable well-paying jobs, with the potential for advancement.\n  If we really want to help Americans, if we really want to get our \neconomy growing, that is where our focus needs to be: creating the kind \nof environment where job creation can flourish. That means making it \neasier and less expensive for businesses--particularly small \nbusinesses, which create a majority of the jobs in this country--to \nexpand and hire new workers.\n  Unfortunately, the President has spent much of his Presidency making \nit more difficult. ObamaCare, for example, saddled businesses with a \nhost of new taxes and regulations that have\n\n[[Page S505]]\n\nmade it difficult or in some cases impossible for businesses to hire \nnew employees.\n  CBS reported in December that--and I quote--``Nearly half of U.S. \ncompanies said they are reluctant to hire full-time employees because \nof the [ObamaCare] law.'' That is not how you want businesses to feel \nif you are looking to encourage them to grow and create jobs.\n  So I am hoping that this evening the President will turn away from \nthe policies that have made nearly half of U.S. companies too worried \nto hire new full-time employees and turn toward policies that will \nenable real job creation in our economy.\n  According to his advisors, the President wants 2014 to be a year of \naction. Republicans could not agree more, and there are a number of \nactions we think the President can take, and I hope he will announce \nthem tonight.\n  One thing Republicans and Democrats agree on, and would like the \nPresident to do, is grant immediate approval of the Keystone pipeline. \nAccording to the President's own State Department, the Keystone \npipeline would support 42,000 jobs that would provide $2 billion--$2 \nbillion--in wages and earnings without taxpayers having to spend a \ndime. All that is required for the creation of these jobs is the \nPresident's approval, which he has inexplicably delayed now for 5 \nyears, despite numerous reports testifying to the benefits of the \nproject and its low environmental impact.\n  The President's staff has spent a lot of time over the last week \ntalking about the President's intention of acting without Congress when \nCongress disagrees with him. Well, here is something the President can \nlegitimately do unilaterally. He has the authority to open the door to \nthese 42,000 jobs, and I hope this evening he will announce his \nintention of acting on approval of the Keystone pipeline.\n  Another thing I hope the President will do tonight is encourage the \nmajority leader to take up dozens of jobs bills that have been passed \nby the House of Representatives. Many of these bills passed the House \nwith bipartisan support and could pass the Senate the same way. There \nis no good reason why the majority leader has decided to let them \nlanguish. Surely we could take up a few of those bills. The President \nought to call on his party to pass these bills to get Americans back to \nwork.\n  In the same spirit, I hope the President will call on his party in \nthe Senate to approve trade promotion authority legislation, which \nwould help create U.S. jobs by giving farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs, \nand job creators in this country access to 1 billion new consumers \naround the globe.\n  Republicans hope the President will use that phone of his that he \nkeeps talking about to call the majority leader here in the Senate and \nencourage him to pass trade promotion authority as soon as possible.\n  Of course, no discussion of relief for middle-class Americans and job \ncreators is complete without discussing ObamaCare, which is putting an \nintolerable burden on middle-class families and small businesses.\n  I am not very hopeful that the President is going to announce his \nintention tonight of working with Congress to repair some of the worst \nparts of his signature law, but for all Americans' sake, I hope he \ndoes.\n  Around the country, families are reeling under the impact of \nObamaCare: higher insurance premiums, higher out-of-pocket costs, \nreduced access to doctors and hospitals. Meanwhile, businesses are \ncutting workers' hours, eliminating health care plans, or declining to \nexpand their businesses to protect themselves from ObamaCare's \nburdensome taxes and regulations.\n  There is bipartisan support for more than one change to ObamaCare, \nand there is particularly strong support for repealing the job-killing \nmedical device tax, which is forcing medical device companies to send \nAmerican jobs overseas.\n  In March of last year, the Senate voted 79 to 20--79 to 20--against \nthe tax. More than 30 Democrats voted for repeal. If the President is \nreally serious about putting Americans back to work, he will announce \nhis intention of working with Congress to repeal this job-destroying \nportion of his legislation.\n  Last month almost 350,000 Americans gave up looking for jobs and \ndropped out of the labor force altogether. That is 350,000 Americans in \n1 month--1 month--who gave up looking for a job.\n  The labor force participation rate is at its lowest level in 36 \nyears. More than 10 million Americans are looking for work, and nearly \n4 million of them have been unemployed for more than 6 months. In fact, \nif you had the labor participation rate today that we had when the \nPresident took office, the unemployment rate today would be about 11 \npercent.\n  It is definitely--it is definitely--time for a year of action. It is \ntime to leave behind the economic bandaids of the past 5 years and \nfocus on policies that will not address just the symptoms but the cause \nof our weak economic growth.\n  We need to remove the obstacles facing our Nation's job creators so \nthat struggling Americans can finally get back to work. We need to help \ncreate a future where every American has the opportunity for a well-\npaying, full-time job, with the possibility of advancement. You are not \ngoing to see that as long as the policies coming out of Washington, DC, \nand this administration make it more expensive and more difficult to \ncreate jobs for the American people.\n  And you are not going to do anything about income inequality if you \ndrive people's cost of living higher, which is what ObamaCare's premium \nincreases, higher out-of-pocket increases, energy-cost increases--there \nare new regulations coming out today that are going to put new \nrequirements and regulations on existing coal-fired powerplants that \nare going to drive electricity costs through the roof for people whom I \nrepresent in South Dakota.\n  Fifty percent of the electricity in South Dakota comes from coal-\nfired power. We are told the administration is coming out with \nregulations that are going to apply those same things that apply to new \nplants to existing coal-fired power. So you are going to have not only \nnew plants that are going to be prevented from being constructed but \nthose that are existing that are going to have to modify their plants \nat enormous cost, in many cases with technologies that do not exist. \nAll that does is put people out of work and makes it more expensive for \nmiddle-class Americans to make ends meet.\n  If you want to do something about income inequality, provide good-\npaying jobs for middle-class families in this country. Put policies in \nplace that make it less expensive, less difficult to create those jobs, \nand then drive down the cost for middle-class Americans rather than \nraising them--rather than having higher energy costs, higher health \ncare costs, higher this, higher that, all because of policies coming \nout of Washington.\n  We can do better. The President has not always shown his eagerness to \nwork with Congress in the past. I am told that tonight he is going to \ntalk about all the things he can do unilaterally. I hope that tonight's \nState of the Union Address will mark a new start. Republicans are ready \nto get to work. I hope the President is too. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                                 Recess\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                       Scholarships For Kids Act\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, this morning the Senator from South \nCarolina, Mr. Scott, and I went to the American Enterprise Institute \nand outlined two bills that together represent the most ambitious \nproposals ever to enable States to use Federal dollars to allow parents \nto find a better school for their child.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to talk about my proposal, which \nis called the Scholarships for Kids Act, and the context in which we \nfind ourselves today as we look forward to the President's State of the \nUnion address. I would also like to briefly mention the\n\n[[Page S506]]\n\nproposal of Senator Scott from South Carolina. He has already \nintroduced his bill. He will be on the floor at another time to talk \nabout it. But these are big ideas. Together they represent redirecting \nabout 35 billion Federal dollars that are now being spent through a \nseries of programs and instead spend them in a way that better fits the \nage in which we find ourselves, an age in which the best Federal \ninvestments can be made in things that enable Americans to do things \nfor ourselves to make our lives better and happier and safer and \nlonger.\n  Let me talk first about Scholarships for Kids. I ask unanimous \nconsent that an article describing the bill be printed following my \nremarks.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would allow approximately \n11 million new Federal scholarships to follow low-income children to \nany school their parents choose as long as it is accredited. It is not \na Federal mandate. It would enable States to create those choice \noptions. But it would mean about a $2,100 scholarship of Federal \ndollars on top of the money that States already spend on elementary and \nsecondary education for each child.\n  The State of Tennessee, for example, spends nearly $8,000 per child \non public elementary and secondary education. This would be providing a \n$2,100 scholarship to the one-fifth of students who are low income and \nallowing that money to follow them to the school they attend.\n  Our country is united, not by race, but by a set of principles upon \nwhich we agree. One of the most important of these is the principle of \nequal opportunity. For me, equal opportunity means creating an \nenvironment where the largest number of people can begin at the same \nstarting line. I believe this is a real answer to the inequality in \nAmerica that we hear so much about, giving children more opportunity to \nattend a better school.\n  The Scholarships for Kids Act will cost $24 billion a year. It will \nbe paid for by redirecting about 41 percent of all the dollars we now \ndirectly spend on Federal elementary and secondary education programs. \nAbout 90 percent of all of the spending on our elementary and secondary \nschools is State and local spending, and about 10 percent is Federal \nspending. This is 41 percent of that 10 percent.\n  It includes all of the money the Federal Government spends on \nelementary and secondary education except money for children with \ndisabilities--and Senator Scott's legislation addresses that. It does \nnot touch the Student School Lunch Program. It does not affect Federal \nresearch in education, and it does not affect Impact Aid.\n  The whole purpose of Federal aid to elementary and secondary \neducation is to help low-income students. But unfortunately, often the \nFederal dollars are diverted to schools with wealthier students. The \nleft and the right both have noticed this and would like to change it.\n  Scholarships for Kids would benefit only children that fit the \nFederal definition of ``poverty'' which is about one-fifth of all \nschool children. That is because it would pin the $2,100 scholarship to \nthe blouse or the shirt of the child, and it would follow that child to \nthe school the child attends.\n  Allowing Federal dollars to follow students to a school has been a \nsuccessful strategy in American education for more than 70 years. Last \nyear, $33 billion in Federal Pell Grants and $106 billion in Federal \nloans followed students to the public and private colleges of their \nchoice. Since the GI bill began in 1944, these vouchers--that is what \nthey are--have helped to create a marketplace of about 6,000 autonomous \ninstitutions and a higher education system that is regarded by almost \neveryone as the best in the world.\n  Our elementary and secondary education system is not the best in the \nworld. U.S. 15-year-olds rank 28th in science and 36th in math. I \nbelieve one reason for this is that more than 93 percent of the dollars \nthat we spend through the Federal Government for higher education \nfollows students to the colleges of their choice, but Federal dollars \ndo not automatically follow students to the elementary or secondary \nschool of their choice.\n  Instead, with our elementary schools and our middle schools and our \nhigh schools, money is sent directly to the schools. Local government \nmonopolies run most of those schools. They tell most students exactly \nwhich school to attend. There is little choice and no K-through-12 \nmarketplace as there is in higher education. Again, in higher \neducation, you have 6,000 autonomous institutions. You have generous \namounts of Federal dollars. They can follow you to the college or \nuniversity of your choice, whether it is public or private or nonprofit \nor for-profit, as long as it is accredited. So students may go to \nHarvard, Yeshiva or Notre Dame, or to Nashville's Auto Diesel College \nor to the University of Tennessee or to the community college nearby. \nThe former Librarian of Congress, Daniel Boorstin, often wrote that \nAmerican creativity has flourished during ``fertile verges,'' times \nwhen Americans became more self-aware and creative.\n  In his book, ``Breakout,'' Newt Gingrich argues that society is on \nthe edge of such an era, the Internet age, an age where everything will \nchange, like everything changed at the time of the new internal \ncombustion engine.\n  Newt Gingrich in his book cites computer handbook writer Tim O'Reilly \nfor his suggestion about how the Internet could transform government. \nHere is how Tim O'Reilly says we ought to do our job as we try to help \nuse the government to help Americans during this period of time:\n\n       The best way for government to operate is to figure out \n     what kinds of things are enablers of society and make \n     investments in those things. The same way that Apple figured \n     out, ``If we turn the IPhone into a platform, outside \n     developers will bring hundreds of thousands of \n     applications to the table.''\n\n  Already 16 States have begun a variety of innovative programs \nsupporting private school choice. Private organizations in many parts \nof our country supplement these efforts. Scholarships For Kids, \nallowing $2,100 Federal scholarships to follow 11 million children, \nwould enable other school choice innovations in the same way that \ndevelopers rushed to provide applications for the iPhone platform.\n  Senator Tim Scott has proposed what he calls the CHOICE Act. It would \nallow 11 billion other Federal dollars that the Federal Government now \nspends through programs for children with disabilities to follow these \n6 million children to the schools their parents believe provide the \nbest services.\n  So there might be a child in Tennessee or Wisconsin or South Carolina \nwho is eligible for both--the Scholarship For Kids, because he or she \ncomes from a family that fits the Federal poverty definition. So there \nis $2,100. Then, if that child is also disabled, the child might be \neligible for a scholarship under the CHOICE Act of several thousand \ndollars. That would then be in addition to the amount of money that \nSouth Carolina, let's say, spends on education per child, which is in \nthe neighborhood of $9,000.\n  So to take the case of Tennessee again, $8,000 or so for the State, \n$2,100 more Federal dollars through Scholarship For Kids, a few more \nthousand dollars, depending upon circumstances, for the scholarship \nunder Senator Scott's proposal, and you have a significant amount of \nmoney that a parent could use to follow a child to the school that \nhelps that child succeed.\n  Especially in the case of children with disabilities, that seems to \nmake so much good sense to me. Senator Scott tells a poignant story of \na young girl in South Carolina who was in a kindergarten. She has Down \nsyndrome. She was in a kindergarten that helped her succeed. But then \nher parents moved. They had to fight for a year to get her new school \nto treat her in a mainstream way. Then they realized that the school \nthey had been fighting for a year was the one they were counting on.\n  Why not let that family take the $13,000, $14,000, $15,000 or $16,000 \nfor that child with Down syndrome, pick a school that treasures that \nchild, and let the money follow the child to the school the child \nattends.\n  So a student with a disability and from a low-income family would \nbenefit under both programs. As I said when I began my remarks, taken \ntogether with Senator Scott's proposal, Scholarship For Kids \nconstitutes the most ambitious proposal ever to use existing Federal \ndollars to enable States to expand school choice.\n  Importantly, this is not a Federal mandate. Washington is full of \npoliticians who fly an hour or an hour and a half from their home town, \nand they\n\n[[Page S507]]\n\nget here and think they have suddenly gotten smarter. They have a good \nidea and they say: Oh, let's apply that in Wisconsin and in Tennessee \nand in South Carolina. I try not to do that. I am a very strong \nbeliever, for example, in teacher evaluations. I led the fight for \nteacher evaluations as Governor of Tennessee 30 years ago. We were the \nfirst State to do it. When I came to Washington people said: Well then, \nyou will want to make everybody do that? My answer was no, I will not. \nStates have the opportunity to be right, and they have the opportunity \nto be wrong.\n  The last thing Tennessee needs is the Federal Government peering over \nthe shoulders of communities and school districts and legislators and \ngovernors and school boards who are trying to work out the very \ndifficult problem of teacher evaluations. It is the holy grail of \neducation reform as far as I am concerned, but it should not be \nmandated from Washington. I very much believe in school choice, but it \nshould not be mandated from Washington. So under Scholarships For Kids, \nStates still would govern pupil assignments, deciding, for example, \nwhether parents could choose private schools.\n  When I was Secretary of Education years ago, Milwaukee was in the \nmidst of a major program to try to give low-income parents more choice \nof schools, including private schools. So along with President George \nH. W. Bush, we proposed what we called a GI bill for kids to allow \nMilwaukee and Wisconsin to do it if it wished to do it. But it did not \nimpose what we thought was a good idea from Washington. Under \nScholarship For Kids, schools that parents chose for their child with \ntheir $2,100 scholarship would have to be accredited. Federal civil \nrights rules would apply. My proposal does not affect school lunches. \nThere also is an independent evaluation after 5 years so that Congress \ncan assess the effectiveness of the new tool for innovation.\n  In remarks that Senator Scott and I made this morning, the issue of \nprivate schools came up, which always does when we talk about expanding \nschool choice. But in this case, we are not necessarily talking about \nprivate schools. Most schools are public schools. I would assume that \nmost of these $2,100 scholarships would follow students to the school \nthey attend, which would be a public school.\n  So if a State chose to create a program whereby its low-income \ncitizens could choose a private school, as long as it was accredited, \nthat would be appropriate under the law. Why shouldn't a low-income \nfamily have the same opportunities for a better school for its child \nthat a wealthier family, who may move to a different part of town or \nmay be able to afford a private school, does?\n  The idea of allowing dollars to follow students to the school of \ntheir choice has not exclusively been an idea of the left or of the \nright in our country. In the late 1960s, the most conspicuous proposal \nfor school choice was from Ted Sizer, then Harvard University's \neducation dean. He suggested a $5,000 scholarship in his poor \nchildren's bill of rights. That $5,000 scholarship would be worth two \nor three times as much today.\n  In 1992, when I was the U.S. Secretary of Education, President George \nH. W. Bush proposed a GI bill for kids, a $\\1/2\\ billion Federal pilot \nprogram for States creating school choice opportunities. Yet despite \nits success in higher education, and despite the fact that it has had \npowerful advocates on both the left and the right, the word ``voucher'' \nremains a bad word among most of the kindergarten-through-12th-grade \neducation establishment, and the idea has not spread widely. Equal \nopportunity in America should mean that everyone, as much as possible, \nhas the same starting line.\n  During this week celebrating school choice, there would be no better \nway to help children move up from the back of the line than by allowing \nStates to use Federal dollars to create 11 million opportunities to \nchoose a better school.\n\n\n                          State of the Nation\n\n  If I may conclude with a word about the context in which we find \nourselves today, Senator Scott and I made our remarks today at American \nEnterprise Institute. I am speaking on the floor of the Senate on a \nvery important day in our country's history. It is not only National \nSchool Choice Week, but it is the day the President of the United \nStates makes his annual state of the Union address. Every President has \ndone that except two--as the Senate historian told us today--and those \ntwo died before it was time to make the address, so it is a tradition \nthat goes back to the beginning of the country. We will all go over to \nthe House of Representatives, listen carefully, and the country will \nwatch to listen to what the President has to say.\n  We are told the issue the President will address is the one of income \ninequality. If that is what he does, that is certainly an appropriate \nissue for any American President. Because if equal opportunity is \ncentral to the American character, so is the idea of the American \ndream, the idea that anything is possible, that anyone can go from the \nback to the front of the line with hard work; and equal opportunity, \ntherefore, helps to create a starting line from which we move.\n  If the President makes that proposal, I think we know the kind of \nagenda we are likely to hear. It will have to do with a higher minimum \nwage that would actually cost jobs. It will have to do with more \ncompensation for perpetual unemployment. It will have to do with \ncanceling more health insurance policies, which is what ObamaCare will \nbe doing in 2014--much more so than it did in 2013.\n  There is another agenda, another picture, another vision of how we \ncan help the largest number of Americans realize the American dream; \nthat is, more jobs, more job training, and more choices for low-income \nparents of better schools for their children so they can get a better \njob.\n  Instead of a higher minimum wage, which actually reduces the number \nof jobs, we would liberate the free enterprise system of the wet \nblanket of ObamaCare, other Obama rules and regulations, and create \nmany more jobs with good wages. Instead of more compensation for long-\nterm unemployment, we would say let's have more job training so they \ncan take one of these good new jobs we propose to create.\n  Then, instead of directing the money to a model that hasn't worked as \nwell over the last 70 years, let us take the Federal dollars we are now \nspending on elementary and secondary education and let them follow low-\nincome children and disabled children to the schools of their parents' \nchoice, So they have an opportunity to go to a better school, just as \nchildren who aren't disabled and with parents who have more money do.\n  We will be arguing that a better agenda for income equality to \nrealize the American dream, to help Americans move from the back to the \nfront of the line, is more jobs, more job opportunities, and more \nchoices of better schools for low-income children. That agenda is \nespecially right for the age we are in.\n  I mentioned the discussion Daniel Boorstin had about America's \nfertile verges, Newt Gingrich's new book, and the suggestion by the \ncomputer programmer that the best way for government to operate is not \nwith Washington mandates or Washington programs but to spend money on \nthings that enable each of us as Americans to do things for ourselves--\nto live a happier life, to live a better life, to live a wealthier \nlife, to live a safer life.\n  I hope in the remarks I have made today that I have done that, \nbecause we have 70 years of experience with such programs in education. \nI would argue there may be no more successful social program in \nAmerican history than the GI bill for veterans. It began 70 years ago \nin 1944. It did not send money to the University of Chicago, Tennessee, \nMichigan, and Harvard. It followed the soldier, the airman, and the \nNavy veteran to the college of his or her choice. We began that \npractice in 1944. We continue it with the Pell grants today. We \ncontinue it with the student loans today. Why should we not follow it \nwith the Federal dollars we spend for elementary and secondary \neducation?\n  If Federal dollars following students to the colleges of their choice \nhelped to produce the finest higher education system in the world, why \nshould we not allow States to try to create the best schools in the \nworld for our children--especially our low-income children?\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will recognize this \nisn't the proposal of the left or the right. I don't know many \nDemocrats who want to get\n\n[[Page S508]]\n\nrid of Pell grants or student loans. They are vouchers, pure and \nsimple, that have lasted for 70 years and may be the most successful \nsocial program we have. Why not allow States in this Internet age to \ntake the Federal dollars we are already spending for low-income \nchildren and make sure the money gets directly to them--and for \ndisabled children, and make sure it goes to directly to them--and give \ntheir parents an opportunity to exercise the same kinds of decisions \nwealthier parents do? They would say: What school would be the best \nschool for my child.\n  Would that not be a way to help a young American get a leg up on \nmoving to the same starting line that children from wealthier families \nhave--and maybe even a chance to move to the head of the line?\n  I hope my colleagues and American people will take a good look at the \nScholarships for Kids Act, and Senator Scott's CHOICE Act. Together \nthey constitute the most ambitious proposal ever to use existing \nFederal dollars to enable States, and to allow parents--especially low-\nincome parents--to choose a better school for their child. There is no \nbetter way to create opportunity in America.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n11 Million $2,100 ``Scholarships for Kids\": A Real Answer to Inequality\n\n       Today I am introducing legislation that would allow $2,100 \n     federal scholarships to follow 11 million low-income children \n     to any public or private accredited school of their parents' \n     choice.\n       This is a real answer to inequality in America: giving more \n     children more opportunity to attend a better school.\n       The ``Scholarships for Kids Act'' will cost $24 billion a \n     year--paid for by redirecting 41 percent of the dollars now \n     directly spent on federal K-12 education programs. Often \n     these dollars are diverted to wealthier schools. \n     ``Scholarships for Kids'' would benefit only children of \n     families that fit the federal definition of poverty, which is \n     about one-fifth of all school children.\n       Allowing federal dollars to follow students has been a \n     successful strategy in American education for 70 years. Last \n     year, $33 billion in federal Pell grants and $106 billion in \n     loans followed students to public and private colleges. Since \n     the GI Bill began in 1944, these vouchers have helped create \n     a marketplace of 6,000 autonomous higher education \n     institutions--the best in the world.\n       Our elementary and secondary education system is not the \n     best in the world. U.S. 15-year olds rank 28th in science and \n     36th in math. I believe one reason for this is that while \n     more than 93 percent of federal dollars spent for higher \n     education follow students to colleges of their choice, \n     federal dollars do not automatically follow K-12 students to \n     schools of their choice.\n       Instead, money is sent directly to schools. Local \n     government monopolies run most schools and tell most students \n     which school to attend. There is little choice and no K-12 \n     marketplace as there is in higher education.\n       Former Librarian of Congress Daniel Boorstin often wrote \n     that American creativity has flourished during ``fertile \n     verges,'' times when citizens became more self-aware and \n     creative. In his book Breakout, Newt Gingrich argues that \n     society is on the edge of such an era and cites computer \n     handbook writer Tim O'Reilly's suggestion for how the \n     Internet could transform government.\n       ``The best way for government to operate,'' O'Reilly says, \n     ``is to figure out what kinds of things are enablers of \n     society and make investments in those things. The same way \n     that Apple figured out, `If we turn the iPhone into a \n     platform, outside developers will bring hundreds of thousands \n     of applications to the table.' ''\n       Already 16 states have begun a variety of innovative \n     programs supporting private school choice. Private \n     organizations supplement these efforts. Allowing $2,100 \n     federal scholarships to follow 11 million children would \n     enable other school choice innovations, in the same way that \n     developers rushed to provide applications for the iPhone \n     platform.\n       Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) has proposed the CHOICE Act, \n     allowing 11 billion other dollars the federal government now \n     spends through the program for children with disabilities to \n     follow those 6 million children to the schools their parents \n     believe provide the best services.\n       A student who is both low income and has a disability would \n     benefit under both programs. Especially when taken together \n     with Sen. Scott's proposal, ``Scholarships for Kids'' \n     constitutes the most ambitious proposal ever to use existing \n     federal dollars to enable states to expand school choice.\n       Under ``Scholarships for Kids,'' states still would govern \n     pupil assignment, deciding, for example, whether parents \n     could choose private schools. Schools chosen would have to be \n     accredited. Federal civil rights rules would apply. The \n     proposal does not affect school lunches. So that Congress can \n     assess the effectiveness of this new tool for innovation, \n     there is an independent evaluation after five years.\n       In the late 1960s, Ted Sizer, then Harvard University's \n     education dean, suggested a $5,000 scholarship in his ``Poor \n     Children's Bill of Rights.'' In 1992, when I was U.S. \n     education secretary, President George H.W. Bush proposed a \n     ``GI Bill for Kids,'' a half-billion-federal-dollar pilot \n     program for states creating school choice opportunities. Yet, \n     despite its success in higher education, voucher remains a \n     bad word among most of the K-12 educational establishment and \n     the idea has not spread widely.\n       Equal opportunity in America should mean that everyone has \n     the same starting line. During this week celebrating school \n     choice, there would be no better way to help children move up \n     from the back of the line than by allowing states to use \n     federal dollars to create 11 million new opportunities to \n     choose a better school.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, it has been 1,406 days since the \nPresident signed into law the Affordable Care Act. Since that time, \nabout 10 million Americans who have not had access to affordable \ninsurance have gotten it and patients have been reempowered, along with \ntheir doctors, to take control of their own health care, taking power \naway from the insurance company which had run our medical lives for too \nlong.\n  The Presiding Officer and I lived through dozens of votes in the \nHouse of Representatives to repeal the bill, as the Senate saw as well, \nbut absolutely no genuine effort to replace the health care bill. I was \nsitting in the Chair yesterday when one of our colleagues, Senator \nHatch, came to the floor to talk about a new proposal--I would probably \nargue the first proposal from Republicans in 1,406 days to actually \ntalk about what their vision--what Republicans' vision--for health care \nreform would be. This is just a framework, not a bill, that has been \nsuggested by our colleagues, Senator Hatch and Senator Coburn and \nSenator Burr. So I wanted to come to the floor to talk about the \nimplications of this framework for affordability and patient \nprotections all across this country.\n  First of all, I give some credit to our colleagues because it has \nbeen 1,406 days of complaints, of politics, of obfuscation, of \nobstruction. So for the first time we are at least beginning to see \nwhat the Republican vision is for the future of health care in this \ncountry. Although we don't have a bill--all we have at this point is a \nframework--it is a pretty scary future because the proposal from our \nRepublican colleagues would dramatically increase the cost of health \ncare for millions of Americans and would put the insurance companies \nback in charge of our health care.\n  So for a few minutes I wish to talk in real terms about what this \nproposal will actually do for health care in this country. I only have \na few minutes, so it is hard to go through the litany of backward steps \nwe would take were we to adopt the proposal that has been laid out by a \ncouple of our very brave Republican colleagues.\n  But the first thing it would do is it would reinstate the fact that \nbeing a woman for decades in this country was considered to be a \npreexisting condition. The health care reform bill says very simply \nthere can be no difference in the amount of money one pays for health \ncare based on gender. The facts are plain: Women have historically paid \n50 percent more in terms of health care costs than men have across this \ncountry; $1 billion more is the total amount of money women have paid \nmore than men simply because insurance companies believe that being a \nwoman is a preexisting condition. That is no longer the law of the \nland. Women pay the same rate as men. There is no difference based on \ngender. But that would be eliminated by this plan. Once again, being a \nwoman could be considered a preexisting condition.\n  Second, annual limits on the ability to recoup the cost of your \nhealth care from your insurance company would be reimposed. The health \ncare bill says: Listen. It isn't fair that you buy an insurance policy, \nand when you get very sick, you are told at some point midway through \nthe year your insurance is up. That is not real insurance. The idea of \ninsurance is that we all pool our risks together, and then if one of \nus, through no fault of our own, gets sick, we actually get those \ninsurance bills paid.\n\n[[Page S509]]\n\n  The Affordable Care Act says there can't be any more of those annual \nlimits, but the proposal from our Republican friends says that annual \nlimits can come back from insurance companies. To someone such as Debra \nGauvin from Connecticut, who had a $20,000 limit and who was diagnosed \nwith stage II breast cancer and hit her limit about halfway through the \nyear and then incurred about $18,000 of additional costs, causing her \nto basically forgo treatment, that was a painful reality of an \ninsurance plan not delivering on insurance simply because she got so \nsick she had big costs. That would once again be the reality. The \nRepublican plan would once again allow for annual limits.\n  Our friends talk about the fact that they address the issue of \npreexisting conditions, but they don't. They truly don't. Because all \ntheir plan says is that if you switch plans and you have no gap, the \nnew plan has to cover whatever illness you may have. But that is not \nhow life works. There are 89 million Americans, in an average year, who \nhave at least a 1-month gap in coverage. That 1-month gap in coverage \nunder the Republican plan--the one shown to us in a basic framework--\nwould allow for preexisting condition discrimination to once again be \nthe law.\n  Betty Berger, one of my constituents, had insurance her entire life \nexcept for basically about a 1- or 2-month period of time where her \nhusband was switching jobs. During that time, their son was diagnosed \nwith cancer. The new insurance company at her husband's new employer \nwouldn't cover the preexisting condition, and the Bergers lost \neverything. They lost their home, they lost their savings, and their \nlives were financially ruined.\n  The Affordable Care Act ends that nightmare for families. Fifty \npercent of bankruptcies in this country are caused by medical debt. The \nRepublican plan does not fix the preexisting condition discrimination. \nAll it says is, if you don't have any change, any gap in your coverage, \nthen the new insurance company has to cover your preexisting condition. \nBut for millions of families that is not how life works.\n  Lastly, although the Republican plan does acknowledge the basic \nunderlying wisdom of the Affordable Care Act is right, in that the best \nway to get coverage to people is to give them a tax credit with which \nto go buy private insurance--that is the foundation of the Affordable \nCare Act, and the Republican alternative that our colleagues introduced \nbasically adopts that as their framework for expanding coverage as \nwell--it is at a much lesser subsidy rate, with much greater tax \nconsequences to Americans than the Affordable Care Act has in it.\n  For instance, the Republican alternative says, if you hit 300 percent \nof the poverty level, that is it, no more subsidy. Well, 300 percent \nsounds like a lot. Three hundred is a big number. But the poverty level \nis pretty measly in this country. If someone is making 300 percent of \nthe poverty level, they are making $34,000 a year. I don't know about \nthe State of the Presiding Officer, but in Connecticut it is hard to \nput food on the table on a consistent basis at $34,000 a year. Then to \nhave no help from the government to buy insurance essentially means we \nwill have a huge class of people making $30,000 to $40,000 a year who \nunder the Affordable Care Act are getting helped by insurance but whom \nunder this alternative plan will get no help.\n  But here is how it is even worse. The Republican alternative we have \nseen this framework on says that one of the ways we are going to pay \nfor this is by taxing people for the health care they are \ngetting. Right now, if someone gets health care coverage through their \nemployer, which 150 million Americans do, they get to essentially \nexclude that money from taxation. They get those benefits in pretax \ndollars. The Republicans have said: Well, we are going to allow that to \nhappen but only for about 65 percent of your benefit. So just under \nhalf of your health care is now going to be taxable. That is a massive \ntax increase on the people of this country.\n\n  We can debate whether there is policy wisdom in limiting the tax \nexclusion of health care, but let us just admit that if you are going \nto fund your proposal based on eliminating the tax exclusion of \nemployer-sponsored benefits to employees, then you are dramatically \nraising taxes on middle-class Americans all across this country.\n  So while I give a lot of credit to the Senators who have put this \nframework out there, because it is the first time we have seen any \nalternative, it is a pretty miserable alternative for consumers all \nacross this country who have finally for the first time, because of the \nAffordable Care Act, gotten access to affordable insurance and for \ncountless more Americans who have been insured and who finally feel as \nthough all of the tricks and the gimmicks they have seen from insurance \ncompanies, such as excluding people from coverage because of a \npreexisting condition or putting an annual limit on their coverage, \nthat those days are over.\n  So as we go into the debate about the effective implementation of the \nAffordable Care Act and as we talk about these alternatives that are \nnow being promoted, it is important we do that with eyes wide open. \nNobody on our side of the aisle who supported the health care bill is \ngoing to tell you it is perfect. No one on our side of the aisle is \ngoing to defend every step of the implementation, but it is changing \nthe lives of millions of Americans. It is reducing the overall health \ncare expenditure of this government, and it is putting Americans back \nin charge of their health care.\n  Now is not the time to be discussing going back to the good old days \nwhen millions of Americans were left out of the rolls and the ranks of \nthose who are insured and insurance companies dictated the day-to-day, \nweek-to-week, and month-to-month health care that is so critical to the \nlives of middle-class families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, tonight President Obama is going to \ndeliver his State of the Union Address. It will be in front of Congress \nand the TV cameras, and he will be talking to the American people as \nwell. He and his advisers are probably working right now on some last-\nminute sound bites and applause lines. But I would say, instead of \nthat, they should be working on an agenda that actually helps \nunemployed Americans, an agenda that will get our economy back on \ntrack.\n  The President doesn't have very many big opportunities left to do \nthis. He is quickly becoming a lameduck President. The President is \ngoing to become a lameduck even faster if he comes to the Capitol \ntonight and delivers a lengthy speech that just attacks Republicans.\n  The economic recession ended 4\\1/2\\ years ago. Many Americans have \nstill not seen their careers or their finances or their quality of life \nimprove. That is what Americans are looking for. Unfortunately, they \nhaven't found it because of the Obama economy. That is what the Obama \neconomy has done to Americans.\n  Millions of Americans have actually, regrettably, given up looking \nfor work. They are falling further and further behind, further and \nfurther away from achieving the dreams they have had. Is the President \ngoing to tell those people he has no new ideas about how to actually \nhelp them?\n  President Obama is failing. He is failing to make it easier for the \nAmerican economy to recover and he is failing to help Americans who \ndesperately want to work. He is failing because he is focused on things \nsuch as extending emergency unemployment benefits and raising the \nminimum wage. While an unemployment check can be a vital safety net for \nfamilies, it is not a long-term solution for what is becoming a part-\ntime economy under President Obama.\n  Tonight the President can deliver yet another partisan political \nspeech--he may get a standing ovation here and there from the most \nliberal side of the aisle--or he can do what he should do as President: \nfocus on solutions with proven bipartisan support.\n  The President has made a point of saying lately that 2014 will be, as \nhe calls it, a year of action. He said he intends to act on his own, \nwithout waiting for Congress. I believe that would be the wrong course. \nPresident Obama has had trouble getting some of his policies through \nCongress, and the main reason is the American people do\n\n[[Page S510]]\n\nnot support his policies. He should use this speech tonight to move to \nthe center, to show he is willing to work with others. He shouldn't \ngive a speech that shows he is moving further to the left. We have had \ntoo much of the President's politics of division.\n  The politics of division is hurting the economy and it is hurting the \ncountry. Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill already agree on \nideas to get America and Americans back to work.\n  There are many policies that President Obama can talk about in his \nspeech tonight that will not require him to go around Congress but, \nrather, to come to Congress. I would like to suggest three of them that \nhe should announce tonight.\n  First is the Keystone XL Pipeline. The President should say he will \nstop blocking construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. His own State \nDepartment says that the pipeline construction could support over \n42,000 jobs across the country, and a bipartisan group of 62 Senators, \n62 Members of this body, backs the project. Early in 2013 President \nObama met with Senate Republicans. He told us we would have an answer \nabout the pipeline by the end of the year. That was 2013. The year has \ncome, gone, and the Keystone XL Pipeline approval is still sitting on \nthe President's desk. The American people deserve an answer, and the \nanswer should be yes.\n  Second, the President really should address his reckless \nEnvironmental Protection Agency--the EPA--and how its regulations are \nputting Americans out of work. Recently the EPA released new \nrequirements for powerplants. The requirements are unachievable and \nthey are unnecessary. Ironically, the EPA did this on the exact same \nday as the 50th anniversary of the start of the war on poverty declared \nby LBJ. These harsh new regulations are going to cause energy costs to \ngo up, and they are going to cause people to lose their jobs as coal \nplants are forced to close. The job losses and higher prices are going \nto fall most heavily on people struggling in Appalachia and across coal \ncountry. Higher energy costs clearly hurt our economy. The President \nmust sensibly rein in his EPA before it does even more economic damage.\n  Third, the President should support bipartisan efforts to repeal his \nmedical device tax. This is a destructive tax, and it was part of the \nhealth care law. It has been estimated by some that the tax puts \nthousands of American jobs at risk because it helps to push \nmanufacturing overseas. An amendment to repeal that medical device tax \npassed right here in the Senate last year with a bipartisan vote of 79 \nto 20. With all the changes President Obama has made to his health care \nlaw, it is barely recognizable. Repealing this tax would be a change \nthat actually helps Americans and not just the President's poll \nnumbers.\n  There are many things the President can talk about tonight that have \nthis sort of bipartisan support. These are just three, but they would \nbe a good place to start.\n  When the President leaves here after the State of the Union, he is \ngoing to go visit four States: Maryland, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and \nthen Tennessee--four States, eight U.S. Senators. When we take a look \nat who they are, four are Republicans, four are Democrats. All 8 of \nthem--4 Democrats and 4 Republicans--were part of the 79 Members of \nthis body who voted to repeal the medical device tax.\n  When the President's spokesman the other day on Sunday's TV shows \nsaid the President is going to use his phone and his pen, I would say \nhe ought to use the phone to call the eight Senators to say: I am going \nto use my pen, after you vote to repeal the medical device tax, to sign \nthat into law. That is something which would show bipartisanship on the \npart of the President as well as really help with our economy.\n  Nearly 21 million Americans are out of work or they are trapped in \npart-time jobs. It is time for President Obama to talk less about \ndivisive ways to redistribute Americans' prosperity and more about \nhelping all Americans increase their own prosperity. America is a \nstrong and resilient nation. We can overcome the Obama economy, and we \nwill. We can overcome--and we will--the bad policies of this \nadministration. The President should come tonight to the Capitol and \nsay he is willing to help Americans return to prosperity.\n  If the President announces these three policies tonight, the country \nand the economy will benefit and a bipartisan group of Republicans and \nDemocrats will all be able to stand and applaud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin.) The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would also like to address the matter of \nthe President's State of the Union speech tonight. I am sure that, as \nhas been the rule, President Obama will make an eloquent speech. He is \nvery good at that. There is just one problem: The President's \ncredibility has been shattered. Indeed, on issue after issue we see a \nmassive gap between his rhetoric and the reality. You might say that \nthe two biggest challenges the President faces tonight are those two \nchallenges. One is to his credibility, and the other is to his \ncompetence and the competence of the Federal Government, actually, to \nbe able to deliver on the promises it makes.\n  The most obvious example is the health care law, which we have heard \na lot about and will continue to hear a lot about in this ensuing year. \nI was visiting with one health insurance company executive who told me \nthat basically the bad news is going to continue to unroll and unravel \nover the coming months. There will be nowhere to hide.\n  Perhaps what people want most from Washington, DC, is accountability. \nI hear it all the time. People say what does it take to get fired? Do \npeople promise the Sun and the Moon and deliver nothing without any \nconsequences? How about people who were charged with implementing the \npolicies of the administration, whether it is the Web site contractor \nor whomever. The Web site contractor finally did get fired and a new \none hired, so I assume that sooner or later the Web site will actually \nwork as advertised. But that still leaves us with the flaws in the \nunderlying policy, which will not work. The American people understand \nthat and they are looking to Washington for help, saying please deliver \nus from this epic failure which is not what we were promised. In the \nevent there is not a response to that that they deem credible, I \npromise there will be an accounting come November 2014.\n  The President said repeatedly that under his signature health care \nlaw, if you liked the coverage you had you could keep it. Public \nopinion polls then showed that roughly 90 percent of the American \npeople liked their health care coverage. Why in the world did we \nundermine or did ObamaCare undermine the existing coverage people liked \njust in order to cover more people, which in fact it did not do. We \nknow ObamaCare has forced millions of Americans to lose their preferred \ncoverage, the coverage they said they liked back in 2009. The President \nrepeatedly said ObamaCare will reduce your premiums, make them lower--\nfor a family of 4, about $2,500. The stories we see, day after day, of \nAmerican citizens signing up on the health care exchanges is just the \nopposite. They are experiencing premium shock, and the fact is it is \ngoing to continue to get nothing but worse as people realize that the \nones who are signing up for ObamaCare are older, sicker Americans and \nthat young healthy Americans are simply taking a pass, saying I cannot \nafford it and if I have a problem I will take care of it later.\n  Premiums are going to continue to skyrocket, and Americans who are \nlooking for more affordable health care coverage will find out that \nindeed it has been priced beyond their ability to pay.\n  Here is the rub. The President said--and I think this was the \nimplicit, underlying promise of ObamaCare: If you pass ObamaCare, \nCongress, everybody will have coverage. We will have universal \ncoverage. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that ObamaCare, \neven if it were implemented to perfection, exactly as the proponents \nand the President had expected, it would still leave 30 million people \nuninsured--30 million people uninsured.\n  The President said this new law would bring a greater sense of \ncertainty to the U.S. health care system. Instead, we see one of the \ncredit rating agencies actually slashing the credit rating of America's \nhealth insurers,\n\n[[Page S511]]\n\nciting the uncertainty generated by the implementation of ObamaCare--\nthe opposite, again, of what was promised.\n  The President also said the Web site, when you plug in your personal \ninformation--your Social Security number, your health information that \nis protected already by Federal law--if you plug it into the ObamaCare \nWeb site it is going to be safe and secure. Cyber experts have \ntestified, particularly in the House of Representatives, that the \nsecurity of the Web site is worse today than it was several months ago. \nThere is no guarantee that if you put your personal information, your \nprivate information, your confidential information into the Web site, \nit is going to be protected.\n  Here is the real surprise: I remember when Secretary Sebelius \nappeared before the Senate Finance Committee just a couple of months \nago. I asked her about the navigator program. You remember, the \nnavigator program was supposed to get people to help you sign up for \nObamaCare. I said: There is no background check, is there, to be a \nnavigator.\n  She said no.\n  I asked: So is it possible that a convicted felon could be a \nnavigator, somebody you are giving your personal information to, to \nhelp you sign up for ObamaCare?\n  To her credit she said, in all candor: Yes; that is possible.\n  I nearly fell out of my chair.\n  ObamaCare's broken promises have caused enormous pain and anxiety in \nmillions of Americans in Texas and all around the country. We see from \nthe Wall Street Journal poll that came out this morning, which had to \nbe a wake-up call to the administration and its allies, the American \npeople are anxious, they are dissatisfied, they are wondering what has \ngone so terribly wrong in Washington, DC, and ObamaCare is exhibit 1. \nThat is why we are committed on this side of the aisle to working with \nour colleagues, when they are ready to talk to us, and to replacing \nObamaCare with patient-centered alternatives that will actually bring \ndown the cost and make it more affordable.\n  What better way to get more people covered than to make it more \naffordable and to make sure government does not make these private \ndecisions for us and our family when it comes to health care but that \nwe, families, get to make that decision in consultation with their \nfamily doctor.\n  When you begin to scrape the surface, the President's problem of \ncredibility and competence--those are the two crises he confronts \ntonight as he addresses the Nation--all we have to do, beyond \nObamaCare, is look at what is happening in the economy. After raising \ntaxes $1.7 trillion, that was about 1 year ago, during the time \nPresident Obama has been President of the United States, the national \ndebt has gone up $6.6 trillion. But my friends across the aisle, many \nof them--I would exclude the present occupant of the Chair who I know \nis concerned about this--my friends across the aisle think nothing of \nbringing legislation to the floor that is unpaid for that would add to \nthe national deficit and national debt. That is the reason we now have \na national debt in excess of $17 trillion.\n  That is more than any of us can possibly conceive. When President \nObama became President, the national debt was about $10 trillion. That \nis bad enough. But in the last 5 years it has gone up $6.6 trillion--or \nmore than $6.6 trillion. It is no coincidence that he has presided over \nthe weakest recovery and highest unemployment since the Great \nDepression back in the 1930s.\n  President Obama has this very strange idea that the best way to get \nthe economy going is to raise taxes and spend more money. It is just \nnot working. As a matter of fact, we have great debates in Congress \nabout the role and the size of the Federal Government. But perhaps the \nbest example of why big government does not work has been the lousy \neconomy, the slow economic growth, the high unemployment, and the \nnumber of people who have actually dropped out of the workforce.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics has this figure that it calculates. It \nis called the labor participation rate. You can Google Bureau of Labor \nStatistics or labor participation rate. That will show you that the \npercentage of people between the ages of 25 and 54 who are actively \nengaged and looking for work is lower today than it was at the height \nof the recession in 2008. Another 347,000 people dropped out of the \nworkforce in December alone.\n  I know when we look at the unemployment rates that are released from \ntime to time, we see the rate coming down a little bit, and we say: \nThat is great. The unemployment rate is coming down. The problem is \nthat in December alone almost 350,000 people quit looking for work. \nThey gave up. We know that nearly 4 million people who are still \nlooking for work have been out of a job for more than 6 months. That is \nnot an economy to be proud of.\n  Let me just contrast that with what happened in the 1980s during the \nReagan recovery. Typically, what economists will tell you is that when \nwe have a recession, it is sort of a V shape. So when it hits bottom, \nit actually bounces up pretty quickly because there is nothing but the \nupside left to go. Yet this recession has been more of a U shape. In \nother words, we hit bottom, and we are still bouncing along the bottom. \nWe haven't seen the kind of economic growth that we need to get people \nback to work, to grow our economy, and to get our budget balanced. I \nthink the reason for that is some of the very policies I talked about a \nmoment ago. It is due to the same misguided policies that the President \nhas advocated and will no doubt talk about again tonight in his State \nof the Union Address.\n  I heard my colleague Senator Barrasso from Wyoming talk about the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. The President likes to say: I have a pen, I have \na phone, and I'm going to go it alone. Of course he can't do that under \nour Constitution. We all learned in high school about the checks and \nbalances of the three coequal branches of government. The President \ncan't spend a penny without Congress appropriating the money.\n  If we take him at his word, and he really wants to do something about \nthe economy and reduce our dependence on imported oil from dangerous \nsources abroad, he could use that pen he talked about to authorize the \nCanadian-American connection of the Keystone XL Pipeline. You would \nthen see a lot of the oil and energy produced in Canada, which is \ncombined with the energy added to that pipeline, make its way down to \nsoutheast Texas where the refineries will turn it into gasoline and jet \nfuel, and in the process create thousands of new jobs.\n  Rather than using that pen to put people back to work and make sure \nthat we have safe sources of energy, his administration is working \nbehind the scenes to kill the Keystone XL Pipeline. Politics is the \nonly explanation.\n  The President should not be surprised at what this Wall Street \nJournal poll showed this morning--that most of the voters disapprove of \nhow he handled the economy. Likewise, he should not be surprised that \ntrust in the Federal Government has also fallen to historic lows; that \nis the credibility problem. You can't promise the Sun and the Moon and \ndeliver squat and expect people to trust you next time when you make \nanother promise.\n  Then there is this. The Obama administration has repeatedly ignored \nor waived laws that prove inconvenient--from ObamaCare to immigration \nto welfare reform to education, energy, and drug policy.\n  One of the most frequent questions my constituents ask me back home \nin Texas is: How can the President do that? I thought we were a Nation \nthat believed in the rule of law, that the law applied to everybody in \nAmerica no matter how humble your station in life or how exalted--\nwhether you are the commander in chief. I guess we have to revisit that \nwhen the President picks and chooses which laws he wants to enforce. Of \ncourse, Congress can pass laws. That is what Congress does.\n  The executive branch is the one that is supposed to enforce the law. \nSo unless someone files a lawsuit--not Eric Holder in the Department of \nJustice, one of the most politicized Departments of Justice I can even \nremember. When some private organization or individual--such as the one \nwho recently challenged the contraception mandate in ObamaCare that was \nrecently stayed by the Supreme Court of the United States--or some \nassociation or business files a lawsuit that culminates in a judgment \nof a court years later, but\n\n[[Page S512]]\n\nfor that, there really isn't much of a check on President Obama. But \nthat can change, and the voters know how to do it: By changing who is \nin charge in the Senate in November.\n  Here is another place where the President overreached and recently \nhad his hands slapped by the courts. This had to do with his claimed \nauthority to do another end run around Congress to make recessed \nappointments. We all know that under the Constitution the advise and \nconsent function of the Senate is to act on the President's nominees \nand to vote to confirm them or not. Again, in a case of the President \ntrying to go it alone, the court of appeals slapped down his attempt to \ndo this end run around the Constitution and the advise and consent rule \nof the Senate. But that didn't stop him. Now he is threatening to take \neven more unilateral action: I have my phone, I have a pen--he is ready \nto do it again. That is not how the Federal Government is supposed to \noperate.\n  For example, after the President made these unconstitutional recess \nappointments, the DC Circuit of Appeals ruled on them and said: If the \nPresident's claim to make that appointment would be upheld, it would \n``eviscerate the Constitution's separation of powers''--the three \ncoequal branches of government, checks and balances. What could be more \nfundamental to our form of government? The court of appeals said that \nif they upheld the President's claimed power to make those \nappointments, it would ``eviscerate the Constitution's separation of \npowers.''\n  We know how important the role of checks and balances is in our form \nof government and in our democracy. Indeed, our democracy would not be \nable to survive without them. The people who founded this great country \nknew that the greatest threat to their freedom and their individual \nliberties and their most basic rights was the concentration of power, \nso that is why they separated power at the Federal and State level in \nthe Tenth Amendment, but they also separated the power at the Federal \nlevel between the judicial, executive, and the legislative branches. \nYet this President and his administration have shown repeated contempt \nfor the checks and balances that are so essential to our form of \ngovernment.\n  I have said many times that no President has the authority to \ndisregard or selectively enforce the law based on political expediency. \nIf he or she can, then we are nothing better than a banana republic. We \nare no longer a Nation that believes in the rule of law, which has \nreally been the competitive edge that this country has had over other \ncountries. People know if you come and do business in the United \nStates, you are going to have access to the courts, your contracts are \ngoing to be enforced, and the laws that are written will actually be \nenforced by an impartial judiciary. That gives us a competitive \nadvantage economically, morally, and otherwise, but it is being \nundermined.\n  Republicans are not the only ones that are worried about the \nPresident's willingness to bypass the normal legislative process. \nYesterday my colleague from Maine, a Democratic caucus member, urged \nthe White House not to treat Congress as--what he called--an \nafterthought.\n  In that spirit, I would like to remind the President of something he \nsaid just a few months ago. He said:\n\n       We've got this Constitution; we've got this whole thing \n     about separation of powers. So there is no shortcut to \n     politics, and there's no shortcut to democracy.\n\n  That is what the President of the United States said just a few \nmonths ago. Yet now he is claiming: I have a phone, I have a pen, and \nI'm going to go it alone. I would like to remind him of something he \nalso said back in 2006, which is very similar. He said:\n\n       The Founders designed this system, as frustrating as it is, \n     to make sure that there's a broad consensus before the \n     country moves forward.\n\n  I couldn't agree more with the Barack Obama of 2006 or the Barack \nObama of a few months ago, but I couldn't disagree more with President \nBarack Obama of today who somehow has this fantasy--it is nothing \nbetter than a fantasy--that somehow he can rise above Congress and the \nConstitution and the separation of powers and don the robe of a virtual \ndictator, force new laws down our throat or force the country in a \ndirection that it doesn't want to go. It is a fantasy. It ain't gonna \nhappen.\n  Yet on issue after issue the President still likes to tell the \nAmerican people that he can move forward without any regard to \nconsensus or constitutional checks and balances. It is a terrible \nmistake, and I wish he would reconsider.\n  In addition to its assault on the separation of powers, this \nadministration has targeted other enemies, such as its intrusive \nmonitoring of journalists' phone records. It has attempted to shake \ndown private companies to get them to fund ObamaCare. It has fostered a \nculture of intimidation and punished whistleblowers. There have been \nscandals from Benghazi to Fast and Furious and those responsible for \nthe attempt to intimidate the American people--or some part of the \nAmerican people--from participating in the political process through \nthe IRS scandal.\n  We know this administration has repeatedly obstructed the \ninvestigations and refused to cooperate with the inquiries that would \nbring the facts out into the light of day so we can all know what \nhappened, make sure that those responsible are held accountable and, \nmore importantly, make sure it never happens again.\n  I am confident that this is not the record President Obama will talk \nabout tonight. Although this is his record, it is not too late to \nchange. His own record is what has destroyed his credibility, as well \nas caused people to question his competence and the Federal \nGovernment's ability to actually deliver on the extravagant promises he \nhas made time and time again.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I grew up in East Saint Louis, IL, on the \nbanks of the Mississippi River. As a child, it was a dominant feature \nin my life--crossing that river, watching that river. It didn't take \nlong as I grew up to realize that that river has a mind of its own.\n  Last year, because of drought conditions in the Midwest, the \nMississippi River was so low in January and February of 2013 that the \nArmy Corps of Engineers had to come out on an emergency basis and \nliterally scour the bottom of the river of rock formation so that \nnavigation could continue. We were worried that we would have to shut \ndown this major economic artery in the Midwest because the river was so \nlow. The Army did a great job. The navigation continued with only \nslight delays and no major interruptions. Within 60 to 90 days, that \nsame river was at flood stage. That is what those of us who grew up in \nthe Midwest come to expect and understand--the unpredictability of that \nriver. As we grew up and started to look around, we realized there were \nbluffs behind us that at one point were the banks of this great river \nand that we were living in the flood plain, if you will--that area \nclose to the river that once was totally under water, way back when.\n  So there were flooding episodes, as most communities went through, \nand efforts made to deal with that flooding, including the building of \nlevees. Those levees, for the most part, on the Illinois side of the \nriver have been reliable. Some have questioned whether they can meet \n500-year standards or these epic floods, and I think the question is \nwell worth asking. But the fact is that the efforts made on the \nIllinois side--I can't speak for others, but at least in that region--\nhave really been up to the task and we have not had serious flooding in \na long time in that part of the world.\n  Because of concerns raised by the Army Corps of Engineers about \nwhether these levees that protect the towns and businesses and families \nwere up to the job, something remarkable occurred. Leaders who lived in \nthe counties--and I will be more specific in a moment--closest to that \narea got together and said, We are not going to\n\n[[Page S513]]\n\nwait on the Federal Government. We are going to impose a tax on \nourselves and raise tens of millions of dollars to start fortifying \nthese levees to protect our towns and businesses. I don't know if that \nhas ever happened anywhere else. We have to salute them. They weren't \nwaiting for Uncle Sam to show up and ride to the rescue; they took it \ninto their own hands. Well, I salute them because they did raise the \nmoney and they are prepared and they are fortifying those levees.\n  I love the Army Corps of Engineers. They came to our rescue last \nyear. But the locals have asked the Army Corps of Engineers to come in \nand certify these levees, that they are stronger now than they ever \nwere, and the Army Corps has been slow to do it. It is frustrating. The \nlocals are doing everything we could ask of them and they aren't \ngetting at least a timely response from the Army Corps of Engineers. \nSo, as a consequence, we are living in this uncertain world.\n  All of these businesses, all of these towns, all of these families in \nthis so-called flood plain believe they are protected by the levees, \nthe levees have not been certified by the Corps, and now comes the new \nNational Flood Insurance Program which says to the people living there \nthat they are going to have to pay higher premiums for flood protection \nin the future. The people rightly said, Wait a minute. We are paying \nhigher sales taxes; we voted to pay higher sales taxes to protect \nourselves, and now we are being told we still have to pay higher \npremiums. That gets to the heart of why we are on the floor discussing \nthe National Flood Insurance Program.\n  Now I wish to say a few words about my position on this issue because \nit is one I have struggled with, to try to find the right answer in \nlight of what I think is an extraordinary, if not heroic, effort by \nlocal people to address their problem and not wait for the Federal \nGovernment, their frustration of not having at least a timely \ncooperation by the Army Corps of Engineers, and now the prospect that \nthe premiums for their flood insurance are going to go up despite their \nbest efforts to protect themselves. If they were doing nothing, \nstanding back and saying, This isn't our worry; if something bad \nhappens, Washington will ride to the rescue, that is one thing. But \nthey are doing something specific that costs them money and they are \ntrying to protect themselves.\n  Rapid increases in flood insurance premiums, which are on the \nhorizon, are hard for many people in my State. For the people in Metro \nEast, which is the area I just described which is on the eastern side \nof the Mississippi River across from St. Louis--the southwestern part \nof Illinois--for many of them this increase in these premiums would be \nimpossible for them to pay. Forty percent of the Metro East I have just \ndescribed is mapped as flood plain, and most of the National Flood \nInsurance Program policyholders there have their premiums subsidized. \nThis meant that instead of paying $500 a year, they were paying about \n$150. It made it more affordable to them. However, the new increases \nthat are anticipated could be as much as 400 percent.\n  In Granite City, IL, policyholders paid $585 last year for flood \ninsurance, but with the new increases, the premiums are expected to \nrise to $1,500 or even $2,000 a year. For some people, $2,000 a year \nmay not sound like a sacrifice. But for hard-working families in small \nhomes they have worked hard to buy and build, another $2,000 a year can \nmake some real impact on their lives.\n\n  Additionally, 30,000 new structures in Metro East could be newly \nmapped into a flood plain when FEMA finally finalizes its flood maps. \nThese homeowners could end up paying $500 to $2,000 a year for flood \ninsurance. Allowing their premiums to rise so high so quickly is \nunacceptable, especially given how the people in Metro East have worked \ntogether over the last 7 years at significant expense to themselves to \nimprove the 74-mile levee system.\n  In 2007, the Army Corps notified Metro East locals that their levees \nneeded improvement. The next year FEMA notified them that much of the \narea would be mapped into a flood plain, triggering mandatory flood \ninsurance purchase requirements unless the levee was improved. In \nresponse, the three Metro East counties I mentioned earlier--Madison, \nMonroe, and St. Clair, where I grew up--taxed themselves to pay for the \nimprovements to their levees. They raised $150 million. I believe this \ntype of local commitment is unprecedented. I don't know if anyone else \nis doing this. They did it.\n  There have been a number of setbacks, but when they occurred, I have \ntried to work with the Army Corps and with my colleagues in Congress to \nget these projects back on track. I commend the people in Metro East \nfor working together to honestly address the threat of flooding. No \ncommunity wants to go through the pain and loss of damaging flooding. \nThe Presiding Officer has been through it in West Virginia. I have been \nthrough it. Twenty years ago, in 1993, there was horrific flooding on \nthe Mississippi River and there have been several instances since. I \nwas out there piling up the sandbags with a lot of folks trying to \nprotect homes and businesses.\n  These communities in Metro East are actively doing something to \nprevent the recurrence of that kind of a disaster. So while the locals \ncontinue to work with the Army Corps to achieve the highest level of \nlevee protection as quickly as possible, I am going to continue to make \ntheir work a priority in my efforts. Because the residents of Metro \nEast have taken on a significant financial commitment to protect homes \nand businesses, I will work to ensure that flood insurance premiums are \naffordable.\n  I wanted to draw attention to the way the residents of Metro East \nhave taken the initiative to help protect themselves from the risk of \nflooding, because not every community is engaged as directly with this \nthreat as they have been. My constituents in this part of the country, \nfor the most part, cannot afford to buy flood insurance at the new \nlevels and the new rates.\n  I agree with the effort underway by Senators Menendez, Isakson, \nLandrieu, and others to slow down these increases, and that is why I am \nsupporting their effort. But we need to do this with our eyes wide \nopen. The National Flood Insurance Program is not going to keep up with \nthe costs of recovery from severe weather events that we see on the \nhorizon.\n  The National Flood Insurance Program provides nearly 6 million \nbusiness owners, homeowners, and renters $1.2 trillion in coverage. The \nproblem is the program simply doesn't collect enough money to cover the \ncosts of rebuilding communities from floods, hurricanes, and other \ndisasters.\n  The flood insurance program will be more than $20 billion in debt \nafter making payments for Superstorm Sandy. If we in Congress continue \nto ignore the structural weakness in the flood insurance program, that \ndeficit, that debt, that shortfall is going to grow in the future. We \ncan and should, sadly, expect more intense extreme weather events. \nAccording to computer models, the changing climate means the storms we \nare seeing will become stronger and more extreme in the future, causing \neven greater amounts of damage. Nationwide, the financial consequences \nof weather-related disasters and climate change hit an historic high in \n2012, causing over $55 billion in damages.\n  I had a hearing on this issue, and I thought: If I bring in \nenvironmentalists, a lot of folks will discount it completely when they \nstart talking about climate change. They may not attend. They may walk \nout of the room. So instead I brought in people from the property and \ncasualty industry, the insurance industry. What do they do for a \nliving? They watch the weather. They watch it more closely than any \npolitician ever did, and they decide adequate premiums to cover the \nreserves needed to protect from these weather disasters.\n  The story they told us was: Get ready. The weather is going to get \nmore extreme, and the costs and damages are going to grow dramatically. \nSome insurance companies--major insurance companies--have walked away \nfrom States, saying: There is just too much exposure there. We cannot \ncharge premiums and collect enough to create a reserve in the instance \nof a natural disaster.\n  Now, that is the reality of the private sector analysis of this \nissue. This is not some--pejorative term--tree-hugging environmentalist \nmusing about possibilities. These are hardhearted actuaries and \naccountants taking a hard look at what the future\n\n[[Page S514]]\n\nholds. The private insurance industry has looked at the scientific \ndata, and they have made changes in the way they do business. They are \nadjusting their operations to prepare for worse weather and bigger \nlosses. They have begun raising premiums for wind, earthquake, and \nflood insurance in areas where disasters are likely, ensuring the rates \naccurately reflect the risk of damage. The industry has also begun to \nrefuse insuring properties in states where there is just too much risk. \nIn contrast, the Federal Government has not adequately prepared to \nhandle the growing number of severe weather events.\n  Well, Senator Durbin, where does this leave you? You do not think \nyour people can afford to pay the higher premiums, and yet you do not \nthink the reserves set aside for the flood insurance program are \nadequate.\n  I think that is the reality of what this political vote is likely to \nshow.\n  Yesterday the vote on the floor was an overwhelming bipartisan vote \nto go forward on this measure. We know the Flood Insurance Program will \nnot be able to keep up with the damage inflicted on our communities. \nThe cost--asking homeowners and businesses to pay dramatically more in \nflood insurance premiums--is too high to make the National Flood \nInsurance Program viable in the near future.\n  We need to recognize that losses from future floods will likely cost \nmore than the National Flood Insurance Program can cover. And then--and \nthat is why I think we need a dose of reality in this Chamber and on \nCapitol Hill--Congress has to step up. That is a reality. We know these \ndisasters are likely to occur, and we cannot--will not--collect the \npremiums necessary to create the reserves to cover them. It will be our \nresponsibility to ensure that help is there. Whether that disaster is \nin Kansas, Illinois, West Virginia, or anywhere across the United \nStates, Congress cannot deny that help.\n  It is time that we seriously address the effects of climate change \nand rethink how we protect and provide disaster assistance to \ncommunities on a regular basis. Those who choose to ignore the \noverwhelming scientific evidence of climate change cannot ignore the \noverwhelming accounting evidence that the National Flood Insurance \nProgram will not be able to meet the increasing expense of natural \nflooding disasters.\n  Our votes--if we pass this measure before us--may spare families from \nan unacceptable financial burden if flood premiums skyrocket, but they \ndo not spare us from the reality that the damages from future flooding \ndisasters will be nationalized, as the damages of Katrina and Sandy \nwere.\n  Those who vote for this Menendez-Isakson-Landrieu measure--as I \nwill--are voting at the same time to nationalize the cost and damages \nof future disasters, to say that this is going to be something we will \nrespond to as needed. I have done that throughout my congressional \ncareer in the House and Senate, stood up to help those regions of the \ncountry in trouble, from California all the way to the east coast, and \nI will do it again because I think it is an American family \nresponsibility. There is a limitation to what this National Flood \nInsurance Program can achieve. There is certainly a limit to how much \nworking families can pay for these premiums. And we have to accept the \nreality that when these flooding events occur, when these disasters \noccur, we have to accept that responsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                               Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Agriculture \nAct of 2014. That is the new name of the farm bill.\n  After over 3 years of hard work by the House and Senate Agriculture \nCommittees and other interested Members, we are finally nearing the \nfinish line for this version of the Nation's farm and food policy.\n  As all Kansans and all farmers and ranchers from every State know, \nthe farm bill impacts not only our farmers and ranchers but also \nbusinesses up and down Main Street, as well as families in our rural \ntowns and urban cities.\n  Everyone in Kansas, people who work in agriculture or are impacted by \nits success--which, by the way, is every single American--and my \ncolleagues in the Congress deserve to know why I was the only Senator \non the conference committee not to sign the conference report as of \nlast night. I am here today to fully explain my reasoning and why I \ncannot and will not vote for this legislation.\n  It all comes down to this simple question: Does the new farm bill \nimprove agriculture in America? I believe the answer is, unfortunately, \nno.\n  While we all want to provide long-overdue certainty to producers--\nsomething lacking for over 400 days, for 2 years; a record--the \nconference missed an opportunity for greater and necessary reforms to \nour Nation's farm programs, Federal nutrition programs, and burdensome \nregulations.\n  We should not march backward and pass a farm bill with more \ngovernment subsidies, more regulations, and more waste.\n  How on Earth did we get to this point today?\n  Back in 2011 Chairperson Stabenow and I started the process of \nwriting a new farm bill with a field hearing in her home State of \nMichigan. Later that year we held another successful hearing in \nWichita, KS. After more formal hearings in the Senate and conversations \nwith Kansas producers, Michigan producers, producers all over this \ncountry, it was clear to me that this farm bill would have to be \nreform-oriented, reduce the deficit, and be responsible--not only to \nfarmers and ranchers but also to consumers and taxpayers. \nUnfortunately, as I stand here today, this farm bill does not meet \nthose standards, and, taken as a whole, the conference report fails to \nmove both Federal farm and food programs forward.\n  I previously voted against the Senate bill, which looked too much in \nthe rearview mirror for outdated programs, but this report is even \nworse. Just listen to this: Last year's House bill was officially \ncalled the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act--\n``reform,'' ``risk management''--and here in the Senate we passed the \nAgriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act. The final report now is reduced \nto the Agriculture Act, the farm bill.\n  Today I will focus my comments on my three biggest concerns: \ncommodity subsidy programs, nutrition program spending, and the lack of \nregulatory reforms so sorely needed.\n  Considering we all commonly refer to the legislation as the farm \nbill, my first concern and criticism is the new price loss coverage \nprogram. The acronym for that is PLC. It is a subsidy program.\n  Back in 2012, 2 years ago, I was pleased that the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee and the full Senate passed a bipartisan commodity title that \ncontained real reform. We ended the current countercyclical commodity \nsubsidy program and got the government out of the business of sending \nsignals to producers essentially telling them which crops to plant by \nsetting target price guarantees for producers--farming for the \ngovernment, not farming for the market. Unfortunately, that reform was \nreplaced in the latest Senate bill with a new target price subsidy \nprogram, doubled down in the House version with even higher target \nprices, and manipulated even more in the conference report to suit the \ndesire of specific crops over the objections of others in different \nregions.\n  The new Price Loss Coverage Program repeats a classic government \nsubsidy mistake: setting high fixed target prices or subsidies, which \nonly guarantees overproduction, with long periods of low crop prices, \nleading to more expensive farm programs funded directly by taxpayers.\n  Why do we have to go down that road again? I have yet to hear one \nlegitimate explanation for why Congress is about to tell all producers \nacross this country that the Federal Government will guarantee the \nprice of your wheat at $5.50 per bushel--by the way, it is a little \nover $6 right now at the country elevator in Dodge City--and rice at \n$14 per hundredweight for the next 5 years regardless of what happens \nin the market. We have done this before, and we know it creates \nplanting and marketing distortions instead of letting our producers \nrespond to market conditions.\n  After the World Trade Organization--the WTO--ruled against the United \nStates for our cotton programs, I thought we had learned a lesson. I \nhave\n\n[[Page S515]]\n\nsaid it before and will say it again: The WTO stove is hot. Why would \nwe reach out and touch it again? Remember that we are still required to \npay Brazil millions of dollars a year under that decision.\n  The Amber Box subsidy programs in this bill will open American \nagriculture to global trade disputes--which we have already lost and \nwill likely lose again if challenged.\n  To date, objections and solutions from me and my colleagues--ranging \nfrom South Dakota, Senator Thune; Nebraska, Senator Johanns; Iowa, \nSenator Grassley; and even Ohio, Representative Bob Gibbs--have all \nfallen on deaf and stubborn ears. Our efforts to add market orientation \nto the price loss coverage subsidy program, as well as attempts to end \nit outright, have all been blocked and are certainly not reflected in \nthe final report.\n\n  I am equally unhappy with the final outcome of the nutrition title of \nthe farm bill.\n  Partisan politics has unnecessarily infiltrated this debate, with \nmany Members on the other side of the aisle drawing a line in the sand \nat zero savings or real reform to the expensive and unrestricted \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. That is called SNAP. It is \nreally the food stamp program. Facts are stubborn things. Despite good \nintentions, SNAP--food stamps--now makes up more than 80 percent of the \nDepartment of Agriculture's budget and was previously exempted from \nacross-the-board sequestration cuts.\n  What we have here today is a ballooning and expensive set of Federal \nnutrition programs, with a patchwork of eligibility standards, \nloopholes, and, frankly, unneeded bonuses to State governments for \nsimply administering the program. If you administer the program right, \nyou get a bonus.\n  I understand and sympathize with the need for nutrition assistance \nfor hard-working families. I have championed their efforts. However, we \ncannot and simply should not box off SNAP from unnecessary and timely \nreforms.\n  While the Senate version of the bill in 2012 and 2013 did tighten the \nLow Income Home Energy Assistance Program--LIHEAP--loophole to save \nroughly $4 billion over 10 years, there have always been additional \nneeded reforms to the program.\n  At the end of the 2012 Senate bill, I included my personal views in \nthe report. I identified eight additional ways to rein in the out-of-\ncontrol spending and reinstitute program integrity for the SNAP \nprogram.\n  Last year, in 2013, I introduced a stand-alone piece of legislation \nthat would have saved a total of $36 billion in SNAP without ever \ntouching individual monthly benefits, and it failed on a party-line \nvote.\n  Eventually, the House of Representatives passed nearly $40 billion in \nsavings--after intense debate over there--within the SNAP program. That \nis a 5-percent reduction over a 10-year period. I do not see how the \nfinal legislation, amounting to a 1-percent reduction in SNAP spending, \nis a fair compromise between both versions of the legislation. This \njust does not add up.\n  In every single one of my townhall meetings in Kansas--and I know the \nPresiding Officer from West Virginia finds the same thing true in his \nhome State--the first question fed-up producers and business owners ask \nis, How can we stop or even slow down the onslaught--the onslaught--of \nregulations?\n  This farm bill had great potential to help producers and ranchers and \nall of agriculture with reducing the crushing regulatory burden from \nthe government's rules and requirements. They just want relief.\n  Despite years of work in both committees and strong provisions in the \nHouse-passed farm bill, the final legislation lacks key, commonsense, \nand sound science regulatory reforms.\n  I am more than disappointed that a WTO-compliant resolution to \nmandatory country-of-origin labeling--it is called COOL--was not \nreached. As a result, our livestock producers who were already facing \ndrought and high feed prices, now are going to have to worry about \nretaliatory actions by the Governments of Canada and Mexico.\n  Our ranchers are equally troubled that provisions in the House bill \ndirecting the USDA to refocus their efforts on the Grain Inspection \nPackers and Stockyards Act, the acronym for that is GIPSA, they were \nexcluded. Another regulatory relief provision was already cleared by \nthe full House and the Senate ag committee would have ended the \nduplicative National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. I will not \ntry the acronym for that.\n  These are pesticide permits required by the Environmental Protection \nAgency. We had an opportunity to protect human health and eliminate \nduplicative, unnecessary regulatory actions, and instead, despite all \nof our commitments to work together to resolve the issue, we were all \nblocked from including the simple and necessary regulatory relief.\n  Each of these regulatory reforms had bipartisan support. But now \nproducers across the country are left without an explanation and, much \nworse, no needed relief. I am shocked at how far some Members will go \nto protect this administration's regulatory agenda instead of \nprotecting real hard-working Americans.\n  After all of that, let me point out that with any large piece of \nlegislation one can usually find some positives to point to and today's \nfarm bill is no different. While I support many of the programs in the \nless talked about titles of the farm bill, I am especially appreciative \nof the inclusion of strong crop insurance provisions and livestock \ndisaster programs. The No. 1 issue we heard over and over again from \nour producers across the country and in every corner of Kansas was that \ncrop insurance was their No. 1 one priority for the farm bill; \nsecondly, they said get the regulations off our backs.\n  The policies in the final bill protect the commitment to producers by \nstrengthening crop insurance as the cornerstone of our farm safety net, \nregardless of the size of their farm or the commodity they grow. As \nthis bill moves forward, the Risk Management Agency, RMA, will be busy \noffering expanded coverage for commodities such as cotton that have not \ntraditionally participated in the program as much as other crops.\n  However, I am concerned that the conservation compliance requirement \nincluded in the legislation on crop insurance, not on cropping \noperations, not on being a farmer but on crop insurance, will \nunnecessarily burden producers who are already good stewards of their \nland and already subjected to conservation requirements in the \ncommodity programs. This is a duplication--more paperwork.\n  As the western half of Kansas continues to linger in a historic \ndrought, the lack of livestock disaster programs that expired in 2011 \nis truly upsetting. We should have never let the programs expire in the \nfirst place. We had an opportunity in 2012 to reauthorize them, but the \nSenate failed to act, over my calls of action.\n  All of the livestock disaster programs are finally retroactively \nauthorized. But the assistance will be too little and too late in many \nparts of cattle country. Some have lost part of their herds and even \nstrains of cattle genetics.\n  Unfortunately, as a Kansan, as well as a member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee and the farm bill conference committee, I am \ndisappointed to say that the final policies of this farm bill do not \noutweigh the positives. While we all want to provide certainty to \nproducers, the conference has missed an opportunity for greater and \nnecessary reforms to our Nation's farm programs, Federal nutrition \nprograms, and burdensome regulations.\n  After over 3 years of debate, the challenges that agriculture faces \nat home and across the world have only continued to grow. We need 21st \ncentury policies and innovative solutions. Instead, this bill misses \nthe mark and goes backward to protectionist programs.\n  The issues I raise deserve to be debated fully and publicly. I know \ntime is of the essence. Yet the full conference committee met only once \nfor opening statements last October. With all of the ramifications of \nthe farm bill, we met once last October--for 3 minutes apiece.\n  In truth, the majority of this bill was negotiated behind closed \ndoors without the opportunity for votes, amendments or discussion. \nThere is too much of that around here. Producers, consumers, and our \nglobal trading partners expected more. Unfortunately, the\n\n[[Page S516]]\n\nU.S. taxpayers deserve better than this conference report. I did not \nsign this conference report last night and cannot in good conscience \nvote for this legislation.\n  But I will promise this to all of the Members who worked so hard to \nat least get a bill. I will continue to work and advocate on behalf of \nadvancing agriculture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in America, education is one of the \nkeys to success--but too many Kentucky children are trapped in failing \nschools. This week is National School Choice Week, an ideal time to \nremember that school choice can be an important option for children \nliving in poverty.\n  Over 10,000 young Kentuckians a year drop out of school, with little \nlikelihood to return and reduced prospects for the future. Dropping out \nbefore graduating high school very often subjects kids to added \nhardship. Studies by the U.S. Census Bureau show that the average high \nschool dropout earns 42 percent less than a high school graduate \nwithout a college degree. And these failures of our school system fall \nhardest on minority and low-income children.\n  But the big government-educational complex too often cares more about \nthe bricks and mortar of a failing school than the children attending \nit. Special interests, like those of unions, can outweigh the interests \nof individual students.\n  We need to provide increased opportunities for families to choose the \neducation environment that best meets the needs of their children. \nSchool choice programs do just that--they empower parents.\n  There are two types of school choice programs. One program provides \nfinancial assistance for disadvantaged students to enroll in private \nschools. The second charter schools--are public schools that are \nentrepreneurial and free from many of the constraints of school \ndistrict bureaucracies. Rather than focusing on red tape, they are \nsingularly focused on academic achievement, and give parents the \nopportunity to choose the best school for their child.\n  Both types of programs offer families the opportunity to send their \nchild to safer schools with a proven track record of success. They \nallow public education dollars to follow the student to the school of \ntheir parents' choosing and improve student performance. Surely \nparents, not bureaucrats, are the best judges of what school is right \nfor their child.\n  In Washington, DC, studies have shown that the city's private school \nscholarship program has increased graduation rates by 21 percent. In \nIndiana, enrollment in the State's private school scholarship program \nhas more than doubled this year, to nearly 20,000 students. Clearly \nparents in Indiana are pleased with the availability of this option.\n  Indiana charter school students also saw improvements in learning for \nmath and reading compared to their traditional public school \ncounterparts. If Indiana and Washington, DC, can offer their children \nbetter choices, why can't Kentucky do the same?\n  A recent poll shows that 72 percent of Kentuckians favor charter \nschools, and yet Kentucky is one of only seven States that does not \nallow them. I agree with the vast majority of Kentuckians who favor \ncharter schools and have supported Federal incentives for States that \npermit them, and will continue to do so.\n  For these reasons, I am a proud sponsor of legislation in the Senate \nthat would expand school choice and allow 11 million low-income \nstudents to take Federal funding to the public or private school they \nchoose. This would give parents, not Washington or bloated school \nbureaucracies, the power to decide how to best use the education money \nallocated for their children. It would also ensure that students \ntrapped in failing schools don't have to wait for those schools to get \nbetter to get a quality education.\n  While I was encouraged to see Kentucky's ranking among States has \nimproved, more is still needed. Last year, 18 of Kentucky's 22 failing \nschools were in Jefferson County. Students trapped in failing schools, \nsuch as those in the Louisville area, need options before they fall too \nfar behind.\n  School choice is a way out. For low-income families, it can break the \ncycle of poverty. Thanks to school choice, many young men and women who \nwould otherwise not have had the opportunity to excel can grow up to \nbecome leaders in their communities and their country.\n  The current one-size-fits-all education system is not the best \napproach. Our Commonwealth needs to make fundamental changes so that \nthat every child has the opportunity to leave a failing school. I'm \ngrateful for the organizations across the Bluegrass State which are \nfighting to make that happen. Kentucky's school children are capable of \ngreat things; let's make sure we empower their parents to help their \nchildren succeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/28/senate-section/article/S516-3", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S516-S517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. LOUIS ARNOLD\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in \ncelebration of the anniversary of Dr. Louis Arnold's birth. Dr. Arnold, \nor ``the Flying Evangelist'' as he is known by many in our home State, \nwas born 100 years ago on January 19, 1914, in Buckeye, KY, and has \nspent his life in service to the Baptist church. He is the founding \npastor of Clays Mill Road Baptist Church.\n  Dr. Arnold felt the call to preach early in life. At age 11, he began \npreaching to his classmates while they walked to and from school. Then, \nat 19, he publicly announced his call to preach and held his first \nsermon in the Mitchellsburg Baptist Church. Following that first \nsermon--the story goes--he gazed up into the stars with a Bible in hand \nand said, ``Lord, I'd rather be a preacher than to be President of the \nUnited States.''\n  Dr. Arnold got the nickname ``the Flying Evangelist'' during the \nsecond World War. Already the pastor of a church in Lexington, KY, he \nwas called to pastor another church in Cincinnati, OH. The churches \nwere separated by 85 miles of country road--too far of a drive to be \nable to preach at both Sunday services. Undeterred, Dr. Arnold bought \nan interest in a small plane and learned to fly. Now, not only could he \neasily commute between the two churches, but he could also fly to \nrevivals and churches across the region. He even equipped his plane \nwith a loudspeaker so he could preach from the sky over cities and \ntowns.\n  Although Dr. Arnold was born in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, his \nmessage has spread far and wide. He has his own radio broadcast, \n``Preaching at Your Church,'' and his paper, ``The Arnold Report,'' is \nmailed to all 50 States. He's organized churches and revivals in his \nhome State of Kentucky as well as travelled abroad to places such as \nMexico, Central America, Europe, and the Bahamas. He's written numerous \nbooks of sermon and Bible study, and dozens of inspirational novels \nwhich have sold in all 50 States and several foreign countries.\n  Dr. Arnold celebrated his 100th birthday by preaching at the Clays \nMill Road Baptist Church; a remarkable testament to his conviction and \nfaith that have not wavered in the more than 80 years since his first \nsermon. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing Dr. Louis \nArnold, an upstanding Kentucky citizen, on the occasion of his 100 \nyears of life and his unwavering devotion to his faith.\n\n[[Page S517]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/28/senate-section/article/S517-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO IRENE GAINER\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to congratulate Irene Gainer on her \nupcoming retirement from Federal service. Most of my colleagues know \nIrene through her husband, Senate Sergeant at Arms Terry Gainer, but \ntoday Irene gets the spotlight as I take a few minutes to recognize her \nimpressive career.\n  Many great things come from Chicago, including Irene, who was born \nand raised in Chicago. Chicago is also where she met her husband Terry \nand started her first career as a nurse. She attended the College of \nSt. Francis and St. Bernard's School of Nursing. During the early years \nof their marriage, Irene joined Terry as the Navy moved them around the \ncountry from Rhode Island to Virginia and then to California. In each \nState Irene worked as a nurse, and to this day she maintains her \nlicenses and professional credentials in all three States.\n  Irene also worked in Illinois hospitals, including St. Bernard's \nHospital, Christ Hospital, Central Community Hospital, and for 14 years \nat the Little Company of Mary Hospital.\n  In 1988, Irene started her second career--she began law school at \nJohn Marshall. Irene attended law school during the day, continued \nworking nights as a nurse at Little Company of Mary Hospital, and--did \nI mention?--she and her husband were raising their six children.\n  After law school graduation in 1990, Irene accepted a job as Clerk in \nthe Circuit Court of Cook County. She also worked for the State of \nIllinois as Assistant Director of Health and Energy Policy, served as \nGeneral Counsel and Executive Director of the Illinois Alcoholism and \nDrug Dependence Association, and as an associate in a law firm.\n  Irene and Terry moved to Washington, DC in 1998. While living here in \nDC, Irene has worked for the National Treatment Accountability for \nSafer Communities, Sibley Memorial Hospital, and the Peace Corps. And \nfor the past 5 years, she has been Director of the Hearing Office for \nthe Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Medicare \nHearings and Appeals.\n  If Irene's busy career is any indication, there is little chance she \nwill spend much idle time in retirement. Between volunteering with her \nlocal Catholic church and staying in touch with her six children spread \naround the world, she is sure to stay active.\n  I thank Irene for her many years of Federal service and wish her all \nthe best in retirement. And I especially hope that she and Terry find \nlots of time to spend with their 14 grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/28/senate-section/article/S517-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING ALEXIS ``LEXIE'' KAMERMAN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on January 17, just days before our Nation \nobserved a day in remembrance of Martin Luther King, Jr., a man \nrecognized for his nonviolent activism during the civil rights \nmovement, a restaurant in Kabul, Afghanistan, popular with foreigners \nand expatriates, including Americans, was rocked by a terrorist attack, \nkilling 21 people.\n  Tragically, we lost one of our own from Illinois during this act of \nsenseless violence: Ms. Alexis ``Lexie'' Kamerman, a Chicago native who \nfor years had dedicated herself to serving others and only the year \nprior had moved to Afghanistan, working with the American University \nthere to help increase access to education for Afghan girls and women.\n  Lexie grew up in Chicago in my home State. She was a 2004 graduate of \nthe Latin School of Chicago, a 2008 graduate of Knox College--where she \nwas also an all-star conference water polo player--and she went on to \nreceive her Masters in Higher Education from the University of Arizona.\n  Countless friends and family have described Lexie as generous, \nfearless, and passionate about helping to create a better world. It's \nno surprise that the 27-year-old found herself in Kabul, working as a \nstudent development specialist with American University of Afghanistan. \nAmerican University of Afghanistan has been committed for years to \nextend high-quality, affordable education for Afghans, especially \ngirls, who may not have had access to it otherwise.\n  Sadly, American University of Afghanistan lost another member of its \nfamily in the same attack: 29-year-old political science professor \nAlexandros Petersen from Washington, DC. He and Lexie both were too \nyoung, too bright, and too dedicated to helping others to be leaving \nthe world so soon.\n  Afghanistan has seen many ups and downs over the years. But these \nheinous attacks on innocent civilians, people such as Lexie who work \nevery day to help the Afghan people achieve a better future, are among \nthe lowest of lows.\n  My deepest sympathies go out to Lexie's parents, Jack and Alison, and \nthe rest of her family, as well as the family at American University of \nAfghanistan and to all victims of the attack and their loved ones. It \nis only fitting that Knox College has created a scholarship in Lexie's \nname, a well-deserved tribute for a young woman who was so dedicated to \nothers and to the value of education during her all-too-short life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/28/senate-section/article/S517-3", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S517-S518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MEDICAL RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to correct some unfortunate \nremarks made on the floor this month and reaffirm my long-standing \nsupport for the medical research programs at the Department of Defense, \nmost of which fall under the Congressionally Directed Medical Research \nProgram, or CDMRP. This program has led to major scientific \nbreakthroughs since its creation in 1992 and it is one of my proudest \naccomplishments here in the U.S. Senate.\n  This program was created by me and together with my Defense \nAppropriations colleagues Senator Ted Stevens and Senator Daniel Inouye \nspecifically in response to grassroots advocacy spearheaded by those \nwho suffer from breast cancer, those who have survived it, and their \nfamilies. The Department of Defense runs one of the largest health \nsystems in the country, serving 9.6 million servicemembers, their \nfamilies and military retirees, and as a result offered a unique \nopportunity to undertake Breast Cancer Research. Military families \nsuffer from the same conditions and diseases that affect our society at \nlarge, and they also have disproportionate rates of some diseases as a \nresult of their service. My colleagues and I believed that offering \npotentially lifesaving research specifically focused on this population \nwas a logical step.\n  So we started with Breast Cancer research in 1992. In the 22 years \nthis program has been funded, we have spent almost $3 billion on Breast \nCancer research, and $7.5 billion overall on important research on \nnumerous conditions through the Department of Defense. Millions of \nAmericans, including those who receive their health care from DOD, have \nbeen touched by conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis--or \nLou Gehrig's disease--autism, lung cancer, multiple sclerosis, \nneurofibromatosis, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, tuberous sclerosis \ncomplex and many others.\n  And what has that investment yielded? It has paid dividends, with \nbreakthroughs in our understanding of breast cancer. It led to the \ndevelopment of the revolutionary drug Herceptin that is saving and \nprolonging the lives of millions of American women every day. DOD \nbreast cancer research directly contributed to the discovery of a \nfrequently mutated gene that contributes to several cancers and the \nOncoVue breast cancer risk assessment test.\n  But this program's payoff has not been limited to breast cancer: \nThose who receive Coenzyme Q10 treatment for gulf war illness can thank \nDOD medical research. The prostate cancer treatment Zytiga received FDA \napproval in 2011 due to the rapid early-phase clinical testing funded \nby DOD. Research jointly funded by CDMRP, the National Institutes of \nHealth--NIH--and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency are \ncreating advanced prosthetics that are accurately recreating the \nmovement of the human hand--which in recent trial allowed a \nquadriplegic to feed herself for the first time in years. These are \njust a few small examples of the many research, diagnosis, and \ntreatment breakthroughs this research has brought about.\n\n[[Page S518]]\n\n  DOD medical research has also made direct contributions to the \nunderstanding and treatment of medical conditions that uniquely or \nacutely affect those who serve. In addition to the research on gulf war \nillness, servicemembers and veterans who suffer from traumatic brain \ninjury, tinnitus, or vision problems know that they can receive the \nmost advanced treatment possible thanks to this medical research. DOD \nmedical research is also finding biomarkers to better treat mental \nillness, so individual servicemembers do not have to go through the \ntrial and error of being prescribed psychotropic medications that may \nor may not be effective for them. These research programs are helping \nto provide a better quality of life for those who have recently served \nin Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  For a number of years now, some in Congress have made the argument \nthat this program does not belong at the Department of Defense, \nsuggesting that these programs are duplicative and that this funding \nshould be spent elsewhere. In fact, the medical research done at the \nDepartment of Defense is complementary to and coordinated with the \nresearch done at NIH, and other Federal agencies including the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. While the medical research done at DOD \nand NIH may have overlapping goals, including many research grants that \nhave been jointly funded, CDMRP has a different mandate, uses different \ncriteria in selecting grants, and uses a unique two-tiered review \nprocess that assures high quality of research.\n  I simply say to those critics of the program, the outcomes speak for \nthemselves. Any suggestion that I believe this program should have been \ncreated elsewhere or should be moved is incorrect, and I want to make \nsure the Record is clear on this point.\n  I thank my colleagues on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, \nChairman Durbin and Ranking Member Cochran, and the chair and ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Mikulski and Senator \nShelby, for providing $1.55 billion in funding for these critical and \nsuccessful medical research programs in Fiscal Year 2014. I look \nforward to many more years of breakthrough medical research conducted \nby the DOD that will directly address the needs of our military members \nand that will have broad application to millions of Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/28/senate-section/article/S518-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MENTAL EXERCISES FOR SENIORS\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, today I wish to call attention to the \nACTIVE, or Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital \nElderly, study on mental exercises for seniors. The study, conducted by \nresearchers at the University of Florida College of Public Health and \nHealth Professions, showed that older adults who receive cognitive \ntraining can significantly improve their reasoning and mental \nprocessing skills. Elderly patients were coached and assessed in \nmemory, reasoning, and processing speed at baseline. The study \nparticipants were then reassessed at intervals of 2, 3, 5, and 10 \nyears. The result was that participants who received cognitive training \nreported significantly less difficulty with activities of daily living. \nMost patients achieved improved reasoning and mental processing speed \nat the end of the study, the results of which may be found in the \nJanuary 13 online issue of the Journal of the American Geriatrics \nSociety.\n  These results echo findings from Senate Special Committee on Aging in \nits recent work on improving quality of life for seniors who suffer \nfrom Alzheimer's and dementia. The Committee's 2012 report, entitled \n``Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia: A Comparison of International \nApproaches,'' stated that ``individuals who are cognitively active--\nsuch as individuals who regularly read or do crossword puzzles--are at \na lower risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI)--an early \nsymptom of dementia and AD, Alzheimer's disease--because they have \nincreased cognitive reserve.''\n  The Senate Special Committee on Aging is also committed to embracing \ninnovative brain health care advances for seniors. During our \ncommittee's recent Healthy Aging Forum, various groups invested in \nsenior health care shared novel ideas for better mental health care and \nquality of life. These included research and medical technology devices \nthat sharpen senior memory, thinking, and cognitive processing skills. \nAmong these were Microsoft Kinect software, which uses cognitive and \nmental diagnostic, rehabilitative, and routine mental game-based \nexercises to help improve senior brain health and fine motor skills. \nLoneliness, which adversely impacts brain health and increases risk for \ndementia in seniors, can be minimized by engaging seniors with the \nGerijoy avatar--also showcased at the Healthy Aging Forum--an \ninteractive virtual pet companion that strengthens seniors' mental \ncapabilities by providing opportunities for meaningful interaction.\n  The University of Florida Institute on Aging, another invited \nexhibitor at the Senate Health Aging Forum, is currently conducting a \nLIFE, Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders, study in \nwhich the effect of physical activity and/or aging health education on \nsenior mobility and independence are being assessed. Cognitive function \nand impairment are also being examined as a part of the study.\n  The Senate Special Committee on Aging has conducted numerous hearings \non Alzheimer's in recent years, coinciding with my cosponsorship of the \nHOPE for Alzheimer's Act, S.709/H.R.1507, which will improve diagnosis \nand care planning services for patients with Alzheimer's. A panel of \nwitnesses from the government, academia, and the Alzheimer's \nAssociation discussed recent advancements in these areas in an April \n2013 hearing entitled, ``The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's \nDisease: Are We On Track to 2025?'' An updated 2013 version of the \nnational plan also highlights anticipated milestones in prevention of \nthe disease. Lifestyle modifications and identification of Alzheimer's \nand dementia risk factors are included as part of the plan.\n  I have long been a tireless advocate in the fight against Alzheimer's \nand dementia. As the chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, \nI am committed to doing whatever I can to ensure the health and well-\nbeing of our seniors. Although much progress has been made, we still \nhave a long way to go in ensuring the best possible quality of life for \nAmericans in their later years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/28/senate-section/article/S518-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S518-S519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL CATHERINE M.

She was selected as the Soldier of the Year \nat Fort Gordon, GA, and was subsequently selected for the Officer \nCandidate School, earning a commission as a finance officer in April \n1997.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Black has served in a broad range of duty stations \nand assignments over her two decades of service. As a Lieutenant, she \nserved as a disbursing officer in a finance group at Fort Bragg, NC. \nThis culminated in a rotation through the U.S. Army Forces Center in \nDoha, Qatar. Following the horrific attacks on September 11, 2011, she \nprovided financial management services during the ground invasion in \nsupport of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  As a Captain, Catherine Black served as a finance detachment \ncommander and battalion operations officer at Fort Richardson, AK, and \nlater as a financial management operations officer at Fort Belvoir, VA. \nAfter promotion to major, she commanded the 126th Financial Management \nUnit for a year and a half, while simultaneously serving as the \nBattalion Executive Officer for the Special Troops Battalion, 1st \nSustainment Brigade at Fort Riley, KS. She trained and deployed her \nthree financial management detachments to both Iraq and Afghanistan. \nShe then deployed her headquarters to Kandahar, Afghanistan and stood \nup financial operations throughout southern Afghanistan. There she \nprovided finance support to joint and coalition\n\n[[Page S519]]\n\nforces and developed financial management infrastructure for the nation \nof Afghanistan.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Black was selected to serve as a congressional \nbudget liaison officer in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the \nArmy for financial management and comptroller. She managed the Army's \nmilitary personnel and operations and maintenance accounts, the Working \nCapital Fund, and activity at the depots and arsenals that support the \nNation's organic industrial base, including Illinois' Rock Island \nArsenal.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Black's leadership throughout her career has \npositively impacted her soldiers, peers, and superiors.

Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the \nRecord finalist essays written by Vermont High School students as part \nof the Fourth Annual State of the Union Essay contest conducted by my \noffice. These 9 finalists were selected from over 380 entries.\n  The essays follow:\n\n\n  Carly Neeld, Champlain Valley Union High School, Grade 11 (Finalist)\n\n       It is a great privilege to be a citizen of the United \n     States. As citizens, we have a responsibility to ensure that \n     our government is used to improve lives. Although this \n     country has achieved much, there are many aspects that can be \n     improved. In particular, we need to work towards reducing the \n     unemployment rate and take meaningful steps to stop climate \n     change. Addressing these two issues now will go a long way \n     towards helping current and future generations.\n       The unemployment rate is at seven percent. It is our \n     obligation, as a nation, to lower this rate. By lowering the \n     unemployment rate, we could see a drop in crime and a \n     reduction in poverty as more people are earning a steady \n     income. Because of this steady income, there will be more tax \n     revenue which could then support safety net programs that \n     help the impoverished. An increased employment rate will also \n     cause an increased access to health care and other \n     necessities to living, strengthening families and \n     communities.\n       In order to decrease the unemployment rate, there are \n     things in our country that will need improvement and our \n     support. Affordable childcare can benefit the employment \n     rate, as it allows parents to be free to go to work. Access \n     to higher education is also essential in increasing the \n     employment rate, as more people will be able to obtain higher \n     paying jobs or start businesses that create jobs. Quality \n     public education, especially early childhood education, will \n     build a strong workforce as jobs are created. It is important \n     to acknowledge the small businesses that provide countless \n     jobs and to ensure that the government is giving these \n     businesses the support they need to sustain their existence.\n       Climate change is a pressing issue the world is now facing \n     and, as the United States, we need to lead the world in a \n     greener direction. Carbon dioxide emissions are growing \n     exponentially and are hurting our environment and our \n     people's health. We need to take meaningful steps to reduce \n     our carbon dioxide emissions and put our energy and resources \n     into renewable energy technologies. Not only will the \n     environment benefit, but we will benefit economically as the \n     prices of energy will be stable and affordable.\n       These goals may be difficult to achieve; however, the \n     result will benefit the country immensely and place us as a \n     world leader in many aspects. These issues must be addressed, \n     as they will improve the lives of every citizen and will \n     allow us to strengthen our union.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n       Rebecca Paige, South Royalton School, Grade 12 (Finalist)\n\n       The rising cost of a college education is becoming a \n     chronic problem for everyone. We want everyone to become a \n     well-educated, informed citizen, but are doing so at a steep \n     price. We are paying an exorbitant amount of money and are \n     being left with large amounts of debt.\n       For many families, having a high school senior in the \n     household brings mixed feelings towards college. There is the \n     excitement towards experiencing new things, but also the \n     concern for how they will be able to afford a college \n     education. The worries start right at the beginning, before \n     the senior is even accepted. Having just finished my college \n     application, I estimate that I paid about $600 for \n     application and testing fees. What do these fees do to help \n     with post-secondary education? Nothing. These fees are being \n     used as a gamble for the right to a college education. There \n     is nothing saying that the applicant will be guaranteed \n     admittance to college, only the chance of it. There should be \n     a movement passed that will eliminate all application, \n     testing, and other miscellaneous fees associated with the \n     application process, so students have a chance to apply to \n     the college they want without money to limit them in the \n     pursuit of a higher education.\n       Even once students have been accepted to a college or \n     university, the tuition should be lowered or subsidized by \n     the government. Pursuing education beyond high school serves \n     to help better society and, in turn, will help us out of the \n     unstable state in which we find ourselves. There are many \n     positive aspects about pursuing education beyond high school, \n     but they are being outweighed by the financial repercussions \n     of the decision to do so. This is not how the system should \n     be run. We should not have to cringe at the word college; we \n     should embrace it because of the plethora of opportunities \n     that it will provide us.\n       There seems to be a double standard in this country. We \n     want our citizens to pursue a higher education because the \n     country will reap the benefits, yet we still limit the post-\n     secondary education to those that can afford it and not let \n     everyone have the opportunity to a higher education. There \n     needs to be a change, if anything is going to move forward. \n     Therefore, let all fees be eliminated, let there be lower \n     tuition costs, and allow all people a chance for a college \n     education without having to sign over their life in order to \n     get one.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n Kendall Spaulding, Missisquoi Valley Union Middle, High School, Grade \n                             11 (Finalist)\n\n       ``Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the \n     courage to continue that counts,'' said Winston Churchill. \n     Churchill's quote links two controversial issues that our \n     country is now facing, education and unemployment. We have to \n     think about the people in our state and their futures. How \n     will they continue to succeed? If people want to continue \n     seeking jobs, they must go through a schooling process in \n     order for them to feel satisfied. We want to grow strong and \n     protect our views, so, taking control of our future will make \n     it stronger and brighter as a country. We have to start to \n     address these topics first, so they won't become a failure, \n     but a success for our country.\n       I believe education should be the government's biggest \n     concern because of what it can push our nation to accomplish. \n     We have to make the common core strong, so that students know \n     what to expect. We cannot just give up after a failure, we \n     have to be determined and think more about of our future. \n     Marion Brady, who is a classroom teacher, asked, ``What \n     knowledge is absolutely essential for every learner?'' His \n     question is what we think the curriculum should be to \n     everyone. I believe if any student is strong in a core of \n     truly essential skills, they can succeed in anything they \n     want in their future. I believe enforcing the common core \n     will help achieve our goals and lead to courageous decisions.\n       Building a successful education program will begin to \n     strengthen the unemployment rate in our country. I think \n     benefits being extended isn't the right solution because \n     there are so many opportunities to go towards to be \n     successful. If the government chooses to extend the benefits, \n     we would be spending billions of dollars in a short amount of \n     time, which would not help our economy. We have to think \n     about what's best for the individual, as well as the whole \n     country. It's best if we continue to persevere by going to a \n     job training facility to be more successful. Making no \n     extensions would lead people to create a successful life on \n     their own, gain confidence, and rely on only themselves. \n     Leading people to search for a job is in their own hands and \n     they need to have courage in order to succeed in life.\n       To conclude, our country has to continue to grow as a whole \n     in order to solve the controversial issues. Making successful \n     decisions can permanently change the way the country grows. \n     Also, creating a confident country leads to less room for \n     failure in the long run. Let's believe we can create a strong \n     common core plan for education and a non-extendable \n     unemployment plan. I believe it can be done, it just takes \n     time and hard work to get them. Let these two topics not be \n     an issue anymore and finally resolve them, so we all can grow \n     to our best.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n        Eric Tucker, Spaulding High School, Grade 11 (Finalist)\n\n       The year 2013 was a period of progress and setback. The \n     government was shut down for sixteen days, the unemployment \n     rate decreased to seven percent, the lowest unemployment rate \n     in five years, The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) was passed \n     with mixed initial success, and many other influential \n     achievements and failures occurred. A new year is here, and \n     now is the time to further develop 2013's successes and solve \n     its problems. The best way to turn 2014 into a year of \n     achievement is to unite Americans and Congress by offering \n     multiple solutions to common disagreements and by discovering \n     a series of common goals with the support of the entire \n     nation.\n       One of the catastrophically unsolved problems in 2013 was \n     the gap between Republicans and Democrats in America. The \n     government was shut down from October 1st to October 16th, \n     and it nearly defaulted on its bills during this harsh debt-\n     ceiling debate.\n\n[[Page S520]]\n\n     This could have been avoided, if multiple choices were \n     offered during these debates. For example, the main reason \n     the Republicans did not want to re-open the government is \n     they strongly opposed the Democratic principle of a \n     government-controlled health insurance system (ObamaCare). \n     One compromise, which could have solved this dilemma, is \n     making ObamaCare optional. This compromise never occurred \n     because the Democrats wanted ObamaCare nationalized with a \n     fine on those who did not enlist and the Republicans wanted \n     complete abolishment. Middle ground must be reached.\n       Further connecting Congress and America will also help \n     eliminate some of 2013's largest problems. Sometimes Congress \n     is split because each Congressperson is acting on behalf of \n     his or her voters. At other times, such as the government \n     shutdown, Republicans and Democrats disagree on the best ways \n     to solve a problem. If Congress and the White House listened \n     to the public more, then America can help its leaders tackle \n     America's most difficult problems. Utilize Facebook, utilize \n     Twitter, utilize easy, accessible websites and conduct \n     multiple surveys concerning many issues the country faces. \n     Have America decide if the debt ceiling should be raised; \n     have America decide if ObamaCare should be mandatory and \n     existent; have America become one of the mediators of public \n     dilemma. Stop having Republicans elect Republicans and \n     Democrats elect Democrats; have Americans elect Americans.\n       Unification and success can also be created through \n     generating nationally common goals. For example, the issue of \n     clean energy is a project being half-heartedly tackled by the \n     government. Turn 2014 into the year that the United States of \n     America leads the world to a greener Earth. Begin the \n     movement that creates 4.5 million jobs, stimulates the \n     economy, and eliminates 1.2 billion tons of carbon emissions \n     per year by 2030. This single goal can cause America to reap \n     the benefits of economic stimulation, energy-efficiency, and \n     national unification.\n       It is time for America to raise itself to new heights as a \n     truly united nation. Allowing the public to help its leaders \n     compromise and work on common goals will bring this country \n     together. Now is the time to unite the United States of \n     America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n   Madison Gilley, Mouth Abraham Union Middle, High School, Grade 9 \n                               (Finalist)\n\n       There are many factors that impact our environment. Air \n     pollution, deforestation, and climate change are just a few. \n     These specific problems are caused by humans. We have a \n     responsibility to our planet, ourselves, and to the other \n     species that live here with us. Senator Bernie Sanders should \n     take a stronger stance in protecting the environment because \n     it is important to the state and the world.\n       Air pollution has a vast effect on climate change and the \n     environment. In 2012 alone, the world produced 9.7 billion \n     metric tons of CO2 emissions (CO2Now). \n     All of the carbon emissions that go into the air cause \n     climate change because the atmosphere traps the \n     CO2, which causes all the extra heat. The air, in \n     many places, is not very clean because of air pollution and \n     smog. Some factories use green energy so they do not put out \n     as much pollution as other factories.\n       Deforestation, caused by logging, farming, mining, and \n     development is also another immense problem that needs to be \n     addressed. Rain forests are being cut down at an alarming \n     rate. These rainforests need to be protected. Madagascar has \n     lost 95% of its rainforests. Sumatra only has 15% of its \n     rainforests left. The Atlantic coast of Brazil has lost 90-\n     95% of its rainforest (Mongabay). Rainforests are important \n     because they provide a habitat for plants and animals, they \n     regulate our climate, they help to prevent soil erosion, and \n     they provide a home for indigenous people. Bernie Sanders \n     needs to help protect the forests not just in Vermont, but \n     all around the world.\n       Different environments around the world are in danger \n     because of climate change. One way that climate change is \n     caused is by carbon emissions. Air pollution causes climate \n     change because when the air is polluted by all the \n     CO2 that we are producing, it damages the ozone \n     layer. Climate change also affects forests which causes \n     damage to the animal population and their homes. The earth \n     isn't an unlimited supply; we need to use what we have \n     carefully and conscientiously.\n       Senator Bernie Sanders should take a stronger stance in \n     protecting the environment because climate change, \n     deforestation and air pollution are major problems damaging \n     our environment. These are all environmental issues that have \n     social and economic impacts. We only have one planet and we \n     need to use what we have carefully.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n     Kylee DiMaggio, Missisquoi Valley Union High School, Grade 11 \n                               (Finalist)\n\n       Barack Obama once said, ``Change will not come if we wait \n     for some other person or some other time. We are the ones \n     we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.'' The \n     American dream that many strive for is currently far out of \n     reach for most. Our current economy is in such a dire state \n     that some are even predicting another economic depression. \n     This economic issue is vital to our future as a nation and \n     impacts United States citizens directly. I also fear that if \n     this issue is not addressed before long the consequences may \n     be great. Fossil fuel usage (along with other things) have \n     aided in the increase of unemployment rates in the United \n     States and the poor economy. I believe that if the president \n     were to focus on the state of the economy many other issues \n     in the United States could be addressed as well.\n       Although I believe that many people blame the state of the \n     economy on an excess of government spending, a huge \n     expenditure of the government is in the subsidization of \n     fossil fuels. Not only are fossil fuels harmful to the \n     environment, but they are extremely costly. With the current \n     economy, many citizens struggle to afford the prices of this \n     resource. Furthermore, the large amount of dependence on \n     fossil fuels leaves this resource an unreachable necessity. \n     It is vital for the president to search for an alternative \n     resource because fossil fuels are currently too costly for \n     average citizens to afford. The president should be focused \n     on finding an alternative resource for fossil fuels to \n     decrease government spending and, in turn, improve the \n     economy.\n       As a result of a poor economy, citizens are finding it hard \n     to live comfortably and fulfill their ideas of the American \n     dream. Government spending reduces the amount of money the \n     government is able or willing to provide to the unemployed. \n     Theodore Roosevelt said, ``Behind the ostensible government \n     sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance \n     and acknowledging no responsibility to the people.'' In \n     saying this, Roosevelt infers that the president is not to \n     blame, it is the politicians below him that do not allow him \n     to make change. I believe that the government as a whole \n     should be concerned with the outcome of such a poor economy. \n     For example, jobs are extremely limited, leaving unemployment \n     rates higher than the United States have seen in years. The \n     unemployed are finding it hard to live comfortably on the \n     current unemployment benefits. Therefore, the government, as \n     a whole, should be focused on extending unemployment benefits \n     to those in need. Citizens are suffering because of the poor \n     economy and the government needs to take action to avoid \n     this.\n       The United States economy must improve the state of our \n     union. Government spending must also decrease to make room \n     for citizens in need of assistance. Without government \n     assistance the citizens turn against their government and \n     grow unhappy. The United States should focus on decreasing \n     government spending to improve the economy because without a \n     stable economy, citizens suffer and the state of the union \n     crumbles.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n        Trevor McNaney, Milton High School, Grade 12 (Finalist)\n\n       Amidst not only our challenges in the past year, but in our \n     progress as well, we as a nation have proved our unity and \n     strength. We have confronted issues, such as gun control and \n     gay marriage and have worked hard to figure out how to best \n     deal with issues like these. We have proved ourselves as \n     pioneers; we have explored the wonders of space and have \n     developed amazing technologies new to the world. I ask the \n     American people, with their strength and their unity, to \n     confront an entirely different issue. One that is so \n     intertwined with our lives and society, yet one that is so \n     ignored. I ask the people to confront a world issue. Today, I \n     ask that each and every individual of this nation to consider \n     the impacts that our society has on the environment.\n       We as a nation have come to understand that in order to \n     prosper, we need to work, produce, and consume with our \n     earnings. Companies produce goods that are meant to be broken \n     and thrown away so that consumers will simply buy more of \n     their product. I argue that we are smarter. A society that \n     values monetary gain at the demise and destruction of the \n     environment is one that will not last. Without a healthy \n     environment, we cannot have a healthy society. We are too \n     scared to look at the destruction and pollution that we are \n     causing as a society and as a global economic system. I ask \n     what is more fearful, deciding to make progress today or \n     ignoring the issues of tomorrow? Ignoring until there are no \n     longer any issues to worry about, until the Earth itself has \n     perished along with its inhabitants. Now is our gateway and \n     foundation to the future. We must change the way we live in \n     order to live.\n       The exciting possibility is that we can change. We hold \n     more knowledge and resources than we ever have before. \n     America, it is time that we put the environment first. It is \n     time that we alter the way that we view and interact with the \n     world around us. By 2026, every home needs a solar panel and \n     seventy percent of the buildings we use need to use gray \n     water. And by 2030, seventy-five percent of the \n     transportation industry needs to use bio-fuels. By 2035, \n     seventy percent of vehicles need to be electric and seventy \n     percent of America needs to be powered by clean renewable \n     energy and resources. Dismiss the idea that it cannot be \n     done, that we as a society and the world cannot solve the \n     problems that we have created. And most of all, dismiss the \n     notion that ''it is not your problem.'' The problems are \n     here, they are real, and they are now. This world is our \n     home, let's treat it like one.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n        Emil Koenig, Vermont Commons School, Grade 12 (Finalist)\n\n       This past year has posed many serious national security and \n     foreign policy challenges for the United States. The nation \n     encountered various issues like the Edward Snowden's NSA \n     leaks, chemical weapons uses in the Syrian civil war, and a \n     government closing. While all of these issues are\n\n[[Page S521]]\n\n     significant and have captured the headlines of the news \n     media, we must also keep in mind the small issues that can \n     potentially transform into global conflicts.\n       Currently, for example, one of the seemingly more exotic \n     issues threatening world peace involves the disputed Diaoyu \n     (or Senkaku) Islands in the South China Sea. Although these \n     barren rocks might seem truly worthless, as they are \n     uninhabited and lack natural resources, this fact did not \n     stop China, Japan or South Korea from staking conflicting \n     claims and angrily criticizing each other, escalating a small \n     territorial issue into a potentially larger crisis. While \n     China flaunts its growing dominance in the region, the South \n     Koreans and Japanese reject Beijing's territorial claims.\n       In my conversations with various Chinese people during my \n     last year studying abroad in Beijing, most people strongly \n     sided with their government's territorial claims. In almost \n     the same breath, they catalogued a long list of grievances \n     from the turbulent history of Sino-Japanese relations. Many \n     still vividly recalled earlier atrocities, such as the ``Rape \n     of Nanjing,'' When Japanese troops stormed Nanjing, raping \n     women and burying people alive.\n       Chinese authorities play on these popular fears, \n     disseminating propaganda that blames Japan for countless \n     issues. Debates about truly useless ocean rocks, therefore, \n     become conflated with deeply felt passions from the past, \n     which is why it is important to understand the cultural and \n     historical backgrounds of various conflicts in order to \n     resolve them.\n       Because the situation now brewing in the South China Sea \n     stems from deeply felt cultural and historical origins, the \n     situation is extremely volatile. When the United States flew \n     two bombers over the islands to demonstrate close ties with \n     Japan, we may have raised the level of tension to a still \n     higher level. Following the flights by our bombers, the \n     Chinese, the Japanese, and the Koreans all sent planes to fly \n     over the islands, to demonstrate their respective ownership \n     claims over of the islands.\n       As a nation, if we want to avoid potential wars, the \n     government should consider more peaceful options, such as \n     encouraging negotiations, before sending in war planes. The \n     government must practice more diplomatic conversations with \n     Chinese, Japanese and Korean partners in order to reduce the \n     likelihood of war. Flying war planes over disputed islands \n     never solves issues; it mainly risks causing more tensions.\n       In sum, to avoid international incidents, the United States \n     must practice a more responsible system of foreign policy. \n     The tension of the East Asian region is only one example of \n     when America used force prior to engaging in other forms of \n     international communication. Instead, the US government must \n     assess historical and cultural backgrounds of various \n     conflicts and first try to resolve them through peaceful \n     means, rather than skyrocket the likelihood of starting wars.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\nAbigail Morris, Champlain Valley Union High School, Grade 11 (Finalist)\n\n       Many United States issues have been the subject of \n     attention from the media, citizens and officials. However, in \n     my opinion the environmental issues in the US have not had \n     their share of the spotlight. Small measures, whether \n     involving policy or simple publicity, could change the US \n     environment for the better. One of these measures is \n     increased regulation of the fracking industry.\n       Hydraulic fracturing or ``fracking'' is the process of \n     gathering oil by forcing highly pressurized fluid into oil or \n     gas formations, so that the oil or gas flows to the surface. \n     The use of fracking has jumped to 25% of oil production, up \n     from 1% in 2000. It has spurred hopes of an energy \n     independent United States, but there are many drawbacks, \n     especially where the environment is concerned. Fracking \n     endangers plants, livestock, and most importantly, human \n     beings. Refusal or reluctance to crack down on the fracking \n     industry could seriously harm the health of the United States \n     and its people. We must not let ourselves be lured by the \n     economic benefits of fracking, and instead must examine it \n     closely to determine if energy independence is worth the \n     risk.\n       Of the 750 chemicals that can be used in fracking fluid, 29 \n     are carcinogens. In Wyoming, Pennsylvania and other states, \n     these chemicals have contaminated drinking water in \n     residential areas. If there is no way to change the chemical \n     makeup of fracking fluid or illegalize fracking completely, \n     making sure the fracking industry is subject to strict \n     regulation is the next best course of action.\n       Progress is being made, however. The FRAC (Fracturing \n     Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals) Act was introduced \n     in 2011, which shows that the issue has caught the attention \n     of Congress. However, both the House and Senate versions have \n     yet to be passed. These bills need to be brought back to the \n     attention of Congress, because as long as the fracking \n     industry is not subject to the same regulation as every \n     other, the natural environment and citizens of the United \n     States will continue to be at risk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/28/senate-section/article/S521-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S521-S526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON THE STATE OF THE UNION DELIVERED TO A JOINT SESSION OF \n                  CONGRESS ON JANUARY 28, 2014--PM 27\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was ordered to lie on the table:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow \nAmericans:\n  Today in America, a teacher spent extra time with a student who \nneeded it, and did her part to lift America's graduation rate to its \nhighest level in more than three decades.\n  An entrepreneur flipped on the lights in her tech startup, and did \nher part to add to the more than eight million new jobs our businesses \nhave created over the past 4 years.\n  An autoworker fine-tuned some of the best, most fuel-efficient cars \nin the world, and did his part to help America wean itself off foreign \noil.\n  A farmer prepared for the spring after the strongest five-year \nstretch of farm exports in our history. A rural doctor gave a young \nchild the first prescription to treat asthma that his mother could \nafford. A man took the bus home from the graveyard shift, bone-tired \nbut dreaming big dreams for his son. And in tight-knit communities \nacross America, fathers and mothers will tuck in their kids, put an arm \naround their spouse, remember fallen comrades, and give thanks for \nbeing home from a war that, after 12 long years, is finally coming to \nan end.\n  Tonight, this chamber speaks with one voice to the people we \nrepresent: it is you, our citizens, who make the state of our Union \nstrong.\n  Here are the results of your efforts: The lowest unemployment rate in \nover 5 years. A rebounding housing market. A manufacturing sector \nthat's adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s. More oil \nproduced at home than we buy from the rest of the world--the first time \nthat's happened in nearly 20 years. Our deficits--cut by more than \nhalf. And for the first time in over a decade, business leaders around \nthe world have declared that China is no longer the world's number one \nplace to invest; America is.\n  That's why I believe this can be a breakthrough year for America. \nAfter 5 years of grit and determined effort, the United States is \nbetter-positioned for the 21st century than any other nation on Earth.\n  The question for everyone in this chamber, running through every \ndecision we make this year, is whether we are going to help or hinder \nthis progress. For several years now, this town has been consumed by a \nrancorous argument over the proper size of the Federal Government. It's \nan important debate--one that dates back to our very founding. But when \nthat debate prevents us from carrying out even the most basic functions \nof our democracy--when our differences shut down government or threaten \nthe full faith and credit of the United States--then we are not doing \nright by the American people.\n  As President, I'm committed to making Washington work better, and \nrebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here. I believe most of \nyou are, too. Last month, thanks to the work of Democrats and \nRepublicans, this Congress finally produced a budget that undoes some \nof last year's severe cuts to priorities like education. Nobody got \neverything they wanted, and we can still do more to invest in this \ncountry's future while bringing down our deficit in a balanced way. But \nthe budget compromise should leave us freer to focus on creating new \njobs, not creating new crises.\n  In the coming months, let's see where else we can make progress \ntogether. Let's make this a year of action. That's what most Americans \nwant--for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives, their \nhopes, their aspirations. And what I believe unites the people of this \nNation, regardless of race or region or party, young or old, rich or \npoor, is the simple, profound belief in opportunity for all--the notion \nthat if you work hard and take responsibility, you can get ahead.\n  Let's face it: that belief has suffered some serious blows. Over more \nthan three decades, even before the Great Recession hit, massive shifts \nin technology and global competition had eliminated a lot of good, \nmiddle-class jobs, and weakened the economic foundations that families \ndepend on.\n\n[[Page S522]]\n\n  Today, after 4 years of economic growth, corporate profits and stock \nprices have rarely been higher, and those at the top have never done \nbetter. But average wages have barely budged. Inequality has deepened. \nUpward mobility has stalled. The cold, hard fact is that even in the \nmidst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just \nto get by--let alone get ahead. And too many still aren't working at \nall.\n  Our job is to reverse these trends. It won't happen right away, and \nwe won't agree on everything. But what I offer tonight is a set of \nconcrete, practical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle \nclass, and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class. Some \nrequire Congressional action, and I'm eager to work with all of you. \nBut America does not stand still--and neither will I. So wherever and \nwhenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for \nmore American families, that's what I'm going to do.\n  As usual, our First Lady sets a good example. Michelle's Let's Move \npartnership with schools, businesses, and local leaders has helped \nbring down childhood obesity rates for the first time in 30 years--an \nachievement that will improve lives and reduce health care costs for \ndecades to come. The Joining Forces alliance that Michelle and Jill \nBiden launched has already encouraged employers to hire or train nearly \n400,000 veterans and military spouses. Taking a page from that \nplaybook, the White House just organized a College Opportunity Summit \nwhere already, 150 universities, businesses, and nonprofits have made \nconcrete commitments to reduce inequality in access to higher \neducation--and help every hardworking kid go to college and succeed \nwhen they get to campus. Across the country, we're partnering with \nmayors, governors, and state legislatures on issues from homelessness \nto marriage equality.\n  The point is, there are millions of Americans outside Washington who \nare tired of stale political arguments, and are moving this country \nforward. They believe, and I believe, that here in America, our success \nshould depend not on accident of birth, but the strength of our work \nethic and the scope of our dreams. That's what drew our forebears here. \nIt's how the daughter of a factory worker is CEO of America's largest \nautomaker; how the son of a barkeeper is Speaker of the House; how the \nson of a single mom can be President of the greatest nation on Earth. \nOpportunity is who we are. And the defining project of our generation \nis to restore that promise.\n  We know where to start: the best measure of opportunity is access to \na good job. With the economy picking up speed, companies say they \nintend to hire more people this year. And over half of big \nmanufacturers say they're thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad.\n  So let's make that decision easier for more companies. Both Democrats \nand Republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful, \ncomplicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here, and reward \ncompanies that keep profits abroad. Let's flip that equation. Let's \nwork together to close those loopholes, end those incentives to ship \njobs overseas, and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs here \nat home.\n  Moreover, we can take the money we save with this transition to tax \nreform to create jobs rebuilding our roads, upgrading our ports, \nunclogging our commutes--because in today's global economy, first-class \njobs gravitate to first-class infrastructure. We'll need Congress to \nprotect more than three million jobs by finishing transportation and \nwaterways bills this summer. But I will act on my own to slash \nbureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects, so \nwe can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible.\n  We also have the chance, right now, to beat other countries in the \nrace for the next wave of high-tech manufacturing jobs. My \nAdministration has launched two hubs for high-tech manufacturing in \nRaleigh and Youngstown, where we've connected businesses to research \nuniversities that can help America lead the world in advanced \ntechnologies. Tonight, I'm announcing we'll launch six more this year. \nBipartisan bills in both houses could double the number of these hubs \nand the jobs they create. So get those bills to my desk and put more \nAmericans back to work.\n  Let's do more to help the entrepreneurs and small business owners who \ncreate most new jobs in America. Over the past 5 years, my \nAdministration has made more loans to small business owners than any \nother. And when 98% of our exporters are small businesses, new trade \npartnerships with Europe and the Asia-Pacific will help them create \nmore jobs. We need to work together on tools like bipartisan trade \npromotion authority to protect our workers, protect our environment, \nand open new markets to new goods stamped ``Made in the USA.'' China \nand Europe aren't standing on the sidelines. Neither should we.\n  We know that the nation that goes all-in on innovation today will own \nthe global economy tomorrow. This is an edge America cannot surrender. \nFederally-funded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions \nbehind Google and smartphones. That's why Congress should undo the \ndamage done by last year's cuts to basic research so we can unleash the \nnext great American discovery--whether it's vaccines that stay ahead of \ndrug-resistant bacteria, or paper-thin material that's stronger than \nsteel. And let's pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses \nto stay focused on innovation, not costly, needless litigation.\n\n  Now, one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our \ncommitment to American energy. The all-of-the-above energy strategy I \nannounced a few years ago is working, and today, America is closer to \nenergy independence than we've been in decades.\n  One of the reasons why is natural gas--if extracted safely, it's the \nbridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon \npollution that causes climate change. Businesses plan to invest almost \n$100 billion in new factories that use natural gas. I'll cut red tape \nto help States get those factories built, and this Congress can help by \nputting people to work building fueling stations that shift more cars \nand trucks from foreign oil to American natural gas. My Administration \nwill keep working with the industry to sustain production and job \ngrowth while strengthening protection of our air, our water, and our \ncommunities. And while we're at it, I'll use my authority to protect \nmore of our pristine Federal lands for future generations.\n  It's not just oil and natural gas production that's booming; we're \nbecoming a global leader in solar, too. Every 4 minutes, another \nAmerican home or business goes solar; every panel pounded into place by \na worker whose job can't be outsourced. Let's continue that progress \nwith a smarter tax policy that stops giving $4 billion a year to fossil \nfuel industries that don't need it, so that we can invest more in fuels \nof the future that do.\n  And even as we've increased energy production, we've partnered with \nbusinesses, builders, and local communities to reduce the energy we \nconsume. When we rescued our automakers, for example, we worked with \nthem to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars. In the \ncoming months, I'll build on that success by setting new standards for \nour trucks, so we can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at \nthe pump.\n  Taken together, our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a \ncleaner, safer planet. Over the past 8 years, the United States has \nreduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth. \nBut we have to act with more urgency--because a changing climate is \nalready harming western communities struggling with drought, and \ncoastal cities dealing with floods. That's why I directed my \nAdministration to work with States, utilities, and others to set new \nstandards on the amount of carbon pollution our power plants are \nallowed to dump into the air. The shift to a cleaner energy economy \nwon't happen overnight, and it will require tough choices along the \nway. But the debate is settled. Climate change is a fact. And when our \nchildren's children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could \nto leave them a safer, more stable world, with new sources of energy, I \nwant us to be able to say yes, we did.\n  Finally, if we are serious about economic growth, it is time to heed \nthe call of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders, and law \nenforcement--\n\n[[Page S523]]\n\nand fix our broken immigration system. Republicans and Democrats in the \nSenate have acted. I know that members of both parties in the House \nwant to do the same. Independent economists say immigration reform will \ngrow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion in the \nnext two decades. And for good reason: When people come here to fulfill \ntheir dreams--to study, invent, and contribute to our culture--they \nmake our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and \ncreate jobs for everyone. So let's get immigration reform done this \nyear.\n  The ideas I've outlined so far can speed up growth and create more \njobs. But in this rapidly-changing economy, we have to make sure that \nevery American has the skills to fill those jobs.\n  The good news is, we know how to do it. Two years ago, as the auto \nindustry came roaring back, Andra Rush opened up a manufacturing firm \nin Detroit. She knew that Ford needed parts for the best-selling truck \nin America, and she knew how to make them. She just needed the \nworkforce. So she dialed up what we call an American Job Center--places \nwhere folks can walk in to get the help or training they need to find a \nnew job, or better job. She was flooded with new workers. And today, \nDetroit Manufacturing Systems has more than 700 employees.\n  What Andra and her employees experienced is how it should be for \nevery employer--and every job seeker. So tonight, I've asked Vice \nPresident Biden to lead an across-the-board reform of America's \ntraining programs to make sure they have one mission: Train Americans \nwith the skills employers need, and match them to good jobs that need \nto be filled right now. That means more on-the-job training, and more \napprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for \nlife. It means connecting companies to community colleges that can help \ndesign training to fill their specific needs. And if Congress wants to \nhelp, you can concentrate funding on proven programs that connect more \nready-to-work Americans with ready-to-be-filled jobs.\n  I'm also convinced we can help Americans return to the workforce \nfaster by reforming unemployment insurance so that it's more effective \nin today's economy. But first, this Congress needs to restore the \nunemployment insurance you just let expire for 1.6 million people.\n  Let me tell you why.\n  Misty DeMars is a mother of two young boys. She'd been steadily \nemployed since she was a teenager. She put herself through college. \nShe'd never collected unemployment benefits. In May, she and her \nhusband used their life savings to buy their first home. A week later, \nbudget cuts claimed the job she loved. Last month, when their \nunemployment insurance was cut off, she sat down and wrote me a \nletter--the kind I get every day. ``We are the face of the unemployment \ncrisis,'' she wrote. ``I am not dependent on the government. . . . Our \ncountry depends on people like us who build careers, contribute to \nsociety . . . care about our neighbors . . . I am confident that in \ntime I will find a job . . . I will pay my taxes, and we will raise our \nchildren in their own home in the community we love. Please give us \nthis chance.''\n  Congress, give these hardworking, responsible Americans that chance. \nThey need our help, but more important, this country needs them in the \ngame. That's why I've been asking CEOs to give more long-term \nunemployed workers a fair shot at that new job and new chance to \nsupport their families; this week, many will come to the White House to \nmake that commitment real. Tonight, I ask every business leader in \nAmerica to join us and to do the same--because we are stronger when \nAmerica fields a full team.\n  Of course, it's not enough to train today's workforce. We also have \nto prepare tomorrow's workforce, by guaranteeing every child access to \na world-class education.\n  Estiven Rodriguez couldn't speak a word of English when he moved to \nNew York City at age nine. But last month, thanks to the support of \ngreat teachers and an innovative tutoring program, he led a march of \nhis classmates--through a crowd of cheering parents and neighbors--from \ntheir high school to the post office, where they mailed off their \ncollege applications. And this son of a factory worker just found out \nhe's going to college this fall.\n  Five years ago, we set out to change the odds for all our kids. We \nworked with lenders to reform student loans, and today, more young \npeople are earning college degrees than ever before. Race to the Top, \nwith the help of governors from both parties, has helped States raise \nexpectations and performance. Teachers and principals in schools from \nTennessee to Washington, D.C. are making big strides in preparing \nstudents with skills for the new economy--problem solving, critical \nthinking, science, technology, engineering, and math. Some of this \nchange is hard. It requires everything from more challenging \ncurriculums and more demanding parents to better support for teachers \nand new ways to measure how well our kids think, not how well they can \nfill in a bubble on a test. But it's worth it--and it's working.\n  The problem is we're still not reaching enough kids, and we're not \nreaching them in time. That has to change.\n  Research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a \nchild's life is high-quality early education. Last year, I asked this \nCongress to help States make high-quality pre-K available to every \nfour-year-old. As a parent as well as a President, I repeat that \nrequest tonight. But in the meantime, 30 states have raised pre-K \nfunding on their own. They know we can't wait. So just as we worked \nwith States to reform our schools, this year, we'll invest in new \npartnerships with States and communities across the country in a race \nto the top for our youngest children. And as Congress decides what it's \ngoing to do, I'm going to pull together a coalition of elected \nofficials, business leaders, and philanthropists willing to help more \nkids access the high-quality pre-K they need.\n\n  Last year, I also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to \nhigh-speed broadband over the next 4 years. Tonight, I can announce \nthat with the support of the FCC and companies like Apple, Microsoft, \nSprint, and Verizon, we've got a down payment to start connecting more \nthan 15,000 schools and 20 million students over the next 2 years, \nwithout adding a dime to the deficit.\n  We're working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges \nand employers that offer the real-world education and hands-on training \nthat can lead directly to a job and career. We're shaking up our system \nof higher education to give parents more information, and colleges more \nincentives to offer better value, so that no middle-class kid is priced \nout of a college education. We're offering millions the opportunity to \ncap their monthly student loan payments to 10 percent of their income, \nand I want to work with Congress to see how we can help even more \nAmericans who feel trapped by student. loan debt. And I'm reaching out \nto some of America's leading foundations and corporations on a new \ninitiative to help more young men of color facing tough odds stay on \ntrack and reach their full potential.\n  The bottom line is, Michelle and I want every child to have the same \nchance this country gave us. But we know our opportunity agenda won't \nbe complete--and too many young people entering the workforce today \nwill see the American Dream as an empty promise--unless we do more to \nmake sure our economy honors the dignity of work, and hard work pays \noff for every single American.\n  Today, women make up about half our workforce. But they still make 77 \ncents for every dollar a man earns. That is wrong, and in 2014, it's an \nembarrassment. A woman deserves equal pay for equal work. She deserves \nto have a baby without sacrificing her job. A mother deserves a day off \nto care for a sick child or sick parent without running into hardship--\nand you know what, a father does, too. It's time to do away with \nworkplace policies that belong in a ``Mad Men'' episode. This year, \nlet's all come together--Congress, the White House, and businesses from \nWall Street to Main Street--to give every woman the opportunity she \ndeserves. Because I firmly believe when women succeed, America \nsucceeds.\n  Now, women hold a majority of lower-wage jobs--but they're not the \nonly ones stifled by stagnant wages. Americans understand that some \npeople will earn more than others, and we\n\n[[Page S524]]\n\ndon't resent those who, by virtue of their efforts, achieve incredible \nsuccess. But Americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who works full \ntime should ever have to raise a family in poverty.\n  In the year since I asked this Congress to raise the minimum wage, \nfive States have passed laws to raise theirs. Many businesses have done \nit on their own. Nick Chute is here tonight with his boss, John \nSoranno. John's an owner of Punch Pizza in Minneapolis, and Nick helps \nmake the dough. Only now he makes more of it: John just gave his \nemployees a raise, to ten bucks an hour--a decision that eased their \nfinancial stress and boosted their morale.\n  Tonight, I ask more of America's business leaders to follow John's \nlead and do what you can to raise your employees' wages. To every \nmayor, governor, and state legislator in America, I say, you don't have \nto wait for Congress to act; Americans will support you if you take \nthis on. And as a chief executive, I intend to lead by example. \nProfitable corporations like Costco see higher wages as the smart way \nto boost productivity and reduce turnover. We should too. In the coming \nweeks, I will issue an Executive Order requiring Federal contractors to \npay their federally-funded employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an \nhour--because if you cook our troops' meals or wash their dishes, you \nshouldn't have to live in poverty.\n  Of course, to reach millions more, Congress needs to get on board. \nToday, the Federal minimum wage is worth about 20 percent less than it \nwas when Ronald Reagan first stood here. Tom Harkin and George Miller \nhave a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to $10.10. This \nwill help families. It will give businesses customers with more money \nto spend. It doesn't involve any new bureaucratic program. So join the \nrest of the country. Say yes. Give America a raise.\n  There are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet, \nand few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families \npull themselves up through hard work than the Earned Income Tax Credit. \nRight now, it helps about half of all parents at some point. But I \nagree with Republicans like Senator Rubio that it doesn't do enough for \nsingle workers who don't have kids, So let's work together to \nstrengthen the credit, reward work, and help more Americans get ahead.\n  Let's do more to help Americans save for retirement. Today, most \nworkers don't have a pension. A Social Security check often isn't \nenough on its own. And while the stock market has doubled over the last \n5 years, that doesn't help folks who don't have 401Ks. That's why, \ntomorrow, I will direct the Treasury to create a new way for working \nAmericans to start their own retirement savings: MyRA. It's a new \nsavings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg. MyRA guarantees \na decent return with no risk of losing what you put in. And if this \nCongress wants to help, work with me to fix an upside-down tax code \nthat gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save, but does little to \nnothing for middle-class Americans. Offer every American access to an \nautomatic IRA on the job, so they can save at work just like everyone \nin this Chamber can. And since the most important investment many \nfamilies make is their home, send me legislation that protects \ntaxpayers from footing the bill for a housing crisis ever again, and \nkeeps the dream of homeownership alive for future generations of \nAmericans.\n  One last point on financial security. For decades, few things exposed \nhard-working families to economic hardship more than a broken health \ncare system. And in case you haven't heard, we're in the process of \nfixing that.\n  A pre-existing condition used to mean that someone like Amanda \nShelley, a physician assistant and single mom from Arizona, couldn't \nget health insurance. But on January 1st, she got covered. On January \n3rd, she felt a sharp pain. On January 6th, she had emergency surgery. \nJust one week earlier, Amanda said, that surgery would've meant \nbankruptcy.\n  That's what health insurance reform is all about--the peace of mind \nthat if misfortune strikes, you don't have to lose everything.\n  Already, because of the Affordable Care Act, more than 3 million \nAmericans under age 26 have gained coverage under their parents' plans.\n  More than nine million Americans have signed up for private health \ninsurance or Medicaid coverage.\n  And here's another number: zero. Because of this law, no American can \never again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition \nlike asthma, back pain, or cancer. No woman can ever be charged more \njust because she's a woman. And we did all this while adding years to \nMedicare's finances, keeping Medicare premiums flat, and lowering \nprescription costs for millions of seniors.\n  Now, I don't expect to convince my Republican friends on the merits \nof this law. But I know that the American people aren't interested in \nrefighting old battles. So again, if you have specific plans to cut \ncosts, cover more people, and increase choice--tell America what you'd \ndo differently. Let's see if the numbers add up. But let's not have \nanother forty-something votes to repeal a law that's already helping \nmillions of Americans like Amanda. The first forty were plenty. We got \nit. We all owe it to the American people to say what we're for, not \njust what we're against.\n  And if you want to know the real impact this law is having, just talk \nto Governor Steve Beshear of Kentucky, who's here tonight. Kentucky's \nnot the most liberal part of the country, but he's like a man possessed \nwhen it comes to covering his commonwealth's families. ``They are our \nfriends and neighbors,'' he said. ``They are people we shop and go to \nchurch with--farmers out on the tractors--grocery clerks--they are \npeople who go to work every morning praying they don't get sick. No one \ndeserves to live that way.''\n  Steve's right. That's why, tonight, I ask every American who knows \nsomeone without health insurance to help them get covered by March \n31st. Moms, get on your kids to sign up. Kids, call your mom and walk \nher through the application. It will give her some peace of mind--plus, \nshe'll appreciate hearing from you.\n  After all, that's the spirit that has always moved this Nation \nforward. It's the spirit of citizenship--the recognition that through \nhard work and responsibility, we can pursue our individual dreams, but \nstill come together as one American family to make sure the next \ngeneration can pursue its dreams as well.\n  Citizenship means standing up for everyone's right to vote. Last \nyear, part of the Voting Rights Act was weakened. But conservative \nRepublicans and liberal Democrats are working together to strengthen \nit; and the bipartisan commission I appointed last year has offered \nreforms so that no one has to wait more than a half hour to vote. Let's \nsupport these efforts. It should be the power of our vote, not the size \nof our bank account, that drives our democracy.\n  Citizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals \nfrom us each day. I have seen the courage of parents, students, \npastors, and police officers all over this country who say ``we are not \nafraid,'' and I intend to keep trying, with or without Congress, to \nhelp stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans in our movie \ntheaters, shopping malls, or schools like Sandy Hook.\n  Citizenship demands a sense of common cause; participation in the \nhard work of self-government; an obligation to serve to our \ncommunities. And I know this chamber agrees that few Americans give \nmore to their country than our diplomats and the men and women of the \nUnited States Armed Forces.\n  Tonight, because of the extraordinary troops and civilians who risk \nand lay down their lives to keep us free, the United States is more \nsecure. When I took office, nearly 180,000 Americans were serving in \nIraq and Afghanistan. Today, all our troops are out of Iraq. More than \n60,000 of our troops have already come home from Afghanistan. With \nAfghan forces now in the lead for their own security, our troops have \nmoved to a support role. Together with our allies, we will complete our \nmission there by the end of this year, and America's longest war will \nfinally be over.\n  After 2014, we will support a unified Afghanistan as it takes \nresponsibility\n\n[[Page S525]]\n\nfor its own future. If the Afghan government signs a security agreement \nthat we have negotiated, a small force of Americans could remain in \nAfghanistan with NATO allies to carry out two narrow missions: training \nand assisting Afghan forces, and counterterrorism operations to pursue \nany remnants of al Qaeda. For while our relationship with Afghanistan \nwill change, one thing will not: our resolve that terrorists do not \nlaunch attacks against our country.\n  The fact is, that danger remains. While we have put al Qaeda's core \nleadership on a path to defeat, the threat has evolved, as al Qaeda \naffiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the \nworld. In Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, and Mali, we have to keep working with \npartners to disrupt and disable these networks. In Syria, we'll support \nthe opposition that rejects the agenda of terrorist networks. Here at \nhome, we'll keep strengthening our defenses, and combat new threats \nlike cyberattacks. And as we reform our defense budget, we have to keep \nfaith with our men and women in uniform, and invest in the capabilities \nthey need to succeed in future missions.\n  We have to remain vigilant. But I strongly believe our leadership and \nour security cannot depend on our military alone. As Commander in \nChief, I have used force when needed to protect the American people, \nand I will never hesitate to do so as long as I hold this office. But I \nwill not send our troops into harm's way unless it's truly necessary; \nnor will I allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open-ended \nconflicts. We must fight the battles that need to be fought, not those \nthat terrorists prefer from us--large-scale deployments that drain our \nstrength and may ultimately feed extremism.\n  So, even as we aggressively pursue terrorist networks--through more \ntargeted efforts and by building the capacity of our foreign partners--\nAmerica must move off a permanent war footing. That's why I've imposed \nprudent limits on the use of drones--for we will not be safer if people \nabroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the \nconsequence. That's why, working with this Congress, I will reform our \nsurveillance programs--because the vital work of our intelligence \ncommunity depends on public confidence, here and abroad, that the \nprivacy of ordinary people is not being violated. And with the Afghan \nwar ending, this needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining \nrestrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at \nGuantanamo Bay--because we counter terrorism not just through \nintelligence and military action, but by remaining true to our \nConstitutional ideals, and setting an example for the rest of the \nworld.\n  You see, in a world of complex threats, our security and leadership \ndepends on all elements of our power--including strong and principled \ndiplomacy. American diplomacy has rallied more than 50 countries to \nprevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands, and \nallowed us to reduce our own reliance on Cold War stockpiles. American \ndiplomacy, backed by the threat of force, is why Syria's chemical \nweapons are being eliminated, and we will continue to work with the \ninternational community to usher in the future the Syrian people \ndeserve--a future free of dictatorship, terror and fear. As we speak, \nAmerican diplomacy is supporting Israelis and Palestinians as they \nengage in difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there; to \nachieve dignity and an independent state for Palestinians, and lasting \npeace and security for the State of Israel--a Jewish state that knows \nAmerica will always be at their side.\n  And it is American diplomacy, backed by pressure, that has halted the \nprogress of Iran's nuclear program--and rolled parts of that program \nback--for the very first time in a decade. As we gather here tonight, \nIran has begun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched \nuranium. It is not installing advanced centrifuges. Unprecedented \ninspections help the world verify, every day, that Iran is not building \na bomb. And with our allies and partners, we're engaged in negotiations \nto see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share: preventing \nIran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n  These negotiations will be difficult. They may not succeed. We are \nclear-eyed about Iran's support for terrorist organizations like \nHezbollah, which threaten our allies; and the mistrust between our \nnations cannot be wished away. But these negotiations do not rely on \ntrust; any long-term deal we agree to must be based on verifiable \naction that convinces us and the international community that Iran is \nnot building a nuclear bomb. It John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan could \nnegotiate with the Soviet Union, then surely a strong and confident \nAmerica can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today.\n  The sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity \npossible. But let me be clear: if this Congress sends me a new \nsanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks, I will veto \nit. For the sake of our national security, we must give diplomacy a \nchance to succeed. If Iran's leaders do not seize this opportunity, \nthen I will be the first to call for more sanctions, and stand ready to \nexercise all options to make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon. \nBut if Iran's leaders do seize the chance, then Iran could take an \nimportant step to rejoin the community of nations, and we will have \nresolved one of the leading security challenges of our time without the \nrisks of war.\n  Finally, let's remember that our leadership is defined not just by \nour defense against threats, but by the enormous opportunities to do \ngood and promote understanding around the globe--to forge greater \ncooperation, to expand new markets, to free people from fear and want. \nAnd no one is better positioned to take advantage of those \nopportunities than America.\n  Our alliance with Europe remains the strongest the world has ever \nknown. From Tunisia to Burma, we're supporting those who are willing to \ndo the hard work of building democracy. In Ukraine, we stand for the \nprinciple that all people have the right to express themselves freely \nand peacefully, and have a say in their country's future. Across \nAfrica, we're bringing together businesses and governments to double \naccess to electricity and help end extreme poverty. In the Americas, we \nare building new ties of commerce, but we're also expanding cultural \nand educational exchanges among young people. And we will continue to \nfocus on the Asia-Pacific, where we support our allies, shape a future \nof greater security and prosperity, and extend a hand to those \ndevastated by disaster--as we did in the Philippines, when our Marines \nand civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon, and were \ngreeted with words like, ``We will never forget your kindness'' and \n``God bless America!''\n  We do these things because they help promote our long-term security. \nAnd we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality \nof every human being, regardless of race or religion, creed or sexual \norientation. And next week, the world will see one expression of that \ncommitment--when Team USA marches the red, white, and blue into the \nOlympic Stadium--and brings home the gold.\n  My fellow Americans, no other country in the world does what we do. \nOn every issue, the world turns to us, not simply because of the size \nof our economy or our military might--but because of the ideals we \nstand for, and the burdens we bear to advance them.\n  No one knows this better than those who serve in uniform. As this \ntime of war draws to a close, a new generation of heroes returns to \ncivilian life. We'll keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive \nthe benefits they've earned, and our wounded warriors receive the \nhealth care--including the mental health care--that they need. We'll \nkeep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and \nleadership into jobs here at home. And we all continue to join forces \nto honor and support our remarkable military families.\n  Let me tell you about one of those families I've come to know.\n  I first met Cory Remsburg, a proud Army Ranger, at Omaha Beach on the \n65th anniversary of D-Day. Along with some of his fellow Rangers, he \nwalked me through the program--a strong, impressive young man, with an \neasy manner, sharp as a tack. We joked around, and took pictures, and \nT. told him to stay in touch.\n  A few months later, on his tenth deployment, Cory was nearly killed \nby a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan.\n\n[[Page S526]]\n\nHis comrades found him in a canal, face down, underwater, shrapnel in \nhis brain.\n  For months, he lay in a coma. The next time I met him, in the \nhospital, he couldn't speak; he could barely move. Over the years, he's \nendured dozens of surgeries and procedures, and hours of grueling rehab \nevery day.\n  Even now, Cory is still blind in one eye. He still struggles on his \nleft side. But slowly, steadily, with the support of caregivers like \nhis dad Craig, and the community around him, Cory has grown stronger. \nDay by day, he's learned to speak again and stand again and walk \nagain--and he's working toward the day when he can serve his country \nagain.\n  ``My recovery has not been easy,'' he says. ``Nothing in life that's \nworth anything is easy.''\n  Cory is here tonight. And like the Army he loves, like the America he \nserves, Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg never gives up, and he does \nnot quit.\n  My fellow Americans, men and women like Cory remind us that America \nhas never come easy. Our freedom, our democracy, has never been easy. \nSometimes we stumble; we make mistakes; we get frustrated or \ndiscouraged. But for more than 200 years, we have put those things \naside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress--to \ncreate and build and expand the possibilities of individual \nachievement; to free other nations from tyranny and fear; to promote \njustice, and fairness, and equality under the law, so that the words \nset to paper by our founders are made real for every citizen. The \nAmerica we want for our kids--a rising America where honest work is \nplentiful and communities are strong; where prosperity is widely shared \nand opportunity for all lets us go as far as our dreams and toil will \ntake us--none of it is easy. But if we work together; if we summon what \nis best in us, with our feet planted firmly in today but our eyes cast \ntowards tomorrow--I know it's within our reach.\n  Believe it.\n  God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, January 28, 2014.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/28/senate-section/article/S526-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:08 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1684.
