Mr. President, law enforcement officials who made the \narrests and looked at this called it a ``modern day plantation.'' What \nhappened was a string of very profitable convenience stores had \nundocumented immigrants from Pakistan and the Philippines routinely \nworking up to 100 hours a week for below minimum wage. And although \ntheir employers made $180 million over a dozen years, while pocketing \nmuch of their employees' wages, these workers lived packed into \napartments unfit for human habitation. Because they lacked the proper \nimmigration paperwork, the workers were simply too afraid to speak up \nfor themselves.\n  It happens all the time. These were the circumstances at more than a \ndozen 7-Eleven stores in Long Island, NY, and in Virginia. They were \nraided last week by Federal immigration officials. The unfortunate \nconditions exposed by this high-profile bust, however, are all too \ncommon. The busts do not come very often. They were able to get to the \nbottom of this. Most of the time these people are so abused and nothing \nhappens except the abuse continues.\n  More than one-half of undocumented day laborers say they have been \ncheated by employers. One-quarter of undocumented workers polled in New \nJersey say they have been assaulted by their employers, a crime they \nrarely report. A lot of times there are language barriers, and they are \nsimply afraid they are going to lose their jobs and maybe be deported.\n  In one survey virtually every undocumented female farm worker said \nsexual violence in the workplace is a very serious problem. The 11 \nmillion people living in America without the proper documentation are \nparticularly vulnerable to abuse by these employers who are very \nunscrupulous.\n  A system under which people can be forced to live as indentured \nservants, under substandard living conditions and the threat of \nviolence hurts all workers, and it is wrong. It is immoral. The \nbipartisan immigration bill before the Senate will eliminate the kind \nof exploitation seen at these rogue 7-Eleven stores and other dishonest \nemployers in a number of ways.\n  First, it will reduce illegal immigration by strengthening our \nborders and fixing our broken legal immigration system. We all \nacknowledged before going into this debate that our system was broken \nand needed to be fixed. That is what this bill does. The bill will also \nmake the electronic employment verification system, known as E-Verify, \nmandatory within 5 years. That will make it virtually impossible for \npeople without the proper immigration paperwork to secure jobs, \nremoving the incentive to come here illegally and removing the \nincentive from these unscrupulous employers taking advantage of those \npeople.\n\n[[Page S5104]]\n\n  The legislation will allow temporary workers to change jobs without \nlosing their visas, making it possible for them to escape and report \nexploitative employers without fear of deportation. They have not been \nable to do that. They will not until we pass this legislation.\n  This measure also offers more visas for victims of crime, including \nemployer abuse. These protections will be good for honest workers, \nhelping them stand up for their rights without fear of retribution. It \nwill be good for honest employers, whose unscrupulous competitors have \nan unfair advantage.\n  This legislation also recognizes that undocumented workers play an \nimportant role in our economy and need an earned pathway from the \nshadows to citizenship. The path will not be easy; it was not intended \nto be. Undocumented people will have to go to the back of the line, pay \npenalties and fines, work, pay taxes, learn English, and stay out of \ntrouble.\n\n  The alternative, to deport 11 million people, is impractical, \ninhumane, and just plain wrong for our economy. Helping millions of \nimmigrants get right with the law will boost our national economy by \nmore than $800 billion over the next 10 years, and it will reduce the \ndeficit by almost $1 trillion over the next two decades--a pretty good \ndeal.\n  Last night's strong bipartisan vote on the Corker-Hoeven border \nsecurity compromise was a huge step forward for this legislation. \nOpponents of immigration reform can no longer hide behind false \nconcerns about border security. That is an understatement. There can be \nany excuse to oppose immigration reform. If it is, it is transparently \nobvious that they are just trying to figure out a way to vote against \nthis legislation.\n  I hope those who have stood in the way of this legislation will \ninstead join us to do what is right for our economy and humane for \nimmigrant families. It is time to crack down on crooked employers--that \nis what they are--who exploit and abuse undocumented immigrants. It is \ntime to give hope to 11 million immigrants who want nothing more than \nto become citizens of a place they call home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/25/senate-section/article/S5104-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in advance of the President's big \nspeech today, I read this morning that one of the White House climate \nadvisers finally admitted something most of us have suspected all \nalong. He said, ``A war on coal is exactly what is needed.''\n  A war on coal is exactly what is needed. That is one of the \nPresident's advisers. It is an astonishing bit of honesty from someone \nthat close to the White House, but it really encapsulates the attitude \nthis administration holds in regard to States such as mine where coal \nis such an important part of the economic well being of so many middle-\nclass families. It captures the attitude it holds with regard to \nmiddle-class Americans all across the country, where affordable energy \nis critical to the operation of so many companies and small businesses, \nand to the ability of those businesses to hire Americans and help build \na ladder to the middle class for their families.\n  Declaring a war on coal is tantamount to declaring a war on jobs. It \nis tantamount to kicking the ladder out from beneath the feet of many \nAmericans struggling in today's economy. I will be raising this issue \nwith the President at the White House later today.\n  One of the sectors the President's war on jobs would hit is \nmanufacturing. Ironic, perhaps, because just a few months ago it was \nPresident Obama himself who said:\n\n       I believe in manufacturing. I think it makes our country \n     stronger.\n\n  Well, of course, that is correct. Manufacturing does make our country \nstronger. Just look at Kentucky. We are the first in the Nation in \naluminum smelting. We are third in production of auto parts. \nKentuckians know these types of businesses strengthen not just the \nBluegrass State but our entire Nation. They provide well-paying jobs, \neconomic growth, and tickets to prosperity for workers and their \nfamilies. Yet in the global economy of the 21st century, retaining, \nmuch less expanding, our manufacturing core has never been more \nchallenging than it is now.\n  We face relentless competition from all corners of the globe, so \npolicymakers have to be careful about the types of policies they enact. \nObviously, American success in this hypercompetitive world is \nstrengthened when we keep taxes low and regulations smart. Perhaps most \nimportant, it is strengthened when we ensure energy is abundant and \naffordable.\n  These are energy-intensive industries, after all. If the White House \nmoves forward with this war on jobs and raises the cost of energy, that \nwould almost assuredly raise the cost of doing business. That would \nlikely put jobs, growth, and the future of American manufacturing at \nrisk. That is one of the many reasons Americans rejected the \nPresident's attempt to impose a national energy tax in his first term.\n  Even with overwhelming majorities in Congress, including a \nfilibuster-proof, 60-vote majority in the Senate, Washington Democrats \nwere unable to pass the President's energy tax. In the Senate, the \nDemocratic majority would not even bring it up for a vote. Think about \nthat. They could have pushed it through on their own without a single \nRepublican vote, and yet they could not.\n  Why? Well, for one, the constituents we serve are a lot smarter than \nsome in Washington might like to believe. They know we cannot impose a \nnational energy tax without cutting jobs and significantly raising \nenergy costs not just on their families, but also on their employers.\n  The data seems to bear out such concerns. I remember some projections \nshowing that by 2030, the Waxman-Markey proposal could have decreased \nthe size of our economy by about $350 billion and reduced net \nemployment by 2.5 million jobs, even after taking job creation into \naccount.\n  So Americans made their opposition to this tax abundantly clear to \nMembers of Congress. In the 2010 midterm elections, they ousted a good \nnumber of those who voted for it in the House. Because of concerns \nabout job losses, higher utility bills, and reduced competitiveness, \nCongress is even less inclined today to vote for an energy tax than \nwhen the President commanded such massive majorities in the first part \nof his first term.\n  It is fairly self-evident to say there is no majority for such an \nidea in the 113th Congress. The President shall also push ahead and \nignore the will of the legislative branch, the branch closest to the \nAmerican people. Whether they want it or not, he says he will do it by \nPresidential fiat.\n  I am sure we will find out more details in his speech today. If I am \nright, and I think I am, he is going to lay out a plan to do what he \nwants to do through executive action--in other words, more czars, more \nunaccountable bureaucrats.\n  The message this sends should worry anyone who cares about \nconstitutional self-government, that the President can simply ignore \nthe will of the representatives sent here by the people because he \nwants to, because special interests are lobbying him, and because he \nwants to appease some far-left segment of his base.\n  What I am saying is he cannot declare a war on jobs and \nsimultaneously claim to care about manufacturing. He cannot claim to \ncare about States such as mine where an energy tax would do great \ndamage to countless Americans employed in energy sectors such as coal.\n  Wages are already failing to keep pace with rising costs for many \npeople. Many families have seen their real median income actually \ndecline in recent years. A survey released yesterday shows that three-\nquarters of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. This is the \nreality of the Obama economy. Even in the best of times, imposing an \nenergy tax would be a bad idea. In an era of unacceptably high \nunemployment, an era where Americans are finally desperate to focus on \ngrowing the middle class rather than throwing scraps to his wealthy \nsupporters, ideas such as this border on absurdly self-defeating.\n\n[[Page S5105]]\n\n  He may as well call his plan what it is, a plan to shift jobs \noverseas. Basically, it is unilateral economic surrender. To what end? \nMany experts agree a climate policy that does not include massive \nenergy consumers such as China and India is essentially meaningless. \nThe damage to our economy would be anything but meaningless. \nIronically, those are the very types of countries that stand to benefit \neconomically from our loss. Nations such as these will probably take \nour jobs, keep pumping more and more carbon into the air, and what will \nwe have to show for it? That is a question the President needs to \nanswer today.\n  Americans want commonsense policies to make energy cleaner and more \naffordable. The operative word is commonsense, because Americans are \nalso deeply concerned about jobs and the economy. That is what the \nPresident should be focused on. Incredibly, it appears to be the \nfarthest thing from his mind.\n\n\n                          Senate Ground Rules\n\n  I have been mentioning on a daily basis the ongoing concern I have \nabout the institution in which 100 of us serve, an institution that has \nserved America well since the beginning of our country. The \nConstitution was framed back in 1887. George Washington presided over \nthat Constitutional Convention. Legend has it he was asked, What do you \nthink the Senate is going to be like? He reportedly replied it would be \nlike the saucer under the teacup, and the tea that sloshed out of the \nteacup would go down into the saucer and cool off. In other words, the \nFounders of our great country believed the Senate would be a place \nwhere things slowed down, were thought over, and obviously where \nbipartisan agreements would be the way to move forward.\n  Over the period of our history, the idea of unlimited debate has had \na lot of support in this body from both parties. In fact, during World \nWar I, it was agreed there ought to be some way to stop a debate. Prior \nto that, there was no way, actually, to stop a debate. They agreed to \ncreate a device called cloture that would allow a supermajority of the \nSenate to bring debate to an end.\n  Over the years there have been flirtations by majorities of different \nparties to fundamentally change the Senate. Those temptations have been \navoided. Those temptations arose again at the beginning of the previous \nCongress and at the beginning of this Congress under the current \nmajority and the current majority leader. There was a lot of discussion \nabout the way forward for the institution that would benefit the \ninstitution and not penalize either side. In January of 2011 the \nmajority leader said the issue was settled for the next two Congresses, \nthe previous Congress and this one.\n  In spite of that, we entered into a lengthy discussion at the \nbeginning of this Congress on a bipartisan basis. As a result of that, \nthe Senate passed two rules changes and two standing orders. The \nmajority leader once again gave his word that this issue was concluded.\n  Last January I asked the majority leader: ``I would confirm with the \nmajority leader that the Senate would not consider other resolutions \nrelating to any standing order or rules of this Congress unless they \nwent through the regular order process?''\n  The majority leader said: ``That is correct. Any other resolutions \nrelated to Senate procedure would be subject to a regular order \nprocess, including consideration by the Rules Committee.''\n  The regular order process takes 67 votes to change the rules of the \nSenate. We did that with the two rules changes earlier this year, \nthereby confirming, again, that is the way you change the rules of the \nSenate.\n  The majority leader, in spite of having given his word, not once but \ntwice, continues to suggest that may not be a word that is going to be \nkept and has continued to flirt openly with employing what is called \nthe nuclear option.\n  My party, when it was in the majority some time ago, 8 or 9 years \nago, flirted with it as well, but good sense prevailed and we moved \nbackward. We moved into a position where we are today, which is it \ntakes 60 votes when you have a determined minority to get an outcome.\n  The threat has been related to nominations and nominations only, as \nif somehow breaking the rules of the Senate to change the rules of the \nSenate would be confined to nominations in the future. The way that \nwould be done, of course, is the Parliamentarian would say it was a \nviolation of Senate rules to change the rules of the Senate with 51 \nvotes. The majority would simply appeal the ruling of the Chair and do \nit with 51 votes. If that is ever done, the Senate as an institution we \nhave known is finished, and it would not be confined to nominations in \nthe future.\n  Senator Alexander and I laid out a few days ago the kind of agenda we \nwould probably pursue, almost certainly pursue, were we in the \nmajority. It was an agenda that would in many ways horrify the current \nmajority, such things as completing Yucca Mountain, repealing \nObamaCare, national right-to-work--I mean, things I believe probably \nevery single Member of the majority party would find abhorrent. But \nthat is the point.\n  The supermajority threshold is inconvenient to majorities from time \nto time. It requires them to engage in negotiation in order to go \nforward. It is frustrating from time to time. It is important to \nremember--every Senate majority should remember--the shoe will someday \nbe on the other foot.\n  The institution has served our country well. We have had some big \ndebates this year in which we have had amendments, discussions on a \nbipartisan basis, and bills moved forward. We saw it on the farm bill. \nWe have seen it on other bills. We may well see it on the bill that is \non the floor of the Senate now.\n  The fundamental point before the Senate is we need to know if the \nmajority leader intends to keep his word, because in the Senate your \nword is important. In fact, it is the currency of the realm here in the \nSenate.\n  I am going to continue to raise this issue because we need to resolve \nit. Senators need to know that words will be kept. The word on the \nground rules of how we operate here in the Senate needs to be kept. We \nare not interested in a majority that says the definition of advise and \nconsent is sit down and shut up, do things I want to do when I want to \ndo it, or I will threaten to break the rules of the Senate to change \nthe rules of the Senate. This is no small matter, and I will continue \nto address it until we get it resolved.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/25/senate-section/article/S5105-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in deference to the Presiding Officer, I \nam going to forgo my speech on the Stanley Cup playoffs until another \nMember is presiding later in the day.\n  Instead, I wish to address the speech made by the Senate Republican \nleader on the issue of our environment.\n  Senator McConnell of Kentucky tells us if we are going to discuss the \nstate of our environment in America, it is a war on coal and a war on \njobs.\n  I think he is wrong. I think the Republican approach to the \nenvironmental issues is a war on science. It is a denial of the \noverwhelming scientific evidence that the weather affecting us on this \nEarth is changing. We know it. Storms, extraordinary storms, are more \nfrequent and more violent than they have been. We know the polar icecap \nis melting. We know the glaciers are disappearing. We know the impact \nthis will have on humanity as well as wildlife. Yet from the other side \nthere is a complete denial of science. This is a war on science.\n  Their position is also a war on public health. Twenty-five million \nAmericans suffer from asthma. Nearly one in five children with asthma \nwent to an emergency department for care in 2009. To\n\n[[Page S5106]]\n\nignore the state of air pollution and the public health challenges it \npresents is to ignore the reality of the state of our environment and \nits impact on public health.\n  Finally, the public approach when it comes to this issue is a war on \nthis Earth we call home. Unless and until the United States shows \nleadership when it comes to the environment, it is difficult, if not \nimpossible, to convince other nations to do the same.\n  Today the President is going to make a speech which will be \ncontroversial about what to do with our environment. I think he is on \nthe right track to engage us in a national debate, a debate about the \nlegacy we leave our children and grandchildren when it comes to this \nEarth we live on.\n  Senator McConnell's State of Kentucky is just south of mine. He has \ncoal reserves in his State, as we do in Illinois. We have seen the use \nof those reserves, because of some of the contamination and chemicals \nthat are associated with that coal, diminish dramatically over the last \nseveral decades.\n  I haven't given up on coal if it is used responsibly. This \nadministration has invested in clean coal projects. One is called \nFutureGen 2. It is a project to capture the emissions coming out of \nsmokestacks from coal-fired electric powerplants and to bury them deep \nbeneath the Earth, a mile beneath the Earth. It is capture and \nsequestration of these emissions. It is an energy research experiment \nwhich we are engaged in right now in central Illinois which I believe \nholds promise for the use of coal in the future in a much more \nresponsible way.\n  How much can you store below the Earth in Illinois? We can store the \nemissions of over 50 coal-fired electric power plants operating for 50 \nyears. Let's engage in that research. Let's find responsible ways to \nuse coal.\n  This notion that moving toward energy efficiency and reducing \npollution is going to cost us jobs isn't borne out by the evidence. We \nare seeing dramatic investments being made in manufacturing for solar, \nwind, and geothermal. We are seeing dramatic investments creating new \nAmerican jobs because we are setting new standards for more fuel-\nefficient cars, for example. This is good for every family, every \nbusiness in America. It is good for the environment, and it creates \njobs. To suggest that dealing with the environment costs us jobs--\nexactly the opposite is true.\n  Let me also say a word about the Republican leader's concern about \nworking families living paycheck to paycheck. Time and again on this \nside of the aisle we have offered to the Senator and his colleagues a \nchance to reduce the tax burden on working families in America by \nasking those who are doing quite well to pay a little more, and they \nhave consistently said no. Again, we have asked the Republican leader \nand his colleagues to join us in raising the minimum wage and they have \nsaid no. So this concern about families struggling paycheck to paycheck \nshould be borne out by some of their votes. That, to me, is essential.\n\n  Let me close by saying this: I believe the environment is a challenge \nwe must face head on. To ignore it is to ignore reality. Lake Michigan, \nwhen measured just a few months ago, was at its lowest depth in any \nmeasured time in recent history. What we are seeing in global warming \nis the evaporation of our Great Lakes. It is a scary thing to think \nabout what this will ultimately do to us.\n  The President is going to face the issue head on. There are some who \nwant to run away from it. They can do that if they wish. But their war \non science, their war on health, their war on those destructive forces \nthat are affecting the Earth is shortsighted. We need leadership on \nthis, bipartisan leadership.\n  Let me close by saying--and then I will yield to my friend from \nMaryland--that I will come back shortly after morning business to speak \nabout this historic immigration bill. The 67-to-27 vote on the floor \nlast night--bipartisan vote--is an indication that we have finally come \nup with a historic measure and one that is important for the future of \nthis Nation. We will do many things around here, and important things, \nbut hardly anything as important as fixing this broken immigration \nsystem. The fact that we can do this in the Senate on a bipartisan \nbasis is a tribute to this institution getting back on its feet and \nputting aside some of the political battles of the past. I only hope \nour friends over in the House are watching this and understanding that \nonly through bipartisanship can we cure and solve some of the problems \nour Nation faces.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Before my friend from Illinois leaves the floor, I wish \nto congratulate him on his incredible leadership on the immigration \nbill. The Senator from Illinois brought many issues to the compromise \nthat was reached, but I particularly wish to thank him on behalf of the \nchildren for the DREAM Act that is incorporated in this legislation \nthat will help so many young people.\n  I told a story on the floor of the Senate about a person who lives in \nMaryland who was offered a scholarship and had to turn it down. We \nfound out he didn't have legal status in the United States. What a \ndisappointment it was to him. I also told about a lot of other young \npeople who have had the courage now to step forward, and the Senator's \nlegislation will give them hope, in a very relatively short period of \ntime, to be able to accomplish the dream of being in America.\n  So I wanted to applaud him and all the Senators who were involved--\nSenator Schumer just left the floor, his incredible work with Senators \nBennet and Menendez, and the Republicans the Senator from Illinois \nworked with, Senators McCain, Graham, Flake, and Rubio.\n  The Senator is absolutely right. If we want a major bill done, it has \nto be done in a bipartisan way. It is not the bill the Senator would \nhave written; it is not the bill I would have written, but I think the \nSenator from Illinois has done a great service, and I thank him.\n  Mr. President, I have cleared it on our side, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be permitted to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/25/senate-section/article/S5106-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5106-S5108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, yesterday was good news. It was good news \nfor the eventual passage of S. 744, the comprehensive immigration \nreform bill. It is good news the Senate is on the verge of being able \nto pass this legislation because 11 million people who live in the \nshadows will now have hope they will be able to stay in America, work \nin America, and one day become citizens of this great country.\n  But the real winners of immigration reform are the American people \nand our government. We have a broken immigration system today, and this \nbill will allow us to replace that broken immigration system with a \nbalanced approach on how to deal with immigration in this country. It \nis balanced first by recognizing border security is important. We have \nto make sure people coming to this country come in lawfully; that they \ncome in through a door, not over a fence, and this bill clearly deals \nwith the issues of border security.\n  The bill also deals with E-Verify for employers, to make sure \nemployers only hire those who are legally present in this country. It \nalso provides a way in which those who are currently here can come out \nof the shadows, get legal status, and earn a pathway to citizenship.\n  I say earn a pathway to citizenship because those individuals have to \ncomply with our laws, pay our taxes, learn English, and then wait for \nthe entire working backlog within the immigration system to be cured \nbefore they can apply for citizenship. So it is a way in which \nindividuals who are currently here, who are law-abiding and are \nprepared to comply with our laws have a reasonable pathway to \ncitizenship.\n  It also deals with realistic numbers for people who want to come to \nAmerica, who want to make America their home, for family \nreunifications, as well as those who want to work in this country. By \nhaving reasonable numbers, we can get the skilled workers we need and \nwe can get the seasonal workers we need.\n  The bill replaces a badly broken immigration system. As I mentioned \nto Senator Durbin, it includes the DREAM Act. This gives children who\n\n[[Page S5107]]\n\nhave been here most of their lives, within a relatively short period of \ntime, a pathway to citizenship in America.\n  I regret that border surge modifications were added to this \nlegislation. I say that for many reasons. I thought the bill reported \nout of the Judiciary Committee, although it was not the bill I would \nhave written, was well balanced on border protection. I think the \nadditions that will be added later today will spend a lot of money with \nlittle results for the taxpayers of this country.\n  I think we have thrown money at a problem rather than trying to look \nat what should be done in the most cost-effective way. The cost \nbenefits of these billions of dollars being spent are very marginal.\n  Most of the problems deal with employment. The E-Verify system is an \nimportant improvement in the bill, as reported out by the Judiciary \nCommittee. When we look at who is likely in the future to be illegal in \nthis country, it is more likely to be people who entered the country \nlawfully and then are out of status than it is someone sneaking over \nthe border. So I think we could have used the money in a much more \neffective way, and we are micromanaging border security, which, in the \nlong run, will not be to the benefit of this country.\n  I couldn't agree with Senator Leahy more in the statement he gave. We \nare waiving contractor rules by the amendment that is currently on the \nfloor, and that is going to cause waste, fraud, and abuse. There is no \nquestion in my mind about that.\n  But what I find very hypocritical is that the same Senators who are \non the floor day after day complaining about the size of government and \ngovernment spending when it comes to educating our children, when it \ncomes to dealing with our most vulnerable, when it comes to dealing \nwith our health care system, are the ones who propose spending more \nmoney on border security than anyone thought was necessary.\n  We could have done this better. I am disappointed, and I think if one \ntakes a look at it, the amount of money being spent exceeds any of the \nearmarked funds we were complaining of wasting in the past. I thought \nthere was some benefit to earmarks. We talked about that, but we got \nrid of earmarks, and now we have a bill that is spending billions of \ndollars in an effort to deal with border security when we could have \ndone it in a much more cost-effective way.\n  I am also disappointed in the amendment process that has been used in \nthis legislation. I don't blame the majority leader at all. I do blame \nthose who have been obstructionists in considering amendments on the \nfloor. Republicans have complained about amendments being offered on \nthe floor of the Senate in the past. We have given the opportunity on \nthis immigration bill for us to consider amendments, but it was the \nsame Republicans who objected to us considering the bill.\n  Senator Leahy offered a group of noncontroversial amendments. It was \na large group. Senator Landrieu has talked about this frequently. She \noffered her amendment to deal with children. In that group of \nnoncontroversial amendments was an amendment I offered, and I still \nhope we will have a chance to deal with this--the RUSH Act. What does \nthat deal with? It is amendment No. 1286, a bipartisan amendment. I am \npleased Senators Kirk and Portman have joined me in cosponsoring this \namendment. It deals with Holocaust survivors, some of our most \nvulnerable citizens. On average, they are over 80 years of age. Many \nlive alone, many live below the Federal poverty level, and they are \ndesperately concerned about being institutionalized, as I think \neveryone can understand. This amendment makes it easier for them to \naccess services under the Older Americans Act.\n  This is noncontroversial. It was before us, and it was objected to by \na Republican, so we couldn't offer that series of amendments. That is \nnot what we should be doing. We should be considering these amendments \nin an orderly way, but that was not allowed.\n  Let me mention one other amendment I hope we will get a chance to \nconsider. That is amendment 1469, offered by Senator McCain, and I have \njoined him. It deals with gross violations of human rights, \ninternationally recognized human rights. Someone who has violated the \nbasic international standards for human rights shouldn't be given a \nvisa to come to America. We took action last Congress in dealing with \nthe Magnitsky circumstances in Russia, denying gross human rights \nviolators in Russia the opportunity to come to America and getting a \nvisa. At that time, we talked about there being an international \nstandard. Senator McCain and I have led the charge with other Senators, \nand I wish to thank Senator Wicker for his work on these issues.\n  We should now have the opportunity. It is noncontroversial. No one \nhas raised an objection to this amendment, so it should be considered. \nYet because of the obstructionist policies to date, we have not had \nthat opportunity.\n  I wish to mention a few other issues in the underlying bill that I \nthink we can improve upon if we have the opportunity to consider \nreasonable amendments. One deals with profiling.\n  I have introduced legislation that would ban profiling. When law \nenforcement profiles based upon race, religion, national origin or \nethnicity, it is bad police policy. It is bad law enforcement policy. \nIt leads to sloppy work. It leads to a waste of resources, and \nresources are very scarce. It causes communities to turn against law \nenforcement rather than working with law enforcement.\n  All of us have said we want to get rid of racial profiling, and this \nbill does provide a way--a statement against profiling. But it is not \nas strong as it should be, and there are some unintended consequences \nas a result of the language included in it.\n  I think it is very appropriate I am talking about this today as the \nTrayvon Martin case starts in our courts--the youngster who, as a \nresult of racial profiling, lost his life. I have introduced amendment \nNo. 1267, which would add to the basic bill against profiling, \nprofiling based upon religion or national origin. It would remove a \nbroad exception to the bill that is included, and that is well intended \nbut I think compromises the purpose of the underlying bill, which is to \nprevent profiling.\n  I have also offered amendment No. 1266, which deals with additional \nscrutiny and screening given to certain individuals. The underlying \nbill says it can be done by country or region. That is profiling. If we \nhave specific information, let us use specific information; otherwise, \nagain, we are going to be wasting the resources of our security system. \nThe best use of resources would have us use information for additional \nscreening rather than just saying from one region of one country.\n  By the way, if you can get a visa from those countries, then there is \nobviously a reason for an individual to be here. So unless we have a \nspecific reason for additional screening, we shouldn't be doing that by \nregion or country.\n  The two amendments I referred to are supported by many groups. They \nare supported by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, \nby the NAACP, by the AFL-CIO, and I can mention other groups that have \nurged us to modify the underlying bill with these changes.\n  I held several townhall meetings in Maryland on the immigration \nreform bill. They were well attended. I thought the discussions were \nvery positive. They were focused on how we can make this bill a better \nbill and eliminate some of the unintended consequences. Several at \nthese townhall meetings talked about the registered provisional \nimmigrant status and certain requirements in order to stay in that \nstatus and have a pathway to citizenship. One of the requirements is an \nindividual has to be regularly employed. We understand that. That is a \ngood requirement. However, there are times when we have to understand \nthat may not be practical--during an economic downturn, when someone is \nin school. The bill recognizes school, education, is an acceptable \nsubstitute for regular employment. But if someone is unemployed for a \n60-day period, they run the risk of losing their legal status in this \ncountry.\n  I offered an amendment that said volunteering in community service \nwould be an acceptable substitute. This is a win-win situation. Someone \nwho volunteers is helping our community and also learning more about \nthe needs of our community. This had the support\n\n[[Page S5108]]\n\nof the AFL-CIO. They understand the reasonableness of our labor \ncircumstances. I hope we will still have a chance to consider that \nmodification.\n  I was also in discussions that came out of these townhall meetings \ndealing with those who have violated our laws perhaps many years ago on \nmaybe not a very serious issue. There should be at least some \nflexibility in the law for extenuating circumstances, so someone is not \njeopardized to be deported because of something that is not relevant to \ntoday--that person being law-abiding. I hope we can consider that.\n  I offered amendment No. 1264, which deals with private prisons. I \nthink our colleagues were surprised to find out that about half of the \n14,000 ICE detentions are detained in private penal facilities, not \nFederal facilities.\n  We want accountability. This law provides for accountability for \nthose who are detained. But a FOIA application, where one can get \ninformation, only applies to Federal prisons. It doesn't apply to non-\nFederal prisons. I offered a commonsense amendment that I don't think \nis controversial that would apply the same oversight to private non-\nFederal prisons as we do to Federal prisons. We all talk about \naccountability and responsibility of accountability. I think that \namendment makes good sense.\n  So this is not the bill I would have drafted. I would have done other \nthings. I would have spent money a little bit differently than is spent \nhere, and certainly not as much money. I would have taken care of some \nof the problems on profiling, and I certainly would have dealt, on some \nof the other issues, with Holocaust survivors. I still have hope that \nsome of these amendments can be considered and adopted. I know people \nare working on that, and I hope we can work on a package that will \nimprove the bill, particularly the noncontroversial amendments.\n  I spoke on the floor a couple weeks ago as to why I support this \nbill. I talked about a high school student who found out he was \neligible for a scholarship, only to find out he couldn't take it \nbecause of his legal status. I talked about young people who were \nseparated from their parents who have been deported. I talked about \nemployers who have seasonal needs and workers who are well-trained, \nhighly skilled. There are scientists who are desperate for immigration \nreform so they can meet their economic needs. I have talked at great \nlength how this bill will help the American economy, help us be more \ncompetitive internationally, and how this bill is compassionate as to \nwhat America should stand for on its immigration policies.\n  So this is not a difficult choice for me to make. I support this \nlegislation and will be voting for this legislation because I do think \nit is in the best interests of our country. I do hope we have an \nopportunity to improve this legislation before we vote on it. I hope we \ncan adopt some of these noncontroversial amendments, but I do hope we \nwill send this bill to the House of Representatives.\n  I urge my colleagues in the House to follow the example of the \nSenate, to listen to each other and work across party lines so we can \npass comprehensive immigration reform and send it to the President of \nthe United States for his signature.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about longstanding \nrules of procedures and traditions of the Senate.\n  I have watched with interest over the past few weeks as members of \nthe majority have continued to threaten to break the Senate rules in \norder to impose a majority rule at the expense of minority rights. We \ncontinue to hear threats of the nuclear option by which the majority \nwould break the rules to change the rules.\n  Despite past assurances from the majority that rules changes would \nonly occur through regular order, they continue to threaten the exact \nopposite. Make no mistake, this is not some inside-the-beltway squabble \nover parliamentary procedure. The longstanding rules allowing for \nunlimited debate and amendment protect every American whose voice is \nrepresented by the minority in the Senate. These protections are \nespecially important for Americans who live in rural and less populated \nStates. That would include my home State of Nebraska.\n  The Constitution specifically designed the Senate to function in a \nmanner that was very different and very distinct from the House of \nRepresentatives. The threat of the nuclear option clearly abandons this \nintent. The majority leader has affirmed the importance of filibuster \nrights to small States, arguing they are ``a unique privilege that \nserves to aid small States from being trampled by the desires of larger \nStates.''\n  I continue to be astounded by the insistence by some that we trample \nover these rights, especially given the significant nominations and \nlegislation the Senate has recently considered.\n  It has been noted by many metrics the Senate has more rapidly \nconfirmed President Obama's Federal judicial nominations than it did \nduring the time of President Bush's administration. In addition, over \nthe past few months the Senate has passed significant pieces of \nlegislation: the farm bill, the Water Resources Development Act, and \nthe Marketplace Fairness Act. We have considered bills I have supported \nand bills I have opposed. But the fact is we have given these pieces of \nlegislation due consideration that would be required of the world's \ngreatest deliberative body.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, the Senate agreed to a new \nstanding order to expedite Senate consideration in extraordinary \ncircumstances. But the majority leader has not even attempted to use \nthe expedited procedures--not once. So I ask why, then, threaten the \nvery fabric of how this institution was created?\n  I have served in the Senate just 4 years, all of which I have been a \nMember of the minority. I would caution my colleagues whose experiences \nhave been conversely limited to serving only in the majority that \nshould the majority go down the road of the nuclear option, there is no \nturning back. There will come a day--perhaps soon--when control of this \nChamber will shift, and the current majority will not like what it sees \nwhen it is in the minority.\n  My colleague, the senior Senator from Tennessee, recently outlined a \nnumber of priorities he would pursue should we find ourselves in that \nsituation where a Republican-controlled Senate could use majority rule.\n  I am not going to be here in the 114th Congress, but I thought I \nwould outline some policies I would support should the current majority \ntake us down that road. Perhaps my list of priorities will give some \nideas to my colleagues who will be serving in the next Congress. Here \nare just a few policies I would highlight, many of which have already \nreceived majority support in the Senate but have fallen short of the \n60-vote threshold.\n  First, and most important, the repeal of the health care law that \npromised the world but delivered only chaos, confusion, and higher \ncosts. You can bet the Senate would repeal all 2,700 pages with one 15-\nminute rollcall vote. In addition, without having to worry about the \nopposition of the current majority, we can enact responsible reforms to \nrein in debt and deficit. Reforming our entitlements would, of course, \nneed to be center stage since that is where the money is spent.\n  Another priority would be to prevent regulatory overreach by heavy-\nhanded\n\n[[Page S5109]]\n\nexecutive agencies, such as the EPA. Very specifically, we could \noverturn the EPA's pursuit of cap-and-trade through the regulatory \nprocess just announced today by the President and force EPA to back off \nregulations with more costs than benefit.\n  Next, we would promote investment and job growth by immediately \napproving the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. We can further \nsupport energy independence by continuing development of the Yucca \nMountain nuclear waste repository which has been stalled by the \nmajority leader despite substantial support. This is critical to \nnuclear plants across this Nation, including two plants in Nebraska.\n  Another focus would be to provide transparency and reform at the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. I would require legislative \noversight of its budget and replace the unelected head of the CFPB with \nan accountable board. Why stop there when we could repeal the entirety \nof the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with a more responsible approach?\n  The Republican-controlled House of Representatives, which the Senate \nwould essentially mirror, passed 270 bills that the current majority \nleader declined to even consider last Congress. Should the current \nmajority irrevocably alter the rules of the Senate, a new Senate \nmajority could just railroad all 270 bills through the process, and all \nthose treasured policies the majority puts in place will get repealed--\nperhaps before they ever get implemented. Ping-ponging from the whims \nof one 2-year cycle to the next is not a way to govern. It is the very \nreason our Founders designed the Senate as a counterweight to the \nHouse.\n  I say to those colleagues who would so quickly disregard the Senate \nrules: Be careful what you wish for. Under this approach, your \nprocedural right to debate, to amend, to raise points of order, all of \nthat would be useless. Your vote, your voice, and the voice of your \nconstituents would be effectively silenced. That is not the Senate the \nFramers envisioned when they brokered the agreement that established \nour constitutional approach. I will leave with the words of Senator \nRobert C. Byrd, with whom many of us had the pleasure of serving and \nwhose love and knowledge of the Senate remains unsurpassed to this day.\n\n       The Senate has been the last fortress of minority rights \n     and freedom of speech in the Republic for more than two \n     centuries. I pray that Senators will pause and reflect before \n     ignoring that history and tradition in favor of the political \n     priority of the moment.\n\n  I hope the majority heeds his call to place history and tradition and \nour Nation over the political priority of the moment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/25/senate-section/article/S5109-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5109-S5110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today President Obama is supposed to \nunveil a national energy tax that will discourage job creation and \nincrease energy bills for America's families. This announcement about \nexisting powerplants comes after the Obama administration has already \nmoved forward with excessive redtape that makes it harder and more \nexpensive for America to produce energy. It also comes as a complete \nsurprise to the Members of the Senate, especially since Gina McCarthy--\nthe President's nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency--\njust told Congress it wasn't going to happen.\n  She is currently the Assistant Administrator of the EPA. Here is what \nshe told the Senate about regulations on existing powerplants: EPA is \nnot currently developing any existing source GHG regulations for power \nplants.\n  As a result, she said: We have performed no analysis that would \nidentify specific health benefits from establishing an existing source \nprogram.\n  With today's announcement by President Obama about existing \npowerplants, it is clear Gina McCarthy is either arrogant or ignorant. \nShe either didn't tell the truth to the Senate or she doesn't know what \nis going on within her own agency. Either way, such a person cannot \nlead the EPA.\n  To the point that this morning's National Journal Daily--with a \npicture of her right there on the front page--says: ``Obama's efforts \ncould make EPA nominee Gina McCarthy's confirmation more difficult.'' \nIn this economy, the last thing we need to do is have a national energy \ntax that will discourage hiring and make energy even more expensive.\n  Also, I might point out to the White House that they continue to say \nthe main objective of the President's plan today is to ``lead the rest \nof the world.'' Based on the news of the last week, it is clear that \nthe rest of the world, including China and Russia, isn't following \nPresident Obama's direction or his leadership.\n\n\n                            Nuclear Weapons\n\n  That brings me to my next topic. Last week, President Obama gave a \nspeech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. In that speech, he said he \nplans to cut the number of America's deployed strategic nuclear weapons \nby up to one-third. This would be a drastic cut and would be on top of \nthe drastic cuts in the New START arms control treaty from less than 2 \nyears ago. President Obama's latest defense cuts are shortsighted and \nhis approach to making this important announcement has been far too \nhasty.\n  First of all, in the President's speech, he repeated what has been \nsort of a mantra for people who want to eliminate all nuclear weapons. \nHe said: ``So long as nuclear weapons exist, we are not truly safe.''\n  In 1987, President Ronald Reagan went to the same spot at the \nBrandenburg Gate in the shadow of the Berlin Wall. He gave a speech in \nwhich he urged the leader of the Soviet Union to ``tear down this \nwall.'' In that speech, President Reagan also said freedom and security \ngo together.\n  In contrast to President Obama's idealism, President Reagan grounded \nhis beliefs in history and in facts. We have experienced a world \nwithout nuclear weapons. Great powers went to war with each other \nrepeatedly, which caused unthinkable amounts of death and suffering. \nThe estimated number of dead from World War II generally ranges from 45 \nto 60 million. We haven't had a war with that kind of global death toll \nsince then. Nuclear weapons and their deterrence power are a critical \nreason for that.\n  Ronald Reagan knew America's nuclear deterrent helped keep Americans \nsafe and helped keep our country free. I think it is important we \nrecognize that essential truth. President Obama seems to base his plan \nto cut America's defenses on this false notion that we are safer \nwithout nuclear weapons. This is a serious problem.\n  Second, I think it is important to recognize that a vital part of the \ndeterrent is what is called the nuclear triad. This is the idea that \nwe, as the United States, have three ways we can defend America.\n  We have nuclear weapons on bombers that can be flown to where they \nare needed, we have nuclear weapons that can be launched from the \nballistic missile submarines that are stationed around the world, and \nwe have nuclear weapons in the ground that can launch intercontinental \nballistic missiles. All of these have different uses and together they \nhave a flexible, survivable, and stable nuclear deterrent. The triad \nensures other major powers are never tempted to go too far and threaten \nAmerica's security or that of our allies.\n  So the second thread of President Obama's plan is that it could \nrequire substantial cuts to the ICBM force across the country, which \nmeans a weaker triad, a weaker deterrent, and a weaker defense.\n  The Secretary of Defense gave a speech the other day too. He \ncommitted to actually keeping the triad of air, sea, and land-based \ndeterrents. If the President is serious about protecting Americans and \nour allies, he should immediately announce he agrees with what his \nDefense Secretary said the other day. The President needs to reassure \nthe American people that he will take no steps that could weaken the \ntriad or any parts of it.\n  The question is, Why now? The Senate just ratified a new START about \na year and a half ago. That treaty set new levels for nuclear weapons \nand for delivery vehicles, but we haven't had time to even implement \nthose new levels and the President goes and makes this next statement. \nWhy the big rush to say those levels are all wrong and we need to cut \neven more nuclear weapons?\n  In 2010, the Senate held hearings about New START. The head of the\n\n[[Page S5110]]\n\nU.S. Strategic Command at the time was General Chilton. He was asked if \nthe treaty allowed the United States ``to maintain a nuclear arsenal \nthat is more than is needed to guarantee an adequate deterrent.''\n  General Chilton said:\n\n       I do not agree that it is more than is needed. I think the \n     arsenal that we have is exactly what is needed today to \n     provide the deterrent.\n\n  A former Secretary of Defense testified at the same hearing, James \nSchlesinger. He said the strategic nuclear weapons allowed under New \nSTART are adequate, though barely so.\n  What has changed from the testimony in 2010 or since the Senate \nratified the treaty at the end of 2011? The level was barely adequate a \ncouple of years ago. It was exactly what was needed then. So how can we \nnow cut another 33 percent off that level? That is what the President \nis proposing. The only thing that has changed since then--it seems to \nme--the threat of hostile nuclear programs has become even greater.\n  As countries that are not our friends grow closer to modernizing \ntheir nuclear weapon program, it would be irresponsible for us to \nweaken our own program. We haven't even had a chance to confirm that \nRussia is complying with its obligations under New START. Russia has a \nlong history of not complying with treaties. President Obama set out to \nreset relations between our two countries. There is no evidence that \nanything has changed.\n  Even the Washington Post admitted the failure of the so-called reset. \nThey ran an editorial last week with the title ``A starry-eyed view of \nPutin.'' It said:\n\n       In touring Europe this week, President Obama has portrayed \n     Russia's Vladmir Putin as a ruler with whom he can build a \n     constructive, cooperative relationship that moves us out of a \n     Cold War mind-set.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       It's a blinkered view that willfully ignores the Russian \n     President's behavior--willfully ignores the Russian \n     President's behavior.\n\n  The Washington Post got it right.\n  Finally, the President seemed to be laying the groundwork in his \nspeech for a new round of cuts he could do unilaterally. That would be \na mistake. Any further reductions in America's nuclear defenses should \nbe done through a negotiated treaty with Russia. That means a thorough \nprocess open to the scrutiny of the American people and subject to full \nconsideration by this body.\n  New START included a resolution of ratification that specifically \nsays future nuclear arms cuts can be made only--only--through a treaty. \nArms control advocates pushing President Obama to make more cuts know \nthat negotiating in public is difficult. They would prefer to strike \nbackroom deals.\n  That is not the political system our Framers designed. They \nspecifically require two-thirds of the Senate to ratify treaties. Such \nimportant decisions should not rest in the hands of the President alone \nor with his selected advisers.\n  Under the President's plan, he would cut our nuclear defenses 55 \npercent. Russia continues to modernize its nuclear arsenal. China is \nexpanding its nuclear stockpile. Iran is accelerating its nuclear \nefforts. North Korea continues its nuclear threats. We already have the \nNew START Treaty. It would be irresponsible to move forward with these \nsorts of cuts the President is talking about without extensive \ndiscussion with the American people and Congress.\n  The world remains a very dangerous place. Instead of drastically \nweakening America's defenses, the President should focus on stopping \ncountries such as Iran and North Korea from expanding their nuclear \nprograms. America can't afford to lose the full deterrent effect of a \nstrong nuclear defense.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to start by thanking the Senator \nfrom Wyoming for his comments this morning. I think they are right on \nthe mark. Throughout world history we have tried the appeasement of \nthose who would seek to use their power to bully other people into \nsubmission, and I worry the President is taking a naive approach here \nand unilaterally disarming the United States in the face of a rising \nthreat from Russia and other parts around the world. So I thank the \nSenator for his very important comments on a very important topic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/25/senate-section/article/S5110-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5110-S5112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Now that cloture was invoked on the underlying Leahy \namendment, I think it is very important the American people and Members \nof Congress look more closely at what actually is in the immigration \nbill we will be voting on during the course of this week and, \npresumably, if the majority leader has his way, will see pass this \nChamber and head over to the House of Representatives.\n  It was three years ago when the Democratic House leader and the \nformer head of that Chamber Nancy Pelosi famously said we would have to \npass ObamaCare in order to find out what was in it. We have all said \nthings we regret, and I bet if she had it to say over again, she would \nnot have said it that way. Indeed, it seemed to strike such a \nresponsive chord in people because the public realizes what we should \nacknowledge, which is when it comes to 2,700 pages of legislation \npassed through without adequate deliberation and an understanding of \nwhat is in it, purely on a partisan vote, we are bound to make \nmistakes.\n  Unfortunately, we know how ObamaCare turned out. We have now seen \nbipartisan votes to repeal certain portions of it such as the 1099 \nrequirement. We have seen an overwhelming bipartisan vote that would \nsuggest sooner or later we will repeal the medical device tax, which is \na gross receipts tax on the people who are innovating and creating jobs \nright here in America and creating access to high-quality health care, \nwhich makes us second to none. We saw how it turned out with ObamaCare.\n  Now, once again, we are being urged to enact a massive piece of \nlegislation before the American people are fully aware of what is in \nit. Indeed, some supporters of the immigration bill are hoping some of \nits more outrageous elements will go unnoticed. Well, that is not going \nto happen. We are going to be spending the next few days, until this \nbill passes this Chamber, to point out some of the more indefensible \nprovisions in the underlying bill.\n  Today I wish to talk about what I think is arguably the most \nindefensible portion of the bill--the part that grants immediate legal \nstatus to immigrants with multiple drunk driving or domestic violence \nconvictions.\n  As we know, in the underlying bill, those who apply for and qualify \nfor registered provisional immigrant status can stay in the United \nStates and work for up to 5 years, providing they meet the terms of \nthat probationary status, and they can actually reapply for another 5 \nyears and then eventually, after 10 years, they can qualify for legal \npermanent residency, which is the pathway to American citizenship as \nearly as 3 years from that time. But under the provisions of this bill, \nimmigrants who are out of status--undocumented immigrants--can get \naccess to probationary status and get on a pathway to legal permanent \nresidency and citizenship, even though they have committed multiple \nincidents of driving while intoxicated or domestic violence. Most \nAmericans aren't aware of these provisions, but I can assure my \ncolleagues everyone will suffer the consequences if this ill-considered \nprovision becomes the law of the land.\n\n  In fiscal year 2011, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported \n36,000 individuals with DUI convictions; that is, driving under the \ninfluence convictions--nearly 36,000 people. That gives us an idea of \nhow big this problem is and what the consequences are of turning a \nblind eye to this provision in the underlying bill and what impact it \nmight have on the public.\n  Last week I shared a few stories from my State of Texas, including \nthe story of the sheriff's deputy in Harris County named Dwayne Polk, \nwho was killed last month by an illegal immigrant drunk driver who had \npreviously been arrested for, No. 1, driving under the influence and, \nNo. 2, carrying an illegal weapon. Today I wish to share two more \nstories.\n  In August 2011, an illegal immigrant drunk driver crashed his car in \nBrenham, TX, killing four other people, all of whom were under the age \nof 23 years old. We subsequently learned\n\n[[Page S5111]]\n\nthe driver of the car had been arrested just weeks before that deadly \naccident for--you guessed it--drunk driving. Yet because his initial \noffense was technically a class C misdemeanor, he was not taken into \nFederal custody and deported.\n  In March 2012, an illegal immigrant drunk driver crashed his vehicle \ninto an apartment building in Houston, killing a 7-year-old boy and \nleaving a 4-year-old boy with severe burns on nearly half of his body. \nNot surprisingly, the drunk driver had been arrested for DUI once \nbefore in 2008, and in 2011, he had been charged with attacking his \nwife by punching her in the face.\n  We know drunk drivers and domestic abusers tend to be serial or \nrepeat offenders. In other words, it is rare that people who have \nengaged in domestic violence only do it once and people who drive while \nintoxicated only do it once. By offering registered provisional \nimmigrant status to illegal immigrants with multiple DUI convictions or \ndomestic violence convictions, we are virtually guaranteeing more \ninnocent people will lose their lives or become victims of violent \ncrime. That is unconscionable and it is indefensible.\n  Last week I challenged any Member of this Chamber to come down to the \nfloor and defend these provisions, and I repeat that challenge today. I \ndon't think we will find any takers, because we cannot defend the \nindefensible, and granting legal status to drunk drivers and violent \ncriminals is just that: an indefensible policy that will inevitably \nhave tragic circumstances.\n  Provisions such as this one are one more reason why this bill is dead \non arrival in the House of Representatives.\n  One final point. Many critics of my border security amendment called \nit a poison pill which, of course, was ridiculous because it used the \nsame criteria used in the underlying framework written by the Gang of \n8. But leave that aside. Here is what I would say to those critics: If \nwe want to know what a real poison pill is, all we have to do is read \nthrough these provisions with regard to criminal justice in the Gang of \n8 bill. We should not be supporting legislation that grants immediate \nlegal status to drunk drivers and domestic abusers. I can understand \nwhy the American people are asked to extend an act of uncommon \ngenerosity for people who enter our country in order to work and \nprovide for their families, but for those who have demonstrated their \ncontempt for the rule of law and for the legal standards which govern \nall Americans, I don't think they deserve this sort of extraordinary \ntreatment. I hope there is somebody who will come to the floor and \nexplain why these provisions are in the bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we have an historic opportunity here in \nthe Senate. It doesn't happen very often. This is a bipartisan bill. \nHow about that. Yesterday we had 67 votes in favor of this immigration \nreform package. We would have had 69, but two Democratic Members were \nheld up because their flights were delayed and they couldn't make it. \nSixty-nine. It basically means we had somewhere in the range of 17 \nRepublicans joining with the Democrats. That is amazing on an issue \nthis controversial.\n  I have been engaged in meetings on this measure for quite a few \nmonths. Eight of us, four Democrats and four Republicans, all over the \npolitical spectrum, sat down and said we were going to come up with a \nbill. It wouldn't be perfect and not one single individual Senator was \ngoing to like it, but together were are going to agree on something, \nand we did. There are parts of it I don't like at all. There are parts \nof it I think are great. That is the nature of a compromise, and that \nis what we are expected to do.\n  It is a long bill. This is the bill we voted on yesterday. Even \nthough many Members are complaining about the size of this bill, most \nof it has been out there now for almost 2 months. Even a slow-reading \nSenator should have been able to get through it. One hundred new pages \nwere brought in yesterday, I will concede, over the last 4 or 5 days, \nbut at least 100 pages can be addressed by most Senators and their \nstaff.\n  Why do we need to do this? Why don't we take the easy way, find \nsomething wrong in here and vote no? I guarantee I can point to five or \nsix sections I would rewrite. If we do that, where do we leave our \ncountry? We leave 11 million people who are undocumented living in the \nshadows, fearing they may be deported tomorrow, working for below-\nminimum wage under intolerable conditions, competing with American \nworkers. We don't know who they are officially, where they live, or \nwhat they do. For the security of the United States, for the \ncompetitiveness of American workers, this is a bad situation.\n  What we do is say to these people, Come forward. Come forward and \nregister with the government. That is the first step. If a person was \nhere before December 31 of 2011, he or she can qualify, but they have \nto go through a criminal background check.\n  The Senator from Texas raises questions about whether that background \ncheck should be modified this way or that way. I can certainly argue \none way or the other as to how it should be modified. But in a 1,200-\npage bill, that is one very small section--an important one but only \none.\n  What I am suggesting is we are better off as a Nation to have 11 \nmillion people come forward, identify themselves, register with our \ngovernment, pay their taxes, pay a fine, and submit themselves to a \ncriminal background check before we allow them to stay in this country. \nThat is certainly better than the current situation.\n  On the other side, this bill also creates an opportunity for them. \nAfter 10 years--10 years of being monitored by our government--they \nhave a chance to move into a status where they can start working toward \nimmigration in a 3-year period of time--working toward citizenship in a \n3-year period of time. Thirteen years. This is no amnesty. During that \nperiod of time before they become citizens, they will have paid, under \nour bill, some $2,000 in fines, paid their taxes for every single day \nthey worked, learned English, and, of course, submitted themselves to \nthis continuing background check. We are a better Nation when that \noccurs.\n  In addition to that, there are provisions in here that relate to a \ngroup of undocumented that mean an awful lot to me personally. Twelve \nyears ago I introduced the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act said if a person \nwas brought here as a baby, an infant, or a child, and that person had \nbeen educated in the United States, graduated high school, has no \nserious criminal problems, they then have a chance to become a citizen \nby completing at least 2 years of college or enlisting in our military. \nI have been trying to pass that for 12 years. It was I think 2 years \nago we had the last vote on the Senate floor on the DREAM Act. Every \ntime we have called it we got a majority, but we couldn't pass it \nbecause of the Republican filibuster.\n  The last time we had this debate, those galleries were filled with \nyoung people who were undocumented in caps and gowns. They were sitting \nthere to remind us they were graduating from our schools--among them \nvaledictorians, many who had been accepted to college but could not \nafford to go because they were undocumented.\n  This bill deals with these DREAMers, as we call them today, and gives \nthem a chance to become citizens. About 500,000 of them have come \nforward already under the President's Executive order. Their stories \nare amazing and inspiring.\n  At a meeting with President Obama 2 weeks ago, we talked about the \nDREAM Act. He said: When the DREAMers came into my office and told \ntheir stories, there was not a dry eye in the room--the sacrifices they \nare making in the hope they can become part of America's future.\n  I have the greatest faith in them, and I know they are not going to \nlet me down. Their stories are going to continue to inspire us, and \nthey are part of this bill.\n  Can I find one section in this bill I disagree with? Sure I can. But \ncan I turn my back on 11 million people being given a chance to come \nforward, register, and become part of America with some strict \nconditions? Can I turn my back on 1\\1/2\\ million DREAMers--and that is \nan estimate--who would finally get their chance to be part of America's \nfuture? No. I am not going to turn my back on them. I will work to \nimprove this bill, but I am not going to walk away from it. Walking \naway from legislation, voting no may be an\n\n[[Page S5112]]\n\neasy thing for some, but when it comes to this, it is not easy for me. \nIt is something I will not do. I want to stand by it.\n  Let me say a word about the rest of the bill. There are provisions in \nthis bill that deal with things we do not think about. Here is the \nreality: If you happen to be a grower, growing fruits and vegetables in \nAmerica, and you put out a sign ``Help Wanted''--would you like to come \nand pick strawberries in Salinas Valley in California; would you like \nto come pick apples in southern Illinois--there are not a lot of local \nkids who sign up. It is hard work, some say dangerous work, and I \nbelieve it is. Those who do these jobs--the migrants who come in and \nwork--do it for a living. It is hard, tough labor. Without them, these \ncrops do not get picked and processed and we suffer as a nation.\n  This bill has a provision on agricultural workers that is \nextraordinary. Michael Bennet of Colorado and Dianne Feinstein of \nCalifornia are two who sat down with Marco Rubio of Florida, and \nothers, and they worked out an agreement that has been signed on to by \nthe growers and the unions representing the workers. How about that. A \nbusiness, management, and labor agreement when it comes to ag workers. \nThat is in this bill too. Should we walk away from that?\n  There is a provision as well to try to tap into the talent that is \neducated in America that can help us create jobs.\n  Let me say that one of the things I insisted on in this bill is that \nbefore anyone is brought in to fill a job from overseas, you first \noffer the job to an American. That, to me, is the bottom line. That is \nmy responsibility as a Senator who represents many of the people who \nare unemployed today. But this bill takes a step beyond that. If you \ncannot fill that position, you have an opportunity to fill it with \nsomeone brought in from overseas.\n  I will give an illustration. The Illinois Institute of Technology--\nwhich is an extraordinary school for engineering and science in the \ncity of Chicago--at their commencement a few years ago when I spoke, \nvirtually every advanced degree was awarded to someone from India. \nToday, virtually every advanced degree is awarded to someone from \nChina.\n  I have met some of these graduates, and I have said to them: With \nthis education--the best in the world--would you stay in America if you \nwere offered that chance? They said yes. Why would we educate them and \nsend them off to compete with American companies? If they can be \nbrought into our companies and create American jobs and opportunities \nwith them, it is good for all of us. That is part of this bill as well.\n  As I look at this bill, this is a historic opportunity to solve a \nproblem which has not been addressed seriously in 25 years, a problem \nwhich we know confounds us as we deal with 11 million undocumented \npeople within our borders and one which truly reflects on our values as \na nation.\n  I gave a speech last week to a group in Chicago, and I talked about \nthe diversity of this group, the group that was gathered--Black, White, \nand Brown, young and old, men and women--and I said: If I asked \neverybody in this ballroom to write their family story, their personal \nstory, each would be different. But there would be two chapters in that \nstory that would be the same. The first chapter you might entitle ``Out \nof Africa'' because that is where we all started. It was 70,000 years \nago when the very first immigrants left Ethiopia, crossed the Red Sea \ninto the Arabian Peninsula, and literally populated the world. How do \nwe know that? Because we can find chromosomal DNA that dates back to \nthose original immigrants in every person on Earth. We all started in \nthe same place 70,000 years ago, emigrating out of Africa.\n  The second chapter would be entitled ``Coming to America.'' Every \nsingle one of us has a different story. My chairman is proud of his \nIrish and Italian heritage. His wife is proud of her French-Canadian \nheritage. I stand here proud of the fact that my mother was an \nimmigrant to this country from Lithuania, brought here at the age of 2. \nNow it is my honor to stand on the floor of the Senate and represent 12 \nor 13 million people in the great State of Illinois.\n  As I have said before, that is my story, that is my family's story, \nthat is America's story.\n  We have to get this right because immigration is not just a \nchallenge, it is part of the American heritage. It is who we are. The \ncourage of Senator Leahy's family, the courage of my grandparents, to \npick up and move and come to a place where many of them did not even \nspeak the same language is part of our American DNA. That is what makes \nus different, and that is what makes us better, I guess I might say \nwith some pride in where I came from.\n  We have to honor that tradition with this immigration reform bill, \nand I believe we do. To walk away from it at this point in time, to \nfind some fault or some section that you disagree with is just not good \nenough. We have to accept our responsibility.\n  Yesterday 67--maybe 69--Senators were ready to do that. By the end of \nthe week, stay tuned. We have a chance to pass this bill and make \nAmerica a stronger nation, be fair and just to people who are here, and \nhonor that great tradition of immigration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate voted to adopt an \namendment offered by Senators Corker and Hoeven relating to border \nsecurity.\n  I have some misgivings about the policy contained in that amendment, \nand I have spoken to that on the floor. But, at the same time, I \ncommend these Senators for engaging on this legislation and taking the \nsteps they feel are necessary to gain broader support for the \nunderlying bill. We are now one step--one big step--closer to a\n\n[[Page S5113]]\n\nSenate vote on comprehensive immigration reform legislation.\n  I would like to take just a few moments to reflect on why this \nlegislation is so important and to remind the Senate that as we \nconsider the bill, we should remember that at its core it is about \npeople. It is about families seeking the promise of America. It is \nabout children whose parents want what any parent wants for their \nchild--the opportunity to succeed, to prosper, to live in a free, open \nand welcoming society.\n  To me, the bill is less about numbers and metrics or border fences \nand technology than it is about human beings and the natural desire we \nall have to better ourselves, our families, and to give our children \nthe lives we wish for them.\n  The measures in this legislation will give those affected by it the \nfreedom to get on the path to becoming Americans. Our history of \nimmigration is one that honors our free and open society and which has \nstrengthened it.\n  Immigration has, in part, been the story of enlarging a society made \nup of individuals who, no matter their vast differences, all believe in \nthe promise of American democracy and the values given to us in our \nConstitution. When we welcome those who yearn for these values, we \nstrengthen and renew them.\n  Of course, we are a nation of immigrants. Past immigration has helped \nshape this country and deepen its economic and cultural vibrancy, \ntouching every State and every community--from the Presiding Officer's \nfar western State of Hawaii to my own northeastern State of Vermont.\n  After the Revolutionary War and into the early 1880s, for example, \nVermont had been the slowest growing State in the Union. Old growth \nforests had been stripped and farms had been worn out. But immigrants \nhelped reclaim forsaken farms and build and operate budding new \nfactories in new centers of industry across the Green Mountain State.\n  The United States has been made stronger by the diverse cultural \nbackground that has been woven into our national fabric. This Vermonter \nis the grandson of immigrants to Vermont from Ireland and Italy, and \nour heritage is one of which my family and I are fiercely proud.\n  To appreciate the values inherent in our immigration policy, I need \nonly to look at the experiences of my own family and the family of my \nwife Marcelle. Marcelle's mother and father, Louis Philippe Pomerleau \nand Cecile Bouchard Pomerleau, immigrated to the United States from the \nProvince of Quebec in Canada. Marcelle is a first-generation American \nborn in Newport, VT, and, of course, to me, is the greatest \ncontribution her mother and father made to Vermont and America.\n  But Marcelle's mother and father contributed much to Vermont and to \nAmerica in business, in music, and enriched their own community. \nMembers of her family went on to establish successful businesses and \nbecome leaders in their communities and they have given greatly to \nVermont. Marcelle grew up to serve the communities in which she lived \nas a registered nurse, caring for others in Burlington, VT, in \nWashington, DC, and in Arlington, VA.\n  Similar to many young immigrants in our country, Marcelle grew up in \na bilingual household, knowing two different cultures. But this is \nAmerica for so many, where young people grow up in families where \nmultiple languages are spoken, where traditions from multiple cultures \nare observed. This enriches America.\n  My maternal grandparents came to this country from Italy. My \ngrandfather, similar to many others who came to Vermont from Italy, was \na granite carver. He opened a granite business in central Vermont. The \nhard work and determination of my maternal grandparents--who did not \nspeak English when they arrived--to settle in this country laid the \nfoundation for my mother and our family.\n  My paternal great-grandparents came from Ireland, and my grandfather, \nwho was named Patrick Leahy--and I am named after him--worked in a \nstone quarry as well. They worked hard. They had a family. I grew up \nthe son of printers in Montpelier, our State capital.\n  But nearly every American family has a story similar to mine and \nMarcelle's. We are more alike than we are different from today's \nimmigrants and first-generation Americans.\n  The majority of new immigrants will continue this proud tradition of \nhard work, the drive toward prosperity, and embracing the values that \nmake America great. They will someday tell their children and \ngrandchildren of their own immigrant histories, as Marcelle and I \nlearned from our parents and our grandparents. The bill we consider \nwill continue to cycle growth and renewal. It will improve on many \naspects of our immigration system.\n  The bill before us contains measures that are important to many \nVermonters. I have a provision that takes an important step toward \nrestoring privacy rights to millions of people who live near the \nnorthern border by injecting some oversight into the decisionmaking \nprocess for operating Federal checkpoints and entering private land \nwithout a warrant far from the border.\n  The bill contains significant measures to assist dairy farmers and \nother Vermont growers who have long relied on foreign workers and are \ngoing to need them in the future. It contains a youth jobs program \nproposed by Senator Sanders to help young people gain employment. It \ncontains a measure I proposed to make sure that no Canadian citizen \ntraveling to Vermont to see a family member will ever be charged a fee \nfor crossing our shared and long and wonderful border.\n  It contains an improvement to the visas used by nonprofit arts \norganizations around the country, such as the Vermont Symphony \nOrchestra that invites talented foreign artists to perform in America. \nIt contains measures to improve the lives and future of refugees and \nasylum seekers who call Vermont home.\n  It contains improvements to the H-2B program to help small \nbusinesses. It contains a measure to ensure that the job-creating E-B5 \nprogram be made permanent so the State of Vermont and other States can \ncontinue the great work that is being done--in our State, done to \nimprove Vermont communities.\n  This is a bill that will help Vermont families and businesses alike. \nSo I discuss this legislation today in the context of my personal \nhistory. I do it to take a moment to remind all of us that immigration \nis about more than border security. It is about more than politics. It \nis about the lives and hopes and dreams of human beings. It is about \nthose who go on to do great things in America. It is about American \ncommunities that benefit from immigration.\n  That has been our history; it should also be our future. As I said \nbefore, the legislation before us will help write the next great \nchapter in America's history of immigration. I see the distinguished \nranking member on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. As we have seen over the past 2 weeks, immigration is a \nvery emotional issue. It is an issue that engenders strong feelings \nfrom both sides of the aisle and maybe out in the grass roots of \nAmerica even stronger feelings than are expressed on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Everyone wants reform in the Senate. I have not heard anybody say the \npresent situation is A-OK, but everyone has their own ideas and \ndifferent solutions.\n  Now, at the grass roots of America, there are people who say we ought \nto give citizenship yesterday. There are people on the other side who \nsay 12 million people ought to be rounded up and shipped out of the \ncountry. Neither one of those are very realistic today, but those are \neven stronger voices than you hear on the floor of the Senate.\n  Now, we are trying to find some reasonable solution. I do not think \nthe bill that is eventually going to pass is a reasonable solution. But \nI will not know whether this is a reasonable solution until we get \nthrough the entire legislative process, meaning the House of \nRepresentatives and the conference. But I think down the road we can do \nmuch better than is going to be done in the Senate.\n  Now, as I said, everybody has their own ideas and different \nsolutions. Unfortunately, the process has not allowed us to \nfundamentally improve this bill on the floor of the Senate like we were \nable to have that chance--not too successfully--but at least we had \nthat chance in committee with that\n\n[[Page S5114]]\n\nfair and open process. So out here on the floor of the Senate we have \nnot been able to vote up or down on commonsense amendments or very many \namendments at all. I think to this point about 9, 10, 11 amendments are \nall that we have considered out of 451 that have been offered.\n  Despite the fact that the American people want the border secured \nbefore we provide a path to legalization, this bill appears to be \nfavored by a majority in the body who believe that legalization must \ncome before border security. I ought to say that again. Despite the \nfact that the American people want border security before we provide a \npath to legalization, there appears to be a majority in this body who \nbelieve that legalization must come before border security.\n  The polls around America show just the opposite. Border security \nfirst, everything else after the border is secured. This approach of \nlegalization first is concerning, not only because the border will not \nbe secured for years down the road, but more importantly because it \ndevalues the principle that is very basic to our country and our \nconstitutional system of government, the rule of law. The rule of law \nmeans the government will follow the laws it writes, and we expect the \npeople to do likewise. People need to be able to trust their government \nand trust that the government will be fair.\n  I empathize with people who come into this country to have a better \nlife. Who is going to blame them for doing that? We would do anything \nto give our kids a better life. Some people see no other choice but to \ncross the border without papers to find work and sacrifice everything \nthey have to do it and to take a chance that they are going to run up \nagainst the law and be deported. But they do it because they want a \nbetter life. That is very basic to the American way of life. It is a \nnatural right of most people around the world, a natural right that \nmost of them are not able to bring to fruition.\n  The American people happen to be very compassionate. I know they are \njust trying to find a better opportunity and live the American dream, \nthose people who come here undocumented. We are the best country in the \nworld. We should be proud of it. We are an exceptional nation. But we \nare a great country because we have always abided by the rule of law. \nThe rule of law is what makes all opportunities we have possible.\n  In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt sent a message to the Congress, \nthe State of the Union Message. He talked about how man must be \nguaranteed his liberty and the right to work. But so long as a man does \nnot infringe upon the rights of others, he said this:\n\n       No man is above the law and no man is below it, nor do we \n     ask any man's permission when we ask him to obey it.\n\n  Meaning the law.\n\n       Obedience to the law is demanded as a right, not as a \n     favor.\n\n  I am a believer, just like everybody in this body, in the rule of \nlaw, despite what some say, including the majority leader. That does \nnot mean we want to deport 11 million people. I want a humane and fair \nprocess for them to live, work, and remain here. I have said many \ntimes, and I have said it many times particularly in the past few \nmonths, that we do not necessarily need more laws, but rather we need \nto enforce the laws that are already on the books.\n  That is what I hear at my townhall meetings when people come to them \nand I start to explain about immigration. Somebody pops up: Right. We \ndo not need more laws; we just need to enforce what we have on the \nbooks.\n  I agree. We need to enhance and expand legal avenues for people who \nwant to enter, live, and work in this country. But we have laws that \nhave gone ignored for 17 years. We have laws that are undermined and \ndisregarded. The country will benefit if we have sensible immigration \nlaws. One of the failings of the 1986 law was that it did not do enough \nto create avenues for people to work here. Advocates for reform claim \nthey want a long-term solution, but what we have before us is nothing \nbut a short-term bandaid. Really, what the bill does is clean the \nslate.\n  Those words ``clean the slate'' was a phrase that we used in 1986. \nThat was the goal, to clean the slate, and we would start all over \nagain. I referred many times--it is probably sickening to a lot of \npeople in this body when I refer to the mistakes we made in 1986, not \nto repeat them. But here we are. We want to clean the slate again and \nstart over. The problem is, if we just do the same thing we did in \n1986, we will be back here in 25 years or less wanting to do the same \nthing.\n  So some Senators are going to say: In 2038, all we need to do is \nclean the slate. Well, we said that in 1986. We did clean the slate. We \nare back here in 2013 cleaning the slate again. We should have a long-\nterm solution to these immigration issues. We should pass true and \nmeaningful reform; and in doing so, we should not be ignoring the very \nprinciple on which our country was founded, on the rule of law.\n  We should not have to in any way be apologetic for taking this \nposition either. One would get the opinion by hearing some speeches on \nthe floor of the Senate that some people have more respect for people \nwho violated our law than they have respect for the rule of law or \npeople who have abided by the law. We have people from all over the \nworld at our embassies, standing in line for long periods of time to \ncome to this country legally. Those are the people whom we ought to be \nrespecting.\n  I do not mean we disrespect people who come here to work. But there \nis one thing: They did violate our laws to come here. We do not have to \napologize for not accepting the fact that it is OK to violate the laws. \nSo we should not be apologetic for any position we take that is backed \nby the rule of law, the foundation of our society.\n  Why should we have to apologize for wanting to ensure people live by \nthe laws that we set? We will not survive as a country if we allow \npeople to ignore the law and be rewarded for it. We just cannot be a \ncountry of lawlessness. Why is wanting to secure the border anti-\nimmigration? It is not. We are a sovereign nation. It is our duty to \nprotect the people of this country. That is the first responsibility of \nthe Federal Government, to guarantee our sovereignty because it is \nbasic to our security. It is our right to create procedures whereby \nothers can come to this country and make a living for themselves.\n  This does not mean we do not want other people from other countries. \nAfter all, except for Native Americans we are all a country of \nimmigrants, some first generation and some, I suppose, fifth or sixth \ngeneration. We want to ensure that we protect our sovereignty. We want \nto protect the homeland.\n  So I ask my colleagues to think about how our country's immigration \nlaws will survive the test of time. If this bill passes as is, will it \nbe a temporary fix or something that we can be proud of for generations \nto come?\n  It is my understanding that, so far, 449 amendments have been filed \nto this underlying bill, including second-degree amendments. We started \noff the debate on the Senate floor with my amendment that would have \nrequired the border to be ``effectively controlled'' for 6 months \nbefore the Secretary could legalize people who are already present. We \nwould call them, under this bill, registered provisional immigrants, \nand we referred to it as RPI status.\n  Clearly, the other side was afraid of the amendment I offered because \nit would have fundamentally changed the bill by requiring that the \nborder be secured before granting 11 million undocumented workers a \npathway to citizenship--but not, contrary to what the polls of the \npeople of this country are telling us--they want security first, \nlegalization after security of the borders. They have already cooked \nthe books on this bill and don't want to make fundamental changes, \nregardless of whether they are good changes, because they don't want to \nupset their deal. They have insisted on a 60-vote threshold for \namendments to pass.\n  When my amendment was up, I refused that 60-vote requirement and so \nthey tabled my amendment. This raises the question: What about the open \nand fair process that we were promised? We learned on day one of the \nimmigration debate that all of this talk about ``making the bill \nbetter'' was just plain hogwash. It was all just a phony and empty \npromise.\n  The sponsors would take the floor and say they were ready to vote on \namendments, but in reality they were afraid of any good change. They \nrefused to let Members offer amendments\n\n[[Page S5115]]\n\nof their own choosing. Instead, they wanted to pick what amendments \nMembers would offer. They want to decide who, what, when, and how it \nwould be disposed of. Of course, that is not right, that is not the \nopen process that was promised.\n  In the last 2 weeks we have only debated nine amendments on this \nbill. Of those amendments, the majority leader tabled three amendments \non a rollcall vote. Of the nine, we adopted three amendments by a \nrollcall vote. We rejected three amendments by a rollcall vote, and we \nadopted another three amendments by a voice vote.\n  I am sure everyone would agree that debating 9 amendments out of 450 \nis not a fair and open process. We have a lot more amendments that have \nbeen filed and not considered. These amendments would make this bill \nbetter. The sponsors of the bill are arguing that because we had a \nprocess in the Judiciary Committee that I have applauded as fair and \nopen, that means we don't need such an open and fair process on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  What does that say about the other 82 Members of this body, that they \nshouldn't be allowed to offer amendments? The problem is while the \ncommittee process was open, many amendments were defeated, and no \namendments were offered that substantially changed the bill in \ncommittee.\n  In order to address many issues with this bill, we would like to vote \non more amendments before the end of the week. I wish to discuss some \nof the amendments we would like to see debated and considered before \nthis immigration debate comes to an end, so people have a flavor of the \nkind of issues we believe have not been fully vetted on the floor of \nthe Senate in this process that we were promised was going to be fair \nand open.\n  A number of amendments we would like considered would strengthen \nprovisions of the bill dealing with border security, something that the \ncurrent bill fails to do in a satisfactory manner. As everyone knows, \nthis has been a serious deficiency in the immigration reform bill, \nregardless of the fact that the polls in this country say people want \nthe border secured first and then legalization. This does it the \nopposite way: legalizes and then maybe the border will be secure.\n  For example, Lee amendment No. 1207 would prohibit the Secretaries of \nthe Interior and Agriculture from restricting or prohibiting activities \nof the U.S. Customs and Border Protection on public lands and authorize \nCustoms and Border Protection access to Federal lands to secure the \nborder.\n  Coats amendment No. 1442 would require the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to certify that the Department of Homeland Security has \neffective control of high-risk border sections at the southern border \nfor 6 months before the Department can process RPI status applications. \nThe Coats amendment would also require the Secretary to maintain \neffective control of those high-risk sections for at least 6 months \nbefore the Secretary may adjust the status of the RPI applicants.\n  Coburn amendment No. 1361 would allow Customs and Border Protection \nto enforce immigration laws on Federal lands. What is wrong with that \namendment, to enforce immigration laws on Federal lands?\n  Other amendments would beef up our interior enforcement, which we all \nknow is absolutely critical with respect to the success of our \nimmigration system. This is an area where the underlying bill doesn't \ndo enough.\n  An excellent amendment we haven't had an opportunity to debate and \nvote on is Sessions amendment No. 1334. That amendment would give a \nnumber of tools to State and local governments to enforce the \nimmigration laws, including giving States and localities the ability to \nenact their own immigration laws, withholding specific grants from \nsanctuary cities that defy Federal immigration enforcement efforts, \nfacilitating and expediting the removal of criminal aliens, improving \nthe visa issuance process, and, lastly, assisting U.S. Immigration and \nCustoms and Enforcement officers in carrying out their jobs.\n  Another amendment is Wicker amendment No. 1462, which would require \ninformation sharing between Federal and non-Federal agencies regarding \nremoval of aliens, which would allow for quick enforcement against \nindividuals who violate immigration laws. The Wicker amendment would \nalso withhold certain Federal funding from States and local governments \nthat prohibit their law enforcement officers from assisting or \ncooperating with Federal immigration law enforcement.\n  Some of the amendments that we haven't considered would ensure that \nour criminal laws are not weakened by the bill. I have an amendment, \nNo. 1299, that would address some of the provisions in the underlying \nbill that severely weaken our current criminal laws.\n  Isn't that funny. We want to have a better immigration bill, and we \nare going to weaken certain laws that are already on the books?\n  Specifically, my amendment No. 1299 would address language in the \nbill that creates a convoluted and ineffective process for determining \nwhether a foreign national in a street gang should be deemed \ninadmissible or be deported. I offered a similar amendment in committee \nwhere even two Members of the Gang of 8 supported it. My \namendment would have closed a dangerous loophole created by the bill \nthat will allow criminal gang members to gain a path to citizenship.\n\n  Specifically, in order to deny entry and remove a gang member, \nsection 3701 of the bill requires that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity prove a foreign national, No. 1, has a prior Federal felony \nconviction for drug trafficking or a violent crime; No. 2, has \nknowledge that the gang is continuing to commit crimes; and, No. 3, has \nacted in furtherance of gang activity.\n  Even if all of these provisions could be proven, under the bill the \nSecretary can still issue a waiver. As such, the proposed process is \nlimited only to criminal gang members with prior Federal drug \ntrafficking and Federal violent crime convictions and does not include \nState convictions such as rape and murder.\n  The trick is while the bill wants you to believe that this is a \nstrong provision, foreign nationals who have Federal felony drug \ntrafficking or violent crime convictions are already subject to \ndeportation if they are already here and denied entry as being \ninadmissible.\n  The gang provisions, as written in the bill, add nothing to current \nlaw and will not be used. It is, at best, a feel-good measure to say we \nare being tough on criminal gangs while really doing nothing to remove \nor deny entry to criminal gang members.\n  It is easier to prove that someone is a convicted drug trafficker \nthan both a drug trafficker and a gang member. As currently written, \nwhy would this provision ever be used and, simply put, it wouldn't be \nused.\n  My amendment, No. 1299, would strike this do-nothing provision and \nissue a new, clear, simple standard to address the problem of gang \nmembers. It would strike this do-nothing provision and include a \nprocess to address criminal gang members where the Secretary of \nHomeland Security must prove, No. 1, criminal street gang membership; \nand, No. 2, that the person is a danger to the community.\n  Once the Secretary proves these two things, the burden shifts to \nforeign nationals to prove that either he is not dangerous, not in a \nstreet gang, or he did not know the group was a street gang. It is \nstraightforward and it will help remove dangerous criminal gang \nmembers.\n  My amendment also eliminates the possibility of a waiver. Amendment \nNo. 1299 should have a vote to make sure the bill doesn't weaken our \ncurrent law.\n  There are a number of other amendments that we would like to see \nconsidered that would help ensure that individuals comply with the \nimmigration law requirements and ensure that the RPI process does not \nallow individuals to game the system.\n  For example, Rubio amendment No. 1225 would require RPI immigrants 16 \nyears old or older to read, write, and speak English.\n  Fischer amendment No. 1348 would also insert an English-language \nrequirement as a prerequisite to RPI status.\n  Cruz amendment No. 1295 would require States to require proof of \ncitizenship for registration to vote in Federal elections.\n  Hatch amendment No. 1536 would ensure that undocumented immigrants\n\n[[Page S5116]]\n\nactually pay their back taxes before gaining legalization.\n  Another amendment, Toomey amendment No. 1440, would increase the \nnumber of W nonimmigrant visas available during each fiscal year and \nwould help improve the visa system.\n  Other amendments that we should debate and vote on would strengthen \nour immigration system by making sure that we don't allow criminal \nimmigrants to stay in our country and be put on a path to American \ncitizenship.\n  For example, Vitter amendment No. 1330 would make sure that \nundocumented immigrants who have been convicted of crimes of domestic \nviolence, child abuse, and child neglect would be inadmissible.\n  Inhofe amendment No. 1203, entitled ``Keep Our Communities Safe \nAct,'' would allow the Department of Homeland Security or a subsidiary \nagency to keep dangerous individuals in detention until a final order \nof removal of that individual from the United States.\n  Cornyn amendment No. 1470 would make sure undocumented immigrants who \nhave committed an offense of domestic violence, child abuse, child \nneglect, or assault resulting in bodily injury, violated a protective \norder or committed a drunk-driving violation, would be ineligible for \nlegalization.\n  Portman amendment No. 1389 would limit the discretion of immigration \njudges and the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the \nremoval, deportation, and inadmissibility of undocumented individuals \nwho have committed crimes involving child abuse, child neglect, and \nother crimes of moral turpitude concerning children.\n  Finally, Portman amendment No. 1390 would ensure that undocumented \nimmigrants who have been convicted of crimes of domestic violence, \nstalking, and child abuse would be inadmissible.\n  I have gone through a whole bunch of amendments. These are all \nextremely important amendments that would ensure that the worst kinds \nof criminal immigrants do not gain a path to citizenship.\n  I urge the majority to allow us to consider these and other \namendments that we would like to offer to improve the bill, instead of \ncutting us off and shutting off full and open debate of this very \nimportant issue--something that we were told from day one, that we \nwould have an open and fair process.\n  What we are doing, voting this amendment to the House of \nRepresentatives on Thursday and Friday, ends up not being a fair and \nopen process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I rise to speak on the immigration \nbill, and I will do so, particularly on the amendment process my friend \nand colleague from Iowa has discussed, but first let me say a few words \nabout two of the President's nominees whose confirmations we will \naddress later today or within the next day or so.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Penny Pritzker will truly be a great Secretary of Commerce, in my \nview. She has experience and acumen and ability that will serve her \nwell in building strong relationships in the Federal Government, but \nalso strong partnerships with the business community in promoting job \ncreation and fostering sustained economic growth. She has been a strong \nleader not only in her own business, but in her community, and I look \nforward to working with her as the Chair of the Subcommittee on \nCompetitiveness, Innovation, and Export Promotion in the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation where I serve.\n  Mayor Anthony Foxx, if he becomes Secretary of Transportation, \nlikewise has a record of accomplishment as a local official, as a \nstrong mayor, and I look forward to working with him on investment in \nhigh-speed rail, distracted and drunk driving, air safety, rail safety, \nand all of the issues that are so important to the infrastructure of \nour country and to the transportation issues that will help promote \njobs and increase economic progress.\n  I will be submitting statements for the Record at greater length on \nthese two nominees who I believe embody the principle of excellence and \ndedication in public service.\n  Madam President, we are reaching a fateful and extremely important \nmoment in the history of our country when we have the great \nopportunity, the exciting and energizing prospect, of providing a path \nto earned citizenship for 11 million of our fellow residents. They live \nalongside us, in our neighborhoods and communities, and they serve on \ncommunity boards and all kinds of activities where they are \nindistinguishable from citizens except for the fact they are not \ncitizens. There are 11 million people living in the shadows, including \nyoung people brought to this country when they were infants or as \nchildren, who know only English as a language, whose home is here, and \nwho know only this country as their home, whose friends and life are \nhere, their schools, and even the military many of them serve. The \nDREAMers are among those 11 million, and their parents and loved ones \nwho came with them to this country.\n  We have this historic opportunity to provide them with a path to \nearned citizenship. To earn citizenship they are paying back taxes and \npenalties, learning English, if they do not know it already, and \nmeeting the other strong standards and criteria this act provides. \nAlong with enhanced border security and a crackdown on illegal \nemployment, this act provides better skilled people more opportunities \nto come to this country in a program I have helped to lead on, as well \nas lower skilled workers who want to fulfill the American dream.\n  This legislation is about the American dream, and it culminates a \ncareful and cautious and deliberate process led by Chairman Leahy in \nthe Judiciary Committee, where abundant opportunity was afforded to \noffer amendments and have them pass. In fact, a number of my amendments \nadopted in the Judiciary Committee strengthen due process, fight human \ntrafficking, afford opportunities for people to seek release from \nsolitary confinement, and protect American workers, and standards and \ncompensation for American workers, against unfair and illegal \ncompetition from other businesses and other workers based on \nsubstandard conditions and exploitation of workers here.\n  Those kinds of amendments have improved on the very important work \ndone by the Group of 8. I join in thanking them, the Group of 8, those \neight Senators who labored so long and helped to provide such a great \nmodel for us to move forward and improve further.\n  I believe this legislation can be improved. Two amendments I have \noffered would help improve it. The little DREAMers, who are too young \nto qualify right now for the expedited path to citizenship that is \nprovided the DREAMers under S. 744, would be helped by an amendment I \nhave drafted, with support from the great champion of the DREAM Act, \nSenator Durbin, who deserves so much credit for spearheading this \neffort over so many years. I have done this at the State level before \ncoming here as a Senator, when I was attorney general, but Senator \nDurbin has championed their cause year after year, Congress after \nCongress, and so I have joined him in supporting an amendment to this \nbill that would help those littlest of DREAMers, too young now to \nqualify for that expedited citizenship, and to do so if they are in \nschool or otherwise satisfy the criteria the amendment would provide.\n  I also thank Senator Murkowski for cosponsoring this very bipartisan \nmeasure with me so that anyone left out of the DREAM Act because they \nare too young would be covered.\n  A second amendment I believe would improve this bill would provide \nmore whistleblower protections for H-2B visa workers. They come to this \ncountry to work here and they are dependent on their employers to \nremain here. So, naturally, if they are exploited, if illegal working \nconditions subject them to hazards, and if they provide the basis for \nunfair competition because they are paid less than the minimum wage, \nthey are fearful of retaliation when they make complaints because their \nemployer can discharge them and they are then automatically deported. \nSo this whistleblower amendment would provide them with protection. \nThis is essential to making possible their redress and remedy when they \nare victims of illegal violations.\n  Both those amendments would improve this law. But I recognize this \nbill is a huge and historic step forward. It\n\n[[Page S5117]]\n\nis imperfect, but I will not allow the perfect to be the enemy of the \ngood. I will continue to fight for these amendments, these improvements \nin this law--enabling the little DREAMers to have those same \nopportunities as the DREAMers who have been brought to this country and \nnow are here and can contribute so much to our Nation; and I will \ncontinue to fight for whistleblower protections for all workers who may \nbe exploited if they are brought here under visa because whistleblowers \ndeserve that protection. They are protecting not just themselves when \nthey complain, but all workers. But I will vote for this measure even \nif there are no more amendments because I believe this measure fulfills \nthe American dream of opening this country--a Nation of immigrants--to \nothers who have the American dream and see this country as a beacon of \nhope and opportunity.\n  Anyone who doubts it should do what I do regularly. Whenever I have \nthe opportunity on a Friday in Connecticut, I go to our Federal \ncourthouse and attend the naturalization ceremonies. People come there \nwith tears in their eyes, accompanied by their families, neighbors, and \nloved ones to celebrate one of the biggest moments in their lives--\nbecoming a citizen of the United States of America. Many of them come \nafter years of struggle to achieve that status--physical struggle to \nreach our shores, emotional separation from their families abroad, and \nprofessional hard work embodying the best about America. I thank them \nfor becoming U.S. citizens. I thank them for not taking for granted \nwhat all too many of us do--the great privilege and right of being a \ncitizen of the United States.\n  Let us seize this moment as a Nation of immigrants to open our doors \nonce again, open our hearts to those 11 million people who want simply \na path to earned citizenship--a historic and rare moment in our history \nwhere the American people have come together in a deep and enduring \nconsensus that now is the time to strengthen border security, as the \namendment we are considering would do, to crack down on illegal hiring, \nas this bill would do, and to make possible for millions of Americans \nwhat my father did, what others did, which is to become citizens of the \ngreatest country in the history of the world.\n  We owe it to ourselves, as well as to our children, to give them that \nopportunity, and we owe our Nation the opportunity to benefit from \ntheir strengths and talents and energy and, yes, their dedication to \nthe country that has given them this historic opportunity.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, could I ask the distinguished Senator to \nallow me to offer a unanimous consent request?\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I express my appreciation to the Senator for the courtesy.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding rule XXII, at 2:15 p.m. today, the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider Calendar No. 180, under the previous \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. For the information of all Senators, at 2:15 p.m., there \nwill be 30 minutes for debate followed by a vote on the confirmation of \nPenny Pritzker to be Secretary of Commerce.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise today to express my deep \ndisappointment with the current immigration reform legislation and the \nextremely limited opportunity for Senators to amend this bill. Although \nI was not a Member of the Senate in 2009, I watched the debate on \nObamaCare closely. I was amazed the world's greatest deliberative body \ncould vote on such a massive change to Federal policy without having \ntime to read or adequately amend the bill.\n  Failure to fully comprehend the consequences--intended or otherwise--\nleft many Americans skeptical, and rightfully so. We were told the need \nto act justified passage of this massive bill, and we were admonished \nthat we needed to pass the bill to find out what is in it. The American \npeople were not pitched sound policy, the American people were pitched \nsound bites. Public polling suggests the American people still haven't \nbought it, and with good reason.\n  A few years later, Americans are starting to learn the devastating, \nreal-life impact of the flawed health care policy, including the loss \nof current benefits and the sticker shock of rising premiums. The \nlitany of broken promises seems endless. Yet here we are again, another \ndire problem in desperate need of a solution, and this time it is \nimmigration.\n  I agree, and Nebraskans agree, we must address the problem of illegal \nimmigration. The status quo is unacceptable. Our border remains \ndangerously insecure, and 11 million illegal immigrants currently enjoy \nde facto amnesty.\n  We are told there is only one solution--rather, we are only allowed \nto vote on one solution that has been agreed upon behind closed doors \nby the majority leader and a small group of Senators. We are told we \nhave no choice but to pass this bill.\n  The pundits in Washington tell us the failure to pass comprehensive \nimmigration reform will leave the Republican Party in an uncertain \nelectoral wilderness. Well, I, for one, am more concerned about the \nfuture of this Nation--the future America I will leave to my children \nand my grandchildren--than I am about any political party's electoral \nprospects.\n  We are told that simply devoting tens of billions of dollars, with no \nplan, will solve the problem.\n  We have tried throwing big money at big problems in the past. It \ndidn't work then, and it won't work now.\n  Some have suggested there has been plenty of time to read the revised \nbill. They argue there are only 119 pages of changes that have been \nadded to the 1,200-page legislation before us. But those changes are \nspread across and throughout the entire language of this bill. There \nhave been little fixes here and there. But if you blink, you might miss \nan important word that has been dropped or a clause that has been \nadded, and the result is a lasting effect for generations to come.\n  Some of these changes include special carve-outs similar to the \ncornhusker kickback that helped bring ObamaCare across the finish line. \nNebraskans know exactly what I am talking about. These new carve-outs \ninclude special treatment for the seafood industry, special treatment \nfor Hollywood, and extensions of the failed stimulus program.\n  I am disappointed the majority leader has once again rushed a bill of \nthis magnitude and impact. It is another artificial deadline imposed by \nthe leader, so members can make it back for some backyard barbecues. \nThat is disappointing.\n  I don't sit on the Judiciary Committee. The only opportunity I and 82 \nother Members of the Senate have to offer amendments to reform the \nflawed aspects of this bill is through floor debate. Yet we are being \ndenied that opportunity by the majority leader. So far, we have only \nvoted on nine amendments. Given the emotional, controversial, and \ncomplicated nature of this issue, reforms are not made easily. We have \na duty to make sure we get it right and that we avoid the mistakes of \nthe past.\n  I have always believed that before we address any form of legislation \nthat deals with legalization for our undocumented population, we must \nfirst fully secure the border. Without a fully secure border, the \nUnited States will find itself in the same dire straits down the road. \nYet the amendment offered by Senators Schumer, Corker, and Hoeven falls \nshort of this very necessary goal. We need a proposal that brings about \nverifiable, measurable results along the southern border.\n  I support a carefully crafted border security plan that is strategy \ndriven, cost effective, accountable, and responsive to the needs of law \nenforcement officials, and those law enforcement officials have \nexpressed concerns with the legislation before us.\n  The attempt of the Schumer-Corker-Hoeven amendment to reach a \ncompromise on border security metrics has resulted in vague ineffective \nstandards. The border security amendment I filed\n\n[[Page S5118]]\n\nwould provide needed oversight to ensure border security goals are \nbeing achieved and maintained in a timely fashion.\n  The border security amendment I filed requires that the Secretary of \nHomeland Security and the Commissioner of the Customs and Border Patrol \nsubmit a written certification that all border goals have been met. The \nHomeland Security inspector general must also sign off on \ncertification. And, finally, congressional approval must be obtained.\n  Importantly, the definition of operational control in my amendment \nwould maintain the current law's definition, rather than watering it \ndown. But my amendment hasn't received a vote.\n  The Schumer-Corker-Hoeven amendment also fails to require a biometric \nentry and exit system at land, air, and sea ports. Instead, it simply \nprovides a basic electronic screening system--and only at sea and air \nports, not land ports of entry.\n  This is absolutely unacceptable--and it is remarkably weaker than the \nborder security provisions in the 2006 and 2007 comprehensive \nimmigration bills, which required implementation of a biometric entry-\nexit system.\n  The border security amendment I filed implements a biometric entry-\nexit system at all points and ports of entry. But my amendment hasn't \nreceived a vote.\n  Border security is a question of national security. It is not a \nposition that can be watered down or compromised. The Schumer-Corker-\nHoeven amendment does just that.\n  We also need to make sure we are being fiscally responsible. Last \ntime I checked, we are still $17 trillion in debt. Yet this amendment \nthrows $46.3 billion at border security with no plan from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security detailing how that money is going to be \nused. There is no clear justification for the amount detailed in this \nrequest. There is absolutely no strategy driving this funding request.\n  There is also not nearly enough accountability. The reporting \nrequirements to Congress are toothless. I reject--and I suspect \nNebraskans reject--the idea that massive amounts of spending alone are \nthe solution to our border security problem.\n  In addition to the lack of strategy behind the funding, I am \nconcerned this legislation provides legalization first and border \nsecurity second. Specifically, this legislation creates a loophole \nallowing certain people who have overstayed their nonimmigrant visas to \nobtain a green card without returning home. The Schumer-Corker-Hoeven \namendment also creates a number of loopholes for criminal aliens to \nremain in our country.\n  Under their proposal the Secretary of Homeland Security has broad \nauthority to waive deportations for certain criminal activity. For \nexample, it would allow many members of criminal gangs to gain entry \nand the legal right to remain in the country.\n  In a written statement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement council \npresident Chris Crane stated:\n\n       The 1,200 page substitute bill before the Senate will \n     provide instant legalization and a path to citizenship to \n     gang members and other dangerous criminal aliens, and \n     handcuff ICE officers from enforcing immigration laws in the \n     future. It provides no means of effectively enforcing visa \n     overstays which account for almost half of the nation's \n     illegal immigration crisis.\n\n  The list of problems goes on.\n  In short, this legislation and the Schumer-Corker-Hoeven amendment \nremains fatally flawed. The American people demand--and they deserve--\nbetter policy.\n  I am committed to working on lasting solutions that will reform our \nimmigration system once and for all. But let me be clear: I will not \nsupport legislation simply because it might be vogue or politically \nexpedient or could ingratiate me with the inside-the-Beltway club. I \nvote for legislation if it is sound policy, if it will improve the \nlives of hard-working taxpayers, and if it reflects the values of \nNebraskans. This legislation has a long way to go.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Has the Senator ever been to the Arizona-Mexico border?\n  Mrs. FISCHER. I have been, at the Texas border.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask when that was?\n  Mrs. FISCHER. That was in the early 2000s.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In the early 2000s. I would say to the Senator from \nNebraska, she is so ill-informed from the statement I just heard. I \ndon't know where to begin, except to say that if she doesn't think this \nlegislation secures the border, she hasn't spent any time on the \nborder--certainly not meaningful time. And I can't express my \ndisappointment in the series of false statements the Senator just made.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I would say I believe my statement is \ncorrect. It reflects the values of my State, it reflects the values of \nAmericans, and it truly reflects their concerns with this piece of \nlegislation that is before us now.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I would welcome the Senator from \nNebraska to come to the border and see what has been done and what can \nbe done with the use of technology. And to somehow believe our border \ncannot be secured by this legislation argues strenuously for a visit, \nand I invite the Senator. I would be glad to join her at any time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague and \nfriend, Senator McCain from Arizona, and I look forward to accepting \nhis invitation to visit his fine State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise again to talk about \nthe critical importance of passing comprehensive immigration reform \nsuch as my good friend from Arizona Senator McCain has advocated.\n  When I look at my State, Coloradans from all walks of life--business \nleaders, religious leaders, our agricultural community, and our civic \nleaders, regardless of political party--agree our immigration system is \nbroken. Now we have run out of excuses to sit on our hands.\n  I see this problem as an opportunity, and I want to discuss why I see \nit as an opportunity.\n  It has touched every corner of our society, and this call for action \nhas become too loud to ignore. But despite such widespread agreement on \nthe need to move forward, there remains a vocal minority in our \nChamber--and across the country--concerned about the consequences of \nreform.\n  There is a worry, and that worry that persists is that immigrants \nwill somehow steal the American opportunity, that immigrants will take \nour tax dollars and take our jobs. But let me say this. All of us here \nin the Senate agree strongly we should not be writing policy in \nWashington that would endanger American jobs, and I want to speak to \nthat.\n  Ever since the economic downturn, Coloradans who have been fortunate \nenough to keep their jobs or recently find employment as we dig out of \nrecession are holding on tightly to those opportunities.\n  Coloradans who have been laid off or who have lived through the \nbitter desperation of extended unemployment look with increasing \nconcern at anything that might stand between them and opportunity.\n  In the context of these worries, some people look at employed \nimmigrants and see only unemployed Americans. To see things in that \nlight misunderstands this legislation as well as our roots as a country \nand our long tradition of opportunity.\n  This bill--the idea of fixing our broken immigration system and \nproviding millions of Americans a pathway to citizenship, which is \nearned--is not a zero-sum game. In fact, it is built off of one of the \nreasons our Nation is so exceptional: The broad spirit that any man or \nwoman can pull themselves up from the most challenging circumstances \nand succeed.\n  This bill is carefully crafted and balanced. It will extend the \nAmerican dream to millions now living in the shadows. Important for \nColoradans, this legislation creates certainty for businesses and \nresidents already legally here today. This is exactly the\n\n[[Page S5119]]\n\nsort of certainty our labor markets need.\n  It is true--maybe except for the great State of North Dakota--that we \nhave made steady progress, but overall unemployment remains too high. \nWe all want to be similar to North Dakota, with a very low unemployment \nrate. Our economy--the American economy--continues to grow, with \nColorado growing at the fourth fastest rate in the Nation. In doing so, \nmany of our business sectors, economic sectors, and industries are \nexperiencing higher labor demand than there is available domestic \nsupply.\n  Taking agriculture, for example, which is important to the Presiding \nOfficer's State as well, the demand for labor on farms and ranches \nacross the Nation far exceeds the supply of Americans who are willing \nto fill those jobs. That labor shortage has resulted in crops left to \nrot in the fields and, therefore, unacceptable economic losses to our \ncommunities.\n  Farmers and ranchers tell me that today they are often left to hire \nundocumented workers to fill this labor gap. This unregulated, under-\nthe-table hiring hurts immigrants who experience frequent exploitation, \nconstant fear, and often debilitating poverty. It also hurts Americans \nwho experience depressed wages and higher unemployment as a result of \ncompetition with this cheap underground workforce. That doesn't make \nsense.\n  This immigration reform bill eliminates this unfair competition and \nensures that all Americans receive fair wages.\n  Our current labor supply challenges extend to many other sectors as \nwell. Jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math are growing at \nthree times the rate of other jobs in the United States. With that in \nmind, and in spite of high levels of unemployment, nearly 100,000 \nvaluable American-based positions in critical high-tech firms, such as \nIBM, Microsoft, and Intel, have been left unfilled. By 2018, estimates \nare that this number will increase to 230,000.\n  This bill, which we are so close to getting across the finish line, \nfocuses heavily on breaking down barriers in our current immigration \nand visa system to help fill this staggering labor gap and spur our \neconomy in the process. The more flexible market-based system for visas \nincluded in this bill will ensure our immigration system only brings \nworkers businesses need. Moreover, this bill will ensure that Americans \nget a first pass at jobs before foreign workers are eligible to fill \nthem. That is an important element, one that Coloradans have told me \nthey demand.\n  But it is not only about ensuring that the bill before us doesn't \ndisplace current U.S. citizens, I would point out to my friends who are \nskeptical of this effort that immigrants in this country also have an \nincredible and phenomenal history of creating jobs.\n  Let me share a couple numbers with everybody. Between 1990 and 2005, \nimmigrants started 25 percent of the highest growth companies in this \ncountry, directly employing over 200,000 people. Since 2007, immigrant-\nfounded small businesses have provided employment for 4.7 million \npeople and generated almost $800 billion in revenue.\n  Big-time American companies, such as Intel, Google, eBay, and Sun \nMicrosystems, were all created by immigrants--companies that helped to \nform the very roots of our thriving tech industry.\n  I wish to take a minute to thank the Gang of 8 specifically for their \nefforts to include a section in the bill that creates the INVEST \nProgram, which focuses on incentivizing entrepreneurs, such as the \nfounders of these iconic companies, to come to the United States. This \nprogram, which draws on the bipartisan Startup Visa Act I introduced \nwith Senator Flake--and includes the work of Senators Moran, Warner, \nand others--will ensure that the next generation of entrepreneurs and \njob creators can stay in the United States and create good American \njobs. Last week, after listening to advocates, Senator Warner and I \nfiled an amendment that we think will bolster these provisions even \nfurther, and we certainly hope our colleagues will think it is a good \nenough idea to include in the final legislation.\n  Programs in the underlying bill, such as INVEST, will help \nsupercharge our economy by helping to create thousands of jobs over the \nnext decade.\n  Ralph Waldo Emerson once said: ``America is another word for \nopportunity.'' We take pride in our rich history of being a country \nwhere the key to earning a valued place in society is through ability \nand determination, where immigrants from all over the world--alongside \nthird-and fourth-generation Americans--can earn an honest living or \nstart a business. It is incumbent on us, as Members of Congress, to \nactively ensure that America remains the land of opportunity.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, that starts with our children, \nincluding undocumented children, our DREAMers, who know of no other \nplace but here as their home.\n  I wish to close by talking about a DREAMer. His name is Oscar. I wish \nto make the case for Oscar and his family.\n  Oscar and his brothers, Juan and Hugo, are the children of parents \nwho illegally immigrated into the United States and brought their kids \nwith them. They now live in my State of Colorado. Throughout their \nentire lives, they lived in fear of the black cloud of deportation that \nhas hung over them.\n\n  I had the pleasure of meeting Oscar here in Washington a couple of \nmonths ago. He had a very simple request for a kid who grew up in the \nUnited States. He wanted the opportunity for himself and his brothers \nto come out of the shadows and become someone.\n  Where are Oscar and his brothers right now? They are in college \npursuing degrees in engineering and psychology. Let's design a \ncommonsense policy that will allow them to work after they graduate. \nLet's give Oscar, and the millions like him, the opportunity to come \nout of the shadows and become the next generation of American leaders, \ninnovators, and job creators.\n  This week we are faced with a choice: We can put into place a bill \nthat was negotiated by Members of both sides of the aisle, one that \ntakes historic and far-reaching steps to secure our borders and \nprovides a tough but fair pathway to legal status and an exit from the \nshadows for those who are here illegally. This bill will help crack \ndown on employer exploitation and help give American businesses the \nsecure and stable workforce they deserve. The other option would be to \ntry and delay this bill and continue on with a broken system that \ncontinually undermines our economy by keeping millions in the shadows. \nWe could keep the system that denies the best and the brightest a \nviable path to citizenship and instead would encourage them to create \njobs abroad for our global competitors such as China and India.\n  Let's not deny Oscar and his brothers the opportunity to come out of \nthe shadows and be the next generation of American workers. Let's \ncontinue to work on amendments, and let's pass this comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill this week.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for her patience, for her forbearance.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/25/senate-section/article/S5119-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Penny Pritzker, of \nIllinois, to be Secretary of Commerce.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 30 minutes \nof debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, for those who are following the debate \nof the Senate, we are in the midst of the debate on the immigration \nreform bill, expecting votes on amendments this\n\n[[Page S5120]]\n\nweek, and then final passage. It is a historic and important measure. \nWe have interrupted it briefly to consider a nomination that is \nimportant as well. It is the nomination by President Obama of Penny \nPritzker of Chicago to be the next Secretary of Commerce in the \nPresident's Cabinet.\n  I know Penny and I know her family and I know the reputation they \nenjoy in Chicago, in Illinois, and around the world. She is an \nextraordinary person. The Pritzker family has been successful in \nbusiness for many decades and many generations. She stepped up years \nago and told her father she wanted to play a role in business \nleadership. There weren't that many women involved in business \nleadership at that time, but her father said he would give her an \nopportunity, and he did. She became very successful with the \ncorporation, with the family businesses, and has made a name for \nherself over the years.\n  Penny has decades of business, entrepreneurial, and, equally \nimportant for this job, civic experience. Despite her success in the \nprivate sector, Penny Pritzker and her family have given unsparingly of \ntheir own time to help many important causes. She understands business \nand economic development, but she also understands the reality of the \nchallenges many families face across our country.\n  We know the jobs report from earlier this month showed we had 6.9 \nmillion jobs created over 39 consecutive months of private sector job \ngrowth. That is progress. We have come a long way. But let's make no \nmistake, families are still struggling to find work and many who are \nworking are struggling paycheck to paycheck to survive. Penny Pritzker \nwill bring considerable experience to the Department of Commerce to \nhelp us create new businesses and job opportunities in America.\n  Penny understands what it takes to build a business from scratch. She \nhas done it five different times with startup businesses. She has \ncreated jobs that support families and communities across America.\n  More than creating jobs, she has helped countless people get the \neducation they need to connect them with job opportunities.\n  She leads Skills for America's Future, a national program bringing \ntogether businesses, community colleges, and others, preparing workers \nfor good-paying 21st century jobs.\n  In addition to education, Penny Pritzker is an ardent supporter of \nthe arts, which supports economic development and tourism across the \nNation. She is a member of the American Academy of the Arts and \nSciences and a trustee of the Kennedy Center.\n  There is no question that our economy is headed in the right \ndirection. The question is: Who will pursue today's efforts to continue \nthat growth and lead us to future success? Who will continue efforts to \nhelp American businesses in the global marketplace?\n  Although we are on the right track, too many businesses in America \nare still struggling to survive. Expanding the new markets is one way \nto help American business and our economy. We need a Secretary of \nCommerce who will not only help small businesses grow and create jobs \nbut also open opportunities for businesses to expand their products and \nservices across the States, the country, and the globe.\n  Penny Pritzker called me a couple of weeks ago and urged me, if \npossible, to do everything I could to try to get her nomination moving \nbefore July. I talked to Senator Reid, who was fully supportive of the \nPresident's nominee. The reason she is anxious to do that is because \nimportant trade discussions are going to begin after the 1st of July \nwith some of the leading economic powers around the world. She wanted \nto be at that table. It is important for America that she is.\n  Penny knows what it takes to make business work. She knows the tools \nbusinesses need. What is more, she knows economic development at all \nlevels.\n  Colleagues from both sides of the aisle agree we need job creation. \nPenny Pritzker has a proven track record in promoting jobs and growth, \nand her leadership will help our country. Her decades of experience \nwill serve her well. Ms. Pritzker's wide-ranging perspective will prove \nworthwhile to the future of our Nation as we compete in the global \nmarketplace.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Ms. Penny Pritzker's nomination, and \nI look forward to working with her as she is hopefully going to be the \nnext Secretary of Commerce under the Obama administration.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I also rise in support of Penny Pritzker \nfor Secretary of Commerce. I think she will do an excellent job.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for 3 or 4 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Honoring Ken Duke\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I rise today to honor Ken Duke of Hope, \nAR. Ken is an incredible athlete who has a great story and is actually \nhere with us today.\n  Years ago, as a teenager, Ken was diagnosed with scoliosis and he was \nforced for years to wear a back brace. There were times when he had to \nwear that back brace for 23 hours a day. He underwent surgery and \nnumerous treatments. Eventually they put a metal rod in his spine and \nthe rod is still there today.\n  Despite all of those tough circumstances, he persevered. He went on \nto win his high school district golf tournament. He was wearing the \nback brace, no less.\n  In recent years, Ken became a strong advocate for those suffering \nfrom spinal problems. He now hosts an annual charity golf tournament \ncalled ``A Day with Duke.''\n  Anyway, after playing golf for Henderson State University--and might \nI say, Go Reddies--he turned professional. As do many professional \ngolfers, he had his good days and bad days, his ups and downs. It is a \ntough life. He has been out there plugging away week in and week out. \nBut this past Sunday Ken had one of his best days of golf he has ever \nhad in his career. At the Travelers Championship in Cromwell, CT, Duke \nfaced a tense playoff with Chris Stroud. After Stroud had chipped in on \nthe 18th hole, the men were neck and neck, both at 12 under par. But \nKen pushed ahead, making a 2\\1/2\\ foot birdie putt on the second \nplayoff hole to clinch his first PGA tour victory. This was not only a \ngreat shot and a great round of golf, but it is also a great American \nstory.\n  Arkansas is very proud of Ken, and we hope there are many wins in his \nfuture. I wanted to say ``congratulations.''\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I have the honor to chair the \nCommerce Committee and thus have enormous interest in who our next \nCommerce Secretary is going to be. I don't think the President could \nhave picked anybody better.\n  I have known Penny Pritzker for 30 years. I have Chicago relations in \nmy family too. She is a force of nature. That is the thing I want \npeople to understand: She is a force of nature. Yes, she is wealthy. \nYes, she is experienced in business. Yes, she is experienced in public \nservice. She is a tiger of energy and purpose.\n  The Department of Commerce is probably the most complicated--I don't \nknow compared to DOD, but I think it is the most complicated non-DOD \nagency. We have oceans, spectrum, aviation, trains. There are a \nthousand different areas, including all the oceans. It takes a real \nleader and it takes a tough person. We haven't had a tough enough \nperson for a while. We had one, but then because of health reasons that \nperson had to resign.\n  I cannot imagine a better--and I don't say these things often about \nnominees--I cannot imagine a more perfect person to run the Department \nof Commerce than Penny Pritzker. I hope my colleagues will vote for her \noverwhelmingly.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor, and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n\n[[Page S5121]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to speak once again on the \nimmigration bill before us.\n  Before there was a Judiciary Committee markup, before there was an \nimmigration bill, and before there was even a Gang of 8, most Senators \nhad three basic beliefs: The immigration system is broken, fixing it \nwill be neither simple nor easy, and it absolutely needs to be done.\n  I share those beliefs. I also rely on two sets of experience.\n  I served in this body and on the Judiciary Committee during the 99th \nCongress when we considered the Immigration Reform and Control Act of \n1986, commonly called the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, and during the 110th \nCongress when we considered the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of \n2007.\n  I voted against both of them. I opposed the 1986 legislation because \nit was self-proclaimed amnesty. I opposed the 2007 legislation because \nit had been developed outside of the Judiciary Committee.\n  My participation in the current immigration reform effort has been \ninformed by those beliefs and those experiences. We simply must fix our \nbroken immigration system, but in doing so we must not repeat either \nthe substantive errors from 1986 or the procedural errors from 2007.\n  As we all know, most of the media and political attention has focused \non the border security and legalization parts of this bill. But there \nis much more to it than that.\n  I initially focused on two areas. First, working with Senators Rubio, \nCoons, and Klobuchar, I focused on increasing opportunities for high-\nskilled immigrants. The bill we introduced, the I-Squared bill, now has \n28 bipartisan cosponsors.\n  Second, working with Senators Rubio, Feinstein, and Bennet, I focused \non developing the guest worker program that will be so important for \nthe agricultural sector of our economy. Those discussions were led by \nSenator Feinstein, and there is no question I played a significant role \nin those. This program is the product of true compromise between farm \nworkers and growers. I had real questions whether that could be done, \nbut it was. I was glad to see it included as part of the Gang of 8 \noriginal bill.\n  Another important provision that was made part of the original bill \nwas my proposal for permanently extending a visa program for religious \nworkers. This provision will provide up to 5,000 visas for foreign \nnationals to work with religious organizations that help America's \nneediest people and underserved communities. I have supported this \nprogram for many years and am very grateful that the Gang of 8 offered \nto include it in the bill at my request.\n  In addition, I commend the Judiciary Committee chairman, Senator \nLeahy, for conducting an open, fair, and thorough markup of S. 744. \nThankfully, this bill--unlike the bill in 2007--is being handled \nthrough regular order.\n  During the committee's consideration of S. 744, I filed 24 \namendments, 20 of them within Judiciary Committee jurisdiction. I am \nproud of the fact that 15 of those 20 amendments were made part of the \nlegislation that is before us now. I do not think ``proud'' is the \nword; I am pleased rather than proud.\n  For example, the committee adopted by voice vote my amendment \nestablishing strong penalties for cultivating marijuana on Federal \nlands. Mexican drug cartels are driving the expansion of this plague, \nusing chemicals and diverting water sources that also harm the \nenvironment. My amendment will reduce the illegal drugs that enter the \nmarket and protect America's natural resources at the same time.\n  The committee also adopted my amendment to establish a mandatory \nbiometric exit system at the 10 busiest international airports. \nPreventing individuals from entering the country illegally is only one \nside of the coin; the other side, of course, is preventing individuals \nfrom overstaying their visas. We know if that works in those airports, \nwe then will be encouraged to expand that in many other ways.\n  Nearly half of those who are currently here illegally came into the \ncountry legally but did not leave when they were supposed to. My \namendment tackles part of that equation.\n  I do want to respond to what some of my colleagues have said about \nthis new biometric system. Some have claimed that my amendment dials \nback current law.\n  Let me be clear: I fully support the biometric exit system provided \nfor under current law. Sadly, it has not been properly implemented.\n  What good is it if legislation simply remains on paper? Do the \ncritics of my amendment prefer the status quo, which has accomplished \nabsolutely nothing?\n  My amendment will actually deploy a real biometric exit system--\nsomething that current law has failed to do. And, by the way, it is \nfully paid for.\n  Trust me. This is more than just a figleaf. The Judiciary Committee \nalso adopted--once again by voice vote--my amendment to improve \neducation and training in the fields of science, technology, \nengineering, and math, or the STEM fields.\n  While foreign high-skilled workers play an important part in our \neconomy, we need to invest more in developing the American workforce, \nespecially the next generation. I look forward to seeing the STEM \naccount grow and provide hundreds of millions of dollars directly to \nthe States for this critical education and training. That is in the \nbill now.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Judiciary Committee adopted a \npackage of my amendments establishing a coherent and constructive \napproach to high-skilled immigration. These provisions will ensure that \nthe H-1B and L-1 visa categories actually work for a change. I \nespecially want to thank Senators Schumer and Durbin for their genuine \nwillingness to compromise because these complex issues require a \ndelicate balance of interests.\n  This is the path I have pursued so far. From the outset of this \nprocess, I have made it clear that there are issues with this bill \nunder the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. As the ranking member \nof the Finance Committee, I have been working in good faith to ensure \nthat those matters are addressed in a responsible and productive way.\n  Toward that end, I filed amendments both in committee and on the \nSenate floor and have been working with my colleagues to get them \nincluded.\n  These are important issues that simply cannot be overlooked. For \nexample, there was the issue of whether immigrants receiving a change \nin status would be allowed to receive welfare benefits. Under a \nlongstanding provision of Federal law, noncitizens, including legal \nimmigrants, are not eligible for Federal cash welfare benefits for \ntheir first 5 years in the country.\n  While S. 744 preserved that 5-year ban for RPIs, I know the Obama \nadministration believes it has the authority to permit States to spend \nFederal welfare dollars on cash benefits to previously prohibited \nindividuals. In order to prevent this or future administrations from \ncontravening Federal welfare law, we needed to clarify that the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services cannot permit Federal welfare \ndollars from being spent on noncitizens. That is a system I am not \nwilling to support, and I am pleased they accepted my amendment in \nsolving that problem.\n  Today I am pleased to report that we have successfully negotiated \nprovisions that will prevent the administration from waiving the 5-year \nban on welfare benefits as well as prohibiting the Secretary from \npermitting this type of spending. They have been included as part of \nthe compromise package we will be voting on later this week.\n  Another problem with the original bill was that it did not adequately \naddress Social Security. Specifically, the bill did not state how \nperiods of unauthorized employment would be treated in the calculation \nof Social Security benefits.\n  Once again, I have worked with my colleagues to reach an agreement on \na provision that says that periods of unauthorized earnings do not \ncount toward determining Social Security benefits. The provision will, \namong other things, prevent people who did not\n\n[[Page S5122]]\n\nhave authorization to work in this country from going back and \nretroactively claiming unauthorized periods of work in which they used \nmade-up or stolen Social Security numbers.\n  This is a necessary step that will help to preserve the integrity of \nour Social Security system. As with the provision on welfare benefits, \nthis provision is part of the Leahy compromise amendment.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee \non Taxation, this provision will result in lower spending for Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  While I am pleased that we have been able to reach agreement on these \nimportant issues, there are other Finance Committee issues that have \nnot been addressed. There is the issue of when those on the RPI or blue \ncard pathways will be eligible for tax credits and health insurance \npremium subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. I filed an amendment \nthat would have placed those subsidies in the same category as other \nFederal means-tested programs, which, of course, includes a 5-year \nwaiting period once an immigrant attains the status of a lawful \npermanent resident.\n  There is also the issue of back taxes. I filed an amendment that \nwould have required all RPI applicants to pay their back taxes as a \ncondition of receiving a change in status.\n  Neither of these two issues is adequately addressed by the current \nversion of the legislation. In my view, these are serious problems that \nwill need to be fixed before the bill is suitable for the President's \nsignature.\n  On top of that, there is still the issue of border security. While \nthe compromise legislation we will be voting on this week significantly \nimproves upon the original draft of this bill, I believe we can and \nshould do more.\n  So as you see, Madam President, there is still a number of issues \nthat need to be resolved. However, as I have said all along, this is a \nprocess. Reporting the bill out of the Judiciary Committee was one step \nin that process, and passing the bill on the Senate floor is another \nstep--a first step.\n  I do not think anyone should be under any illusions that when the \nSenate completes its work on the legislation this week, the process is \nfinished. The House of Representatives is working on its own bill with \nan entirely different approach. I have already begun reaching out to my \nHouse colleagues to help address these issues that I believe are \nimportant, particularly those that fall under the jurisdiction of the \nSenate Finance Committee.\n  I hope the House will work to address what I see as significant \nshortcomings in the Senate bill, and I will work hard to ensure that \nthose issues are resolved should the bill go to conference.\n  With that in mind, I plan to vote in favor of S. 744 later this week. \nAs I said before, I share the belief of most of my colleagues that the \ncurrent immigration system is broken and that reform is absolutely \nnecessary. As I see it, the only way we can reach that goal is to allow \nthe process to move forward.\n  Once again, I would like to commend my colleagues for their work on \nthis legislation thus far. I hope they will keep an open mind on future \nchanges as well. While the final product is far from perfect, I believe \nwe are on a path to reaching a reasonable solution to the problems that \ncontinue to plague our Nation's immigration system.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle and on both sides of the Capitol to move this process forward \ntoward a successful conclusion.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. In fact, I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Penny Pritzker, of Illinois, to be Secretary of Commerce?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

It was a clear, good vote for our new Commerce \nSecretary. We are very excited about that vote, 97 to 1. I am going to \nspeak to that, but before I do, I yield to my colleague from the State \nof Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, for 2 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I will speak as in morning business for \nup to 2 or 3 minutes. I just wish to take a point of personal \nprivilege.\n  As we get to the end of this immigration debate and hopefully have a \nfinal vote on this bill sometime this week, it is a very important \nissue for our country, and there have been any number of Senators who \nhave been involved in trying to negotiate a very complex and tough \nbill. The Gang of 8 has done a terrific job, in my view, of managing \nlots of very controversial aspects to this bill. But a group of us, not \nconnected directly to the Gang of 8, have been working on a group of \namendments that are not central to the bill or rather potentially--\npotentially, let me say--noncontroversial. We have been working with \nRepublicans and Democrats parallel to the Gang of 8. I only ask the \nleadership on both sides, the Republican leadership, the Democratic \nleadership, to please look at the list that has been submitted for the \nrecord not once, not twice, not three times but five times--a list that \nhas been well circulated--and if there are any objections to the \nspecific ideas in the bill--not objections to the amendments but \nspecific objections to the ideas of the amendments, the substance of \nthe amendments--please talk with me and I will be happy to do \neverything I can to resolve any concerns.\n  As the Senator from Arizona knows so well--he has been in the middle \nof this debate for a long time now--there have been hundreds of \namendments offered in the Judiciary Committee and voted on and there \nare over 250 amendments pending on the floor, some of\n\n[[Page S5123]]\n\nwhich are extremely controversial. The Republicans would like to vote \non some of those, there are others the Democrats want to vote on, and I \nam fine to vote on all of them or none of them. I will stay here all \nnight and vote on them. I don't have a dog in that hunt. What I have is \na relatively small group of amendments that Republicans and Democrats \nwho are not in the Gang of 8 have voted on or have been talking about \nand working on that, to our knowledge--and our knowledge may not be \ncomplete--have no voiced opposition against them, and we are hoping \nthat whatever agreement is reached, this list of noncontroversial \namendments would at least be given a chance for a voice vote in global. \nWe don't need individual votes. We don't need a record vote. We just \nwould like to have our voices heard.\n  I see the Senator from Arizona, and I don't know if he wants to \nrespond to this, but I am happy if he wants to ask me a question or \ntwo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Again, I can't speak for Senator Grassley, who is \nmanaging the bill in an outstanding fashion, but I would like to point \nout, in conversations I have had with Senator Grassley, these \namendments are in process, and as the Senator mentioned, there are a \nnumber of them being cleared. In other words, rather than just being \njudged noncontroversial, which I certainly accept the word of the \nSenator from Louisiana, we need to clear them with everybody. I hope \nshe understands, and I hope we can move forward rather rapidly with \nthat process.\n  I don't dispute they are ``noncontroversial,'' but every Senator \nobviously wants to have these amendments cleared with them, and they \nhave already started that process. I appreciate the advocacy and the \ninvolvement of the Senator from Louisiana. She has been extraordinarily \ninvolved in this issue by helping us make the package much better, and \nI hope she will show some more--I emphasize more--patience as we try to \nget this package agreed to by both sides.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Arizona, and I will show more \npatience. Everyone on the floor is showing a lot of patience with this \nvery complicated bill, but I have asked privately and I will ask \npublicly for the process of clearing--clearing--noncontroversial \namendments to begin.\n  There is also a process going on to clear votes on controversial \namendments. I am aware of that--to clear votes--and a time agreement on \ncontroversial amendments. I am not asking for that. I am asking for \nclearances to begin for no votes, voice vote only, on noncontroversial \namendments, and I am glad I have the Senator's support to look at that \nand, hopefully, we can work something out.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Louisiana yield for \na question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Louisiana, as Senator McCain \nsaid, for her continued patience. I think what she proposes makes a \ngreat deal of sense. There are a whole lot of amendments--and we did \nthis in committee under Senator Leahy's leadership--that are not \ncontroversial and we could vote for. My only question is, I take it the \nSenator assumes, once they are cleared, they would be voted en bloc.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Correct, by voice.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. OK. I think this makes sense. We are working on the ones \nthat require votes. We should be working simultaneously on the ones \nthat are noncontroversial, and let us hope we can come to some \nagreement so we can all vote on this bill and move on to other \nbusiness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I first wish to thank the Gang of 8 and \nour Judiciary Committee for their work. As was discussed in the last \nfew minutes, there has been an incredible amount of patience and hard \nwork that has gone into this bill, and I am very hopeful we will be \nable to work out the remaining issues and amendments. I think the \nstrong vote yesterday showed an incredible sense of momentum and \nbipartisan compromise.\n\n\n                          Pritzker Nomination\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Speaking of bipartisanship, I wish to address the \nrecent vote, the 97-to-1 vote, for Ms. Penny Pritzker. This is a very \npositive development at a time when we are seeing a lot of nominations \nthat have been stalled out. As a member of the Commerce Committee, I \nwish to spend a few minutes talking about her nomination.\n  I think we all know she is extremely well qualified. Over the course \nof her career, she has started and led a number of business ventures in \na wide range of industries, such as finance, real estate, hospitality, \nand transportation. She has been an advocate for business and assisted \ncompanies in expanding into new markets. She is also a member of the \nPresident's Economic Recovery Advisory Board and is chairman of Skills \nfor America's Future, helping to prepare workers for the 21st century.\n  When I met with Ms. Pritzker, I was impressed not only by her \nexperienced command of what is going on right now with our economy, \nobviously, but also her understanding of the Department. As we know, \nthe Department oversees the International Trade Administration, the \nPatent Office, the Economic Development Administration, the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and many others. But beyond \nthat, we talked about the fact the Commerce Secretary can actually be \nan advocate for business today and for jobs today.\n  I think one thing long overdue is looking at our top exporting \nindustries in America--whether it is farm machinery, agriculture, \nmovies, all of our top exporting industries, medical devices--and \nseeing what we can do to help them expand in our country, not in other \ncountries, so they are exporting to the world.\n  My State has been built on exports over the last few years. We have \nan unemployment rate of 5.3 percent. Certainly, the growth is due in \npart to the fact we have recovered now 93 percent of the jobs lost in \nthe downturn in our State, but it is a lot about exports and it is also \na lot about tourism, something with which Ms. Pritzker is well \nacquainted. I think this is literally the low-hanging fruit when it \ncomes to exports. We lost 16 percent in international tourism since 9/\n11, and every point we add back is 161,000 jobs--161,000 jobs--right in \nthis country.\n  We are starting to do that now. We are starting to do that now \nbecause we are finally advertising our country under Brand USA, \nsomething the Department of Commerce is greatly involved in overseas, \nbut also because we are speeding up the wait time for visas, something \nthe State Department and the Commerce Department have worked jointly \non.\n  Every visa we get down to 2 to 3 days for a tourist visa means \nsomeone will choose to visit the Mall of America in Bloomington or \nchoose to visit Las Vegas or choose to visit South Carolina instead of \ngoing to another country, instead of going to London or instead of \ngoing to Singapore. We want them to come to the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I think this is a big part of the job the Commerce Secretary will \nneed to do to continue the improvements we have seen with tourism, to \nmake sure everyone knows they can have a great vacation in West \nVirginia and to keep that message going.\n  Another part of why I am excited about Ms. Pritzker in this job is \nbecause we are seeing more and more women in the workplace, as we know. \nWe just did a report on that with the Joint Economic Committee. We need \nto see even more women in areas they haven't been involved in as much, \nsuch as manufacturing. The share of women workers in the manufacturing \nindustry has been declining since 1990 and is now at 27 percent, the \nlowest level since 1971. At the same time, we have job openings in \nmanufacturing, and we need people to be trained in the new skills for \ntoday's manufacturing. This is no longer your grandpa's factory floor. \nThere are new skills needed in robotics, advanced degrees, and others \nto run the equipment, to make the equipment, and to repair the \nequipment.\n  On a more general matter with women--and this is something we \ndiscussed at our commerce hearing with\n\n[[Page S5124]]\n\nMs. Pritzker--we just have 17 percent of board seats across \nmanufacturing, 12 percent of executives, and 6 percent of CEOs. So \nthere is a lot of work that can be done there.\n  I am very excited about this nomination and the work that is ahead \nfor Ms. Pritzker, and I am glad to see such strong bipartisan support \nin the Senate.\n\n\n                            NLRB Nominations\n\n  As we continue to negotiate the immigration bill, I would like to \ntalk about one more issue that is vitally important to our country's \nmiddle class. I just focused on some of the business issues--whether it \nis reducing redtape for our businesses, making sure we bring our debt \ndown in a reasonable way or simply looking industry by industry at what \nwe can do to make sure our market share increases--our global market \nshare in America--but we also have the issue of America's workers.\n\n  While I am here, I wish to talk about something vitally important to \nour country's middle class; that is, moving forward with the \nPresident's nominations for the National Labor Relations Board so it \ncan get back to work protecting the rights of working Americans and \nemployers.\n  Over the course of the last few months, the President has nominated a \nfull slate of five very qualified people to serve on the NLRB--three \nDemocrats and two Republicans--all of whom have sterling credentials \nand a track record of focusing on results and working across the aisle.\n  The first two nominees were named in February--February--the month we \ncelebrate Valentine's Day, and we are now headed to the Fourth of July. \nThe remaining three were nominated at the beginning of April. Yet we \nstill haven't had a vote. In May, the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee held a hearing on the five nominees to the NLRB. \nThis was an important first step, and I commend Chairman Harkin for \nmoving forward on these nominations. However, until these nominees are \nconfirmed and the NLRB is up and running, workers and businesses will \ncontinue to face uncertainty.\n  The NLRB rules impact people's daily lives and reflect our values as \na country: child labor laws that prevent young kids from being \nexploited and forced to work instead of going to school, fair pay laws \nwhich ensure women get equal compensation for equal work, laws that \nmandate decent working conditions to protect people from being hurt or \ninjured on the job, and laws that uphold the fundamental rights of \nworkers to organize. The impact of the NLRB is critical to workers.\n  The Board is the only option available to employers and companies \nthat become the victim of unfair labor actions or run into barriers \nduring negotiations with labor unions. This is for both sides. It is \nthere for employers and for workers. We have a responsibility to show \nsome leadership and begin the process of vetting these nominees in the \nSenate so the NLRB can get back to work.\n  This is about providing stability and consistency to workers and \nbusinesses, but it is also about doing what is right for American \nfamilies. My mom was a teacher. She taught public school until she was \n70 years old, so I have seen firsthand how important it is for workers \nto have that right to organize, to have that right to make their case. \nThis is why I have always believed we need a good NLRB, a fair NLRB.\n  We have a President who has put up five nominees, three Democrats, \ntwo Republicans. The last time I checked, this President won the \nelection and he has the right to nominate people for this job.\n  America was built on a strong middle class, and the NLRB is a \ncritical agency for keeping America moving forward, for ensuring every \nperson can work a steady job, with good wages, provide for their \nfamilies, and save a little for the future. So there is much at stake, \nand I urge my colleagues to put politics aside and allow the Senate to \nmove forward with consideration of the full package of five nominees to \nthe National Labor Relations Board.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, we are debating this historic \ncomprehensive immigration reform, something that as a member of the \nJudiciary Committee I have worked long and hard on, and actually worked \nback in 2007 when I first got to the Senate. I can't tell you the \ndifference it is doing this 5 years later than it was back in 2007. \nThis time we have a coalition that is incredibly strong, that has \nwithstood a lot of different questions and issues about this bill, that \nhas been able to accommodate concerns raised within the Gang of 8 and \nthen on the Judiciary Committee level, and now after last night's vote \nadding other requests and other things Members have. But I want to \nemphasize why this bill is so important from an economic standpoint.\n  When we were in the Judiciary Committee, we had hearings and we had a \nnumber of people testify about the bill and what this bill would do in \nterms of the debt--something I know the Presiding Officer cares about \nvery much. We had a number of Republican economists come forward and \ntalk about how this bill reduces the debt. There were some early \nfigures out there. Then I held a hearing on the Joint Economic \nCommittee and called Grover Norquist as a witness. I was the first \nDemocratic Senator I know of to call Grover Norquist as my witness. But \nhe came forward and talked about the effects this bill would have in \nterms of reducing the debt. Lo and behold, last week we got the true \nnumbers from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office which showed \nthat in fact this bill reduces the debt by $197 billion in 10 years. \nThen in response to a request from Senator Sessions, they also looked \nat the 20-year figure, and it showed it reduces the debt by $700 \nbillion in 20 years. This is one example of what you are seeing with \nthis bill.\n  We are going to see immigrant workers who have been in the shadows \ncome out to get on a path to citizenship that will take 13 years, who \nwill have to pay taxes, will have to pay fines, will have to learn \nEnglish if they don't know English. They will have to show their \nrecords and make sure they don't have any significant criminal records \nin order to gain citizenship. But it also means they will be paying \ntaxes that will contribute to the well-being of this country, and they \nwill be paying into systems they haven't been paying into before that \nhelp other Americans.\n  The other point economically is the fact we are going to see a better \nlegal immigration system. That is what our country was built on. \nEveryone came from another country, when you look at the history of our \ncountry. For me, it was Slovenian and Swiss immigrants. My grandfather \nworked 1,500 feet underground in mines and never even graduated from \nhigh school. He saved money in a coffee can to send my dad to college. \nMy mom's side of the family came from Switzerland. My grandmother ran a \ncheese shop. So I am here standing on the floor of the Senate on the \nshoulders of immigrants, a grandfather who worked in the mines and \nanother grandparent who worked in a cheese factory. Those are my \nimmigrant roots. We all have them. We have to remember what this bill \nis about, and we have to remember that 90 of our Fortune 500 companies \nwere actually formed by immigrants--200 formed by children of \nimmigrants--and 30 percent of our U.S. Nobel laureates born in other \ncountries.\n  So when we look at this, yes, we have to look at the enforcement side \nand enforcement of the border. That is incredibly important. But we \nalso have to look at the economic engine of America that brought us to \nwhere we are and where we want to head and how we are going to compete \ninternationally. We do that by welcoming in America's talent, which \nwill be our talent--most of which is homegrown but some of which comes \nfrom other countries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Minnesota \nfor her remarks and say how much I appreciate her work on this \nlegislation, on the Judiciary Committee and beyond.\n  The chairman is here today. I wish to thank him for his leadership \nboth on the committee and on the floor.\n  One way or another, something important is going to happen here this\n\n[[Page S5125]]\n\nweek--which should happen more regularly than it does, but it does not, \nin the 4 years I have been here; that is, a bill that actually is the \nresult of thoughtful bipartisan--in some cases I even describe it as \nnonpartisan--work that has been done first by the so-called Gang of 8 \nthat I was pleased to be part of, then in the Judiciary Committee \nitself, and now on the floor of the Senate.\n  Before I talk about immigration, I want to mention we are still \nstruggling out in Colorado this summer with these terrible wildfires. \nWe have appreciated the Federal cooperation we have received. It is a \nreminder to me, when I stand on this floor, how important it is for us \nto get past this partisan gridlock we have and into a position where we \nare actually making shared decisions that will allow us, among other \nthings, to do the investments we need to do to make sure our forests \nhave the fire mitigation that will prevent them from catching and \nburning the way they are this summer in Colorado.\n  Today we have the opportunity to try to work together on immigration. \nOpponents have come out and said this bill is going to cost us money, \nthis bill is going to make the deficit worse. It is exactly the \nopposite. The Congressional Budget Office has said if we pass this \nbill, we will see nearly $1 trillion of deficit reduction over 20 \nyears. This Congressional Budget Office tells us it will increase our \ngross domestic product by 5.4 percent over that same period of time. So \nthis bill is a deficit reduction bill. People around here who talk \nabout deficit reduction--and I am one of them--finally have a chance to \ndo it in a thoughtful and measured way, in a useful and constructive \nway, rather than through a series of mindless across-the-board cuts \nwhich we have seen as a consequence of the sequester. Even in \nWashington, DC, $1 trillion is real money. That is one reason we ought \nto pass this bill.\n  Another reason we ought to pass this bill is it creates a visa system \nthat is actually aligned to the economic needs of the United States of \nAmerica. Forty percent of Fortune 500 companies have been founded by \nimmigrants. Nearly 1 in 10 business owners in Colorado are immigrants \nand generate $1.2 billion for our State's economy. Agriculture is a $40 \nbillion industry in Colorado, and tourism is Colorado's second largest \nindustry.\n\n  We have a growing high-tech sector in Colorado, and 23.6 percent of \nSTEM graduates from our State research universities are immigrants. We \nwant them to earn those degrees if they are doing it in the United \nStates and then stay here in the United States, build businesses in \nthis country, invest in our future with us in this country. Today, \nbecause we have a broken immigration system, we are saying to those \ngraduates, Go back to China and compete with us; go back to India and \ncompete with us; we have no use for your talents here in this country.\n  This bill fixes that. This bill has very important border security \nmeasures and measures to prevent future illegal immigration. I thank \nthe Senator from Tennessee, who is on the floor, for his remarkable \nwork with Senator Hoeven to get us to this point. The agreement on \nborder security, which maintains a real and attainable pathway to \ncitizenship which was a bottom line for the Gang of 8 Senators who were \nworking on this bill, was the result of several Senators who were \nwilling and determined to find a way to get this done. So I thank \nSenator Corker, I thank Senator Hoeven, and I thank Senator McCain and \nthe other Republican Members of the Gang of 8 for getting us here. This \nis how the Senate should work--a process that leads to principled \ncompromise.\n  On the border security amendment, some opponents of fixing our broken \nimmigration system continue to say our bill doesn't do enough to secure \nthe border. No reasonable person could look at this legislation and \narrive at that conclusion: nearly $50 billion in additional spending at \nthe border, 700 miles of fencing at the border; we double the number of \nborder agents on the southern border of the United States; we go from \nroughly 22,000 to 44,000 border agents. Those numbers are directionally \nright. We double them. More money and Federal resources are devoted to \nsecuring our border than on all other law enforcement that the Federal \nGovernment undertakes, and now we are doubling it.\n  You might be critical and say, Well, you shouldn't spend that money, \nalthough, as I mentioned earlier, this bill results in deficit \nreduction of almost $1 trillion over 20 years. I could see how somebody \nmight stand up and be critical about that. I can't see how somebody \ncould seriously maintain this bill does not secure our border.\n  We call for an array of new technologies and resources at our border \nsectors to ensure 100-percent surveillance and rapid interdiction of \nthreats and potential illegal crossings.\n  E-Verify is required to be used by every employer in the United \nStates, so we don't end up the way we did the last time--with a broken \nsystem, where small businesses either became the INS or were given fake \ndocuments and people came here where there were jobs--illegally, not \nlegally. This internal enforcement mechanism will allow us to make sure \nsmall businesses know who they are hiring, and we are turning away \npeople who are here unlawfully and shouldn't work here in the United \nStates of America.\n  This is the greatest country in the world. But 40 percent of the \npeople who are here who are undocumented came lawfully to the United \nStates, overstayed their visas, and it is the consequence of our having \na system to check people on the way in but never checks them on the way \nout or whether they left at all. This bill fixes that problem with a \ncomplete entry-exit system, with improved biographic and biometric \ntracking of those who come into and leave our borders. It is about time \nfor us to begin to apply 21st century technology to this broken \nimmigration system we have.\n  There are many economic reasons why we should support this bipartisan \nlegislation. We know it will help businesses, we know it will boost our \neconomy, we know we are securing our borders. If people don't believe \nme on this, I hope they will listen to Senator John McCain and Senator \nJeff Flake, who are the two Republican border Senators--Senators from a \nborder State--who took me and others down there to see what the border \nactually looked like, who support this legislation, who have to go home \nto Arizona and be able to defend this legislation by saying it secures \nthe borders of the United States of America. They know what they are \ntalking about.\n  We also can't lose sight of what this bill means for families who are \nsuffering under the current system. Here is one story from a bright \nyoung woman in Boulder, CO, who I had the fortunate pleasure to meet, \nAna Karina Casas Ibarra. I first met Ana at a bagel shop in Boulder \nwhere my staff and I stopped in for a bite to eat. She waited on us and \nrecognized me. When my staff overheard her explaining the dynamics of \nthe 112th Congress, they suggested she apply for an internship in my \noffice. She was an awesome intern. We had the opportunity to learn more \nabout her story.\n  Fourteen years ago, her mother brought her and her two younger \nbrothers to the United States to escape an abusive marriage. Her mom \nhad consistently juggled two or three jobs to support them. Although \nAna was a good student, an old Colorado law denied her in-State \ntuition. She had to work to pay for community college a few semesters \nat a time. Her brothers, who saw her opportunity denied, lost their \nmotivation. One brother who speaks better English than Spanish was \ndeported, and the other brother who has an American citizen wife and a \nbaby is facing possible deportation right now. She just published her \nstory in the Denver Post. She wrote:\n\n       Too many families share similar horror stories of \n     separation. There are 11 million people who have entered this \n     country illegally, and the time is now to provide them with a \n     path to citizenship.\n       It is time for immigration reform.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \nDenver Post op-ed.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Denver Post, June 23, 2013]\n\n            My Family Needs Immigration Reform, Sen. Bennet\n\n                      (By Ana Karina Casas Ibarra)\n\n       In 2012, I was working at a bagel shop in Boulder when Sen. \n     Michael Bennet walked in. I immediately recognized him, \n     handed him his bagel, and said, ``Here's your bagel,\n\n[[Page S5126]]\n\n     senator.'' I didn't know then that this small interaction \n     would change my life.\n       After the senator left the shop, I approached my co-\n     workers, confused that they hadn't recognized him. Some knew \n     that Jared Polis was our district's representative, but they \n     didn't know Bennet. I explained to them the difference \n     between the House and the Senate, and that Bennet was our \n     representative, too.\n       Members of his staff overheard this conversation, and \n     encouraged me to apply for an internship in the senator's \n     office.\n       That fall, I interned for Sen. Bennet in Denver. I got the \n     chance to talk with the senator, meet his constituents and \n     witness how his staff solves problems for Coloradans. The \n     experience was eye-opening and educational, deepening my \n     interest in government and my belief in American democracy.\n       That belief has shaped my life. Fourteen years ago, when I \n     was only 12, my mother brought my little brothers and me to \n     the United States, crossing the border from Mexico to escape \n     her abusive husband. Through the years, my mom has \n     consistently juggled two or three jobs to support us.\n       I worked hard in school, earning good grades so I could get \n     into a top college. But several anti-immigrant laws were \n     passed in Colorado in 2006, including one that cut off in-\n     state college tuition for undocumented students. Despite my \n     good grades, I ended up applying to the Community College of \n     Denver, the only school I could afford to attend. I \n     alternated between going to college and taking semesters off \n     to work and slowly save up for more classes.\n       My brothers' lives have been dramatically different from \n     mine. They saw me work hard in high school only to be cut off \n     from the opportunities I had earned. They watched me do other \n     people's laundry, clean bathrooms and make sandwiches just to \n     put myself through community college. They saw that same \n     future for themselves and they lost the motivation to finish \n     high school.\n       Luis, my middle brother, became depressed, refusing to eat, \n     talk to anyone or go to school. I lived in fear that he might \n     take his own life. Instead, in 2009, he was arrested and \n     deported. I watched, powerless, as my family was torn apart. \n     Luis, who lived the majority of his life in the U.S., who \n     speaks better English than Spanish and whose family and \n     friends all live here, is now alone in Mexico, the country \n     our mother fled when he was just a boy.\n       Luis' deportation was a nightmare for my family. The \n     feelings of pain, frustration and helplessness left permanent \n     scars. Now my family's nightmare is happening again. My \n     youngest brother was arrested last August when he was sitting \n     in a parked car without a drivers' license. Our family--\n     including my brother's wife, a U.S. citizen, and their baby \n     girl--now waits in fear for his upcoming deportation hearing, \n     terrified that our family will be torn apart once again.\n       The diverging paths of my life and my brothers' illustrate \n     the precarious balance we have experienced. As difficult as \n     it has been for me to work my way through high school and \n     college, it is far too easy to get caught up in deportation \n     proceedings as my brothers have. Too many families share \n     similar horror stories of separation. There are 11 million \n     people who have entered this country illegally, and the time \n     is now to provide them with a path to citizenship.\n       It's time for immigration reform. I hope Sen. Bennet \n     remembers me and my family's story when he works with the \n     ``Gang of 8'' in Congress to draft a comprehensive \n     immigration bill. As a former intern, a constituent and the \n     sister of immigrants caught in our broken immigration system, \n     I urge Sen. Bennet and his colleagues to create a path to \n     citizenship for people like me.\n       My life was changed forever when my senator walked into \n     that bagel shop. Now Sen. Bennet has the power to change the \n     lives of families across the United States by championing \n     fair, humane immigration reform that keeps families together \n     and creates opportunities for all those immigrants seeking \n     the American dream.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. I just wish to say, again, how proud I am of the work \nSenator Corker and Senator Hoeven have done to get us to this point. I \nhope we will come to an agreement on some amendments between now and \nthe end or that we will just take up this bill.\n  It is time for us to pass it. It is time for us to fix this problem \nfor our economy and for the families all across this country. I believe \nwe can do it, and I think it is an opportunity for this Senate to show \nit can work in a bipartisan way that produces a meaningful piece of \nlegislation that is very important to the American people.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I don't want to interrupt the flow of the \nproceedings, but I ask that my statement be made as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Student Loan Rates\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, in the next few short days, on July 1, the \ninterest rate for subsidized Stafford loans are set to double. The \nproblem is that with the subsidized Stafford loans, we are talking \nabout students who tend to be lower income. Many of these students are \nfirst-generation college students, and they tend to be people who work \nthe hardest to get what they have. They tend to not have very much \nmoney or resources and not very many connections. They don't have a lot \nof advantages.\n  We have had several people from around the State of Arkansas e-mail \nor write my office. One of those who wrote to me is Donovan. He is a \nfather who works construction to support his kids. He has two kids in \ncollege, one in the Marines, and one about to graduate from high \nschool. He cannot afford to pay his living expenses for himself and his \nfamily and their education without the help of student loans.\n  Kim is another. She is a first-generation college graduate who is \nworking to pay off $85,000 in student loan debts. As she is paying that \ndown, she doesn't have the money to save for her own children's \neducation.\n  Brandon is another story. Brandon goes to Southern Arkansas \nUniversity. He is working hard to afford his education and pay for it, \nbut he is struggling with the high cost of tuition, room and board, and \nbooks. He is worried he is not going to be able to afford college if \nthe interest rate goes up.\n  Last year the Senate and the Congress generally passed a provision to \nkeep the interest rate of the subsidized Stafford loan at 3.4 percent. \nI think that is the right policy. I think we want Americans to further \ntheir education. I think it obviously helps their personal enrichment, \nit helps their family, their community, and helps our country to keep \nus competitive in this global economy.\n  Again, we are about to see a jump to 6.8 percent. The reason I am so \nconcerned about it is that in my small State of Arkansas, there are \n68,000 low-income and middle-income Arkansas students who rely on these \nloans.\n  Unfortunately, what has happened in the Congress and in the Senate is \nthat we had two votes a couple weeks ago, both of which failed. What we \nsee now is a lot of finger-pointing, a lot of press releases and press \nconferences. But this is an area where we should find a bipartisan \nsolution. This is a classic case that if we work together, we can work \nit out. In the last few weeks, I have seen Senators come together and \nwork out difficult problems. Surely we can work through this and work \nit out.\n  The House says it has a permanent fix. I disagree with that being a \npermanent fix. If we look at it, it doesn't compare well to the plan we \nvoted down in the Senate a couple weeks ago. The Democratic plan in the \nSenate has a 3.4-percent flat interest rate. Their interest rate is \nmarket based, and it rides the 10-year Treasury. We have to go through \nthe calculation on how they do it, but basically we all know that \ninterest rates are not going down. Interest rates are not staying the \nsame. Interest rates are going up, and everybody knows that.\n  When we start tying these things to interest rates--did we not learn \nanything in the housing crisis? If we get people on the adjustable rate \nmortgages, what happens? It sounds good on the front end, but then they \ncan't pay. The same thing will happen with student loans. They would \nget them on the lower rate on the front end, and that will go up over \ntime.\n  The House Republican plan actually lets a borrower change that rate \non that loan every year. So they don't lock in once for 10 or 20 years, \nthey would lock in one year at a time and then ride that interest rate \nannually. It is very problematic.\n  By the way, I disagree with President Obama. I think he happens to be \nwrong, and I think we need to find a bipartisan solution.\n  I have a couple of charts where we talk about this. This is the House \nRepublican plan and these are the costs. The House Republican plan goes \nup. Basically, the interest rate payments will be almost $8,500. If we \nextend the current rate, it is $3,500-ish. If they don't do anything \nand double the current rate, it is $7,400, and that is real money. The \ndifference here is that this is real money for folks who tend to start \nout with a lower income and don't have a lot of opportunity.\n  We can see what the so-called permanent fix does. It basically fixes \nit for higher payments over time, which means we are going to have \nfewer people who can plan to go to college as\n\n[[Page S5127]]\n\nwell as fewer people who are able to go to college. We are going to \nhave a higher default rate, which means more people don't pay back, \nwhich just creates more problems as we go. It will also hurt their \nspending power and again our competitiveness.\n  I supported the Democratic plan, but again I think there is merit in \nsome of what the Republicans offered. I just hope this is a time when \nwe can find a long-term solution, where we can come together and work \nit out. Students shouldn't be punished because of Congress's inability \nto work together.\n  Now is the time to come together. We need to come together for \nDonovan, Kim, Brandon--the three Arkansans I talked about--and for \nmillions of students across the country. I know we can fix this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Arkansas \nfor his comments. I wish to speak to the amendment and the overall bill \nthat is before us.\n  I thank the eight Senators who have brought us to this point where we \nare looking at landmark legislation. I thank all who were involved last \nnight who went through the hurdle of putting in place the strongest \nborder security plan anyone could have imagined.\n  I don't think anybody can now look at this immigration bill and say \nwe are not doing what the majority of Americans want to see happen; \nthat is, to secure the borders. I thank all involved in making that \nhappen. I know over the last several days that has consumed our \ndiscussion--talking about the border being secure. Border security is \nsomething I know people in Tennessee and folks all across this country \ncare about.\n  Again, I appreciate all the contributions that have been made. I \nthank those who were involved last night in a very strong bipartisan \ncloture vote. Hopefully, we will have the vote on the amendment soon. I \nunderstand there are negotiations underway to add as many as 20 or 30 \nmore amendment opportunities for folks. I hope people will try to \nnarrow down their list.\n  I cannot imagine how more amendments which can improve the bill is \nnot something we all want to do. I wish to thank those working toward \nthat end. We have plenty of time left this week to deal with a number \nof important amendments. Candidly, many of them, in my opinion, would \nmake the bill stronger.\n  Today I wish to speak to two things. No. 1, we talked about security. \nI, as a Senator, in the 6\\1/2\\ years I have been here, have never had \nthe opportunity to be a part of a piece of legislation that--if passed \nin both Houses and the President signs it, it becomes law--will \nimmediately affect in a positive way 11 million citizens who are in the \nshadows today. In many ways, they are already part of our society and \nwill now be able to come out and be even more productive for the United \nStates of America. I am thrilled to have that opportunity.\n  It now appears this amendment is going to pass, and we will have the \nopportunity to have a balanced immigration bill. I think the American \npeople are compassionate. I think if they understand that we have done \nwhat we can to keep this problem from occurring again in the future and \nif the people who came here in the way that they came are at the back \nof the line and have to do those things that are necessary to overcome \nthat before they get their green card and then become citizens, I \nbelieve this is a bill that overwhelmingly will be supported by the \nAmerican people. It gives every single one of us an opportunity to be a \npart of landmark legislation that immediately is going to affect 11 \nmillion people who now are in our country and many more people who come \nthereafter.\n  To move away from the human side--and I know we are going to have \nsome budget points of order later--I wish to speak to the economic \nside, which is a side we have not talked about much.\n  Another first for me in the Senate is to vote for a bill that, if it \npasses, is going to bring $157 billion into the Treasury without \nraising anybody's taxes. Never have I had that opportunity. That is \nwhat we will be doing if we pass this legislation with the border \nsecurity amendment that is now in place.\n  Over the next 10 years, CBO scores show that we are going to have \n$157 billion come into the Treasury without raising anybody's taxes \nbecause of the fact we are going to have people coming in out of the \nshadows. Over the next decade, CBO projects we are going to have over \n$700 billion coming into the Treasury.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has worked on deficit reduction. This \nwill be the first opportunity we have had to do something such as this \nthat in no way affects people negatively but causes us to have much \nmore in the way of resources. We will have resources coming into the \nTreasury, lowering deficits, and, candidly, helping seniors who are \nconcerned about whether we are going to be able to maintain momentum \nwith many of the entitlement programs we have today.\n  CBO has actually scored something else. If this bill passes, real GDP \ngrowth is going to be at 3.3 percent over the first decade and 5.4 \npercent at the end of the second decade. Again, this bill is something \nthat generates economic growth. While both sides of the aisle talked \ngreatly about economic growth, I have to say that my side of the aisle \ntends to focus more time on that issue, and I applaud that. I think it \nis very important. I think it is a situation where a rising tide raises \nall boats, households do even better, and the standard of living \nincreases. What this bill, if passed, is going to do is cause our GDP \ngrowth to be even higher over the next two decades.\n  I know people have talked a little bit about wages. In fairness, \nthere is a study that does say that over the next decade there might be \none-tenth of 1 percent effect on wages. What it says is that by the end \nof the second decade, wage increases are going to grow even more \ndramatically than they would without this bill.\n  Productivity is going to increase. CBO has recently scored that \nproductivity is going to be much higher if we pass this piece of \nlegislation. If people come out of the shadows, become more productive \ncitizens, it actually causes us to produce even more goods and services \nin this Nation.\n  I think everyone understands that because the people who will be \naffected by this--the 11 million undocumented workers and people who \nare in this country--will be paying into the system for 10 years, at a \nminimum, and will not be allowed to participate in Social Security and \nMedicare. What they are doing is actually giving additional life to \nboth of those programs--programs that seniors around this country \ndepend on tremendously.\n  To digress, I know yesterday CBO said that if this amendment we are \ndebating passes, it will have a tremendous impact on lessening the \namount of illegal immigration we have in our country, which is \nsomething I know almost every American wants to see.\n  I know there will be some budget points of order. In my life as a \nSenator, I spent a lot of time on deficit reduction. As a matter of \nfact, I would put the efforts we have made in my office against almost \nanybody here. Over the last 6\\1/2\\ years, we have been focused on \ndeficit reduction.\n  As I said, I have never in my life had an opportunity such as this as \na Senator. If we pass this piece of legislation, by sheer force of what \nis going to happen out in the marketplace and what is going to happen \nby bringing people in out of the shadows so they can participate in a \ndifferent way and without raising anybody's taxes--as a matter of fact, \nmaybe it gives them an opportunity to lower people's taxes down the \nroad--we are going to lower our deficit.\n  I know there will be budget points of order. I plan to vote to \noverride those because I don't think the off-budget items are being \ncounted in the way they should. I think all of us understand that \nMedicare and Social Security are in distress. Those programs are not \nbeing counted in what is going to be discussed later today with these \npoints of order.\n  I encourage everyone to override these points of order, taking into \naccount the benefits this is going to have on the off-budget items. By \nthe way, typically when we are dealing with these ``off-budget items,'' \nwe are actually dealing with them in the reverse, and that is that \npeople are not taking into account the negativity that is going to \nimpact them. In this case, there is actually a positive result.\n\n[[Page S5128]]\n\n  So from a human standpoint, this is the right thing to do. From a \nborder security standpoint, this is the right thing to do. From a \ndeficit-reducing standpoint, this is the right thing to do. And for \nraising the standard of living for all Americans through economic \ngrowth, this is the right thing to do.\n  I thank the Chair for the time, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think we should get a little \nperspective, at least as I see it, on the Corker-Hoeven-Schumer \nsubstitute that was voted on earlier, and we will vote on again. I \nthink this is what happened.\n  It became clear last week that the Gang of 8 bill was nowhere close \nto doing what it promised to do on enforcement. The flaws were too \ndramatic to hide and the CBO found it would only reduce illegal \nimmigration by 25 percent after they had promised dramatic changes in \nit. And I pointed out that it had holes all through it, like Swiss \ncheese, and the CBO essentially confirmed that.\n  The bill was in trouble. Support for the gang's proposal began to \nfall, and the mood changed from over confidence among the supporters to \neven panic. The gang knew action had to be taken or things could be \nlost, so they got--they went to Senators Corker and Hoeven with this \nidea that they would just add 20,000 Border Patrol agents to our \ncurrent agents on the border and 700 miles of fencing. Both of those \nprojects they had steadfastly rejected, even rejecting the Cornyn \namendment to add 5,000 agents. One of the Members of the Senate said it \nwas dumb to do any fencing, and they opposed the fence.\n  Well, these provisions of new enforcement were contrary to what the \nsupporters had been saying for weeks. They promised America their bill \nwas the toughest ever, driving those messages into homes all over \nAmerica with TV advertisements; with Senator Rubio; big business; Mr. \nZucherberg pretending he is a conservative advocate; running ads \ntelling us all what we ought to know and do about this bill. The goal, \nI have to say, was to provide some sort of cover to get wavering \nDemocrats and Republicans to sign on to this new bill that is going to \nadd 20,000 agents.\n  Well, why would they be willing to make such a dramatic, \nunceremonious retreat on a position they had taken for months? First, \nthey were desperate. Something needed to be done. Secondly, they know \nthat the promises made in this substitute bill to build fences and to \nadd 20,000 agents will never occur. It is not going to happen. So they \nare really not worried about that. It is a kabuki dance, a bob-and-\nweave, a rope-a-dope. Everybody in the Senate knows how this process is \nworking. The staff know it, and I think probably most of the media \nunderstand it.\n  These promised actions are not going to happen in the future. The \ninterests who push this bill have never wanted to end the illegality. I \nhave been fighting on this for years. Every time we get close to fixing \nE-Verify, every time we get--in fact, we had debates, and I had to hold \nup bills to keep E-Verify from expiring. Forces were out there trying \nto kill E-Verify for years, and I held up legislation to insist that at \nleast we keep it alive. We weren't able to strengthen it, which it \nneeded desperately. That is the workplace situation, E-Verify is, where \nwhen a person applies for a job they run a quick computer check on a \nperson's Social Security number to determine whether they have a lawful \nSocial Security number. It identifies a lot of people who are illegally \nhere and should not be taking jobs. So those forces have never wanted a \nlawful system, and they objected to things that occurred.\n  So their interests and the interests of those who met in secret to \ncobble this bill together have always favored more immigration, legal \nimmigration, and it seems to me quite a bit of indifference to illegal. \nThese are the forces that have voiced support for but blocked the \ncreation of real border security fencing over the years.\n  They have voiced support for E-Verify with a blocked extension of it \nand strengthening of it. They have voiced support for an entry-exit \nvisa system that works in all land, sea, and airports; indeed, we have \npassed bills to do that--biometric land, sea, and airports. This bill \nreduces that requirement through just entry-exit visa systems at air \nand seaports and not on land, and it is not biometric. That is a \ncritical difference because now 40 percent of the people here illegally \ncome on visas and overstay, and we have no idea who is leaving the \ncountry. We clock them in on entry, but we don't clock them out when \nthey leave. So we don't know if anybody has overstayed.\n  That is the situation we are in. I see my friend, Senator Vitter, and \nI want him to have time to talk. I know he is due to be talking now. I \nwould say one more thing as he prepares to deliver his remarks.\n  We were promised, when the bill passed, that the economy would be \nbetter, wages would improve, and GDP would be up, and unemployment \nwouldn't be adversely affected. The CBO report said unemployment will \ngo up, and I have a chart they put out in their own report showing \nthat. They say wages will go down over the next decade, and they say \nunemployment will go up. They say gross domestic product will increase \nsome as a result of the situation of more people, but per capita, per \nperson, GDP declines for 21 years.\n  So we need to know--at this time of high unemployment, slow growth, \nlow-wage growth, we need to be very cautious about allowing millions of \nnew workers to enter this economy at this time. We want to have \nimmigration, but we want to have it at a rate that serves the national \ninterests and increasing it dramatically is not appropriate.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11:30 a.m. \nWednesday, June 26, all postcloture time on the Leahy amendment No. \n1183, as modified, be considered expired; that the pending amendment \nNo. 1551 be withdrawn; that if a budget point of order is raised \nagainst the Leahy amendment No. 1183, as modified, during its \nconsideration, and the applicable motion to waive is made, that at \n11:30 a.m., the Senate then proceed to vote on the motion to waive the \nbudget point of order; that if the point of order is waived, the Senate \nproceed to vote on the Leahy amendment No. 1183, as modified; that upon \nthe disposition of the Leahy amendment, the Senate proceed to the vote \non the motion to invoke cloture on the committee-reported substitute, \nas amended; that if cloture is invoked, it be considered as if cloture \nhad been invoked at 1 a.m., Wednesday, June 26; and, finally, that the \nmajority leader be recognized following the cloture vote, if cloture is \ninvoked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, related to that unanimous consent \nagreement, I wish to make a budget point of order, which I will do in \njust a second. But I also ask unanimous consent that after I make the \npoint of order and after the Senator from Vermont moves to waive it, I \nbe recognized for up to 12 minutes to explain my budget point of order.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, the pending measure, S. 744, as reported \nby the Judiciary Committee, would violate the Senate pay-go rule and \nincrease the deficit.\n  Therefore, I raise a point of order against that measure pursuant to \nsection 201(a) of S. Con. Res. 21, the concurrent resolution on the \nbudget for fiscal year 2008.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, the waiver provisions of applicable \nbudget resolutions, and section 4(g)(3) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go \nAct of 2010, I move to\n\n[[Page S5129]]\n\nwaive all applicable sections of those acts and applicable budget \nresolutions for purposes of the pending bill and amendments, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, let me now talk briefly about my budget \npoint of order. I made one specific budget point of order, perhaps the \nmost serious, which is that this bill, as it came out of committee, \nincreases the deficit, pure and simple--the thing we constantly rail \nagainst, the thing we constantly promise we will not do any more of. It \nincreases the deficit.\n  However, that is not the only budget point of order. There are at \nleast 11 budget points of order against this bill--the Senate pay-go \npoint of order, which I just explained.\n  In addition, there is new direct spending authorized by the bill that \nwould exceed the Judiciary Committee's authorization levels for a 5-\nyear period. In addition, there is new direct spending exceeding those \nauthorization levels for the 10-year period.\n  There are four points of order pursuant to section 403(e)(1) that lie \nagainst the emergency designations in the bill.\n  We say we are for budget discipline. The problem is that whenever we \nwant to bust the caps, bust the numbers, we just call certain spending \nan emergency. This is clearly not emergency spending. This is an \nimportant problem, but it is not an unexpected emergency, such as a \nnatural disaster or an attack by a foreign government. There are also \nfour similar emergency designations made under section 4(g)(3) of the \nStatutory PAYGO Act of 2010.\n  So, again, there are at least 11 separate, distinct budget points of \norder that lie against the bill. That is a big deal, particularly when \nwe are running record deficits and have record debt, particularly when \nall of us from both sides of the aisle have come to the floor regularly \nand said: This is a huge challenge, and we are doing something about \nit.\n  We are going to pass a bill that breaks those rules, that busts those \ncaps, 11 different ways.\n  Technically, my budget points of order that I just enumerated are \nabout the underlying bill, but most of these also apply to the Corker-\nHoeven substitute--the Leahy substitute incorporating the Corker-Hoeven \nlanguage. So they have the same budget problems, the same fundamental \nproblems under that version.\n  This is very simple. It is about, are we serious in reining in \ndeficits and debt or not? Are we serious or not?\n  There is a bit of good news. In the last several months, say, since \nSeptember of last year, this body has raised this same sort of budget \npoint of order seven different times--seven different times--saying \nthat important bills bust the caps, increase the deficit, claim \nspending is an emergency when it is not. And seven different times \nsince last September, we sustained those budget points of order. We as \na body said: You are right. We should not do that. We should get \nserious about spending.\n  Seven times, by the way, on my side of the aisle virtually everyone \nsupported that budget point of order, and we did that in many cases \nwhere it was difficult politically to do it--when veterans' benefits \nwere at issue, when other important matters, such as Hurricane Sandy \nrelief, were at issue. So we have shown some amount of discipline \nthrough these budget points of order seven out of seven times since \nSeptember. The question now is, Are we going to do it again or are we \ngoing to cave?\n  Now, this pay-go point of order is perhaps the most serious because \nit is about increasing the deficit. That is what the point of order is \nabout--actually increasing the deficit over the next 10 years.\n  We have to stop violating this rule if we are serious about deficit \nand debt. Pay-go originally banned counting Social Security revenues to \nmask the deficit. Spending in this bill is offset by $211 billion in \nSocial Security revenue. So once again we are going to rob Social \nSecurity to claim we are moving toward balancing the budget.\n  We need to get serious on all of these budget issues. We need to \nmaintain the record we have had here in the Senate since September. We \nneed to sustain this important budget point of order when we vote \ntomorrow.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I support Senator Vitter's motion. There \nare multiple points of order that could be raised against this \nlegislation. They have declared a number of the spending programs \nemergencies; if you designate an appropriation as an emergency, it does \nnot count against the budget, but it is real spending all the same.\n  Normally, we would expect that border enforcement and hiring of \nofficers would not be an emergency; neither would other aspects of what \nwe are doing here be considered an emergency.\n  We were told by the sponsors of the legislation repeatedly that this \nbill will be paid for and it will be paid for by fees and fines \ncontributed by those who are here illegally as part of their payment to \nget citizenship and legal status. Well, that comes nowhere close to \nfunding the legislation.\n  This chart I have in the Chamber gives us some--I will get to it in a \nsecond. But this chart gives an indication of where we stand with \nregard to budget implications of the legislation.\n  So the fines and penalties and fees that are a part of this maybe \nbring in $6 or $7 billion. They said there was enough to pay for the \nbill. The bill originally started out at $6 billion, then it went to $8 \nbillion, and then, with the Corker-Hoeven amendment, it jumped to $46 \nbillion. There are no additional fees on the illegal aliens.\n  When they met with the support group, the Gang of 8 met with the real \ngroup who has been driving the bill--this coalition of special \ninterests.\n  They went to them and said: We need to raise some more money.\n  And they said: Well, you cannot put any more fines on the people here \nillegally.\n  So they said: Yes, ma'am. We will not put any more fines on them. We \nwill put more fees on legal immigrants in the future.\n  So they raised fees on legal immigrants but did not raise fees on the \npeople who are here illegally who originally they said were going to \npay for the entire bill. So that is important for us to fully \nunderstand. The money is simply not there.\n  I will note parenthetically that the 2007 immigration bill--that was \non the floor and we debated and eventually failed--that bill would have \nraised as much as $8,000 per illegal individual. This bill only raises \n$2,000, and it is to be paid over 10 years. This is not a burdensome \npayment if you are going to say they pay a fine--as the sponsors of the \nlegislation did--to become permanent residents and put them on a path \nto citizenship. So it is about $17 a month. I calculated it out \nroughly. That is not a big fine. You are allowed to work. You get a \nSocial Security card, an ability to apply for any job in America on an \nequal status with anybody else who has been unemployed and looking for \nwork, their children looking for work and need a job. Somebody who was \njust a few days before illegally here now has full power under this \nlegislation, if it were passed, to take that job. So the idea that $17 \na month is somehow going to be breaking the bank is not accurate.\n  The problem fundamentally with this situation is that it double \ncounts billions of dollars. We need to understand how this process \nworks, this double counting. It was part of the 2,000-plus page \nObamaCare health care legislation. This thing is over a thousand \npages--1,200 pages--and things get lost in it. What is lost \nfundamentally in it--and the supporters of it ought to be more candid \nabout this--is that to make their argument that the bill is going to \nbring in more money than goes out, they have to double count Social \nSecurity and Medicare money. They just do. Senator Corker has made that \nargument. Basically, we have this money coming in.\n  In one of the conventions of accounting that our budget team uses--\nthe\n\n[[Page S5130]]\n\nCongressional Budget Office--it calculates all the money coming into \nthe government, all the money going out of the government, regardless \nof whether or not there is a trust fund.\n  Another form of accounting accounts for the trust funds and accounts \nfor general revenue. General revenue is on-budget. Off-budget is the \nSocial Security trust fund and some other funds.\n  So look at this chart. I think it gives a picture of where we are. \nThis is the true cost of this immigration bill. I am the ranking \nRepublican on the Budget Committee. We wrestle with these numbers all \nthe time. Under this, they claim they have a unified budget surplus of \n$197 billion. That is the accounting method where all the money coming \nin is counted against all the money going out. But if you remove the \nSocial Security surplus, that is $211 billion. If you remove the \nMedicare surplus, that is $56 billion, showing, instead of having a \nsurplus, we have a $70 billion deficit.\n  You say: Well, CBO said different.\n  No, CBO did not. CBO, in its report, explicitly shows that the on-\nbudget accounting is negative, that it adds to the debt. It counts a \nsurplus in Medicare and Social Security. Now, how could they do that? \nWell, these individuals--many of them do not have a Social Security \nNumber and are not paying Social Security and Medicare taxes--the \nwithholding of FICA on our paychecks. They are not paying that. Once \nlegalized, they will pay that. There will be new money coming into the \nTreasury.\n  These sponsors of the bill, so desperate to promote their bill and \nsay it is paid for, say that Social Security payment, that FICA \npayment, is now available for them to spend over here on all the things \nthey want to spend the money on; therefore, it has created a surplus. \nBut it ignores something very important: that each one of those \nindividuals who have paid into Medicare, paid into Social Security, are \ngoing to draw out Medicare and Social Security. It is their money. It \nis their retirement money. You cannot put the money up for their \nretirement and spend it the same day and expect it to be there.\n  This is how this country is going broke. This is how they handled \nPresident Obama's ObamaCare. They double counted the money. Well, you \nsay that is not accurate. Let me read the letter I got from the \nCongressional Budget Office Director the night before we voted, \nDecember 23. I voted against it. The ObamaCare legislation passed on \nChristmas Eve. They finally got the 60th vote before Senator Brown from \nMassachusetts could be installed. This is what the CBO said at the \ntime:\n\n       [T]he savings to the [Medicare] trust fund under PPACA--\n\n  That is the ObamaCare--\n\n       would be received by the government only once, so they \n     cannot be set aside to pay for future Medicare spending and, \n     at the same time, pay for current spending on other parts of \n     the legislation. . . . To describe the full amount of \n     [Medicare] trust fund savings as both improving the \n     government's ability to pay future Medicare benefits and \n     financing new spending outside of Medicare would essentially \n     double-count a large share of those savings and thus \n     overstate the improvement in the government's fiscal \n     position.\n\n  If that were a private business that sent out a solicitation to buy \nits stock and they said, we are on a good basis, we are making so much \nprofit--and they are counting as their profit the money going into \ntheir employees' pension plan--I think they would be in big trouble, do \nyou not? Because it is not their money, it is money committed to the \nemployees' pension. You cannot claim it as profit and say, invest in my \ncompany, I am making a big profit, counting the money that is in the \nemployees' retirement money.\n  Well, this is what we have been doing. The Senator from South \nCarolina used to say: We have been raiding trust funds. If we were in \nprivate business, we would be in jail. I think there is too much truth \nto that, frankly. So this is undisputedly real.\n  But because there is a score, a unified budget score, the method that \nsays all money comes in and all money goes out, you have a surplus, you \ncan count this as a surplus. Why is that? Well, because most of the \npeople who will be legalized under this bill, those individuals are in \na situation where they are younger, maybe 35. So they will pay into \nMedicare for a number of years, and Medicare for a number of years will \nsee a surplus in their account.\n  But after they reach retirement age and start retiring, the money is \ngoing to be drawn out. In fact, right now the amount of money paid into \nSocial Security and Medicare by American workers is not enough to cover \nthe cost of their retirement. That is why both of those accounts are in \nserious trouble. We have got to do something about it. We need to be \nmaking it stronger, not weaker. This makes it weaker. You are taking \nthe money that should have been going to fund the retirement accounts \nof the people who were previously illegal who are now legal and \nspending it on something else.\n  Senator Vitter is exactly right, there are multiple bases for making \na budget point of order against this bill. I believe the motion to \nwaive the budget point of order was a motion to waive all of them, so \nthis will be the only one we will get to vote on. So there are others \nwho could have been raised also.\n  So what about this argument that wages are supposed to be improved by \nthe bill? We were told that and told that repeatedly. This is what the \nCBO report says, ``CBO estimates that S. 744 would cause the \nunemployment rate to increase slightly between 2014 and 2020.'' So this \nis a fact. So at a time of high unemployment, lower wages, we are \npassing legislation that will increase unemployment, make more people \nunable to find work.\n  This is a chart that was in the CBO report, not my chart. I did not \nmake this chart; it is in their report. It points out the average wage \nwould be lower than under current law over the first dozen years. So we \nare asked to vote for a bill that CBO says would make the average wage \nof American working people lower for a dozen years.\n  I do not see how that is rational, frankly. We have seen since 1999 \nthe wages of American workers have been decreasing as compared to the \ninflation index. The amount of money they are making is falling \ncompared to inflation. That is a tragic thing. It has been continuous. \nI thought it might be temporary, but it has been continuing steadily.\n  One expert, Professor Borjas at Harvard, attributed 40 percent of \nthat to immigration already. This bill will dramatically increase the \nflow of immigration. So I am worried. This is a chart that has down \nhere 2021, 2023, before it hits the line back where it was. Then you \nsay, well, then it is improving. Not so. Not so. If the bill had not \nbeen passed, we would have had some increase all along. The lines would \nhave been much higher. I do not know how many years it would take for \nthis ever to get back to where it would have been if the bill did not \npass.\n  That is what the CBO says. It is not that inconsistent with common \nsense, that at a time of high unemployment and you bring in millions of \nworkers, it is going to pull down wages. If you bring more coal into \nAmerica, you bring more iron into America, more cotton into America, \nthe price of those products falls. It is supply and demand. You bring \nmore labor in, you are going to have a lower wage rate, which David \nFrum has written is what the bill was designed for to begin with, pull \ndown wages.\n  We need to think about this. I dispute this idea that there is no \nimpact on wages by this immigration law. This is what will happen in \nthe next 10 years: We are going to legalize 11 million people. About \nhalf of those are not working effectively in the real job force; maybe \nthey are doing part-time work; maybe their family is taking care of \nthem; maybe they are working in a restaurant or lawn care companies off \nthe books. All of a sudden they are going to be given legal status. \nThey will be able to apply for any job: truckdrivers, forklift \noperators, coal miners, steelworkers, work for the county commission, \ncity council, State of Alabama. They can apply for all of those jobs. \nSo you are going to see a large increase in the supply of labor \navailable for jobs for which they were not eligible previously.\n  Second, what about the normal legal flow? We now admit about 1 \nmillion people a year into America. That is the most generous admission \nrate of any Nation in the world. It is pretty significant, very \nsignificant. We have been absorbing that. I think we can continue at \nthat rate. However, this bill, in addition to the 1 million I just \nmentioned, will increase by at least 50 percent the number of \nimmigrants who\n\n[[Page S5131]]\n\ncome into the country every year hereafter, which is pretty \nsignificant.\n  In addition, there is another 4.5 million who are waiting to come \ninto America. They have been tentatively approved, but there are limits \non how many can come each year. So they are waiting their time. They \ncall it a ``backlog.'' They are just waiting their time. That is 4.5 \nmillion. They have been accelerated.\n  Let's think this through. Under the current law, we were on track to \nadmit 10 million people as immigrants into America. By immigrants, I \nmean people who want to stay here, get legal permanent residence and \nbecome citizens. We are on track for 10 million if you follow current \nlaw.\n  Under this bill, we will admit, over the next 10 years to lawful \nstatus in America, the 15 million I mentioned, the 11 million plus the \n4.5. Then we are going to increase by 50 percent the annual admission \nrate from 1 million to 1.5, meaning 15 million over 10, which means 30 \nmillion. So the number of people who will be given permanent legal \nstatus in America over the next 10 years will be 30 million, not 10 if \nthe law had been properly applied.\n  There is another category. Those are people we refer to generally as \nguest workers. Guest workers come not to become immigrants, not to stay \nin the country permanently, but come to work in an area where they can \nfind a job. It is supposed to be in an area where there are not workers \nto do the work. That is the theory, at least. How will that be impacted \nby this new legislation? It is going to be double. So the number of \nguest workers, which is very large now, is going to double under this \nlegislation.\n  I would say, first of all, it is common sense that the average wage \nis going to fall. It is common sense that unemployment will go up. It \nis common sense that it is going to be harder for Americans in this \ntime of high unemployment and falling wages to get a decent job with \nhealth care and retirement benefits. It just is.\n  People can spin and they can quote Grover Norquist and those kinds of \nthings to say otherwise, but Professor Borjas at Harvard says \ndifferently, a Federal Reserve economist in Atlanta says differently, \nthe U.S. Commission on Civil Rights said they had hearings and every \nwitness acknowledged it would be bad for American workers, particularly \nlower income workers, particularly for African-American and Hispanic \nworkers who are already here. They will get hammered the most under \nthis dramatic increase in workers.\n  They say it will increase GNP. Well, it will. You legalize 30 \nmillion, you are going to have a larger economy and it will be bigger. \nBut the question is, per person, per capita, will America's \nproductivity increase? Will our GDP increase?\n  Well, what did CBO find? This is their chart. It shows that it \ndropped. This is the baseline today. If we pass the bill, the per-\ncapita GNP of the United States of America of each citizen drops. That \ndoes not make us wealthier as a Nation, as a person. So what if the \neconomy grows a little bit but everyone has less because you have got \nmore people? That is what they say: S. 744 would reduce per capita by \n0.7 percent in 2023. That is 2023. This is about 16 years they chart \nthat it will be lower than it would have been if the bill never passes.\n  So why would we want to pass legislation that clearly reduces the per \ncapita wealth of America, our growth of GNP? I do not think that makes \ngood sense. I am concerned about it. Nobody wants to talk about it, \nthey just want to pretend there is no limit to the number of workers \nwho can be brought in and that that will not have a societal impact on \nAmerica.\n  Let's take a look at a few things here. This is the Washington Post \nfrom 2 weeks ago when we got the job report dealing with the jobs for \nthe month of May. It was considered to be fairly positive. It was about \nour normal average increase during the recovery period from the \nrecession. But it is still not much. Not so good.\n  Unemployment went up, even though we created, they said, 175,000 \njobs. That sounded good. We created 175,000. But you have to create \nabout that many jobs each month to stay level, because we have more \npeople coming into the workforce each month.\n  Look at what they said in the article:\n\n       The bulk of the job gains in May were in the service \n     industry, which added about 57,000 jobs last month. Still, \n     roughly half of those were temporary positions, suggesting \n     that businesses remain uncertain of consumer demand.\n\n  They go on to note:\n\n       Missing from the picture were production jobs in industries \n     such as construction and manufacturing. . . . Meanwhile, \n     manufacturing shed 8,000 workers. . . .\n\n  Manufacturing jobs went down by 8,000. The increase was in service \nindustries. The increase in half of those were part-time or temporary, \nnot full-time, permanent jobs.\n  Anybody who says we are in great shape with regard to job creation is \nnot telling the truth.\n  An article in today's Wall Street Journal, ``Some Unemployed Keep \nLosing Ground,'' states that ``nearly 12 million Americans were \nunemployed in May, down from a peak of more than 15 million. . . . ''\n  At one point a few years ago, we had 15 million Americans working. We \nnow have 12 million Americans working.\n  The percentage of Americans in the workforce continues to fall. It is \nthe lowest since the 1970s when women were entering the workforce. That \nis why the percentage went up, but now we are down to that level again. \nPeople are not finding work.\n  The idea that we can bring in millions of workers well above the \ncurrent rate and that this is somehow going to create jobs is hard for \nme to accept. The article states:\n\n       ``At 175,000 jobs per month, we're years away,'' said Adam \n     Looney, a Brookings economist, from where we need to be in \n     unemployment rate. The real reason is economic growth has not \n     increased much.\n\n  It goes on to cite some very sad numbers that show the danger for \npeople who have been unemployed for longer periods of time. It does \nappear, unfortunately, that somebody who is older or somebody who has \nnot found a job for quite a number of months finds it even harder to \nfind a job in the future. This is the Wall Street Journal, and they \nsupport immigration aggressively, but this is their story. The article \ntalked about Mr. Ken Gray.\n\n       Ken Gray has experienced that frustration firsthand. In \n     January of 2011, Mr. Gray's wife died after a battle with \n     ovarian cancer; three months later, he was laid off from his \n     job as an account manager at AT, where he had worked for \n     more than 20 years. Still grieving from the loss of his wife, \n     Mr. Gray says he was slow to turn his full attention to his \n     job search. By the time he did, the Chicago resident was \n     long-term unemployed, and he has struggled to get prospective \n     employers even to respond to his applications.\n       ``You just feel so discouraged,'' Mr. Gray said. ``You ask \n     yourself what's the sense of sending a resume if you don't \n     hear anything.''\n       Now 59 years old, Mr. Gray been living off his dwindling \n     savings since his unemployment benefits expired last year. He \n     says he remains determined to find work. But long-term job \n     seekers are twice as likely to leave the labor market as to \n     find jobs, and many experts worry that many of them will \n     never return to work. That could create a class of \n     permanently unemployed workers and leave lasting scars on the \n     economy.\n       ``Once people reach a point where they no longer consider \n     themselves employable . . . it is very difficult to pull them \n     back,'' says Joe Carbone, president of WorkPlace, a \n     Connecticut workforce-development agency. . . . ``We are \n     losing thousands of people a day. This is like an epidemic.''\n\n  I don't think we can pretend this isn't reality. I think the CBO \nnumbers probably understate the problem. Professor Borjas' studies \nwould indicate that and others would indicate that.\n  Another example is from the New York Times, May 20, 1 month ago, \nwritten by Jessica Glazer:\n\n       The men began arriving last Wednesday, first a trickle, \n     then dozens. By Friday there were hundreds of them, along \n     with a few women.\n       They set up their tents and mattresses on the sidewalk in \n     Long Island City, Queens, unpacked their Coronas and cards--\n     and settled in to wait for as long as five days and nights \n     for a slender chance at a union job as an elevator mechanic.\n       On Monday morning. . . . Those in line--there were more \n     than 800 by sun-up Monday--were hoping for a chance at job \n     security, higher salaries and other benefits.\n       Andres Loaiza, 25, had his eye on a position that includes \n     minimal physical labor. . . . Every 18 to 20 months, the \n     union accepts 750 applications for the 150 to 200 spots in \n     its four-year apprenticeship program. . . . While they \n     waited, the hopefuls lined the sidewalk along 36th Street. . \n     . . The union had rented six port-a-potties and hired a 24-\n     hour security guard. . . . Overnight, they brushed their \n     teeth with bottles of water; tucked into\n\n[[Page S5132]]\n\n     their sleeping bags, folding chairs or cars; and tried to get \n     some rest.\n\n  On Saturday a light drizzle fell. Gerry Dubatowka, 20, whose father \nis in Local 3, waited for his shot.\n\n       He is studying electrical technology at Orange County \n     Community College, but said he would rather work with his \n     hands than be in school.\n       ``I just want to do whatever, wherever I got to start,'' \n     said Mr. Dubatowka. ``I want steady work all the time.''\n\n  For millions of Americans, this is what they want. They want a job \nwith a retirement benefit, a health care benefit, and a steady job. We \nare not creating enough of them. That is the problem. Continuing:\n\n       After Sunday's drenching rain, Monday morning dawned gray. \n     A few arguments erupted as people tried to cut the line. . . \n     . At 9 a.m. Monday, the door opened. The first man in line \n     disappeared inside and emerged moments later with a wide \n     smile across his face.\n       ``Yay! No. 1!'' one man yelled when he stepped onto the \n     sidewalk.\n       ``Good luck, big guy!'' said another.\n\n  This is the problem we are facing. I would share with my colleagues, \nat the rate of immigration in the future, we will have well over \n100,000 new immigrants a month enter the country who are looking for \njobs. We will have more than that enter, but we will probably have \nabout 100,000-or-so-plus a month looking for jobs.\n  What does our Congressional Budget Office say about our future \neconomic growth pattern? The CBO each year, as part of the budget \nprocess, lays out a 10-year projection of economic growth for America. \nThey project all kinds of things. They are not perfect, but they use \nthe best data available from the Labor Department, academic studies, \nprivate business analysis, and they project how many people would be \nemployed. They are projecting for America's economy what I think a \nlarge majority of other economists and private sector people are \npredicting; that is, a new normal, where growth has not increased as \nfast as it has during boom times in the past. You have heard that \nphrase, ``a new normal.'' This is a new normal, and that is what we are \nfacing.\n\n  They predict, in the second 5 years of our 10-year budget window, we \nwill increase jobs in America by 75,000 a month, well below the amount \nof people immigrating to America to get jobs under this bill. Should we \ninvite people to come who are not likely to have a job? Should we \ninvite more people to come than we will have jobs for when they will \nmake the new immigrants who arrive before them unable to have a good \njob?\n  Shall we bring in more immigrants than we can absorb, causing wages \nto decline for American citizens, making it harder for American \ncitizens to find work? Do we take those people who are not finding jobs \nand do we then place them on the welfare rolls and put them on a \ngovernment subsistence program when they have been independent and able \nto prosper previously in the private sector?\n  What is the right thing for America, colleagues? I think we have to \nthink about that. These numbers from CBO show there will be adverse \nimpacts on the economy, wages, and unemployment at a time when we need \nto be doing just the opposite. We need to be creating jobs, putting \npeople to work. We simply have to give first priority to those to whom \nwe owe our allegiance, the people who fought our wars, paid our taxes, \nand kept the country going when they were able to work.\n  I raise that point. People don't like to talk about it, but I do \nbelieve it is honest and true. A good immigration policy should be \nfocused on a number of things. It should be focused first on the \nnational interests, the interests of the American working people, \nwhether they are lawful immigrants and not yet citizens or whether they \nare lawfully here as citizens. We owe our obligation first to that \ncohort of people. They are loyal to our country, and we owe them our \nloyalty first.\n  Then we bring in people at the rate we think we can absorb that is \nhealthy for America. Maybe 1 million people a year is about the right \nrate. If that is where we are, I can accept that. To have it increased \nby 50 percent, to have the guest worker program doubled on top of \nallowing early entrants and legality to 15 million, that is a trend \nthat I think is dangerous for America.\n  My position is this, let's be prudent, friends and colleagues. Let's \nbe cautious. Let's not be increasing the legal flow by 50 percent at a \ntime of high unemployment when it looks as if we are not going to be \nable to create enough jobs for those people who would be coming here. \nWe surely don't need to be doubling, it seems to me, the guest worker \nprogram at a time when we have high unemployment.\n  This is where we are. I believe that needs to be considered. I think \nthe American people who are out here watching what is going on in the \nCongress need to be asking their Senators and their Members of Congress \nwho will be taking up these issues soon: Are you thinking about us? \nWhom are you thinking about? Are you thinking politics or are you \nthinking about me? Who is thinking about me?\n  You meet in secret with the Chamber of Commerce. You meet in secret \nwith La Raza, you meet with the politicians, you meet with the meat \npackers group, and the immigration lawyers association, but you don't \nmeet with the law enforcement officers who have told us this bill will \nnot work.\n  You don't have representatives from the heart and soul of America in \nthere. Nobody is expressing what kind of impact will be felt by them. \nThis is what my concern is and one of my many concerns as we wrestle \nwith legislation.\n  We can deal compassionately with the people who have been here for a \nlong time, and I will support that. I believe we need a system that \nends the lawlessness and a system that serves the national interests of \nAmerican citizens.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized as in morning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me comment also, the Senator from Alabama has done a \nyeoman's job. He has studied this issue and looked at all angles. He \nhas one great advantage over me. He is an attorney who understands the \nramifications. Let me just mention two things about the bill which \nconcern me. One is that I have been privileged, maybe as much as any \nother Member of this Senate, to speak at naturalization ceremonies. If \nmy colleagues have never done it before, I say to my fellow Senators, \ndo it. One has a totally different perspective on this whole issue we \nare talking about; that is, getting to know people who go through the \nlegal channels. You look up and see that these are people who learned \nthe language, who have studied the history and, I daresay, would know \nas much about the history of the United States of America as we know in \nthis Chamber.\n  Anything that is going to fast-track a citizenship is something that \nis of concern to me.\n  This is not why I am here. I decided to come down knowing that the \nPresident of the United States was going to make a talk, and in this \ntalk I wish to make sure people understand what he is advocating is the \nlargest tax increase in the history of this country. It is something we \nknow he has been trying to do, in terms of his global warming \nactivities, actually a long time before he was first elected 4\\1/2\\ \nyears ago. His speech on global warming indicates he has started \ndelivering on all the promises he gave the environmentalists during his \ncampaign. When I talk about the environmentalists, I am talking about \nall the groups--good, well-meaning, some are not, some are extremists.\n\n  Leading up to his reelection campaign, the President had been given a \npass by all these organizations because they knew if the American \npeople thought he was going to do what we now know he is going to do, \nwhat he announced today, he would not be reelected because of the cost \nof it.\n  So he had been given a pass by the environmentalist groups, such as \nthe Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Fund, the Environmental \nDefense Fund, moveon.org, George Soros, Michael Moore--you know the \ncrowd. They said: Fine, but as soon as you are reelected, since you \ncan't be reelected again, we want to get all these things done. So all \nthese groups want the President to use his regulatory power to make \ntraditional forms of energy so expensive there is no option but to use \ntheir preferred alternatives.\n  They understood if the President wanted to get reelected he would \nneed\n\n[[Page S5133]]\n\nto delay many of these regulations until after his reelection, and that \nis exactly what happened. They were willing to do this because they \nbelieved it was that important to reelect Barack Obama for a second \nterm as President, as opposed to Mitt Romney or any of the others who \nwere running. So they gave him a pass, and they didn't talk about this. \nAs a result, he delayed many of the most significant regulations the \nEPA worked on during his first term until after the election.\n  One of those regulations was Boiler MACT. Let me explain MACT. MACT \nstands for maximum achievable control technology. It means what is the \nmaximum in terms of something, such as emissions, that can take place \nwhere you have the technology to support it.\n  This rule sets limits--this is on Boiler MACT--on emissions of \nindustrial and commercial boilers that are actually impossible to meet \nbecause the technology required by this rule isn't even available yet. \nIt would cost the economy--and the analysis that was done, by the way, \nno one has disagreed with--$63.3 billion and would result in about \n800,000 jobs being lost. It is called Boiler MACT. Every manufacturer \nhas a boiler, and these are the standards that would be required--an \nemissions standard--where there is no technology to reach that at this \ntime.\n  So the President waited to finalize the rule until the day after the \nelection. He didn't want the rule to go out before then because he \ndidn't want people to realize what it would cost until after election \nday.\n  Another rule is the Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards. It \nis called the NAAQ Standards, but it affects everyone in America. The \nPresident tried to redo President Bush's 2008 update of this standard \nduring his first term. But as the election neared, and the cost of the \nregulation became clear, he completely punted the effort. Now, however, \nwe know he is actually considering an update of this regulation that \ncould lower the standard from 35 parts per billion to 60 parts per \nbillion. This is on emissions, and this would put as many as 2,800 \ncounties out of attainment.\n  Let me tell you what that means--and, by the way, we have 77 counties \nin my State of Oklahoma, and all 77 would be out of attainment. It \nmeans you can't go out and recruit industry or keep the jobs you have \nbecause you are out of attainment. That is an official standing. This \nwould mean 2,800 counties would be out of attainment in the United \nStates, including all in my State of Oklahoma.\n  One thing the environmentalists want that the President has not been \nable to deliver--and it is even worse than all the rest of this stuff--\nis to deliver on the CO2 regulations, which is the crown \njewel of environmental regulations. In fact, there is an MIT professor \nnamed Richard Lindzen, who is supposed to be one of the outstanding and \nperhaps the premier climate scientist in America today, who said the \nregulations on carbon dioxide are a ``bureaucrat's dream. If you \ncontrol carbon, you control life.''\n  That is a pretty strong statement. This is because everything--every \nmanufacturing process, every refinery, every hospital diagnostics \nmachine, every home, every school, every church--would have to be \nregulated. If you can control carbon, you can control every decision \nanyone ever makes. This is what the liberals want. They want government \nto control everything, and their crown jewel is CO2. That is \nwhere the whole thing started.\n  Remember, a lot of people are saying now: We never did say it was \nglobal warming, now it is climate change. They have changed it around \nquite a bit, as people realized some of these things aren't true. I can \nremember when people were talking about global warming--now we know we \nare actually in part of this cycle that is going down. But that is not \nimportant. What is important is they want to regulate carbon dioxide. \nThat is their goal.\n  So the President first tried to push greenhouse gas emissions on the \nNation in 2010 when the Democrats had supermajorities in both the House \nand the Senate. The last bill they had was called the Waxman-Markey \nbill--two House Members. It was a cap-and-trade bill. We all know what \ncap and trade is. We have been talking about it now for 12 years. That \nis where they cap emissions and then they can trade those around. They \ncan buy and sell them and it results in a huge tax increase. It would \nhave regulated any source of emissions that emitted 25,000 tons of \ngreenhouse gas emissions or more.\n  That is very important because what the President announced today is \nfar greater than that. In other words, those bills were only going to \nregulate the emissions of industries that emitted 25,000 tons of \ngreenhouse gases each year. That came to a total cost of about $400 \nbillion a year.\n  Again, I am using these without documentation now because I have been \nusing them, and we have been documenting them for 12 years with no one \narguing the fact that if we pass cap and trade at 25,000 tons of \ngreenhouse gas emissions a year, it will cost about $400 billion. So \nthat is a huge amount.\n  While that may not be the largest tax increase in history, what the \nPresident proposed today would be. Congress squarely rejected that, and \nwhile the bill passed the House, it failed miserably in the Senate. \nThat is because it would have lowered the standards of living for the \nAmerican people across the country, forced businesses to shut down, and \nit would equate to the biggest tax increase in American history.\n  And I think people understood that. That was what happened in the \npast. What the President wants to do is what they could not get passed \nin terms of legislation, so they are going to now do it by regulation. \nThe American people knew what was going on, knew the impact this \nlegislation would have, and they told their Representatives to vote \nagainst it, and they did. Many of those who voted for it are no longer \nin this Chamber. They were defeated in 2010.\n  With the President's reelection squarely secured, the \nenvironmentalists have been crying for the President to act \naggressively on global warming. It is payback time. We understand, Mr. \nPresident, you couldn't push this thing by regulation before the \nelection because you wouldn't have been reelected. But now you are \nreelected, and we have a law that says you can't be reelected again, so \nit is payback time. So he is doing this unilaterally, bypassing \nCongress, and using the authority he is claiming under the Clean Air \nAct.\n\n  In the words of a very prominent Democratic Congressman, John \nDingell, this would be a ``glorious mess'' because instead of \nregulating only the biggest pollutants--such as in the Waxman-Markey \nbill, and those who wanted to regulate only industry that emitted over \n25,000 tons a year--the Clean Air Act regulation would regulate any \nfacility emitting over 250 tons. So it is not 25,000 tons that would be \nregulated, it is anything over 250 tons. You can't even calculate how \nmuch that would cost in terms of a tax increase.\n  As the President announced today, he will begin this process with the \nregulation of greenhouse gases from new and existing powerplants. The \nPresident may have said today he will work with the State utilities to \nmake sure they get a policy they like, but that is just window \ndressing. It is putting lipstick on the pig. Legally, the President \ncannot get around the requirements of the Clean Air Act.\n  The Clean Air Act was passed a long time ago. In fact, I supported \nit. We had the Clean Air Act regulations back when I was serving in the \nHouse. They were good and they worked, but they do call for regulation \nof any facility emitting 250 tons of greenhouse gases a year. It wasn't \nmeant for greenhouse gases that make those kinds of emissions. And \nwhile he might not be talking about it, the law he is using to justify \ngreenhouse regulations would not let him stop with regulating just \npowerplants or allowing him to craft a policy that states that. He \ndoesn't have a choice. The law requires him to eventually impose \nregulations on every single industry in the country--every single \nindustry--one at a time, with unelected bureaucrats doing the heavy \nlifting along the way.\n  This means every school, every hospital, every apartment will \neventually be regulated by the President's EPA, and at a much greater \ncost than the $400 billion a year that was expected under Waxman-\nMarkey. Keep in mind, the Waxman-Markey bill was the last cap-and-trade \nbill they tried to pass through, and it was soundly defeated. In fact, \nit is so hard, no one has ever calculated what the cost will be to the \nAmerican people if they had to regulate down to 250 tons.\n\n[[Page S5134]]\n\n  Let me give an example. For my State of Oklahoma I always calculate \nat the first of each year how many Federal taxpayers we have in the \nState. Then I do the math every time something comes along. Well, in \nterms of regulating under those industries over 25,000 tons of \nemissions a year, that amounts to $400 billion, which is about $3,000 a \nyear for each taxpayer in Oklahoma. That is what you have to stop and \nrealize. The cost of this thing is not little, it is huge.\n  Today's announcement doesn't come as a surprise. We have known they \nhave been working on these regulations since the President was first \nelected, scheming to give his environmental base exactly what they \nwant.\n  Roger Martella, former general counsel of the EPA, recently said, \n``Two years is about the minimal time it would take to go from soup to \nnuts on a rule like this,'' and ``these rules don't come out of the \nclear blue sky and involve lengthy internal deliberations before the \npublic even gets the first peak at them.''\n  So we know what is going on right now has been happening for a long \nperiod of time. Further, the Congressional Research Service recently \nput out a report saying President Obama has spent $68.4 billion on \nclimate change activities since he has been elected. This doesn't \nrequire a vote. This was all done by the President. So that has been \ntaking place, and the CBO substantiated this by saying the annual \nspending on climate change has reached an annual level of $7.5 billion, \nwith an additional $35 billion being provided in the President's $825 \nbillion stimulus plan.\n  The President has been intent on giving his environmental base this \nvictory for a long time, and he is willing to bypass Congress to make \nit happen. And the reason is because it would not pass Congress. We \nhave had his bills here and they have been defeated every time.\n  I would look at the majority leader right now and say: I bet you \ncouldn't come up with 35 votes to pass cap and trade in the Senate. But \non regulations, he can do it without having to go out and get the \nvotes.\n  The impact is clear: It is the crushing of our economy. As I spoke on \nthe floor last night, developments in horizontal drilling and hydraulic \nfracturing have resulted in a boom in energy production. Oil production \nin America is up 40 percent in the last 4 years. It is not because \nPresident Obama is President; it is in spite of his policies because \nall these things have happened in hydraulic fracturing.\n  By the way, I know a little about that because the first hydraulic \nfracturing was done in my State of Oklahoma, and that was in 1949. \nThere has never been a case of groundwater contamination in the years \nsince then, in over 1 million applications.\n  Now, the 40 percent increase in production in this country in 4 years \nall came from the private and State lands. None of it came from the \nFederal Government because this administration would not let us drill \nand produce in that area. In fact, the report I just quoted said that \non Federal lands it has been reduced by 7 percent.\n  So while overall oil production nationwide is up 40 percent, on the \nFederal lands it is down by 7 percent.\n  The President is setting us on a course of unilateral disarming of \nour economy the same as he is doing to the military. He wants to impose \ncostly regulations to our energy and manufacturing sectors that no \nother nation on Earth has. China, India, Southeast Asia, Mexico, all \nthese nations know you need cheap reliable energy. They have to have it \nin their countries. They are never going to pursue these regulations, \nand they are waiting for the day America does it unilaterally.\n  Why would that be? Because if we do it, they know our jobs are going \nto have to find energy someplace, and they will be after those jobs. \nAny unilateral greenhouse regulations we have in the United States will \nonly shut down our domestic production.\n  In fact, when Lisa Jackson was the Director of the Environmental \nProtection Agency, I asked this question, and on live TV she gave me a \nvery honest answer: If we were to pass any of these cap-and-trade \nbills--such as the ones I have been talking about--would this lower \noverall emissions of CO2? And she said, No. Because the \nproblem is not here; it is in China and India and Mexico, and other \ncountries where they don't have regulations.\n  You could carry that argument out and say if you pass these things \nand we do it unilaterally in the United States, as the President \nsuggested today, it is going to have the effect of increasing \nCO2, because people will seek those countries where they can \nactually do this, where they don't have any restrictions at all. So \nthere is no need for the President to take us down this path.\n  He is beholden to his environmental base which claims global warming \nis the biggest threat facing humanity. Many have said, even in recent \nmonths, that all the major weather events of the last decade have been \nthe result of global warming. Some have even claimed Oklahoma's recent \ntornadoes are the result of global warming. This isn't true. Oklahoma \nUniversity's weather center says this year has not been any different \nthan years past. We have plotted our tornadoes since 1950.\n  The majority leader doesn't have tornadoes in the State of Nevada as \nwe do in the State of Oklahoma. But we have been tracking them since \nthe 1950s and the trend is about the same. It is not any higher this \nyear, last year, and the year before than it has been in the past. It \nis because we have been having these events since the dawn of time that \nmany environmentalists now refuse to refer to global warming as global \nwarming, so they call it climate change or anything else the public \nwill buy.\n  We will most likely not be hearing many of these environmentalists \ntalk about the fact that during the last 15 years there has not been \nany increase in temperature, as reported in The Economist. But even if \nthey did acknowledge this, with the term climate change, they have an \nalibi, because climate change by its name doesn't necessarily mean \nwarming. It can mean anything. The President's announcement today of \nhis new plan to regulate greenhouse gases to combat global warming does \nnot come as a surprise. He has been working on it for years.\n  I would conclude and say, let's remember what it was that Richard \nLindzen--the foremost authority in America on this subject--stated when \nhe said regulating CO2 is a bureaucrat's dream: If you \ncontrol carbon, you control life.\n  And remember the other thing, and that is all the expense, all the \ntrouble we are talking about going through, and all that the President \nannounced today is not going to reduce CO2--not according to \na Republican, but to the Democratic former Director of the EPA.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there will be no more rollcall votes \ntonight.\n  At 11:30 tomorrow, I remind everyone we have a motion to waive the \nbudget point of order. We will also vote after that on the Leahy \namendment No. 1183, as modified. Following that, we will have a vote on \nthe motion to invoke cloture on the committee-reported substitute. So \nwe have those votes already set up.\n  I have been at the White House for the last couple hours with Senator \nMcConnell. I got back to the cloakroom, and we are working on an \namendment list. During my absence here the staff has been working very \nhard. We have worked amongst ourselves, we have worked with the \nRepublicans trying to come up with a list of amendments. We are not \nthere yet. I am informed that the last half hour or so we went backward \nrather than forward. But we are working on this. We can still do it. We \nhave to keep our eye on the prize and make sure everyone is willing to \ngive a little, because right now there are too many amendments that \nwill never be agreed to. But this can be done, and we will continue to \nwork. A majority of both caucuses wants amendments. Having said that, \nsimple majorities won't do it. But I am hopeful and confident we are \ngoing to be able to work something out on amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, there are a number of my colleagues \nwho are going to be speaking in the next hour about the President's \nannouncement today of his plan to address carbon pollution and the \nchanges it is wreaking on our planet.\n\n[[Page S5135]]\n\n  We just heard from the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma about the \npolitics and motives behind the President's decision. We can disagree \nabout the politics and motives, but I think we should be past the point \nof disagreeing about the facts.\n  The facts are that in the past 15 years, during which the \ndistinguished Senator said we have not seen any increase in \ntemperature, we have actually had the hottest decade on record. I will \nget the exact figures in a moment, but I think 10 of the 12 hottest \nyears on record have been in the past 15 years. I heard the \ndistinguished Senator say that so I don't have the exact numbers, but \nthere has been a terrific spike.\n  If you go to the property casualty insurance industry--which is not \nan industry that is heavily involved with Democratic or liberal \npolitics--these people who do their calculations make their living by \ntrying to predict correctly, and their cold-hearted actuaries have no \npurpose other than to provide the insurance industry the best possible \ninformation. They are showing an exceptional spike in both the number \nand severity of storms we are seeing, and they are having to adjust \ntheir insurance practices accordingly.\n  I hope we can find a way to work together, because I think the \nPresident's step that he took today is one that is long overdue and \nvitally important to our economy, vitally important to our national \nsecurity, vitally important to our international credibility and, most \nof all, vitally important to our children and grandchildren. This is \nthe great issue and responsibility of our time, and I am delighted to \nsee the President has stepped up to it.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Hawaii is on the floor. He was \nat the President's announcement with me, and I know he wants to say a \nfew words.\n  Trying to do something about this and put a price on carbon has been \ndescribed as the biggest tax in history, perhaps, and as something that \nwould amount to the crushing of our economy. I think it is pretty safe \nto show that neither of those statements is accurate.\n  For starters, there is nothing that says the government has to keep \nthe money when it is in a carbon pollution fee. It could go straight \nback to American families and be essentially a wash in the economy. In \nfact, by going back to families 100 cents on the dollar and changing \nthe economic behavior of the industry for the better, I think it will \nprove to be an economic plus.\n  Over and over, EPA regulations have been imposed that created more \neconomic benefit for the country than they cost. I am confident this \nregulation, once it gets going, will create more economic benefit for \nthe country than it will cost. And every dollar of it could go back. It \nwould mean as much as $900 a year for every American family to offset \nany increase in energy cost and to spend how they will.\n  But to do something that Republicans ordinarily agree is important, \nand that is to set the market straight so there isn't an imbalance in \nwhich the price of a product doesn't reflect the true cost of a \nproduct, that is law 101, it is economics 101, it is fairness 101. It \nshould not be a proposition we are debating.\n  I intend to stay here until this hour or so we have is concluded, and \nI yield to the distinguished Senator from Hawaii who was also at the \nPresident's announcement in the blazing heat. But since he is from \nHawaii, he is more used to the heat than I am.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would the Senator yield before he yields to the Senator \nfrom Hawaii?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield the floor, whoever seeks recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I was very encouraged by the President's \nspeech today for a number of reasons. The main thing I found \nencouraging is he is obviously done waiting. And there are three \nreasons to be done waiting.\n  The first is it is very unlikely, given the current composition of \nthe Congress, that the Congress will take action in the 113th. We have \nto recognize that political reality.\n  The second is from an ecological standpoint, we don't have the luxury \nof waiting. We don't have 5 or 8 or 12 years to wait and deliberate. We \nneed to take action now in order to reverse global climate change.\n  The third is a matter of law. Under the EPA v. Massachusetts, the \nSupreme Court didn't just give the authority to the EPA to regulate \ncarbon as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act; it effectively requires \nthat the EPA move forward. So even if this President didn't believe in \nthe science, even if this President weren't as passionate as he is \nabout combating climate change, he would be required under the law to \ncomply with the conditions of the Supreme Court decision.\n  Let's get one thing straight. In a way, it is a little sad this has \nto be asserted on the Senate floor as a political statement, but here \nit is: Climate change is real, it is caused by humans, and it is \nsolvable. It is a real threat with a high cost. But if we act now, we \ncan start a new era of economic and scientific leadership for American \ninnovation.\n  I see our young pages here. This is an incredible opportunity for \ninnovation, for partnership, for opportunity, for our economy to grow, \nand for us to again become a world leader to start a second industrial \nrevolution in clean energy and clean technology.\n  The State of Hawaii was able to move forward with something called \nthe Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative. What we have done is simply \nbreathtaking. In a very short period of time, we have actually tripled \nclean energy production--and not from 2 percent to 6 percent but, \nrather, from 6 percent to around 18 percent--in a matter of a few \nyears, all the while driving unemployment down.\n  So the old choice between economic development and economic \nopportunity and environmental protection, the premise that \nunfortunately some on the other side of the aisle cling to, which is we \nhave to choose between protecting our health and our environment for \nfuture generations and economic opportunity in the short run, has been \ndisproven.\n  We have great opportunities to be a leader in clean technology. That \nis why we have to support ARPA-E, that is why we have to support our \nDOE and national energy labs. The Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative is \nproof that we can do so.\n  I am very encouraged by the President's movement. I am pleased to \nwork on a bipartisan basis with anyone who wants to legislate. If there \nare problems with the straight regulating of carbon, let's talk about \nthat. But the only way to solve those problems is by legislating. If \nthis body and the body across the Capitol are unwilling to act, I am \npleased this administration will take action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Hawaii. I ask unanimous consent, if he wishes to engage in a \ncolloquy on the Senate floor, if that would be agreeable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. We were both at the President's speech today. One of \nthe things the President mentioned that I think is an important point \nto bear in mind is carbon pollution isn't free right now. We are not \ngoing to suddenly impose a cost on the economy through regulation that \notherwise would not be there.\n  I can speak for Rhode Island. We are paying the price right now in \nthe price of food and goods that are more expensive because of \nwildfires and droughts. We are paying the price in the cost of repairs \nto homes and shorelines that have been damaged by floods and storms. We \nare paying the price in terms of increased taxes for more disaster \nservices--not only in Rhode Island but across the country. We are \npaying the price in the form of hikes in our insurance premiums. We pay \nthe price in softer ways--in days spent in the hospital with a child \nhaving an asthma attack when you could be working or at home. And \ncertainly we pay the price in what you might call the lost victories of \ninnovation we never achieved because we were so busy subsidizing these \nold fuels.\n  I wish to ask the Senator from Hawaii to comment for a moment on how \nhe sees the costs in his home State of Hawaii, which is far away from \nmy home State of Rhode Island, both very ocean and coastal States. But \nI would\n\n[[Page S5136]]\n\nlove to hear his experience and his views as well.\n  Then I see the Senator from Connecticut is on the floor, who is \nwelcomed to either join in the colloquy or to make a statement, as he \nwishes.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, through the Chair, I would like to \nanswer the Senator's question and then yield to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  I thank my friend for pointing out that this is not just for those of \nus who consider ourselves environmentalists, this has become an \neconomic issue as well. This has become a question of our national \nstrategic priorities. There is a reason that Admiral Locklear, the head \nof the U.S. Pacific Command, gave an address in which he called climate \nchange the strategic threat in the Pacific theater. That is not because \nhe is a member of the League of Conservation Voters or the Sierra Club, \nit is because he understands what is happening throughout the Pacific \ntheater.\n  There is a reason that Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus is leaning so \nheavily forward on the question of biofuels and clean energy. Again, it \nis not because his job is to be concerned with global climate change. \nHis job is to make sure the Navy is as prepared as possible from a fuel \nstandpoint and from a readiness standpoint. He sees new fuels as the \nway to go.\n  The other part of this equation from the Department of Defense \nperspective is the amount of money we have to spend forward operating \nto protect our fuel supplies and fuel lines. To the extent we can have \nsmart grid technology, better battery storage technology, new renewable \nenergy generation, and better efficiency, all of that helps our troops, \nespecially as they are forward deployed.\n  I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for pointing out that there is \na broadening recognition that this issue goes beyond conservation or \nanyone's particular concern with the natural environment narrowly \nspeaking. This is a question about the cost of insurance, how much we \nhave to spend on flood mitigation, and how much we have to spend in \nterms of disaster mitigation. This is now pervading our entire economy. \nIt is costing the Federal Treasury billions of dollars, and so the cost \nof doing nothing at this point exceeds the cost of action.\n  I yield the floor for the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I thank both of my colleagues. We \nwill soon be joined by another colleague in this colloquy, my colleague \nand friend from Connecticut Senator Murphy.\n  I first want to thank the Senator from Rhode Island. He has been a \nconstant and extraordinarily eloquent speaker on this subject. He has \nregularly been reminding us of our obligation even before the President \noutlined his vision of what we need to do today. I thank my friend, and \nI thank the President for his bold leadership and very effective and \ncourageous action he is taking today.\n  Anybody who questions the need for action in this area need look no \nfurther than the shorelines of Connecticut which were devastated by \nSuperstorm Sandy and have been repeatedly hit over this past year by a \nrash of unprecedented severe weather events. Connecticut has been \nthrough extraordinarily severe and serious weather events that may \nbecome the new normal.\n  We hate to think of these kinds of storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes \nas the regular order. In fact, that havoc may be the new normal for \nmany States and, indeed, the new normal for all of America, which is \nwhy the President's leadership today is very important. Without action, \nwe will suffer the effects of inertia and continued pollution \ncontamination. Climate disruption is the result of human contribution, \nhuman inaction, and human failure to address these problems. In fact, \ninaction is unacceptable. Inertia is intolerable. This kind of \nleadership from the Senate, as well as from the President, is a moral \nobligation to protect the climate for our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  In the last 30 years asthma rates have doubled. In the last year \nalone our Nation has faced droughts, floods, and extreme temperatures \nin almost every corner of the country, which exacts a cost in dollars \nand in human lives as well as suffering. These kinds of extremes in \nclimate are destructive and deadly. The health-related costs of climate \nchange literally add billions more to our debt.\n  Connecticut has suffered major disasters six times since 2010. There \nhave been six disasters in less than 4 years, and that compares with \nsix disasters in a 30-year period from 1954 to 1985. So we know \nfirsthand how climate disruption--it is not just climate change, it is \nclimate disruption--can affect our daily lives.\n  We have an opportunity, as well as an imperative, to act now. We need \nto take simple steps, and we know what they are: upgrading and \nmodernizing our existing powerplants so they emit less carbon, \ninvesting in clean energy research and development, and investing in \nfuel cells.\n  Connecticut is the fuel cell capital of the Nation and could be the \nfuel cell capital of the world. By doing what I just mentioned, \ncombined with other measures that are easily within reach, we can help \nsave lives and dollars in this effort. The investments we are making in \ninfrastructure--the public investments--can also help us to go in this \ndirection.\n  There are commonsense and necessary actions that we have an \nobligation and an opportunity to take now, and one of them is the \nappointment of Gina McCarthy to head the EPA. Her appointment is now \nstalled by the same paralyzing partisan gridlock that is all too \ncommon. This kind of partisan gamesmanship should stop. I know her \nwell. I can assure this body of her qualifications, as I have done \nbefore.\n  She has worked in the Presiding Officer's State of Massachusetts, as \nwell as my State of Connecticut. She has worked with Republican \nGovernors. She has exemplified the kind of balanced, sensitive, and \nresponsive approach to business needs and interests as well as to \nenvironmental protection.\n  She is well respected in the environment and business communities \nbecause of her dedication to developing practical solutions in facing \nthis set of environmental challenges. Her leadership, along with the \nPresident's vision today, is so very important.\n  There is a group of us who are working together. I am proud to be a \npart of that effort. I have cosponsored legislation that would protect \nsome of Connecticut's treasured bodies of water, including the \nFarmington River, the Salmon Brook, and Pawcatuck River as part of the \nNational Wild and Scenic Rivers System.\n  I have joined with members of the New England delegation to urge the \nArmy Corps of Engineers to complete its study of the Connecticut River \nso we can better understand the human impact on that river and improve \nits system. All of these efforts will be for naught if America and \nhumankind fail to address the fundamental challenge we now face, which \nis to end our contribution to climate disruption, stop the drift and \ninertia, accept that we must act and act now. The President's plan is \nonly an example of the kind of bold approach we need to combat the \nimpacts of climate change.\n  With the Presiding Officer's approval, and with the Senator from \nRhode Island's acquiescence, I will yield to my colleague from \nConnecticut for his comments. We share a State, and we also share a \nview that our children--his two and my four--will benefit from what we \ndo together as a body, as a group, and as a country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, we have a lot in common. We share the \nfact that we are both parents. In fact, I am the father of two little \nboys--a 4-year-old and a 1-year-old. If they are lucky enough, they \nmight get to live to see the year 2100. They might be around for the \nend of this century, as opposed to the rest of us who will not see that \nday. I shudder to think about the Connecticut they are going to have to \ndeal with 80-some years from today if we don't act right now.\n  This isn't science fiction that we are talking about. In New England \nwe are talking about a 1- to 3-foot rise in sea level by the end of \nthis century. Just a handful of inches is catastrophic in some parts of \nthe globe, but a 3-foot rise in sea level in the State of Connecticut \non a shoreline that has already been battered--as Senator\n\n[[Page S5137]]\n\nBlumenthal mentioned--by storm after storm would be absolutely \ncataclysmic.\n  The Connecticut my children may be living in at the end of this \ncentury would bear almost no recognition to the one in which they live \nnow. Every single week and every single month that we don't do \nsomething is another step closer to that future world which we now \nthink of as one of fantasy.\n  Connecticut is also home to some of the biggest property and casualty \ninsurance companies in the country--and, frankly, in the world. I think \nit is important to recognize the fact that our inability to act is \nbankrupting this country right now as we speak. The property and \ncasualty industry has paid out $135 billion with respect to extreme \nweather events in 2012--$139 billion has been paid out. Now, that \nresults in increased premiums, which results in skyrocketing costs for \neverybody across this country who is paying for property and casualty \ninsurance.\n  The taxpayers have likely paid about $100 billion in terms of cleanup \ncosts and remediation costs just over the last year alone. Superstorm \nSandy, and the events that we have seen hit the gulf and the east \ncoast, are bankrupting our Nation and bankrupting companies and private \ninsurance policyholders as we speak. Those costs are catastrophic.\n  The reason we have such a big group of Senators down here applauding \nthe President's actions is also because we know the United States \ncannot do this alone. We know we are going to have to convince \ncountries such as India, China, and developing nations to join us in a \nglobal effort. We hope the international climate talks are on pace to \nget an agreement that could be operative by the end of this decade, in \n2020.\n  The world is still scarred by a unanimous vote in this Chamber to \nreject the Kyoto protocols. The world is skeptical that the United \nStates really has the courage to lead on this issue.\n  Even though this body remains paralyzed for the time being on this \nsubject, having the President come out and make the proposals he has \ntoday will hopefully give some confidence to the people who will be \nsitting in Poland at the end of this year. Hopefully, they will work \nout a climate agreement over the next several years on which the United \nStates--at least with respect to the administration and the Senators \ndown on the floor--is willing to lead.\n  Finally, I was pleased to hear the President talk about the specific \nissue of fast-acting climate pollutants today. We are going to have to \nget a global agreement on carbon dioxide. In the meantime, as we try to \nfigure out a bridge to that 2020 operative agreement, if we are able to \nwork with the international community with respect to the climate \npollutants of methane, black carbon, and HFCs, we can make an enormous \ndent as we get ready for that lasting agreement.\n  In fact, we just got good news last weekend that the President, along \nwith the head of the Chinese Government, has come to an agreement to \ntry to rework the Montreal protocols with respect to a reduction in the \nadmittance of HFCs, one of the most disastrous and insidious climate \npollutants.\n  This is a very good day. We have given a signal to the international \ncommunity that we are ready to lead. We have given a signal to millions \nof kids across the country who hope they might be around at the end of \nthis century and that this country might have some approximation to \nwhat we enjoy today.\n  There will be a big group of us--led by Senators Whitehouse, Merkley, \nand Boxer--who will be ready to work with this President to enact this \nvery bold plan. As I mentioned, one of the leaders of this effort is my \ngood friend whom I yield to now, with the permission of the Presiding \nOfficer, the Senator from Oregon.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I thank my colleagues from Connecticut \nand Maryland and Rhode Island who are down here sharing their stories \nand their concerns about carbon pollution and its impact on climate \naround the world.\n  Indeed, it was just last October that I was engaged in a triathlon. \nIn the first stage, the swimming was in the ocean in North Carolina. I \nhad been told to expect temperatures of 62 to 65 degrees. As I went \ndown to the water with the first group of participants getting off the \ntransport bus, the first in front of me stepped in the water and said: \nHey, folks, this water is really warm. Come on in.\n  The temperature was not 62 degrees or 65 degrees, the temperature of \nthe ocean was 72 degrees. A week later Hurricane Sandy struck the \nNortheast with incredibly devastating consequences, powered by this \nmuch warmer ocean water. That is one of the many effects we are seeing \nof increased carbon in the atmosphere, trapping the Earth's heat.\n  Perhaps the most important number we should all be aware of is the \nnumber 400. I put the number 400 on a chart so we could ponder it--400 \nparts per million. What that represents is a roughly 50-percent \nincrease in carbon dioxide as it is represented in the broader \natmosphere since the start of the Industrial Revolution, going from 270 \nto 400. That is a lot of heat-trapping gases added to the atmosphere.\n  Indeed, when we were at 350, scientists started to say, before we hit \n400, we need to dramatically reduce the burning of fossil fuels so we \nwill never hit 400 and the number will come back down and stabilize \naround 350.\n  If we were being graded as human civilization on this planet on our \neffectiveness in decreasing the burning of fossil fuels and keeping the \nconcentration from increasing, we would be getting an F. We would be \nfailing because not only did we soar from 350 to 400, but the rate of \ncarbon pollution has doubled in the last 30 years. Thirty years ago the \nrate was, on average, one part per million per year. Now the average \nrate is two parts per million per year. So not only have we not \ndecreased and leveled out, but the steepest of the curve has doubled, \nwhich means that 5 years from now we will be at 410 and 10 years from \nnow we will be at 420. What this represents is a very bleak future for \nhumans on this planet.\n  By various estimates, it has been somewhere between 3 million and 10 \nmillion years since our atmosphere had this level of carbon \nconcentration. That means that in the time humans have been on this \nplanet, which is less than 200,000 years, humans have never witnessed--\nhave never lived in an atmosphere of this concentration. We have never \nleft footprints in the sand when the atmosphere has this level of heat-\ntrapping gases.\n  Now we see it everywhere. We see it in Oregon in terms of our cascade \nglaciers are getting smaller and our cascade snowpacks are getting \nsmaller. Our pine beetle infestations--normally knocked down by cold \nwinters--are getting larger. Our fires are getting larger, fed by \ndrought and dead trees from the pine needles. Indeed, we have had three \nrecord-setting droughts in the Klamath Basin in the last 30 years--the \nworst ever droughts three times in the last 13 years.\n  We are even seeing it in our Pacific Ocean oysters. Those oysters, \nwhen they are tiny, are very sensitive to the acidity of the water. The \nacidity has gone up because carbon dioxide in the water has gone up.\n  We have many examples just in my home State. If we look across the \nrest of the United States, if we look across the globe, there are huge \nimpacts everywhere, with multiples of impact at the poles, where the \ntemperature change is faster.\n  I applaud the President for saying we must have a bold strategy to \ntake on climate change. There are three big areas of carbon dioxide \ngeneration, and those are electricity generation, transportation, and \nbuildings. His plan lays out strategies in all three areas, and that is \ngood. That is a starting point for a much broader discussion on how we \nend our fossil fuel addiction. Addictions are hard to kick, but they \nare particularly hard to kick if we have someone who is trying to keep \nus hooked, and those who benefit from the profits of burning fossil \nfuels are very much trying to keep us hooked. So we have to recognize \nthat requires an extra degree of dedication and effort on all of our \nparts.\n  I will wrap up and turn this over to my colleague from Maryland, who \nhas been a terrific champion on this topic and who has seen firsthand \nin Maryland many of the effects of global warming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let me thank Senator Merkley for his\n\n[[Page S5138]]\n\nstatement but more importantly for what he has done to elevate the \ndiscussion in the Senate on the need to deal with our environment, to \ndeal with energy, to deal with climate change. He has been one of our \ntrue leaders in ways in which we can live sensibly and in a way that is \ngood for our environment, good for our economy, and good for our \nhealth.\n  I also notice Senator Whitehouse is on the floor. I know he helped \norganize all of us being here today. He has taken on a leadership \nposition in the Senate in the area of climate change, and I personally \nwish to thank him because this has been a difficult challenge, to keep \nus focused on one of the most important issues of our time. When we \ntalk about a legacy we want to leave to future generations, it is our \nenvironment, it is our health, it is our economy, it is our national \nsecurity, and Senator Whitehouse has been in the forefront of keeping \nus engaged on this issue so we could reach this day.\n  I applaud President Obama for his statements today, for his \nleadership, and for his action plan on dealing with climate change. It \nis comprehensive. It is extremely timely. I think it is a workable \nsolution for us to be the leaders in the international community in \ndealing with the issues of climate change. First and foremost, it is \nbased upon the best science. This is not a political issue, this is a \nscience issue. Climate change is real, and the way we have to deal with \nit should be based upon the best science. That is what President Obama \nis seeking.\n  I heard some of my colleagues who are reluctant on this issue talk \nabout the cost. I am glad they raised the issue of cost because when we \npassed the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, the recommendations \nof some individuals who weren't exactly excited with the bill required \nthat we do a cost-benefit analysis on the cost of regulation versus the \nbenefit to our society. That cost-benefit analysis shows that we get \nfour to eight times back in savings for what it costs to regulate to \nget clean air and clean water. That is just the direct economic issues. \nWe also get a healthier lifestyle. We get air we can breathe. We are \nable to enjoy the environment. That is a plus in addition to the direct \neconomic benefit.\n  I wish to talk about my experiences in Maryland. Maryland took a \nleadership position. We passed some of the toughest clean air standards \nin the country. We invested $1 billion in cleaning up our energy-\ngenerating plants. Do my colleagues know what that meant for Maryland? \nThat meant 2,000 more jobs. We created jobs by cleaning up our \nenvironment. But we need national help. Why? Because air doesn't \nexactly stop at a State border, and we are downwind from many other \nStates. The people in Maryland are suffering from dirty air not as a \nresult of what is being generated in Maryland but what is being \ngenerated elsewhere, so we need national standards. That is exactly why \nthe President has called for dramatic action and is taking dramatic \naction today.\n  Inaction will cost us dearly. We have had more episodes of extreme \nweather recently, and that is based upon science and the fact that \nweather is changing as a result of carbon pollution in our environment, \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Between 2011 and 2012, those types of extreme \nweather events cost us more than $1 billion worth of damage. The \ntaxpayers of this country paid for it because we believe that when we \nhave emergency, extreme conditions, there is a community responsibility \nto help deal with it. Well, we can do something about it to mitigate \nthat type of damage in the future, and the President did that today in \nhis call for action in regard to climate change.\n  Superstorm Sandy has been referred to a couple of times on this \nfloor. We saw the devastation of that storm, which was very close to \nwhere we are here in the Nation's Capital. Last year we had a record-\nsetting number of continuous days of 95-plus-degree weather, so we know \nfirsthand what is happening.\n  In my own State of Maryland and in this region, we pride ourselves on \nthe Chesapeake Bay and what we have done to clean up the Chesapeake \nBay. I was with Senator Carper on Monday, and we had a good-news press \nconference on the Eastern Shore of Maryland talking about some of the \npositive results we have seen in the bay.\n  We have worked to reduce the nutrient levels in the bay, and that is \na very positive element. It reduces the oxygen deprivation in the \nChesapeake Bay, and as a result we have had fewer dead zones than we \nhad in the 1980s. That is due to the hard work we have done in this \nregion with farmers and developers to reduce the nutrient pollutants. \nYes, we are dealing with storm water runoff with farmers and \ndevelopers, but we also have to deal with the realities of climate \nchange. Warmer water kills sea grass. Sea grasses are critically \nimportant for the diversity of the Chesapeake Bay. So this issue \naffects my region, it affects our entire country, and inaction can \ncause extreme damage.\n  The biggest sources of carbon pollution--and my colleagues have \nalready talked about it--are powerplants. The President talked about \nthat, and he talked about how we deal with transportation and how we \ndeal with our buildings. No. 1 on our list should be conservation. The \nless energy we use is the easiest way we can reduce our carbon \nfootprint. We also have to develop alternative fuels, and we have to be \nmuch more aggressive in doing that.\n  I heard a lot of people talk about the international reaction and \nwhat other countries are doing. Two weeks ago I was in China. I was in \nBeijing. I was there for a couple of days. I never saw the Sun, and \nthat wasn't because there were clouds. There were no clouds in the sky. \nI couldn't see the Sun because of pollution. That is not unusual in \nBeijing. So China is now doing something about carbon emissions. They \nare doing it because they have a political problem because their people \ncan see the pollution and they have a tough time breathing. People are \nactually issued masks that can supplement their oxygen intake because \nthe pollution is so bad in China. They are taking action. They are \ndeveloping alternative fuels. They are investing in solar and wind and \nin conservation because they know it is critically important.\n  Quite frankly, what is needed is U.S. leadership. The international \ncommunity is waiting for America to assume the leadership role, and I \nthink the international community is prepared to work with us. That is \nwhy President Obama's comments today were just so timely--so timely to \nshow that the United States is prepared to take action and to lead in \nthe international community so we all can pass on a cleaner \nenvironment, a safer world, a cleaner world, a more economically viable \nworld, a world that is more secure for our children. President Obama \ntook a giant step forward toward that vision with his comments today.\n  Let me yield very quickly back to the Senator from Rhode Island, if I \nmight.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I know the Senator from Texas is \nwaiting to speak. I wish to, first of all, thank the Senator from \nMaryland, who is such a wonderful leader and ally and friend. He is \nvery loyal to the needs and concerns of Maryland in this area. He has \nbeen terrific.\n  Earlier, the Senator from Oklahoma said--I think I am quoting him \ncorrectly--that in the past 15 years, there has not been any increase \nin temperature--I guess to suggest this isn't a real problem and we \ndon't have to worry about it. I tried to get the figure right, but I \nhave double-checked it, and I would like to correct myself. In the past \n15 years, 13 of those 15 years are the 13 hottest years on record. So \nthe past 15 years has been a period of very unusual heat.\n  What happens when you have that type of unusual heat? What happens \nwhen you have the climate disruption--to use the good phrase of Senator \nBlumenthal. You end up with added storms.\n  This is a graph prepared by the insurance industry--not exactly a \nbunch of liberals. This is how they make their money. They want to get \nit right. They have graphed the storm activity, starting all the way \nover there in 1980, coming here to 2012.\n  So if you go back in the last 15 years here, you will see a \nsignificant increase in storm activity--the type of major storms the \ninsurance industry has to pay for, so they care very deeply about this. \nThey get their data right, and I think they can be trusted.\n  I also think that the 13 out of 15 being the hottest years on record \ncan\n\n[[Page S5139]]\n\nbe trusted because that is science that comes from NASA. I do not know \nwhere the Senator from Oklahoma was getting his data, but I will trust \nthe scientists at NASA. These are people who have put an explorer the \nsize of an SUV on the top of a rocket, fired it off into space, sent it \nto Mars, landed it on the surface of Mars, and they are now driving it \naround on the surface of Mars. I do not think these are scientists who \nare incapable of getting it right. So I trust the insurance industry \nfor these numbers about storms. I trust the NASA scientists for the \nnumbers about temperature.\n  I think it is pretty clear that we are way out of the bounds of \nhistory, as Mr. Merkley, the senior Senator from Oregon, said. The \nentire history of our species on this planet--until the Industrial \nRevolution and our great carbon dump--has been within 170 to 300 parts \nper million. That has been the range for as long as we have been a \nspecies on this planet--until this sudden up-surge, and that has now \ntaken us to 400. It is a novelty, if that is not too frivolous a word \nto use for such an excursion outside of the bandwidth in which our \nspecies has inhabited this planet throughout our entire existence.\n  I see the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Texas \norganizing who is going to speak next, and I will respectfully yield to \nwhichever one of them wishes to proceed. But I do want to thank my \ncolleagues for coming to the floor today to discuss this issue. Senator \nMurphy from Connecticut, Senator Merkley from Oregon, Senator Schatz \nfrom Hawaii, Senator Blumenthal from Connecticut, Senator Cardin from \nMaryland, and now Senator Tom Udall from New Mexico all have been here \non very short notice because we all want to support this President in \nhis decision to move forward on regulating our carbon pollution and \nbeginning to forestall the damage it is doing to our economies, to our \nStates, to our coastlines, to our forests, to our farms. If anything, \none could say it is about time, but it certainly is time, and I applaud \nthat the President has stepped so well forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I thank Senator Whitehouse \nvery much--him and the other Senators who have been down here talking.\n  I would ask the Chair--Senator Cruz has been very generous. It was \nhis turn to go, and I said I could finish this in 5 minutes. So I would \nask the Presiding Officer to indicate when 5 minutes is up, and I will \nyield the floor, then, to him and ask unanimous consent that he get the \nfloor after me so that there is not any issue there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I say to Senator \nWhitehouse, one of the things the Senator and I know--and we have been \nasking for this and talking about this--we need Presidential \nleadership. We saw that today. The speech that was given here in \nWashington really detailed a lot of the important work that needs to be \ndone.\n  We both serve on the Environment and Public Works Committee. We know \nhow important it is to get an EPA Administrator in place and to move \nforward with the greenhouse gas regulations the Supreme Court has now \nsaid we can move on.\n  So this is a big day, and I think there are many of us in the Senate \nwho are willing to work on a bipartisan basis. We hope a lot of our \nRepublican friends will step forward and see that there is a space here \nto talk about climate, to try to work with each other.\n  I applaud the President for what he did today, how specific he was in \nterms of the EPA and greenhouse gases, how specific he was about \npolicies throughout the government.\n  I wanted to, in what is left of my 5 minutes, talk a little bit about \nthe Southwest. Sheldon Whitehouse and the others have talked about \ntheir regions of the country, but really what we are talking about in \nthe Southwest is that from the climate models--just business as usual \nthat we see--if the temperatures go up 1 degree in other places in the \nUnited States, it is double that in the Southwest.\n  So essentially what you have is, if--and imagine a mouse and you are \nclicking on something on a screen and dragging it--what we see \nhappening is New Mexico going 300 miles to the south, if you maintain \nbusiness as usual and you get down the road about 75 years, although it \nis hard to look down that far--if you put New Mexico 300 miles to the \nsouth, you are down in the middle of the Chihuahuan Desert. It \ncompletely changes the landscape of New Mexico. Your forests are not \ngoing to hold snowpack anymore. Your temperatures are going to be much \nhigher. Everything is going to change pretty dramatically.\n  Let me give an example. One of our communities in New Mexico has a \nwatershed where they get 40 percent of their drinking water drawn from \nthe snowpack and in two reservoirs. Many of our communities in New \nMexico are like that. With snowpack gone, they will have to then go to \nanother way of getting water. And making up 40 percent is very \ndifficult, especially if the other areas--for example, the aquifers \nthat are under that particular area or town--if those aquifers are also \nbeing drawn down because there is no snowpack. Then you just \ncontinually mine the waters. So that is the situation with the \nsnowpack.\n  The other thing that is happening in our forests is they are burning \nmuch hotter, and they are burning out of control. We are seeing bigger \nand bigger fires. Every couple of years, we break the record from a few \nyears back. With these fires burning so much hotter than they have ever \nburned before, the kinds of things you see is that the soil turns to \nalmost dust. It cannot absorb water. It is not a natural forest \nenvironment. So this has a devastating, devastating impact, and it is \noverlain by a drought, which also has been going on about 12 or 13 \nyears.\n  I want to point out and read from a recently issued report from one \nof our great national laboratories, Los Alamos National Laboratory, \nwhere they talked about the drought-stress for our forests. The \ndrought-stress of forests in the Southwest ``is more severe than any \nevent since the late 1500s megadrought''--the late 1500s megadrought--\nthat ``probably led to deaths of a large proportion of trees living at \nthe time.'' Climate projections predict that ``the mean forest drought-\nstress by the 2050s will exceed that of the most severe droughts in the \npast 1,000 years.''\n  So there is no doubt that climate change is real, that the costs are \nreal and the costs are not just monetary. This is a direct challenge to \nour way of life, and no one can really put a price on that.\n  America needs a ``do it all, do it right'' energy policy, taking on \nthe twin threats of climate change and dependence on foreign oil. With \npolicies that encourage innovation in energy technologies, we can \ncreate jobs in an advanced energy economy.\n  So I am pleased to hear the President commit to taking bold actions. \nIt would be even better if Congress moved forward with bipartisan \nactions. But we have seen that option hijacked time and time again.\n  It is time for us--as a nation--to move forward. The science and \nfacts are clear. It demands a response that matches the scale of the \nproblem.\n  In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Air Act requires EPA \nto set public health standards for climate change pollutants. The \nSenate has defeated several efforts to block EPA's efforts.\n  The President has committed to put limits on carbon pollution from \nexisting powerplants--powerplants that are the single greatest source \nof U.S. greenhouse gas pollution.\n  The President is instructing EPA to work with the States and \nindustry. I agree. The EPA recently reached a major agreement with New \nMexico and our State's largest utility, PNM. As a result, we are \ncleaning up the air in New Mexico, reducing carbon pollution, with more \nnatural gas and more renewable energy.\n  This type of collaboration should continue. But we need strong \nleadership at the EPA. On March 4, the President nominated Gina \nMcCarthy to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  And now, almost 4 months later, Ms. McCarthy is still awaiting \naction, delayed by a filibuster threat.\n  We need Ms. McCarthy at the helm of EPA, working with stakeholders to \nfind win-wins on the environment and our economy.\n\n[[Page S5140]]\n\n  The President has signaled that the problem of climate change cannot \nwait. The delays must end. We can reduce emissions in a smart way.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to help us confirm Gina McCarthy as \nthe Administrator of the EPA without further obstruction.\n  The President's action today is one of many crucial steps to address \nthe problem, and I applaud him. Government at all levels, business \nleaders, and people across the country--and around the world--need to \nwork together.\n  We need to develop adaptation strategies for those most affected by \nclimate change. We need to protect future generations, with \ntransitioning to an energy economy that produces cleaner energy.\n  My State is a very special place. Throughout my career, I have \ncommitted to protecting its pristine landscapes, its special \necosystems. This environmental stewardship runs deeply in my family.\n  Climate change threatens our economy in New Mexico and across the \ncountry. It affects our security, and our way of life.\n  The threat of global warming is real, and so must be our commitment \nto future generations.\n  So let me conclude and say that once again I thank Senator Cruz for \nhis courtesies.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \ntemporarily set aside all pending amendments so that I may offer my \namendment No. 1580.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, the amendment I would have called up had \nnot the majority party objected is an amendment that would have \ncorrected one of the most egregious aspects of the Gang of 8 bill; \nnamely, it is a penalty that is imposed on U.S. employers for hiring \nU.S. citizens and for hiring legal permanent residents. It is a \nstriking result of the Gang of 8 bill as it intersects with the \nObamaCare legislation.\n  Let me explain how it operates. Right now, for any company with 50 or \nmore employees, if that company does not provide a sufficiently high-\ndollar health insurance policy for low-income workers, that company \nfaces a fine of $3,000 per worker. Moreover, that fine is not \ndeductible in the company's taxes, which means that as an effective \nmatter to the company, the penalty is in the order of $5,000 per \nemployee when you factor in the tax consequences. That is the present \nstatus quo under ObamaCare. That is the penalty that is visited upon \nU.S. employers for hiring U.S. citizens and for hiring legal \nimmigrants.\n  What does the Gang of 8 bill do to change that? Well, the Gang of 8 \nbill takes some 11 million people who are here illegally and it grants \nthem what is called RPI status--registered provisional immigrant \nstatus. I have many concerns about legalization prior to securing the \nborder, but this concern is altogether separate from that, and it is \nthe simple reality that anyone granted RPI status--anyone granted \nlegalization under the Gang of 8 bill--is exempted from ObamaCare, \nwhich means that the employers who would be hiring them do not face the \nObamaCare tax of $5,000 per employee, whether U.S. citizen or legal \nimmigrant.\n  What does this mean in reality? Let's take an example, a simple \nhypothetical. Madam President, I would ask you to envision a small \nbusiness: Joe's Burger Shack. Joe's Burger Shack is owned by a small \nbusiness owner. It is a series of small fast food restaurants in any \ngiven State. It could be my home State of Texas or any State across the \nUnion.\n  Let's assume that Joe's Burger Shack has 100 employees and that at \nJoe's Burger Shack, with 100 employees, business is doing relatively \nwell, people are eating more hamburgers, and Joe decides he wants to \nhire 5 more people. If Joe and Joe's Burger Shack decide they want to \nhire five more people, if Joe chooses to hire five U.S. citizens or if \nhe chooses to hire five legal permanent residents--five legal \nimmigrants--Joe faces a penalty of $25,000 for doing so--$5,000 apiece \nright off his bottom line to the IRS. In contrast, if Joe decides \ninstead to hire five RPIs, who came here illegally among those 11 \nmillion who are here illegally but granted RPI legalization under the \nGang of 8 bill, Joe pays a penalty of zero dollars.\n  Let me ask a simple, commonsense question. In this instance, who is \nJoe, the small business owner, going to hire? This bill creates an \nenormous incentive to hire those here illegally, and at the same time \nit does it by creating a statutory penalty for hiring U.S. citizens and \nfor hiring legal immigrants. That makes no sense.\n  Let me give a second example. Suppose Joe is facing harder times. \nBecause of ObamaCare penalties, Joe makes the decision that a great \nmany fast food restaurants have made--to forcibly reduce workers' \nhours. ObamaCare kicks in when a worker works 30 hours a week, so a \ngreat many small businesses--and in particular fast food restaurants--\nhave been forced to forcibly reduce their employees' hours to 29 hours \na week or less.\n  Now, imagine that of Joe's 100 employees, 25 of them are RPIs--are \nformerly illegal immigrants who have received legalization under the \nGang of 8--and 75 are either U.S. citizens or legal permanent \nresidents.\n  Well, if Joe wants to reduce the hours of 25 of his employees both \nbelow the 30-hour threshold because times are hard and he cannot afford \nthe burden ObamaCare is putting on his business, if Joe forcibly \nreduces the hours of 25 U.S. citizen employees or 25 legal immigrant \nemployees to below 30 hours a week, Joe saves potentially $125,000 a \nyear in tax penalties, $5,000 apiece times 25 employees.\n  In contrast, if Joe says instead, I want to reduce the hours forcibly \nof those who are here illegally who have received legalization through \nthe Gang of 8, Joe saves zero dollars in tax penalties because he is \nnot paying a tax penalty regardless of whether those here illegally are \nworking 30 or 40 hours or more. The question I would pose to the \nPresiding Officer is, whose hours will Joe reduce?\n  This statute puts an enormous incentive, an incentive from Congress, \nfor Joe to forcibly reduce the hours of U.S. citizens and of legal \nimmigrants.\n  Let me give a third and even more stringent example. Imagine if Joe \nis facing great financial burden, as a lot of small businesses are, as \na lot of small businesses are struggling. Imagine if Joe instead made \nthe decision to fire all 100 workers, all 100 workers who happened to \nbe U.S citizens or permanent legal residents and instead hire only \nthose who are here illegally or have been legalized under the Gang of \n8. The consequences, simply doing the math at $5,000 an employee, mean \nJoe could save $500,000 a year in tax penalties. Actually the way \nObamaCare works, it is a complicated formula where there is an \nalternative avenue where Joe could well be paying $2,000 per employee \nminus 30, which would get down, when you factor in the tax savings, to \nabout $200,000. But any way you measure it under ObamaCare's \ncomplicated tax penalty formula, Joe could potentially save hundreds of \nthousands of dollars by firing his U.S. employees--U.S. citizen \nemployees or his legal resident employees and instead hiring those who \nare here illegally.\n  That does not make any sense. That is not an incentive anyone \nrationally would set up. That is what this Gang of 8 bill does. You \nknow, to share how real this incentive is, this penalty for hiring U.S. \ncitizens and legal permanent residents, I wish to read a letter from \none of my constituents, Mr. Allen Tharp, who is chairman and CEO of Old \nEngland, Lion and Rose Restaurant, Ltd. in San Antonio.\n  He wrote a letter that reads as follows:\n\n       My name is Allen Tharp. Since 1985, I have been the sole \n     owner and CEO of Allen Tharp LLC, as well as the Lion and \n     Rose restaurant chain, and a partner in the Golden Chick \n     restaurants. Our corporate restaurants provide well over \n     1,000 jobs to fellow Texans, and our franchise restaurants \n     provide many more.\n       I've been following the current debate over immigration \n     reform very closely and want you to be aware that this bill, \n     coupled with the new ObamaCare legislation, makes it much \n     more affordable for a business like mine to employ Registered \n     Provisional Immigrants than American workers. I do not \n     believe that was the intention of either legislation, but it \n     is the irrefutable effect of both.\n\n[[Page S5141]]\n\n       ObamaCare, as documented in numerous news stories, already \n     creates an incentive for businesses to cut hours in order to \n     avoid triggering the 50 full-time employee threshold that \n     requires businesses to pay a fine if they do not provide \n     government-approved health insurance. Because of this law, I \n     have been forced to cut back every single hourly employee in \n     each of my companies to no more than 28 hours per week. \n     Cutting schedules from 40 to 28 hours per week has caused \n     some hardship on many employees. However, our choice is to \n     either provide part-time work or no work at all because our \n     business cannot afford to comply with the severe consequences \n     that would be imposed on us under this law if we continue to \n     provide full-time employment to all these employees.\n       If the current immigration bill before the Senate, however, \n     is made law, a business could hire Registered Provisional \n     Immigrants instead of U.S. citizens and avoid triggering \n     ObamaCare regulations and fines.\n       Hiring RPIs over American workers, from a purely economic \n     point of view, would be the best thing for my business. I \n     personally do not believe this is the right thing to do. But \n     surely some of my competitors would. ObamaCare and the \n     immigration bill is forcing employers to make extremely \n     difficult choices. I do not want to be in the position of \n     choosing to grow my business or choosing to pay my fellow \n     Americans. I want to do both. ObamaCare and the immigration \n     bill will prevent me from doing so.\n\n  This is a real CEO, facing the real incentives of running a business \nunder ObamaCare and looking at what would happen if this Gang of 8 bill \npassed into law.\n  What are the potential counterarguments to this concern? Well, in the \nway of Washington, we do not actually have to predict, because the \nproponents of this bill have followed a long tried and true path in \nWashington; namely, they have gone to an ostensibly neutral reporter at \na mainstream publication and urged them to ``fact check'' the claim the \nGang of 8 bill with ObamaCare would put a penalty on hiring U.S. \ncitizens and legal immigrants. And to fact check, the reporter \ncompliantly gave the answers to the responses that are given by the \nGang of 8. But I would suggest that those responses are, on their face, \nsingularly unpersuasive. The first response the Washington Post Fact \nChecker put up was a claim that Cruz is creating a mountain out of a \nmole hill because ``the impact on employers is almost too miniscule to \nbe noticed.'' That is a quote from our friends at the Washington Post \nin their so-called ``fact check.'' The basis of this is they said, \nwell, gosh, there are a lot of companies that do not have 50 employees. \nThe number of companies with more than 50 employees is really small or, \nas they put it, ``almost too miniscule to be noticed.''\n  I am going to suggest the claim that companies with more than 50 \nemployees comprise a share of the economy that is ``miniscule'' is \nfacially absurd.\n  Indeed, if you look at the data, 71 percent of all U.S. employees \nwork in a business with more than 50 employees. So, according to the \nWashington Post, it is an objective fact that the employers for 71 \npercent of U.S. employees are ``almost too miniscule to be noticed.'' \nTo put that in raw numbers, that is 80 million employees. I would \nsuggest 80 million employees is, on any measure, not miniscule.\n  The second basis of the so-called fact check, the second response \nfrom the bill's proponents was that, well, under current law it is \nillegal for a potential employer to ask about a person's immigration \nstatus. I would note this is a particularly facile response that almost \nsurely came from a lawyer. As a lawyer myself, I will say it \nis precisely the sort of response that causes people to love lawyers as \nthey do, oh, so much in today's society. Because, yes, it is true there \nis a provision in statute that says: You cannot ask about a person's \nimmigration status and base employment decisions on that. But the \nstatute also requires you to check their immigration status before you \nhire them. Moreover, there is no provision for employees volunteering \nthis information. If this bill passes, if there is a massive incentive \nto hire RPIs over U.S. citizens, the simple reality is there will be \nmassive economic incentives for employers to do so.\n\n  Let me note this point is utterly irrelevant when it comes to \nreducing employee hours. Because even if you engage in the ``Alice in \nWonderland'' world where employers do not know if an individual is an \nRPI or a U.S. citizen, once they are hired, as a matter of legal \nrequirement, they do know that. If they are then subsequently making a \ndecision on whose hours to reduce, the overwhelming economic incentive \nwould be to reduce the hours of the U.S. citizen or the legal immigrant \nrather than those who are currently here illegally.\n  I want to ask the Presiding Officer, this penalty on hiring U.S. \ncitizens and on legal immigrants, who is this going to hurt the most? \nWell, it is not going to hurt companies that are doing nuclear science \nresearch. It is not going to hurt companies that are designing \nsatellites. It is going to hurt the workers who are working in the \nsorts of jobs where they face competition from those who are here \nillegally. It is going to hurt workers, for example, in the fast-food \nindustry. It is going to hurt workers who are working in landscaping, \nin construction.\n  Who is it going to hurt the most? If you look right now, today, under \nthe Obama economy, who is being hurt the most by the Obama economy? \nThose who are the most vulnerable among us. Hispanics today have a 9.1-\npercent unemployment rate. Hispanic U.S. citizens, Hispanic legal \nimmigrants will be directly harmed by this outcome. African Americans \nhave a 13.5-percent unemployment rate right now under the Obama \neconomy. It has gone up under President Obama. African-American workers \nwill be hurt by this statutory penalty on hiring U.S. citizens and \nlegal immigrants.\n  Teenagers face an unemployment rate of 24.5 percent. Teenagers, in \nparticular, if you look at jobs, for example, in the fast-food \nindustry, are so often the first or second job a young teenager gets as \nhe or she begins to climb the economic ladder. If Congress passes a \nbill that puts a major economic penalty on hiring a U.S. citizen or \nlegal permanent resident, he or she may never get that job.\n  I wish to read a letter from another constituent who is president of \nPainless Performance, a high-end car parts manufacturer in Fort Worth, \nTX. The letter reads as follows:\n\n       My name is Adrian Murray. I am an immigrant. My parents \n     moved to America from Ireland 55 years ago to seek \n     opportunity and a better life. At the time, new immigrants \n     had to have a sponsor and proof of future employment. I still \n     have the letters written to the INS on their behalf. My \n     parents later became naturalized citizens and raised me to \n     respect America, her customs and her laws.\n       That was back in the day when being an American citizen was \n     prized. To stand before a judge with hand raised, pledging \n     allegiance and fidelity to America was the dream of millions \n     around the world. We devalue American citizenship by making \n     it a cheap tool for political gain.\n       My parents taught me to respect America's exceptionalism \n     and therefore honor the institutions of this nation. Because \n     of their example, I have built a successful business with 52 \n     employees. Many of those in my plant are legal immigrants \n     from Vietnam. They, too, came here the right way and endured \n     much hardship to earn their citizen status. What am I to tell \n     them, that their sacrifice was meaningless, that they should \n     have just snuck in, that their citizenship has no value, that \n     the joke is on them?\n       Well, I would never exercise the option of replacing them \n     with cheaper ObamaCare-exempted workers. Would they not be \n     justified in questioning the motives and validity of a \n     government which would even consider giving an employer that \n     option? What has this nation come to?\n       It is getting harder and harder to recognize America. A \n     nation which once proudly held fast to the virtues of liberty \n     and freedom is now seriously contemplating a law which \n     amounts to nothing more than thinly disguised human \n     trafficking. Once the world's greatest deliberative body, the \n     Senate is set to vote this bill into law without bothering \n     even to read it. This cannot be. This must not stand.\n\n  It is not too late. At the outset of my remarks, I asked unanimous \nconsent to call up my amendment to fix this problem, and the Democrats \nin this body objected. My amendment would address this problem by \nproviding that ObamaCare shall be defunded until there are no longer \nany registered provisional immigrants in line. This is the one way to \ncorrect this problem, to correct the statutory penalty on U.S. citizens \nand legal immigrants, if this bill were to pass.\n  As we have just seen, the majority party has chosen to object to \nbringing up that amendment. Indeed, so far, we have not had an open \ndebate on amendments on this bill. I would note that a number of \nproponents of this bill claimed they were going to fix this. Here are a \nfew of the comments sponsors of this bill have made concerning the \namnesty tax loophole.\n  From my friend, the senior Senator of Arizona, Mr. John McCain:\n\n\n[[Page S5142]]\n\n\n       I think that is an issue, and I think that it needs to be \n     addressed.\n\n  Also from Senator McCain:\n\n       We cannot give people who are not citizens the same \n     benefits; that is the fundamental principle . . . we are \n     trying to work around it so that an American citizen is \n     competitive for a job.\n\n  A quote from a senior Democratic aide:\n\n       We are willing to work through these issues as the bill \n     works its way through the Senate.\n\n  I am sorry to tell you, those promises have not materialized. We \nhaven't worked through these issues. I cannot help but think, with an \nissue such as this, of the very real impacts it has on so many \nfamilies. At least in my family that impact would not have been \nhypothetical.\n  Fifty-five years ago my father came from Cuba as a legal immigrant. \nHe was 18, and he couldn't speak English. When he arrived in Austin, \nTX, penniless, he took a job similar to so many other immigrants before \nhim, washing dishes, making 50 cents an hour. I will say the food \nservice industry has provided such an opening portal for millions of \nAmericans and for millions of immigrants from throughout the world.\n  Yet if the Gang of 8 bill had been law in 1957, along with \nObamaCare--my father who couldn't speak English, who was very glad to \nmake 50 cents an hour so he could take that money and pay his way \nthrough the University of Texas, go on, get a higher paying job, start \na business, and work toward the American dream--my father very well \nmight have been fired because of the Gang of 8 bill, because the impact \nof this legislation would have been to cost his employer $5,000 for \nhiring him, a legal immigrant.\n  I have to tell you, my father's skills at age 18, I wouldn't \ncharacterize him as a high-skilled dishwasher. He told me he got that \njob because he couldn't speak English, and one didn't have to speak \nEnglish to wash dishes. You had to be able to take a dish and stick it \nunder the hot water.\n  This incentive would have been a massive incentive on his employer to \nsay: Raphael, I am sorry, you are out of a job because we are going to \nhire someone who didn't follow the rules, didn't come here legally, \ncame here illegally, because Congress penalizes us $5,000 for you, but \nit puts zero penalty on that individual who is here illegally. I cannot \nthink of a more irrational, a more indefensible system than a statutory \nauthority for hiring U.S. citizens or legal immigrants.\n  If this bill passes, a number of things will happen. If this bill \npasses, African-American unemployment, Hispanic unemployment will \nalmost surely go up. It will be the Senate's fault because this bill \nwill penalize hiring African Americans, U.S. citizens or legal \nimmigrants and, instead, will incentivize hiring those who are here \nillegally.\n  If this bill passes, Hispanic unemployment will almost surely go up \nbecause this bill penalizes hiring Hispanics who are U.S. citizens or \nHispanics who are legal immigrants who followed the rules.\n  If this bill passes, youth unemployment will almost certainly go up \nbecause it is young people in particular who are just beginning the \njourney up the economic ladder who will be most impacted by Congress \ndeciding to put a $5,000 penalty on hiring that U.S. citizen, hiring \nthat legal immigrant and, instead, give a preference for hiring those \nhere illegally.\n  If this bill passes, union households' unemployment will very likely \ngo up because it is working-class households that are facing the most \ndirect competition. If that happens, it will be the fault of the \nSenate.\n  If this bill passes, unemployment among legal immigrants will almost \ncertainly go up. What this bill says, if you hire an illegal immigrant, \nthe IRS is going to impose a $5,000 penalty on you, the employer. If \nyou don't hire that legal immigrant, if you reduce that legal \nimmigrant's hours, if you hire instead someone who is here illegally, \nthat penalty will go away.\n  I would suggest that is utterly and completely indefensible. Nobody \nin this body wants to see African-American unemployment go up. Nobody \nwants to see Hispanic unemployment go up, youth unemployment go up, \nunion household unemployment go up, legal immigrant unemployment go up. \nYet every one of those will happen if this Gang of 8 bill passes \nwithout fixing this problem. If that happens, all 100 Members of the \nSenate will be accountable to our constituents for explaining why we \nvoted to put a Federal penalty on hiring U.S. citizens and hiring legal \nimmigrants. In my view, it makes no sense, and it is indefensible. I \nvery much hope this body will choose to pass my amendment and fix this \ngray defect in the Gang of 8 legislation.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                    Remembering William D. Hathaway\n\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise in sadness because America and the \nState of Maine lost a friend yesterday, one of my predecessors in this \noffice, Senator Bill Hathaway, who served 14 years in the Congress, 8 \nin the House and 6 in the Senate, from 1973 to 1978.\n  I knew him well because I worked for him as a staff member in the \nSenate. In fact, I was sworn in as a Senator 40 years to the day from \nthe day I entered Senate service on behalf of Bill Hathaway in January \nof 1973.\n  I had a chance, as all staff members do, to see him up close, to see \nhim operate as a Senator and as a person. I was asked today several \nquestions about him and what characterized Bill Hathaway. The first \nthing I said was he always put people first. He really and truly didn't \npay much attention to politics. He always wanted to do what was right. \nI remember being in his office in the Russell Senate Office Building \nand talking about the political ramifications of some bill or some \nvote.\n  He sat back in his chair and said: You know, it is hard enough around \nhere to figure out what the right thing to do is. When you add the \npolitics on top of it, it becomes practically impossible.\n  That was the way he thought and that was the way he acted. In fact, I \nonce sent him a memo as a young staff member that had some political \nramifications of a particular vote. I wish I had saved the memo because \nin his inimitable scrawl at the top of the page when it came back to me \nit said: I pay you for policy, not political advice.\n  That was the kind of guy he was. One of the things which I noticed \nabout him, which was a tremendous influence on my life, was he was \nexactly the same person in private as he was in public. There wasn't a \ndifferent Bill Hathaway on the stump, in Maine, making speeches or on \ntelevision than the one I saw behind closed doors driving around \nWashington or around Maine, through the small towns, getting a haircut \nor spending time together. He was always the same person with the same \nvalues and the same concern for the people of Maine.\n  If you haven't gathered it already, Bill Hathaway taught me a lot \nabout how to do this job.\n  Next to my dad, he was probably the most influential adult in my life \nwhen I was a young person. He was honest, he was smart, he was \nanalytical, and he was motivated to do the right thing for the people \nof this country and the people of the State of Maine.\n  I have one personal story as well because I think it speaks to the \nkind of person he was.\n  Unfortunately, when I was working here in 1974, I was stricken with a \ndangerous and unusual form of cancer. I ended up having to have \nsignificant surgery. I, again, was one of many staff members who worked \nfor Bill Hathaway, but one of the most vivid memories of my life was \nwaking in the hospital after the surgery in the recovery room. Looking \nup, I saw my wife on one side of the bed and standing at the end of the \nbed in hospital green scrubs was Senator Bill Hathaway.\n  That was the kind of man he was. He was a politician but in a good \nsense of the word. He was a man who thought about the people who took \nso seriously the responsibilities of this office. We lost him \nyesterday. I think he was about 90 years old. He never lost his \ninterest in Maine, in people or in the issues of the country.\n  I was fortunate to spend some time with him recently, and he hadn't \nlost a step when it came to thinking about these kinds of questions. He \nwas good-natured, funny, and he was genuine.\n  As I said at the beginning, Maine and the United States of America \nlost a friend yesterday, and he is one whom I will miss terribly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n[[Page S5143]]\n\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, fixing our broken immigration system is \nan urgent priority. As the son of an immigrant myself, I understand how \nimportant this is for families across the country and in my home State \nof New Mexico. I know how hard immigrants work in this country, how \nmuch they believe in America, and how much they are willing to give \nback to this Nation.\n  New Mexico's remarkable spirit is rooted in our diversity, our \nhistory, and our culture, which has always been enriched by our \nimmigrant communities and family members. At the same time, the laws \nthat govern our country's immigration system are antiquated and \nineffective. I am encouraged that we are finally making progress toward \na solution and finding some common ground on this critical issue.\n  We need a solution that includes a visa system that meets the needs \nof our economy, a tough but fair path to earned citizenship for the \nestimated 11 million people in our country who are undocumented and a \nplan that ensures the security of our borders.\n  Our broken immigration system does not match the realities of our \nNation's economy. The H-2A program makes it difficult for farmers to \nhire the workers they need.\n  The H-1B program sends some of our most talented students back to \ntheir countries of origin, where they find themselves competing against \nAmerican jobs rather than helping to create American jobs.\n  The labor pool, comprised of millions of undocumented workers, allows \nfor worker exploitation and low wages. We must ensure that our laws \nenable our companies to retain the highly skilled foreign graduates of \nour universities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, \nthe STEM field, in order to harness their skills, their creative \nactivity, and their entrepreneurial spirit to create jobs in America.\n  A commitment to reform our country's immigration system also requires \na commitment to our students. As a strong supporter of the DREAM Act, I \nam glad this legislation acknowledges that students should be treated \ndifferently. I wish to especially thank Senator Durbin for his work \nseeing this through to the end.\n  Thousands of students across the country will gain more education and \ntraining, which translates into better and higher paying jobs. All \nthese extra wages will circulate through the economy, spurring economic \ngrowth and new job creation.\n  I have met many DREAMers in New Mexico, and they are incredibly \nbright, hardworking, and, frankly, most of them don't know how to be \nanything but an American. DREAMers represent much of what is best about \nour Nation--hard work, motivation, and a willingness to serve this \ncountry in uniform. I believe it is time to make the DREAM Act a \nreality.\n\n  Finally, those of us who represent border communities understand \nthere are a number of challenges they face that are unique. We have \nmade great advances in border security in recent years. Illegal border \ncrossing apprehensions are at historically low levels and have fallen \nin New Mexico by more than 90 percent since their peak back in 2005. We \nhave more agents, more technology and infrastructure devoted to our \nborder than ever before. Our challenge moving forward is to continue to \nensure our Nation's safety while balancing the need of our border \ncommunities to thrive and benefit from their unique binational culture \nand economy.\n  The mission of Customs and Border Protection is to both safeguard our \nNation's borders and facilitate lawful international trade and \ncommerce. However, in the Paso del Norte region, which includes both \nwest Texas and southern New Mexico, not all of our ports of entry are \noperating at full capacity. The high volume of commercial vehicles \nattempting to cross at the El Paso port makes it extremely difficult \nfor CBP to efficiently service all the would-be crossers while also \nmaintaining security.\n  My amendment to extend the hours of operation at the nearby Santa \nTeresa Port of Entry will lead to more efficient trade between the \nUnited States and Mexico, will help to grow our economy, create new \njobs, and invest in border security efforts at our Nation's ports.\n  On the subject of increased commerce and the Paso del Norte region, I \nwant to thank Secretary Napolitano for doing her part. Earlier this \nmonth she announced a plan to extend the border commercial zone in \nsouthern New Mexico. This initiative was spearheaded by former Senator \nJeff Bingaman at the Federal level, and it received bipartisan \nunanimous support back at home in the New Mexico State Legislature. \nIncreasing the number of visitors traveling to the region will help \nU.S. businesses, local economies, and bring in more tax revenue.\n  New Mexicans are eager for a solution. DREAM Act students deserve a \nsolution, and, frankly, our economy requires a solution. With this in \nmind, I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure we achieve \naccountable immigration reform that works for New Mexico and for our \nNation.\n  Este es el ano.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor tonight to \ntalk briefly about where we are in immigration reform. We are moving \nalong this week. We have come out of several weeks of committee work, \nwhere there were a number of Republican amendments that were adopted as \npart of the process and a number of Democratic amendments adopted as \npart of the process.\n  As somebody who was involved in the negotiating group that led to the \nbill reaching the Judiciary Committee, I actually think it was improved \nby both Republicans and Democrats. It has been an unusual bipartisan \neffort, and it is the kind of effort the American people, certainly the \npeople of Colorado, think is long overdue. They do not understand why \nwe seem to be engaged in these fights that don't have anything to do \nwith them instead of working to get together constructively to meet the \nchallenges this country faces.\n  I think when it comes to this very difficult issue of immigration--\nand it is difficult, and there are strong feelings about it--it has \nbeen remarkable for that reason; that we have been able to see what I \nwould describe not even as a bipartisan process but a nonpartisan \nprocess, with people actually coming together to resolve this issue. As \na result, the objections to it, the substantive objections to it are \nfalling away.\n  There was an objection that somehow the bill was being rushed \nthrough. Well, no, it went through the regular order, which is very \nrare for this place. It shouldn't be rare, but it is rare. It got a \nfull hearing in the Judiciary Committee, and there has been a full \nhearing on the Senate floor.\n  There was an argument somehow it was going to create horrible \ndeficits, and it turns out the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nsaid, actually, in the first 10 years it is going to improve our \ndeficit situation by $190 billion and over the next 10 years by another \n$700 billion--almost $1 trillion over the course of the next 20 years.\n  So, then, there was another argument, which was there is no border \nsecurity as part of this legislation. In the Group of 8 we listened \nhard to what the border Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake, two \nRepublicans from Arizona, had to say about what they believed they \nneeded at the border. We went and visited the border with John McCain \nand Jeff Flake to see what they believed they needed on the Arizona \nborder. But there were other Senators who weren't satisfied by what we \nput in that bill, and so there was an effort that was then led by \nSenator Corker from Tennessee and Senator Hoeven to amend the bill, and \nwe supported it. I supported that amendment.\n  In fact, that amendment got 68 votes the other night--or something \nlike that. We were missing a couple of Senators. We would have had 68 \nor 69 if everybody had been here.\n  That is progress because that has built support for the bill--\nRepublicans and Democrats coming together around the border security \nissue. I think it is very hard for anybody to make a real\n\n[[Page S5144]]\n\nargument this is not a significant attempt to strengthen the border in \nthis country.\n  We were already spending more money on border enforcement than we do \non any other Federal law enforcement combined as it was. We had gone to \nabout 22,000 Border Patrol agents already as it was. Now we are \ndoubling that number--doubling--as an attempt to respond to a very \nreasonable concern the American people have that the border should be \nas secure as possible. So that is now part of this legislation.\n  So those are three things people have argued: The process was too \nfast, the bill was going to negatively affect the deficit, and our \nborder is still insecure. Those were the arguments that were made.\n  Now we don't hear those arguments so much anymore. Now we hear scare \nstories about health care. We are hearing scare stories about how this \nwill affect our economy even though the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office has said we are going to see five additional points of \ngross domestic product growth--GDP growth--in the second 10 years of \nthis bill passing, as a result of bringing people out of the shadows.\n  It is not as if the 11 million people who are here and who are \nundocumented are not working. They are working. Many of them are \nworking in this country. Many of them are working in the agriculture \nsector in my State and in this country. Many are working in other \nindustries as well all across the United States. But they are working \nin an unlawful way. They are working in a cash economy. They are \nworking in a situation where they are easily exploited. Because of \nthat, they drag down the wages of everybody in America.\n  Workers in my State who are here and who are legal--l-e-g-a-l--are \nhaving to compete in a marketplace where there are people who can pay \nless because they know there are people who have to take less because \nthey do not have lawful recourse.\n  All the protections we put in this bill, all the protections to make \nsure, and rightfully so, an American is offered a job first; to ensure, \nand rightfully so, we are not bringing in a whole bunch of new people \nwhen there are Americans looking for work--all of those protections \npale in comparison to the protection of bringing 11 million people out \nof the shadows and out of a cash economy and into a place where they \nare paid a lawful wage and they are paying their taxes to the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  If all someone cared about, if the only thing someone cared about \nwhen they got up in the morning and went to bed at night was rising \nwages for Americans, solving this issue finally for the 11 million \nwould be the most important thing you could do. And we do that in this \nbill.\n  The opponents of this bill are not seriously suggesting they are \ngoing to go to the expense of sending 11 million people back to where \nthey came from. They are not seriously suggesting, in answer to this \nissue, that nothing in the CBO report is true, that none of it makes \nsense, that this is about ObamaCare when what we are really trying to \ndo for once in this place is solve a set of challenging issues in a \nbipartisan way.\n  Mr. President, even more than that, for a decade or more, because of \nour broken immigration system, the policy of this country has been to \nturn back talented people--even people educated at our universities, \neven people educated to be engineers and mathematicians. When they have \ngraduated from college here, at our expense, in many cases, we have not \nsaid to them: Stay here and build your business. Compete here and help \nus grow this economy. Start a business--as half of the Fortune 100 or \n500 companies have been started by immigrants. No. We have said: Go \nhome. Go home to India and compete with us from there. Go home to China \nand hire other people over there.\n  If we pass this bill, we will say once again that this nation of \nimmigrants is open for business, that we are open to the most creative \nand talented people in the world, that we want them to drive our \neconomy in the United States just as they have generation after \ngeneration going back to our Founders.\n  It is a great testament to who we are and to the nature of our \ncountry that people want to come here, and under the right \ncircumstances we should have them here. The CBO report--and I don't \neven care about the CBO report--makes it very clear--makes it very \nclear--what businesspeople in my State already know: It makes it clear \nto the agricultural industry in my State, the high-tech industry in my \nState, the ski resorts in my State that the objections of people of \ngoodwill on this bill have been met through compromise and through \nprincipled agreement.\n  This is a good piece of legislation. We shouldn't, in this ninth or \neleventh hour or whatever it is--the ninth inning--allow ourselves to \nget distracted by the politics seeking to divide us in this Chamber or \nin this country. And I don't believe we will. So I urge my colleagues \nto support the passage of this bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope the Senator wasn't rushed completing \nhis statement, because I was listening intently and appreciating all he \nsaid today.\n  I haven't had the opportunity to express through the instruments of \nthis floor how much I appreciate the Senator from Colorado. He has done \nsuch a terrific job. He has been one of the four Democrats. He hasn't \nsought a lot of press on this, but he has been a stalwart in getting \nthis done for a couple reasons.\n  One, his State of Colorado is a perfect example as to why we need \nthis bill. The demographics have changed in that State remarkably, as \nthey have in my State of Nevada. His quiet concern for what we need to \ndo and then his quiet movement to make sure we get the things done we \nneed to is evident in this immigration bill.\n  Frankly, we had a discussion today in our caucus, as we have had on \nseveral occasions, about student loans. No one is better prepared to \ntalk about that issue than the Senator from Colorado. He is not only \nconcerned about what happens to students who are in college, but also \nhe was a school superintendent, understanding what people who want to \ngo to college have to deal with. So I appreciate very much the \nstatements of the Senator from Colorado. He has done a remarkably good \njob, and the people of Colorado are so fortunate to have this good man \nin the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/25/senate-section/article/S5144-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I agree with the President that climate \nchange represents one of the greatest challenges of our time, but it is \nalso a challenge uniquely suited to our strengths as a country. Our \nscientists, researchers, universities and entrepreneurs stand ready to \ndesign and build new, less polluting energy sources. Vermont's and our \ncountry's farmers and forestland owners stand ready to grow renewable \nfuels. American businesses will innovate and develop new energy \ntechnologies that will reduce pollution and grow our economy with jobs \nthat cannot be shipped overseas. Our workforce stands ready to \nmodernize our power plants and retrofit our buildings to meet 21st \ncentury efficiency standards.\n  I stand ready to support the President, and Vermonters want to do our \npart. The important goals the President has laid out today will create \njobs, save lives and protect and preserve our treasured natural \nresources for future generations.\n  No single step can accomplish the goals that President Obama has \npresented today, but we must begin now, and take these critical first \nsteps together. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to address \nthese threats and be responsible stewards of the earth. Just as any \nVermonter who has hiked the 200 miles of Vermont's beautiful Long Trail \ncan tell you, the journey begins with a commitment to reach a goal, and \na first step in that direction.\n  Climate change is not a far-off or remote challenge. The impacts are \novertaking us today around the globe and\n\n[[Page S5145]]\n\nin Vermont. In the past 2 years, hurricanes Irene and Sandy devastated \nthe Northeast, while huge swaths from Texas to the Midwest have been \ngripped in a historic drought, and tornadoes have raked the heartland.\n  We can no longer willfully ignore these impacts or continue to deny \nthe facts: The science is clear and definitive that human-induced \nclimate change is happening and it is happening rapidly. We are \nobligated to reduce carbon emissions, and efforts to do so have the \nsupport of the American people.\n  Not only is the science clear, but the human and economic costs of \nclimate change are hitting home. The severe weather events of just the \npast 2 years have caused damages in the United States in excess of $188 \nbillion and left more than 1100 people dead. If we do not act now then \nthe toll is sure to mount, with ever more destructive and deadly \nweather pounding our coasts, parching our Nation's agricultural center, \nand rising sea levels threatening our coastal communities. If we do not \nact now, the devastating impacts of climate change will only get worse.\n  But climate change is not just about weather disasters. For instance, \nwe also have seen asthma rates double in the past 30 years, and our \nchildren and grandchildren will only suffer more asthma attacks as air \npollution worsens. We already reduced smog and acid rain and have set \nlimits for mercury, lead, and arsenic. It is time to set a limit on \ncarbon pollution that causes climate change and assaults the public \nhealth.\n  The President's proposal will allow the United States to take further \nimportant steps toward the environmental quality and good jobs that \nwill come with a cleaner and safer energy future. We can act now so \nthat future generations--our children and grandchildren--will know that \nwe took the steps that helped make their world safer and cleaner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/25/senate-section/article/S5145-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VOTE EXPLANATIONS\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

As we bid farewell this \nweek to one of Iowa's most successful entrepreneurs and cofounders of \none of Iowa's most iconic businesses, Bill Krause's can-do spirit will \ninspire generations of Iowans. That is because the footprint this \ngentle giant leaves behind is one of a man who pioneered a wildly \nsuccessful chain of convenience stores. Kum & Go is one of the Nation's \nlargest family-owned chains in America with more than 420 stores doing \nbusiness in 11 States.\n  A self-starter from an early age, Bill's tireless work ethic and \nvisionary leadership skills reflect the very best of America's \nentrepreneurial spirit. Throughout his career, Bill was rewarded with \nthe prizes and pitfalls of risk taking at its very best and at its very \nworst. Named Iowa Entrepreneur of the Year in 1992, Bill's varied \nbusiness pursuits stretched beyond his signature success and prosperity \nin the convenience store industry, including fashion retailing, \ntrucking, gaming, farming, banking, as well as interests in Iowa-based \nsoccer and baseball teams. An honest-to-goodness rags to riches story, \nBill always kept his eyes focused on the opportunity that lie ahead at \nthe next bend, without losing sight of what mattered most in life: his \nfamily, faith, and friendships, including those of thousands of \nemployees and the countless customers he loved to meet and greet in his \nstores.\n  After graduating from Eldora High School, Bill worked his way through \ncollege and graduated from his beloved alma mater, The University of \nIowa, in 1957 with a degree in journalism. A lifelong Iowa Hawkeye fan, \nBill is one of those uncommonly humble men of considerable means who \nnever forgot from where he came.\n  That sense of loyalty later translated into valuable financial \ncontributions, including a signature gift that launched a historic \nrenovation to Kinnick Stadium. He earned a number of distinguished \nawards and accolades from The University of Iowa and for more than five \ndecades supported the Hawkeye's celebrated athletics programs as a \ntireless fan and patron. He also served as adviser to deans of the \nTippie College of Business, sharing his Main Street expertise with \nthose tasked with teaching the next generation of business leaders. \nPutting his money where his mouth is, Bill founded a fund to jump-start \nthe next generation of business leaders. Since 1998, the Krause Fund \nhas provided more than 1,200 Iowa undergraduate students with the \nopportunity to learn about managing an endowed equity portfolio.\n  Bill Krause knew how to run a business, how to create jobs and how to \nkeep customers satisfied. The narrative of his success was shaped by \nhis humble beginnings, earning $10 a day at age 15. Years later with \nhis father-in-law, Tony Gentle, he pioneered the convenience store \nconcept of buying milk, bread and eggs at the local gas station when \ncustomers pulled up to fill their tanks. By all accounts, Bill's \nAmerican success story bloomed as a result of his integrity, decency, \npassion and generosity.\n  His homegrown roots stretched deep, defining his contributions of \ntime, talent and treasure to his church and community. He was awarded \nthe St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Award by the National Catholic Education \nAssociation in 2007 and the Civitas Award from Dowling Catholic Schools \nin 2012. Through scholarship, service and sacrifice, Bill and Nancy \nKrause taught their 3 children and 12 grandchildren the real measure of \nsuccess.\n  In fact, a few years ago a room at the Kum & Go headquarters in West \nDes Moines was known as the ``one-liner'' room because of the messages \nlining the walls. When asked, Bill said the legacy he hoped to leave \nbehind mirrors one of the lines on the wall: ``It's nice to be \nimportant, but it's more important to be nice.'' Perhaps that is one of \nthe reasons why he gave blazers to high school kids for their first job \ninterviews. Or why he was a leading fund-raiser for minority and low-\nincome students at Holy Family School in Des Moines.\n  Mr. President, may I suggest to the U.S. Senate that Bill Krause has \nmore than secured this legacy throughout his professional and personal \nlife. Barbara and I share our deepest condolences to Bill's family, \nespecially to his wife Nancy, and to all those who are mourning the \nloss of this larger-than-life Iowan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/25/senate-section/article/S5145-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5145-S5146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING PHILLIPE RIBIERO\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to congratulate \nPontiac High School chemistry and biology teacher Phillipe Ribiero for \nwinning the qualifying round and advancing to the final round of the \nMake My Lab WoRx contest. This is a wonderful achievement that reflects \nhis talent as an educator and the fine work that is happening across \nMichigan to ensure that the best and brightest are teaching our young \npeople.\n  The 2013 Make My LabWoRx contest is part of a program developed by \nAstellas Pharma. It seeks to increase the understanding of the role \nscience plays in human health and medicine. The contest is comprised of \nseven qualifying rounds that take place across the country, including \nMichigan. To participate in the contest, science teachers must submit a \nlesson plan or experiment, along with a video demonstration. \nInvolvement in this program allows teachers to showcase their passion \nfor teaching science in a\n\n[[Page S5146]]\n\ncreative and exciting way. Mr. Ribiero's winning video and lesson plan \ninstructed students on how to make an acid/base indicator using common \nhousehold items. Mr. Ribiero's win in the 2013 Make My LabWoRx contest \nhas provided Pontiac High School with a new microscope and funding \nnecessary to purchase additional lab equipment.\n  A quality education is fundamental to the future success of our young \npeople, and to the health and prosperity of our country. This award is \nindicative of Mr. Ribiero's creativity, dedication and hard work as a \nscience teacher, and his ability to challenge Pontiac High School \nstudents academically and to nurture their growth as individuals. I am \nproud of the example he has set, which represents the best of our \nState's educational system.\n  I know that Mr. Ribiero's family, friends and the Pontiac High School \ncommunity are all truly proud of his accomplishment. I also know my \nSenate colleagues join me in congratulating Phillipe Ribiero on this \nachievement. His work has brought pride to both Pontiac High School and \nthe community at large. I wish Mr. Ribiero the best of luck as he \ncontinues to educate and inspire young minds for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/25/senate-section/article/S5146-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING ELIOT AND MURIEL BATTLE\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I wish to offer tribute to a \ntruly passionate team from Columbia, MO--Eliot and Muriel Battle--who \ntogether became key to forever changing race relations throughout \nColumbia.\n  One local newspaper recently wrote: ``You could not have Eliot \nwithout Muriel. What they accomplished, they accomplished together.'' \nAnd what they accomplished was astounding--a testament to the power of \nleadership by example.\n  Over the last decade, the city of Columbia and the University of \nMissouri have lauded this couple with various citywide recognitions \nand, for Eliot, an honorary degree, in honor of their lifelong efforts. \nYet the most poignant recognition of all was the decision to name \nColumbia's newest high school ``Muriel Williams Battle High School.'' \nEducation served as the backbone of the couple's series of first-ever \naccomplishments as they became pioneers in the desegregation of the \ncity's public schools.\n  Seeing the new high school open became one of Eliot's last goals. And \nhe met it with pride. Despite his declining health, he walked to the \npodium on June 2 to a standing ovation, spoke loud and clear, and \nreceived a second standing ovation at the end of his speech honoring \nhis wife, who had passed 10 years earlier, in 2003. Nine days after the \nceremony, he passed on too.\n  It is amazing how life works sometimes. Their story is one for all to \nknow and understand. I would like to share a few highlights.\n  They moved to Columbia in 1956 in the heart of the civil rights \nmovement, just a year after Rosa Parks would not give up her seat on \nthe bus. In this era, many civil rights leaders had more radical \napproaches to change, but the Battles did not fit into these molds. \nEven though they also wanted quick change, they were a couple who lived \n``quietly yet determined and unwavering,'' as one newspaper columnist \nnoted, working behind the scenes of social justice and modeling the \nracial acceptance they wanted their community to adopt.\n  Both of the couple's first education jobs in Columbia were at \nDouglass School--Eliot as an assistant principal and, later, Muriel as \na social studies teacher. Both had come from families that emphasized \n``education was the answer'' for African Americans, Muriel once said. \n``We grew up,'' she said, ``knowing we were going to college.'' It \nbecame clear quickly that both Eliot and Muriel wanted all Columbia \nchildren to have the same chance they did.\n  In 1960, Eliot became the first African-American faculty member at a \nnewly integrated Hickman High School, serving as a guidance counselor. \nHis approachable manner helped ease the tension of desegregation by \nmediating between some African-American families and White educators.\n  After Muriel's stint at Douglass School, she spent 30 years at West \nJunior High School, where she worked as a teacher, department \nchairperson, assistant principal, and principal. She retired as the \nschool district's first female associate superintendent of secondary \neducation.\n  Muriel was known for making all people of all ages and race feel \nvalued and welcome even down to her school motto: ``We're glad you're \nhere.''\n  Long into their retirement from education, the couple continued their \nefforts to promote diversity. Eliot became a founding member of the \nMinority Men's Network, served on the Columbia College board of \nTrustees, and wrote the 1997 book: ``A Letter to Young Black Men.''\n  Muriel formed the Battle Group, an education consulting firm that \nprovided strategies to school districts, parent-teacher associations, \nand juvenile justice facilities, and dedicated time and money to \nbuilding a Martin Luther King, Jr., memorial.\n  Their efforts toward overall community acceptance reached far beyond \ntheir professional lives. Two of their four children became the first \nAfrican-American students to attend Grant Elementary--the first of \nColumbia's schools to be integrated.\n  They also integrated neighborhoods, being one of the first African-\nAmerican families to move beyond the redlining real estate limits in \nColumbia and into a White neighborhood. Despite the hateful letters \nthey received--and even after having a White neighbor shoot their \nfamily dog, Bingo--the couple led by example and continued to tell \ntheir children that these neighbors feared change and they had to push \non.\n  As one local newspaper recounted, Battle's daughter said her father \nwould routinely say ``They don't understand, and they are afraid. We \nhave to live our lives and do the best we can, and if they knew better, \nthey would do better.''\n  The community of Columbia was so lucky to have had this team move \ninto its community and change it forever.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the lives and \naccomplishments of Eliot and Muriel Battle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/25/senate-section/article/S5146-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CLAIRE CITY, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to amend the small, rural school achievement program \nand the rural and low-income school program under part B of title VI of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nextend and improve a program aimed at addressing the unique needs of \nrural schools. The Rural Education Achievement Program, or REAP, is \ndesigned to help level the playing field for small and high-poverty \nrural school systems. It is the only dedicated federal funding stream \nto aid rural school districts in overcoming certain challenges \nassociated with geographic isolation.\n  Nearly \\1/3\\ of America's public schools are in rural areas, and more \nthan 21 percent of our public school students attend these schools. \nStudents in rural America should have the same access to federal \ndollars and quality education as those students who attend schools in \nurban and suburban communities. For this reason, in 2001, I worked with \nformer Senator Kent Conrad to author the law creating REAP, and I am \nnow pleased to work with Senator Max Baucus on its reauthorization. \nREAP created two grant programs: the Small and Rural Schools \nAchievement program SRSA, which provides additional funding and \nflexibility to small rural school districts, and the Rural and Low-\nIncome School program, RLIS, which provides additional funding for poor \nrural school districts.\n  Prior to enactment of this law, rural school districts received funds \nbased on school enrollment. In many of these districts, Federal formula \nprograms, which are population-based, do not produce enough resources \nto carry out important programs, which these grant programs help make \npossible. One school district in Maine, for example, received only $28 \nin 2001 to fund a district-wide Safe and Drug-free school program.\n  In addition, small and rural school districts often forgo Federal \neducation dollars because they lack the personnel and the resources to \napply for competitive grants. Having fewer personnel also creates \nadditional challenges in providing professional development \nopportunities. By allowing rural school districts to combine funds, as \nwell as providing additional funds, REAP gives these districts the \nlevels of resources required to undertake significant educational \nreform. Funds from this program have already helped to support new \ntechnology in classrooms, distance learning opportunities, and \nprofessional development activities, as well as a vast array of other \nprograms that will help rural districts.\n  The REAP Reauthorization Act of 2013 would reauthorize and implement \na few improvements to the law. These changes would allow Federal funds \nto be even more closely targeted to geographically isolated districts. \nOne important reform would allow program eligible districts to \nparticipate in the Rural and Low-Income School program if they would \nnot receive financial benefits from the Small and Rural Schools \nAchievement program.\n  Education is an essential driver for good jobs for our citizens. This \nrings true especially in rural America, where schools are the linchpin \nof rural communities. I am pleased to have the support of the Maine \nSchool Management Association for the REAP Reauthorization Act of chair \nof the Senate Rural Education Caucus, I will continue to work toward \nour goal of advancing the educational interests of rural schools and \ndistricts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      Maine School\n\n\n                                       Management Association,\n\n                                       Augusta, ME, June 24, 2013.\n     Re Reauthorization of REAP\n\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins, The Maine School Boards Association \n     and the Maine School Superintendents Association want to \n     thank you for your continued sponsorship of the REAP Program. \n     Specifically, our Associations are pleased to support the \n     2013 Reauthorization of REAP. Throughout the years, REAP \n     funding has helped to provide equity for many small schools \n     in Maine and our expectation is that will continue with this \n     Reauthorization.\n       Both the National School Boards Association and the \n     American Association of School Administrators are also \n     supportive of the Reauthorization of REAP.\n\n[[Page S5151]]\n\n       The Maine School Boards Association and the Maine School \n     Superintendents Association appreciate your continued support \n     for public education.
