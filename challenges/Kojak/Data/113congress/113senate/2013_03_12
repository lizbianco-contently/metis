Earlier this year, with November election losses fresh in \ntheir minds, top Republicans promised a kinder, gentler Republican \nParty, a Republican Party that cared about ``every American . . . \nachieving their dreams.'' Republicans bandied about words such as \n``fairness'' and ``opportunity.'' They made overtures toward women and \nHispanics. They promised cooperation and an end to brinkmanship. House \nMajority Leader Cantor even spoke of ``an agenda based on a shared \nvision of creating the conditions for health, happiness, prosperity for \nmore Americans and their families.''\n  Rebranding, we thought, was underway. Then a few weeks passed and the \nRepublican emphasis on fairness and equity made a direct U-turn back to \nwhere they started. Today the House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan \nwill unveil an extreme budget that is anything but balanced. This \nbudget reflects the same skewed priorities the Republican Party has \nchampioned for years, the same skewed priorities Americans rejected in \nNovember. The Ryan budget will call for more tax breaks for the \nwealthy, an end of Medicare as we know it, and Draconian cuts to \neducation and other programs to help America's economy grow and \nprosper.\n  We have heard it many times and I will repeat it. Yogi Berra famously \nsaid, ``It's deja vu all over again,'' and it really is. We have seen \nthis before, deja vu all over again. The Ryan budget will shower more \ntax breaks on millionaires and continue to tilt the playing field to \nthe advantage of big corporate interests and raise taxes for the middle \nclass.\n  I know Congressman Ryan is held out to be this guru who understands \nthings so well. What he understands is gimmickry and that is what he \nhas done so well. He has pulled the wool over the eyes of those people \nin the House and they continue following him, but his\n\n[[Page S1672]]\n\nbudget is anything but balanced, anything but fair. Members of the \nHouse should look at what they are being led into--or out of.\n\n  This plan, just like last year, refused to close a single tax \nloophole in order to reduce the deficit. Yet it guts investments in \neducation, health care, public safety, scientific research, and job-\ncreating clean energy technology. The Ryan budget would end the \nMedicare guarantee and force seniors into a voucher program. It would \nax preventive health care such as cancer screenings and charge seniors \nmore for prescriptions and further reduce the funding for food \ninspectors, police, and first responders generally. As if protecting \nthe wealthy special interests is not bad enough, the Republican budget \nalso devastates the economy, costing jobs and slowing economic growth.\n  Not only is this a wrong approach, it is the same old approach. To \nmake matters worse, the Paul Ryan Budget No. 3--he has done it two \nother times--used the same fuzzy math and gimmickry as his previous two \nbudgets, relies on accounting that is creative at best and fraudulent \nat worst to inflate its claims of deficit reduction. We believe it is \ncritical to stabilize the deficit, but it will take more than \naccounting gimmicks to achieve real deficit reduction.\n  At a time when corporations are making record profits, the stock \nmarket is soaring, and wealthy Americans' income continues to rise, the \ndeficit reduction should not have to be at the expense of middle-class \nfamilies, senior citizens, and the poor. Americans have demanded a fair \napproach to deficit reduction for all Americans--Democrats, \nIndependents, and Republicans. They want a fair approach to deficit \nreduction that makes sensible cuts and asks profitable corporations and \nthe wealthiest among us to share the burden--balanced.\n  We have been listening. That is why this week Budget Committee Chair \nPatty Murray will introduce a budget that reflects those balanced \npriorities. Her plan, the Democratic plan, will cut wasteful spending \nand reduce the deficit, close tax loopholes that benefit the rich, and \ninvest where the economy needs to grow, to go really hard, to continue \nto build, to grow. It will create a strong middle class.\n  Congressman Ryan and his Republican colleagues in Congress have taken \na different approach, an approach that makes it plain they missed the \nmessage in the November elections. Their budget once again will put \nmoneyed special interests ahead of middle-class families, and no amount \nof rebranding will hide that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/12/senate-section/article/S1672-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as we know, President Obama missed this \nyear's legal deadline to submit a budget to Congress, just like he has \nnearly every year of his presidency. But this year it is even worse--we \nnow know he does not even plan to submit a budget until after the House \nand the Senate have acted to pass one.\n  That has never happened in the more than 90 years that have gone by \nsince the modern budgeting process was established in the 1920s. \nSomehow, Presidents managed to submit budgets on time in the middle of \nWorld War II, during the Great Depression--but not today? There is \nsimply no excuse.\n  Rather than helping lead Congress toward a reasonable outcome, it \nappears the President is happy to drop a bomb on the congressional \nbudget process instead by releasing his budget plan after the House and \nSenate have acted--presumably so he can campaign against Republicans if \nthe process fails as he hopes. Let's hope he does not trot out that \ntired political playbook again.\n  The President should send over his budget now--not next week or next \nmonth, but today--so both sides can consider it at a time when it might \nbe helpful, rather than destructive, to the process.\n  And speaking of serious delays, for 4 years my constituents in \nKentucky and Americans across the country have been asking Senate \nDemocrats a simple question: ``Where's the budget?'' Most families put \none together. They want to know what Democrats who run the Senate have \nplanned.\n  But for 4 years, Senate Democrats have ignored these concerns. Year \nafter year, they have neglected one of their most important legislative \nresponsibilities.\n  Evidently that is about to change. Senate Democrats are now pledging \nto finally--finally--produce a budget. I will be interested to see what \nthey put forward.\n  I hope Senate Democrats take this exercise seriously and propose real \nspending reforms that can put our country on a stronger, more \nsustainable fiscal path, reforms that can control spending and lead to \nrobust private-sector growth and job creation. We will see.\n  What about Republicans? Well, Republicans lead the House, and they \nhave proposed budgets every year, right on schedule--budgets that would \nfinally put our country on a path to growth and job creation, and that \nwould put our creaky entitlement programs on a sound fiscal footing so \nthey are around when people need them.\n  Today, House Republicans will unveil this year's budget blueprint. If \nthe past is any indication, the reforms it contains would jump-start \nour economy, help more Americans join the middle class, and begin to \ntackle the debt that threatens all of our futures because Republicans \nunderstand we need to grow the economy, not the government. What's \nmore, it would get us back to a balanced budget within just a few short \nyears.\n  Call me a skeptic, but there is little chance the budget my Senate \nDemocrat friends put forward will balance--either today, 10 years from \ntoday, or ever. And I doubt it will contain much in the way of spending \nreform either. We will probably just get more of what we have come to \nexpect from them the past few years: lots of budget gimmickry, tons of \nwasteful spending, and even more tax hikes. That type of budget won't \ngrow the economy or shrink the debt.\n  But here is the thing. The budgeting process is a great way for both \nparties to outline their priorities for the country, and that is \nsomething Senate Democrats have refused to do until now.\n  So, if they want to put forward a budget that allows Medicare to go \nbankrupt, that hikes up taxes on the families and small businesses that \ncan least afford them, and that proposes a future of massive deficits \nwithout end--if that is really how they want to define themselves for \nthe American people--then let the battle of ideas begin.\n  But we need to see their budget first, so it is time to end the years \nof delays and put those ideas on the table. And it is well past time \nfor the President to do the same--not after Congress acts, but before.\n  Republicans have managed to play by the rules every year and produce \nserious budgets for our country. I hope Democrats are finally ready to \nget to work to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/12/senate-section/article/S1672-3", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this is a historic week because we will \nsee congressional presentations of the congressional budgets, and I \nbelieve we will see stark contrasts.\n\n[[Page S1673]]\n\n  Congressman Ryan of Wisconsin--nearby my home State of Illinois--is \ngoing to prepare and present to the Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives a budget that he says will bring our overall Federal \nbudget into balance over 10 years. It is a daunting task, and I commend \nhim for his effort. I also have to say that we have been there before. \nWe have heard this budget before. We know what it contains. There are \nseveral elements in the Ryan budget--as some have announced in \nadvance--that repeat the mistakes of his earlier budgets, and some of \nthem are grievous.\n  We understand we need entitlement reform to make sure important \nprograms such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid continue for \nyears to come. We understand there will be some hard choices associated \nwith efforts to make these programs more solvent.\n  The Ryan approach continues to have something called premium support. \nWhat it boils down to is this: In the outyears, Congressman Ryan and \nthe House Republicans want to offer seniors across America less money \nto pay for their Medicare insurance. They want to privatize the \nMedicare insurance system.\n  Our side of the aisle--both in the House and the Senate--is dedicated \nto some basic principles. One of the first is to make sure men and \nwomen across America who are from working families have a fighting \nchance, to make sure the Tax Code is responsive to their needs, to make \nsure the programs they count on will be there when they need them.\n  Every hour of every day most American workers in States such as \nMassachusetts and Illinois pay into our Social Security and Medicare \nsystem with the belief that when the time comes for retirement, Social \nSecurity and Medicare will be there. Unfortunately, what Congressman \nRyan is proposing is to really break that promise and to say to seniors \nacross America: You can pay into it for a lifetime, but when the time \ncomes and you really need Medicare and health insurance during your \nretirement, you probably won't be able to afford it. You won't be able \nto come up with the premiums.\n  What good is a Medicare system that a worker has paid into for a \nlifetime if it cannot provide the basic protections they will need \nduring retirement? They can balance the books--at the cost of coverage \nand the cost of the Medicare promise that has been made for \ngenerations.\n  Therein lies the real crux of the difference between Democrats and \nRepublicans when we look at these entitlement programs. We know that \nreform is necessary, but reform should be based on best medical \npractices, on reducing the obvious waste in the Medicaid Program, and \nnot on penalizing seniors who are on a fixed income who cannot afford \nincreasingly high Medicare premiums. That is the Paul Ryan approach--\nprivatizing Medicare. It is not a good approach for America. That is \nthe real difference.\n  Of course, there is this dedication on the part of Congressman Ryan \nto reduce the tax rates for the wealthiest people in America. Those \nrates, after the fiscal cliff negotiation, go as high as 39 percent on \nthe highest income. Paul Ryan's budget wants to bring them down to 25 \npercent, which is a dramatic decline in the income tax rate for the \nwealthiest Americans. How will he achieve this? He says he will achieve \nit by changing the Tax Code to bring the rate down to 25 percent. I sat \nthrough the negotiations in the Bowles-Simpson Commission and other \nplaces, and the math does not work. If they are going to try to bring \ndown the income tax rate for the wealthiest to 25 percent, sadly, they \nwill eliminate the most basic income tax deductions for working and \nmiddle-income families across America. That is the reality; otherwise, \nthey cannot reach that number.\n  We have to look at this. If the Paul Ryan budget means the wealthiest \nAmericans get a tax cut while working families see a tax increase and \nif the Paul Ryan budget means Medicare will be fiscally solvent but \nunaffordable for most working Americans, this is a budget we need to \nreject out of hand.\n  We will see that budget in its entirety today, and by tomorrow the \nDemocratic alternative here in the Senate, which has been worked on and \nprepared by Senator Patty Murray of Washington and her colleagues in \nthe Senate Budget Committee, will be presented as well, and it will be \na stark contrast. What Senator Murray and the Senate Budget Committee \nwill produce is a balanced approach that says: Yes, there will be \ndeficit reduction, but it will be the right way. We need to make sure \nwe have revenues coming from those who can afford to pay in the highest \nincome categories. Yes, we need spending cuts, and they will continue. \nWe need entitlement reform that is thoughtful and sensitive. We need \nreform that really makes sure these programs are here for generations \nto come.\n  I think America will applaud the efforts on the Senate side. I think \nthey will have many questions to ask on the House side, and then the \ndebate begins. Those of us on the Appropriations Committee wait for \nthis to be completed because the budget resolution is basically our \nblueprint for what we can achieve during the remainder of the year and \nfor the next budget year that starts October 1.\n  There are a couple of things that are part of the budget process that \nI will address very quickly.\n\n\n                             Sequestration\n\n  I am very concerned about the impact of sequestration on health care. \nReporters in Illinois asked me over the weekend: What is the big deal? \nSequestration came and life didn't end. It seems as though we are going \non in a normal way.\n  Unfortunately, they overlooked some obvious impacts. For example, \ncommunity health centers are the frontline for primary health care \nacross America. I visit them and always leave with a sense of hope and \na positive feeling. The community health centers in Chicago and across \nIllinois are quality medical institutions. They serve people with \nlimited insurance or no insurance, and they serve them in the most \nprofessional way. I have said with confidence that if I happen to get \nsick someday or someone in my family did, I would feel confident \nwalking into these community health centers--they are that good.\n  Some 22 million people in more than 9,000 locations across America \nrely on them. As the point of care for uninsured and low-income people, \ncommunity health centers provide preventive services that help avoid \nexpensive procedures and emergency room visits.\n  At a time when 30 million new Americans are about to get health \ninsurance so they can afford to get care, these across-the-board cuts \nare taking $115 million out of community health centers this year \nalone. Nationally, almost 900,000 patients will lose access. Community \nhealth center funding in Illinois will be cut by $6.2 million. Erie \nFamily Health Center in Chicago is one of the best. They will do their \nbest to protect clinical care, but the wraparound services that make \nErie so effective, not to mention cost-effective, will be reduced.\n\n  Now is not the time to cut community health center funding. Instead, \nwe should expand the centers so hard-working and low-income families \nget the care they need.\n  Regardless of where someone lives or where they go to see the doctor, \nthe $1.6 billion cut to the National Institutes of Health threatens all \nof us. And that is what these cuts are going to do to medical \nresearch--cutting $1.6 billion from the National Institutes of Health. \nI have always said that I will take this issue to any corner of \nAmerica, any group--liberal or conservative, young or old--and make my \ncase that investment in health care research is one of the most \nimportant investments our government makes. When we shortchange medical \nresearch, we shortchange our future.\n  Great medical care is only as good as the science behind it. Drugs \nand devices work only as well as our understanding of the medical \nconditions they are treating. Our country is rich with promising \nresearch. We lead the world and should be proud of it. We have the \nbright minds, the curious scientists, and the innovative labs. Today \ncountless people are engaged in work that will lead to better \ntreatments for arthritis, Alzheimer's, AIDS, diabetes, cancer, and the \nlist goes on.\n  Biomedical research supported by the NIH has established America as \nthe leader in the world, and we are right on the verge of making life-\nchanging discoveries through this research. But sequestration--which is \nnow in place--\n\n[[Page S1674]]\n\nwill have a ripple effect that could curb medical discoveries and \nweaken the economies across the country.\n  Dr. Francis Collins, Director of the NIH, says there is no question \nthat sequestration will slow the development of an influenza vaccine \nand cancer research.\n  Eli Zerhouni, head of NIH under President George W. Bush, said:\n\n       We are going to maim our innovation capabilities if we do \n     these abrupt deep cuts at NIH. It will impact science for \n     generations to come.\n\n  Right now, when so much good research is moving us forward, we should \nbe doubling down on medical education, innovation, and infrastructure. \nCutting back on NIH and biomedical research is so shortsighted. Medical \nresearch saves lives, keeps America's place as a leader in science and \nmedicine, and it generates economic growth. Frankly, these cuts shake \nthe confidence of people in this field. Trying to decide whether they \nshould dedicate their lives to medical research with the uncertainty of \nsequestration and budget cuts is unfair.\n  For over a century, NIH-supported scientists have led the way for \nimportant breakthroughs to improve health and save lives through the \ndiscovery of things such as the MRI, extending the life expectancy for \npeople with cystic fibrosis, revolutionizing our thinking about cancer, \nimproving our understanding of stroke and heart disease, and creating \nnew vaccines that save lives.\n  President Obama has called on congressional leaders to come together \nto create an alternative to the sequestration. A balanced mix of \nsmarter spending cuts and revenue from closing loopholes that benefit \nhigher income individuals will mean we can keep our commitment to \nmedical research.\n  This week we are going to start the debate on the continuing \nresolution. One of the early amendments that is likely to be offered \nwill be by Senator Harkin, who chairs the Labor, Health and Human \nServices Subcommittee in Appropriations. I have spoken to Senator \nHarkin. He is determined to do everything he can to give the Senate the \nopportunity to continue to cut the deficit but to do it in a way that \nwill not make dramatic negative cuts in medical research.\n  I hope we can get a bipartisan consensus. Diseases and the threats of \nill health strike all of us regardless of party affiliation. We should \ncome together on a bipartisan basis to support increasing medical \nresearch and maintaining America's lead in the world.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

After more than two decades serving her Nation in \nthe uniform of the U.S. Army, she poured her energy and sense of duty \ninto helping our State. Frequently offering frank advice in only the \nway Borah could, she was a leader by example and a great friend.\n  Borah's legacy will live in many ways, including in the young Texans \nshe helped me select for nominations to our Nation's military academies \nthrough her service on my Military Academy Selection Committee.\n  Sandy joins me in sending our thoughts and prayers to Borah's \nhusband, LTC Rich Castle, their families, and all those whom Borah \ntouched throughout her journey in life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/12/senate-section/article/S1674-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would like to mark this 1,413th day that \nthe Senate has not had a budget. We will be talking a lot about the \nbudget this week, as we should, in a debate that has been long overdue.\n  Since the Budget and Accounting Act was passed in 1921, no President \nhas missed the legal deadline for submitting a budget to Congress. \nUnfortunately, for the fourth time in 5 years, President Obama will \nmiss that deadline.\n  Given that our gross national debt is already larger than our entire \neconomy, and given that we are facing more than $100 trillion in \nunfunded liabilities, one would think the President would make this a \npriority and he would feel a greater sense of urgency about America's \nfiscal dilemma.\n  In fact, not only will President Obama be late with his budget this \nyear, he will not even be submitting it to the House and the Senate \nuntil after we have released our own budgets. So the President will not \nhave any input whatsoever by submitting his budget--which he should \nhave done on February 4--he will not have any input whatsoever on the \ndeliberations of the House and Senate as we take up our proposed \nbudgets.\n  As I say, since the Budget and Accounting Act was passed in 1921, no \nU.S. President has ever done that. The White House has always gone \nfirst. In fact, the President is the leader of our Nation not only as \nCommander in Chief but also as the one the Constitution looks to in the \nlaw to bear the responsibility to make at least an initial budget \nproposal. The White House has always gone first, providing a blueprint \nthat helped guide negotiations on Capitol Hill, but not under this \nPresident.\n  The budget process is an opportunity for the President to outline his \npriorities. It is an opportunity for the President to tell the American \npeople what we can afford and how we are going to pay for it. Above \nall, it is an opportunity for the President to show real leadership on \nissues of national importance.\n  As ADM Mike Mullen, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nsaid: The greatest national security threat to the United States is our \nbudget. What he meant by that is, unless the Federal Government gets \nits fiscal house in order, we are not going to be able to afford even \nthe safety net for the most vulnerable of our people, nor are we going \nto be able to afford the national security that helps keep America \nstrong and America and its allies safe.\n  Unfortunately, the President has failed to demonstrate the required \nleadership in this area. He has also ignored the recommendations of his \nown bipartisan fiscal commission. He submitted two consecutive budget \nproposals that failed to receive a single vote in this Chamber. His \nadministration has racked up $6 trillion in new debt since he became \nPresident, and he created a massive new entitlement funded by a \ntrillion-dollar tax increase--something known as ObamaCare. Now he is \nrefusing to send us a budget until after the Senate and the House vote \non their own budget proposals.\n  If the President really wants to play a constructive role in the \nbudget process, he will send us his proposal right away. Further delays \nwill only complicate and hinder our negotiations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Schatz) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/12/senate-section/article/S1674-3", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1674-S1676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TERRORISTS TRIALS\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an issue I am \nvery concerned about, which involves a man who was recently captured \noverseas. His name is Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, and he is Osama bin Laden's \nson-in-law. Here is a photo of him sitting next to Osama bin Laden. In \nfact, he appeared with Osama bin Laden right after the 9/11 attacks on \nour country.\n  He is Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, captured overseas and brought to \nthe United States of America. The Attorney General has made the \nannouncement Osama bin Laden's son-in-law\n\n[[Page S1675]]\n\nwill be tried in New York City in a civilian trial rather than being \nbrought to Guantanamo Bay for further interrogation and held in \nmilitary custody.\n  I am very concerned about this issue as this is a man who, based upon \nthe relationship he had with Osama bin Laden in 2001 and 2002, served \nas a spokesman for al-Qaida. He urged others to swear allegiance to \nOsama bin Laden. On September 12, 2001, he appeared with Osama bin \nLaden and Ayman al-Zawahiri. He is shown in this photo.\n  He warned the United States and its allies, ``A great army is \ngathering against you.'' He also called on all Muslims to battle the \nJews, Christians, and Americans. He also promised more 9/11-style \nattacks. Right after our country was attacked on September 11, he \nappeared with Osama bin Laden warning of more September 11 attacks. He \nsaid, ``The storms shall not stop, especially the airplane storms.''\n  In 2002, he reportedly arranged to be smuggled to Iran where he was \nheld under some form of house arrest. Obviously, we need to understand \nwhy the Iranians were allowing such a prominent member of al-Qaida to \nbe kept in their country. We have deep concerns about Iran, which is \nthe largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. It is threatening \nour country and right now marching toward nuclear weapons capability. \nIt has threatened to annihilate Israel and threaten our country, while \nhe was under loose house arrest following his direct allegiance with \nOsama bin Laden.\n  In addition, American authorities have tied him to an October 8, \n2002, attack on the U.S. Marines while training on an island off the \ncoast of Kuwait. This was a situation where one of our marines was \nkilled and another was seriously injured.\n  The attack was conducted by al-Qaida fighters with direct ties to Mr. \nAbu Ghaith, who is Mr. Osama bin Laden's son-in-law. Kuwait actually \nstripped Mr. Abu Ghaith of his citizenship because of his role in \nrecruiting Kuwaitis to become members of al-Qaida.\n  Last week he pled guilty to charges in Federal court in New York \nCity. I am concerned when we take a top member of al-Qaida after his \ncapture overseas, such as Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, bring him to \nour courts in New York City, and then all the full rights of our \ncivilian court system apply to this individual. This includes the \nright, when one is in custody and interrogated, to hear Miranda rights.\n  My former role was as attorney general for the State of New \nHampshire. I have great respect for our civilian system; however, our \ncivilian system was not designed to deal with situations where we are \nat war. Mr. Abu Ghaith falls clearly within the definition of what this \nbody has authorized as the use of military force against an enemy \nbelligerent. When we bring him to New York City, we must Mirandize him \nand inform him he has the right to remain silent. We lose valuable \nopportunities to gather intelligence, to protect our country, and to \ndiscover if he was with Osama bin Laden.\n  We have photos of him one day after the September 11 attack. What \ndoes he know about al-Qaida? Who else was involved? What does he know \nabout their network? During the time he spent in Iran, was he still \ncommunicating with members of al-Qaida? Obviously, he was because we \nallege he helped commit an attack in 2002 in Kuwait which killed at \nleast one marine.\n  Who was he communicating with? What future attacks are they planning? \nWhat associations has he made with members of al-Qaida? When we tell \nsomeone such as this he has the right to remain silent and give him a \nlawyer, we lose opportunities to protect our country.\n  When we are at war, as we are with al-Qaida, we need to focus to \ndiscover as much information as possible about al-Qaida: who they are \ntargeting and who are the members of al-Qaida. Obviously, all of us \nsupported the President's decision to take out Osama bin Laden. Who are \nthe other members of his network? What information are we losing when \nwe bring him to a civilian court system instead of bringing him where \nhe belongs as an enemy belligerent in Guantanamo Bay?\n  It seems to me inconsistent that the administration would take the \nposition--and I support them on this--they would kill top members of \nal-Qaida overseas. Yet they are so averse--when they capture someone--\nto bringing them to Guantanamo Bay. It is their preference to take them \ninto a civilian court system in the United States of America, where \nthey must read Miranda rights to that individual rather than take them \nwhere they belong, to Guantanamo Bay.\n\n  I have visited Guantanamo, which is a secure detention facility where \npeople are treated humanely, kept very securely, but not on U.S. soil. \nWe may keep them in Guantanamo Bay under the law of war and interrogate \nthe individual as long as we need to.\n  Let me remind everyone the intelligence we gathered, which allowed us \nto find and take out Osama bin Laden, took a matter of not just months \nbut years to gather. To take someone such as Sulaiman Abu Ghaith and \nimmediately, after he is captured, very quickly bring him to New York \nCity, we lose the opportunity to go back to him over time to understand \nthe full amount of information he may have about al-Qaida. This is why \nwe have a distinction under our law between the law of war and our \ncivilian system.\n  He is not a bank robber. He is not an average criminal who should be \ntreated the same way as any other criminal in America. He is someone \nwho has sworn to kill Americans and has asked others to take the oath \nfor al-Qaida, which is at war with our country. I am very worried about \nthe fact the administration seems to be bent on bringing these foreign \nterrorists to the United States to give them all of the rights of our \ncivilian court system rather than focusing on ensuring we have all the \nintelligence we need to protect our country.\n  I would like to also speak about another individual and the \ninconsistency we have here. This is Anwar al-Awlaki. Anwar al-Awlaki \nwas an American citizen. He was radicalized, possessed both American \nand Yemeni citizenship, and became a leader for al-Qaida in the Arabian \nPeninsula. He advocated for violent jihad against the United States and \nhas been linked to a dozen terrorist investigations in the United \nStates. These include links to the September 11 attacks against our \ncountry and links to the November 5, 2009, Fort Hood shooting.\n  The administration made the decision in September 2011 to take out \nMr. al-Awlaki overseas in Yemen. I certainly support their decision in \nthat regard.\n  I want to point out how inconsistent it is that we are willing to use \nthe drone program to take out someone like al-Awlaki, and yet we will \nnot use all the tools in our toolbox to ensure Osama bin Laden's son-\nin-law is held at Guantanamo and fully interrogated to give us the time \nwe need to gather the full information he has. It is very inconsistent, \nand I think the administration should be detaining enemy belligerents \nin Guantanamo and ensuring they are interrogated.\n  I wish to mention one final person, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. Let's not \nforget the administration's first decision with the mastermind of 9/11, \nKhalid Shaikh Mohammed, was to bring him to New York City for a \ncivilian trial in New York close to Ground Zero, as they are now making \nthe decision with Osama bin Laden's son-in-law.\n  The public outrage was great over bringing Khalid Shaikh Mohammed to \nNew York City due to the amount of security it would take to secure \nsomeone like him. There was the concern he should be treated as an \nenemy of our country and tried by a military commission in Guantanamo. \nHe was transferred there eventually by the administration, but only \nafter great pressure from both sides of the aisle in Congress to say it \nwould be appropriate that the mastermind of 9/11 belongs in Guantanamo \nbefore a military commission.\n  I think we find ourselves in the same situation now with Osama bin \nLaden's son-in-law. There can be no doubt he is a top member of al-\nQaida; that he had close relationships with Osama bin Laden; that he is \ncharged with conspiring to kill Americans. These are very serious \ncharges, and there can be no doubt that he falls within our operation \nand the use of military force; that he is an enemy of our country and \nthat we should be treating him in a similar fashion as to how we \ntreated Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.\n  Most of all, we need to prioritize intelligence gathering to prevent \nfuture\n\n[[Page S1676]]\n\nattacks against our country rather than focusing on bringing them \nimmediately into our civilian court system. A man such as Osama bin \nLaden's son-in-law should never hear the words ``You have the right to \nremain silent.'' We can't afford to have him be silent. We need to know \neverything he knows to protect our country, its citizens, and to \nprevent future attacks on America and our allies.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am rising to speak on the continuing \nresolution to keep government funded for the rest of the year.\n  I chair the full committee of the Appropriations Committee. My very \nable and esteemed colleague, Senator Shelby, is the vice chairman. We \ncome to the floor to talk about our legislation, which is an amendment \nto the House CR to fund the Federal Government for the rest of the \nfiscal year. It continues the bipartisan tradition of the \nAppropriations Committee working closely with both sides of the aisle, \nand I wish to thank Senator Shelby for his excellent cooperation and \nhis wise counsel in doing this and actually cosponsoring this.\n  Our leadership, Senators Reid and McConnell, has been critical to \nallowing us to come to the floor and have our bill be debated openly, \nto have appropriate amendments, and then to have it voted on by the \nfull Senate. In today's toxic environment in Washington, I must say our \nconversations have been characterized by civility, collegiality, and \nabsolute candor--what we can do; what we can't do, not what we would \nlike to do but what we must do to keep the government's doors open.\n  I also want to comment on the excellent tone and conversation we have \nhad with the House, specifically our House counterparts, Hal Rogers, \nthe chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, and Congresswoman \nNita Lowey. We have talked with each other and worked together, and if \nwe continue to do that without other intervening dynamics, we can get \nthis bill done.\n  Before I go into our bill to offer its content, I want everybody to \nunderstand there are three things at play in Washington this week. We \nuse arcane language, so nobody knows what is going on. There is the \nsequester, there is the continuing resolution, and there is the Budget \nCommittee. Everybody is going to get confused because everybody is \ngetting it commingled. All of it is getting press and the American \npeople don't understand there are three separate solutions to three \nseparate problems.\n  Let me go to the Budget Committee, which will be on the floor next \nweek, and Senator Murray is vociferously and persistently working on \nthat bill. That is for fiscal year 2014. That is the framework on how \nwe are going to approach our overall budget: What are we going to \nspend, what revenues we are going to have to raise, if any, and also a \nreview of mandatory spending. That is going on over there. That is for \nfiscal year 2014.\n  The Mikulski-Shelby continuing resolution is the appropriations \nbill--not a personality bill--that will fund the government through \n2013. The American people might say: Didn't you do that in October? \nIsn't our fiscal New Year's Eve October 1? Well, not really. What \nhappened is we were going into the heat and passion and prickliness of \nan election year, so the wise heads thought it best to extend it where \ncooler heads would prevail in March. So here we are. We are the cooler \nheads, and we are ready to prevail. What we have here now is that \nlegislation.\n  Everybody needs to understand this: On March 27, that continuing \nresolution expires. If we do not pass our bill and then have an \nagreement between the House and the Senate that is signed by the \nPresident, we could face a government showdown. There is no will on \neither side of this institution that wants to do that. We are \nabsolutely committed to no shutdown, no showdown, no lockdown, no \nslamdown. We want to do the job, and that is why we have been working \nvery carefully to do that.\n  What we will offer today is funding through the fiscal year, which \nwill take us to October 1, and that meets the mandatory cap assigned to \nus by the Budget Committee of $1.4 trillion. That is a lot of money, \nbut it is a big government with big responsibilities. It includes \neverything from defense--defending us over there--to the border \ncontrol--defending us here--to meeting compelling human need and making \ninvestments in science and technology while ensuring we do what we need \nto do.\n  Our legislation is quite simple and straightforward. It includes five \nappropriations bills. Two are already in it from the House--defense, \nmilitary construction, and veterans. It will also include agriculture, \nhomeland security, and a subcommittee that Senator Shelby and I are \nchair and vice chair of that funds the entire Justice Department. That \nmeans FBI, Federal law enforcement, and science and commerce. So we \nhave Ag, CJS, homeland security and defense. Defense and military \nconstruction are identical to the House. Agriculture, CJS and homeland \nsecurity are consistent with bipartisan and bicameral agreements \nnegotiated last fall.\n  Remember, we are reaching across the aisle, we are reaching across \nthe dome. That is how we are trying to do it. However, there are seven \nremaining bills in the continuing resolution, and they are energy and \nwater--money for things such as the Corps of Engineers--interior and \nenvironment, financial services, transportation, Labor-HHS, state and \nforeign ops, and the legislative branch. That means they are provided \ncurrent funding levels and policies with some very limited changes to \nfix present problems. These are called anomalies.\n  The Senate version, as I said, totals $1.43 trillion, which is equal \nto the House CR. So the top line is the same; the difference is how we \nachieve national goals. It is equal to the House continuing resolution, \nand it is the same as required by the Budget Control Act. We are \nabsolutely in compliance with the Budget Control Act.\n  Sequester mandates another $86 billion in cuts. That comes over what \nwe do, and that solution is to be negotiated by the President and the \nleadership with the concurrence of both bodies. That is part of the \ncharm offensive that is going on now. OK. Sequester needs a balanced \nsolution, and we will be listening and awaiting their ideas, but right \nnow we are looking at our bill that includes bipartisan amendments, \nminimizing the problems of operating and returning to a regular order \nfor fiscal year 2014.\n  The amendment we offer is much better than an extension of the \ncurrent continuing resolution. Why don't we take a date and just change \n2012 to 2013? We don't do that because our bill makes reforms. We \nactually get more value for the dollar. If we just extended it, we \nwould sometimes be spending money on unneeded programs, one of which \nwould be--in our bill, CJS--$500 million for a space shuttle that \ndoesn't exist. We want to change that and put it where it belongs, into \nthe proper defending of our Nation and investing in science and \ntechnology. So a date change in a continuing resolution is not \nworkable.\n  The Senate amendment improves the House CR by adding those three \ndomestic bills and, as I said, includes a number of changes. I could go \nthrough each and every one of those changes, such as in agriculture, \nbut what I wish to do is explain the process now. I do want to explain \nthe content of my bill; however, I am going to take 1 minute now and \nyield to Senator Shelby for his opening statement and then I will come \nback and explain the details of our actual funding.\n  I must say again, I have appreciated not only the civility and the \ncollegiality but the candor. We had to look at not what we would like \nto do and not even what we should do but what we must do to keep \ngovernment operating, to achieve the national goals America wants: our \nnational security, both those who wear the uniform of the U.S. military \nas well as others who defend the Nation, such as border control, \nFederal law enforcement, law enforcement at the local\n\n[[Page S1677]]\n\nlevel, food safety and drug safety inspectors, to make sure we meet \ncompelling human need in the fields of education, biomedical research. \nThis is what we are trying to do--weather satellites that predict \nfuture natural disasters.\n  Again, we don't have a bill that is what we would like to do, what we \nhave is a bill that is what we must do. If we all work together--and we \nask those who have amendments to be working with our leadership--we \nbelieve we can move this bill by the middle of this week; that by the \nweek's end, the certainty of government funding will have been \nestablished and we will have shown we can govern.\n  I yield the floor so my vice chairman can say what he wishes to say \nto add to the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, first of all this morning I would like to \nthank Chairwoman Mikulski for her willingness to work together in good \nfaith and to introduce the bill that keeps the government running for \nthe rest of the fiscal year. The chair and I have had what I would \ncharacterize as a long and productive working relationship. I think \nthis bill is a very clear signal that we intend to continue that \nrelationship for the good of the legislative process and the American \npeople.\n  I believe Congress must learn to deal with the spending constraints \nthat have become a necessary reality for all of us. Much more work \nremains to be done to secure our fiscal future, including fixing \nentitlement programs and reforming our Tax Code. However, today we have \ntaken the first step to show the American people Congress can come \ntogether on important issues. My hope is we will continue to do so.\n  I am pleased to say Chairwoman Mikulski and I have accomplished three \nshared goals in this proposed legislation. First, this bill will \nprevent a government shutdown. Nobody in America wants that. Moving \nfrom one continuing resolution to the next only delays our problems and \ncreates added uncertainty. I hope we can return to the regular order of \nproducing budgets and appropriations bills to avoid the threat of a \nshutdown in the future.\n  Second, this bill will provide more flexibility for the remainder of \nthe year so that government agencies can deal with the reality of the \nsequester which remains fully in place here.\n  Third, I believe this bill is a product both parties in both Houses \ncan support. It prioritizes spending and aims to steer clear of \ndivisive issues.\n  In addition, discretionary spending is subject to the caps put in \nplace by the Budget Control Act, and this bill complies with those \nlevels. As noted, spending cuts made by the sequester will come on top \nof these constraints.\n  I support moving forward with this bill, and encourage my colleagues \nto join together to do the same. Many Americans have lost faith that \nRepublicans and Democrats can work together on anything. I believe this \nbill demonstrates it is possible, and I hope it will pave the way for a \nmore productive relationship in the future. And while we are sure to \ndisagree on many issues, I remain positive we can restore regular order \nin the Congress and deal with pressing fiscal matters in a timely \nbipartisan manner.\n  I think I speak for both of us when I say we are committed--yes, we \nare committed--to putting the budget and appropriations process back on \ntrack. We look forward to working with our colleagues who share that \ngoal and are willing to join us in this effort. This is a new \nbeginning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, you can see our tone. We need \neverybody's cooperation, if they have amendments, to bring them to us \nand also to the leadership which is helping us negotiate which ones \nwill come up, and I think we can get this bill done this week.\n  But I wish to say why getting it done is worthwhile. I want to speak \nabout agriculture, and I wish to speak about some of the content we \nhave, and do it in alphabetical order because it is easier for folks to \nfollow.\n  In agriculture, our amendment makes sure we fund the Food Safety \nModernization Act which is not included in the House bill. This is the \nfirst major reform of food safety laws in 70 years and is much needed. \nCDC says 48 million Americans suffer from food-borne illness each year.\n  This morning before I came to the floor, I attended a hearing on the \nSelect Committee on Intelligence that I am a member of. General James \nClapper, the Director of National Intelligence, along with key people \nfrom the military, civilian agencies such as FBI Director Mueller, gave \nus a 30-page report on threats to the United States. One of the things \nthey talked about was the safety of our food supply. We need to make \nsure we have inspectors on the ground for what might occur through \nbacteria or what might also be induced. So food safety is a big issue.\n  This amendment is also better at improving clean water to rural \ncommunities, and provides 165 rural communities with clean water and \nwaste disposal, creating construction jobs today, and improving \ncommunity health. I am very well versed in that because, along with \nSenator Cardin, we represent 2,000 miles of the Chesapeake Bay. We have \nolder communities. We have issues related to wastewater treatment that \nare not only polluting the Bay but are very difficult to repair because \nof the very nature of our population--wonderful, patriotic people who \ndon't have a lot of cash to pay a lot of taxes for wastewater. But in \nhelping them, we improve public health and we save the Chesapeake Bay \nwith all its seafood industry. That is just me. But we could go \neverywhere.\n  Commerce, Justice, Science, that is a subcommittee I chair. Boy, do I \nlike it. Why do I like it? Because it goes to everything we are talking \nabout: about justice, about jobs today and jobs tomorrow. When we look \nat our Department of Commerce, which should be the point place for \nAmerican business really promoting private sector initiatives and, most \nof all, promoting exports--not sending jobs overseas but sending \nproducts and services--that is where the trade negotiation goes. This \nis part of our economic vitality. This is where we have bipartisan \nagreement. Let's engage in free and open and fair trade. That \nnegotiation staff and so on is funded through our subcommittee.\n  We also want to protect our borders. That is going to be in homeland \nsecurity. In our justice funding, we fund Federal law enforcement and \nprovide funds to local communities on a competitive basis to put cops \non the beat and to give them the appropriate things they need to \nprotect themselves.\n  Let's look at the Byrne grants, the main Federal tool that helps \nState and local law enforcement. We provide more money. That means more \nmoney for body armor, more money for them to learn the latest tips and \nso on, and stopping the gang threat. It also provides COPS on the Beat \ngrants. Both of those are modest increases over the House funding. When \nI say modest, do you know what I am talking about? For all that local \nlaw enforcement does, we are going to provide $15 million. That is not \na lot of money by Washington's terms, but to the local police \ndepartments it will be a help.\n  Commerce-Justice also supports innovation. It is in this subcommittee \nthat we fund the National Science Foundation $220 million more than the \nHouse. That means we will be able to provide more help to 7,000 \nscientists and teachers making new discoveries for new products that \nwill lead to new companies and new jobs. This is what we do.\n  We are better than the House also in homeland security. This \namendment does more to protect the Nation from cyber warfare. Cyber \nwarfare is one of the greatest threats facing America. Again, in this \n30-page report we have on threats, the first five pages were devoted to \nall of the cyber problems. What kind of cyber problems? Cyber attacks, \ncyber espionage, and the growing nexus between organized crime and \nnation states, preventing hacking, stealing our state secrets, our \ntrade secrets and also the human trafficking of children and women, \nweapons of mass destruction. Where you sell women and children as a \ncommodity across the borders of the world through organized crime and \ncorrupt government officials, you will also sell other kinds of things, \nincluding weapons of mass destruction. So this is where we need to fund \nhomeland security, the Department of Defense, the FBI, our contribution \nto Interpol. All of that is in the bill, and we do better--not a lot \nbetter\n\n[[Page S1678]]\n\nbecause we are frugal; again, not what we would like to do, but what we \nmust do.\n\n  Also under homeland security, we make sure we look at that which puts \npeople in harm's way. In my own State, and others, there is the issue \nof fires. Most fire departments in big cities are run by professionals, \nbut in most rural communities they are run by the great volunteer fire \ndepartments. We have a fire grant program that I helped start that \ntrains and equips local firefighters. What we do here is provide more \nmoney--$33 million above the House--to help provide those grants, and \nwe also provide additional funds to help State and local fire \ndepartments.\n  In the area of compelling human need, I want to talk about the \nSubcommittee on Education, Labor, and Human Services. This is the \nsubcommittee that funds compelling human need. And what do we do here? \nWe look after childcare development block grants, we support care for \n9,000 more children, and we also make sure we adequately fund Head \nStart by providing modest sums there.\n  In addition, we also provide more money to the National Institutes of \nHealth, $71 billion. But put that into the context that they are going \nto take a $1.5 billion hit in sequester.\n  I know the Presiding Officer represents a great State, Hawaii. Who \nwouldn't love Hawaii? But I wish the Presiding Officer would look at \nMaryland. Not only do we have the wonderful Chesapeake Bay, a Super \nBowl championship, but we have other ``super bowl'' winners. They are \ncalled the National Institutes of Health, the National Security Agency, \nthe National Weather Agency.\n  Just the other day when I was over at NIH, they told me--and told \nAmerica through their communications--that NIH's work, working with \nclinicians and the private-led science sector, has reduced cancer rates \nin the United States of America by 15 percent in breast cancer, \nprostate cancer, lung cancer. And it is all those wonderful researchers \nat the Bethesda campus and in academic centers of excellence all over \nAmerica. But instead of pinning medals on those people and encouraging \nyoung people to come into science, we could end up giving them a pink \nslip. What are we doing?\n  I not only want to lower cancer rates, but I want to improve and \nraise the discovery rate. This is what we do in this CR. We are working \nwith them on a bipartisan basis. This is helping American people and \ngiving us products that are approved by FDA that we can sell and ship \naround the world, particularly to countries that could never do it.\n  So I am all about jobs--jobs today and jobs tomorrow. That is why \nwhat we do in transportation, housing, and urban development is also a \nbig step forward. In addition to looking out for the homeless, we \nprovide an additional amount of money for highway and road safety \nprograms, where people actually working with funds going to Governors \nat the local level--not some shovel-ready gimmick--can identify \nprojects in the pipeline we could generate in construction. We can \nimprove public safety by smart highways. And, literally, we can help \nget America rolling again; we have a fragile economy.\n  I could go on about this bill, but this is a general outline, and I \nwill talk more about it. I feel very passionate about it because we \nhave squeezed every nickel, we have looked at it very fastidiously to \nmake sure that we are right within our mandated spending cap to assess \nour national priorities: national security, compelling human needs, how \nwe can help create jobs, look out for the middle class, and make those \ninvestments that improve the lives of the American people and generate \njobs tomorrow.\n  I think we have a very good bill. I ask everyone's cooperation to get \nit passed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/12/senate-section/article/S1678-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1678-S1680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE SEQUESTER\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the work Chairwoman \nMikulski and Ranking Member Shelby and the Appropriations Committee \nhave done and the place they will bring us to on the floor of the \nSenate this week as we take an important step forward to fix the fiscal \nyear 2013 budget. I will be meeting tomorrow--as many legislators do \nduring the course of the year--with my Governor. All of the Virginia \ndelegation will be sitting down with Governor McDonnell, who will be \nvisiting, and he and the State will view this as very good news as we \ncan talk about this work product.\n  I made my first speech on the floor about 2 weeks ago, and it was a \nspeech that was kind of a plea. It was a plea to avoid the economic \nself-inflicted wound of sequester. As we all know, we were not able to \ndo that at the time. There were two bills, and neither of them was able \nto get sufficient votes to move forward. The negative consequences from \nthat sequester have been felt in the Commonwealth, as I traveled \naround, whether it is warn notices to ship repairers in the Hampton \nRoads area, planned furloughs of DOD civilian employees, or a delay in \na carrier deployment that could potentially leave us more vulnerable in \nthe Middle East.\n  The good news is that we can fix it and improve it. The \nAppropriations Committee's work discussed today is a way to begin to do \nthat. We have a chance to get it right and to reduce the negative \neffects of sequester by dealing effectively with the expiring CR for \nfiscal year 2013 and then producing a progrowth 2014 budget. This is \nthe work before this body in the next few weeks, and we need to do our \nvery best work.\n  On the continuing resolution, it has been made clear in the comments \nbefore, we do not have a fiscal year 2013 budget or appropriations \nbills at the current time, so since October, we have been operating out \nof 2012 appropriations bills, pushed forward for a few months at a \ntime. This leads us to a situation where we are not forward-focused, \nbut we are operating out of an old playbook. We need to align our \nspending around this year's priorities and not be locked into funding \nthe priorities of the past.\n  The Department of Defense--just to focus on this for a minute because \ndefense is critical to the Commonwealth, as it is to all States--is \nvery constrained by the continuing resolution that is currently in \nplace. There is a $11 billion operations and maintenance shortfall that \nis difficult for DOD to manage in a way that will keep us safe. There \nis a lack of flexibility to adjust to new needs. There are no new \nstarts on important projects, including on the shipbuilding and naval \nside, which is so important to the Commonwealth. That has already led \nto a delay in the construction of one of the new Ford class aircraft \ncarriers, the USS John F. Kennedy, with a consequent potential loss in \njobs. Other agencies throughout the Federal Government have been \nsimilarly affected.\n  The good news is that there is a solution. Chairwoman Mikulski and \nSenator Shelby, the ranking member, have worked together to lay that \nout today. This week we will work together on a true appropriations \nbill for the remainder of fiscal year 2013 for critical government \nfunctions: Department of Defense, military construction, the VA, but \nalso homeland security, agriculture, commerce-justice- science. There \nare other governmental functions that will continue to operate under \nthe fiscal year 2013 CR, but in many areas we will not be working off a \nbackward-looking document. For the remainder of the year at least, \nbecause of the work of this committee, we can look at a forward-looking \ndocument.\n  Again, I congratulate Chairwoman Mikulski and Ranking Member Shelby \nand the Appropriations Committee for working so hard together with \nHouse colleagues to put us in this posture. A true appropriations \napproach to the remainder of fiscal year 2013 fixes many of the DOD \nproblems I outlined earlier. For example, it will allow us to go \nforward on the shipbuilding contract to construct a second Ford class \ncarrier, the USS John F. Kennedy. That will be wonderful news for our \ndefense and wonderful news for the shipyard that is the largest private \nemployer in Virginia. It will allow us to move forward on significant \nship refurbishment and repair contracts. The repair and refueling of \nthe USS Roosevelt and the USS Lincoln were delayed as a result of the \nuncertainty about the budget, but the work this committee is doing will \nenable us to move forward.\n  We will be able to not completely eliminate the operations and \nmaintenance deficits but at least make moves\n\n[[Page S1679]]\n\namong those accounts to mitigate the effects of the O deficit, and \nthat will be across service branches.\n  Just last Friday, as I left the Senate and drove back to my home in \nRichmond, I stopped and did an economic development tour with a \ncontractor in the Fredericksburg area working on robotics projects for \nall of the service branches. They talked about the fact that the CR was \nreally putting a crimp in their planned expansions, their ability to \nhire students who are graduating from engineering programs around \nVirginia and around the Nation this fall. The CR fix going forward will \ngive this company and so many others some certainty that will enable \nthem to do the work we need to do and also help expand employment.\n  Other agencies have a similar upside from the fix of this fiscal year \n2013 CR, as Chairwoman Mikulski was just outlining--improvements in \ndomestic nutrition; improvements in international food aid, which is \nnot only good for the most vulnerable people in the world but also good \nfor the American farmer; improvements in State and local law \nenforcement support, immigration enforcement, workforce training, early \nchildhood education. There are many aspects of this fix going forward \nthat are far preferable to the CR and certainly preferable to flirting \naround the possibility of any kind of a shutdown after March 27. That \nis why I strongly support the approach the Appropriations Committee, \nunder its leadership, has worked on. It is good for the United States \nand good for Virginia, and it represents a move to forward-looking \nbudgeting rather than plays out of last year's playbook.\n  Make no mistake, the sequester is still in place, and the sequester \nis still having significant effects. The fiscal year 2013 \nappropriations bill we are discussing will mitigate the effects, but \nthere will still be an operations and maintenance shortfall within DOD. \nEvery service is still facing potential cuts in training and other \nreadiness functions that should cause us concern.\n  Last Monday, a week ago yesterday, I went to the Pentagon and visited \nwith Secretary Hagel, Deputy Secretary Carter, General Odierno, spent \ntime with General Welsh last week, and not just with the brass but then \nwent down into the cafeteria and heard the real deal from folks who \nwere having lunch, and these were Active Duty assigned to the Pentagon, \nDOD civilian, Guard men and women who were back just coincidently to do \ntraining-related meetings that day, and veterans who were back having \nlunch with their friends. As I went table to table and talked about \nsequester, I heard about continuing effects and concerns regarding the \nfurlough of defense civilians and potential cuts to contractors. So \nthose are still out there, but the good news is that this bill will \naddress and improve, and then we have a second chance to do so as well \nas we begin in short order to deal with a proposed fiscal year 2013 \nbudget.\n\n  There is a strong budget process already underway that will bear \nfruit in the committee within the next couple of days. The Budget \nCommittee, under the leadership of Chairman Murray, has worked very \nhard, and it started the process that will lead to committee discussion \nand voting and then amendment and debate later this week. The basic \ngoal of what we are trying to do is pretty simple, under the chairman's \ndirection: Let's grow the economy and create jobs while reducing our \ndeficit and debt in an economically credible way.\n  If we do this right, together with the appropriations approach \ndiscussed today, we can help reduce and then shape the negative effect \nthat sequester has had on the Commonwealth and the country by replacing \na blunt, nonstrategic, across-the-board set of cuts with more strategic \nand targeted approaches.\n  We have a long way to go, obviously, whether it is on finding the \npath forward just on this bill--and it looks as if there is very strong \nbipartisan support, and that is positive--but certainly on moving \nforward with the budget and the possibility of finding some compromise \nwith the House. There are going to be vast differences in the \napproaches, and we cannot sugarcoat that. But I think it is maybe \nimportant at least to stop and acknowledge some positive steps.\n  At year end, before I joined the body, the two Houses did come \ntogether and they found a compromise on the Bush tax cuts, which was \npositive. There were things not to like about it, but the fact of \ncompromise was a positive. The House agreed earlier in calendar year \n2013 that they would not use the debt ceiling as leverage over the \nAmerican economy or leverage over these discussions. That, in an \nearlier instance, led to America's credit being downgraded, so stepping \naway from that is positive. In the Senate, we are returning to normal \nbudgetary order under normal timing, and that is a positive step. Both \nsides have agreed to avoid brinkmanship surrounding government shutdown \non March 27 and have worked assiduously to avoid it. This compromise to \nthe fiscal year 2013 CR and the willingness to move forward in a true \nappropriations approach for the rest of the year in these key \ngovernment functions is so positive. And the prospects, which I think \nare very good, of both Houses actually producing budgets on time for \nthe first time in a number of years is also positive.\n  So while there are real and significant differences, and we will lay \nthose on the table and debate them with vigor over the next few days \nand weeks, the American public will see this process unfold. They \nexpect us to debate, listen, and find reasonable compromises. We have \nseen some, just in the last few days--I guess I will conclude and say \nthis: We have seen some recent positive economic news--the jobs report \nFriday, some of the news about housing, the stock market. There are \nsome positive economic trends that are starting to develop. Congress \ncan accelerate these trends. Congress can accelerate the improvement of \nthe American economy if we keep taking these reasonable steps forward \nto find a responsible budgetary path. This work on the CR bill to find \nan appropriations path for the remainder of the year is one of those \npositive steps, and I applaud the committee leadership for doing so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for \nhis comments. He and Senator Warner are on the other side of the \nPotomac, and sometimes we are friends, sometimes we are rivals. But it \nis such a dynamic State. The junior Senator from Virginia knows his \nState has some of the greatest Federal assets there--the Pentagon, the \nCentral Intelligence Agency. It is a home of vibrant technology. That \nis why we sometimes come as rivals.\n  But I want to ask a question of the Senator from Virginia, if the \nSenator will yield?\n  Mr. KAINE. I yield.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. When we are moving the continuing resolution and he \ntalks about being in the cafeteria and going table to table, which is \nsomething I do myself, and I know he enjoys it,--is it his point that \nwe protect the men and women in uniform but the civilian employees, \nmany of whom are veterans, would be at risk?\n  Mr. KAINE. Absolutely. I am just coming from an armed services \nhearing, I say to Senator Mikulski, where we were talking about that \nvery same thing. The armed services mission, of course, requires that \nwe protect the men and women in uniform. But so many of the DOD \ncivilians are absolutely critical in doing their appropriate jobs. \nSixty percent of the staff, for example, our strategic men, STRATCOM, \nare civilian employees. They are doing some of the most important work \nthat we need done in the country right now around cyber security. The \nnurses who care for the wounded warriors I visited at Fort Belvoir \nHospital, for example, are DOD civilians. So the furloughs that affect, \nmore broadly, the civilian employees should be reason for significant \nconcern.\n  Again, we are taking a positive step toward addressing some of these \nissues by embracing the appropriations approach that the Senator has \nworked on, and we will have an additional ability to take a positive \nstep with respect to the fiscal year 2014 budget.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. So just to prove our policy goal here, we cannot have \ngovernment funding expire. The consequences of a government shutdown \nwould be horrendous. What would it be on the Virginia economy?\n\n[[Page S1680]]\n\n  Mr. KAINE. I say to the Senator, it is impossible----\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Speaking from the old days as a Governor.\n  Mr. KAINE. It is like the old commercial about the price of various \nthings but some things are priceless. There is no way to estimate it. \nJust off the top of my head, there have been analyses of the degree to \nwhich the Federal budget impacts the economy in each State, and the \nmost recent, done by Bloomberg about 16 months ago, had Virginia as the \nState most affected by the Federal budget. So the prospect of more \nbrinkmanship around shutdown, which has happened in the past, even if \nit does not occur, creates great anxiety. But if it were to occur, \nwhether it is the nurses caring for our wounded warriors, whether it is \nthe researchers helping us to figure out how to stay ahead of the cyber \nattacks that are frankly happening to our Nation every day, or whether \nit is the shipyard repairers at Newport News Shipyard who manufacture \nthe largest in manufactured items in the world, nuclear aircraft \ncarriers, which should be a story of American pride, who would find \ntheir jobs at risk--a shutdown and even the negative consequences of \nplaying out of last year's CR, which is backward-looking rather than \nforward-looking, are significant. And that is why turning and facing \nforward is the approach we should take.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator for his insightful and cogent \ncomments. He is a great fighter from Virginia. I look forward to \nworking with the Senator from Virginia--just as I have worked with \nSenator Shelby--where there is no brinkmanship, no ultimatums. We just \nwant to get the job done. We need to do our job so other people get to \ndo their job so America keeps rolling.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I would like to speak for 15 minutes on \nthe topic of revenue sharing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I did not come to the floor today to \nspeak on the appropriations and CR, but I want to thank the chairwoman \nand ranking member for working in a bipartisan way. They are working on \nfinding a solution and an ability to ensure that at the end of the day \nwe can keep this government operating and moving forward, and I thank \nthem for that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/12/senate-section/article/S1680-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1680-S1681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            REVENUE SHARING\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I rise to take exception with some of my \ncolleagues--and I hate to say this--on my side of the aisle. This \nsubject is very frustrating. I am talking about a letter I reviewed \nfrom March 8. It is a letter from the Senate Energy Committee. The \nletter talks about revenue sharing and offshore oil and gas development \nand how that Federal revenue should be shared.\n  When I read this letter, it sounds as if there is some evil monster \nlurking in the deep, which is far from the truth. It is very \nfrustrating--and I hate to say this--to see some of my fellow Democrats \ntrying to make energy policy without talking to folks who are in the \nenergy-producing States.\n  Let me make this very clear. I am here to talk about revenue sharing. \nThe letter is laid out as if it is about revenue sharing. After reading \nthe letter, I found out that it is really about opposing offshore oil \nand gas development of any kind. I come from a State that is heavily \ninvested in this endeavor, and to say revenue sharing is inherently \ninequitable is somewhat comical. What is inequitable is to drain \nresources from our energy-producing States without compensating them \nfor the impacts of this needed development.\n  I introduced legislation 6 weeks ago to make sure Alaskans get their \nfair share of the resources developed along our coastlines. Our \ncommunities are greatly impacted by development. My goal is to share \nFederal energy resources generated off Alaska's coast with the State \nand local governments as well as Alaska's Native people. It is just \ncommon sense.\n  My bill not only encourages increased and responsible development of \nAlaska's energy resource, but it also makes sure our communities \nbenefit directly from oil and gas being produced in our State. The idea \nis to help State, local, and tribal governments pay for the public \nsector infrastructure required to develop these resources.\n  My bill also requires oil produced in the Federal waters of the \nChukchi and Beaufort Seas--for those who may not always know where \nAlaska is, it is not near the coast of California, which every map \nseems to show. It is up north near Canada and has an enormous amount of \nresources in the Arctic area, and it is called the Chukchi and Beaufort \nSeas.\n  My bill also requires oil produced in the Federal waters of the \nChukchi and Beaufort Seas to be brought ashore by pipeline. This is \nsafer than tanker transport and secures a future throughput for the \nTrans-Alaska Pipeline that feeds this country.\n  The bill provides Alaska with 37.5 percent of Federal bonus bids and \nroyalty shares from any energy development--fossil or renewable. Let me \nmake this clear: Again, when I first read this letter, they seemed to \nbe outraged by revenue sharing. As I look at it closer, it is really \nabout how they don't like offshore development. As I read it, it says \nthey don't like oil and gas.\n  Before I got here, this Congress passed revenue sharing for the Gulf \nStates, but they excluded Alaska. Even though Alaska is the farthest \naway from the lower 48, and it is one of this country's fuel sources, \nthere is no revenue stream at all--period. We have a huge impact with \nthe development of our housing, transportation, water, and sewer. We \nneed to have the capacity so these communities can support this large \ndevelopment.\n  My bill provides just what the Gulf States get--37.5 percent of the \nFederal revenues. We are not adding new taxes. We are taking what is \ncollected--- or in the future what would be collected. The 37.5 percent \nof Federal revenues would be delivered in the following way: 25 percent \nwill go to the local governments; 25 percent will go to the Alaska \nNative village and regional corporations. In some ways they are similar \nto the Indian Country in the lower 48 States but different in how they \noperate. In any event, it will provide services to Alaska Native \ncommunities. Ten percent will go directly to tribal governments, and \nthe remaining 40 percent will go to the State of Alaska to deal with \nthe impacts of this.\n  This bill also requires 15 percent of the Federal share of royalties \nbe directed to the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Why is that \nimportant? It is important because that not only touches coastal \nStates, it touches every State. Almost $900 million annually would be \ndirected for the purpose of land and water conservation throughout this \ncountry.\n  Finally, a percentage of the 37.5 percent of the Federal share would \nbe dedicated directly to deficit reduction.\n  Again, as I read the letter, they make it sound very evil. They make \nit sound like it is some monster lurking in the waters. This doesn't \nsound so evil. This is about fairness to our State and any coastal \nState that develops oil and gas off their shores.\n  Again, as I read the letter, it is clear that friends and colleagues \non my side of the aisle don't get what it means when we have this type \nof development and what type of infrastructure we have to provide to \nbalance that infrastructure and ensure the people of that State get the \nresources and the development they need--especially when we extract \nfrom our State. People come and extract from our State and use it \nelsewhere. Our State should be left with some stream of revenue.\n\n  They make a point in the letter, which this bill does address, as far \nas having 37.5 percent of these resources go to the States. The answer \nto that is simply, yes. Yes, it does. Relying on the Federal Government \nto determine what is best for these States doesn't always work out so \nwell. We are now finally doing a CR with some modifications, and I am \nglad we are.\n  After 4 years of seeing how this place operates, I will put my bet on \nState, local, and tribal governments to deliver the services we need. \nIf it means that we take money from the Federal Government and give it \nto these local communities to do the job, I am all for it.\n  As a former mayor, I know what we can do when we are given the \nresources\n\n[[Page S1681]]\n\nand how we will spend it efficiently and do what is right for the \ncommunities we represent.\n  I appreciate the moment to talk on this issue. It is frustrating to \nsee these letters. The Presiding Officer is from an energy State and \nknows what it is like when people propose their ideas for their \nStates--and never talk to us about it--or propose what we should be \nworking on. We should have communication.\n  It is frustrating to have people from my own side of the aisle say we \nare not sharing our resources with the rest of the country when we do \nshare. It is also frustrating that some of those on my side of the \naisle oppose something which makes so much sense. We need to give more \ncontrol to the local people who are extracting resources from the \ncoastline.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to speak.\n  At this time I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, shortly we will go to our respective \nparty caucuses. I understand that we are going to be joined by the \nPresident of the United States so he may share with us his insights and \nrecommendations to deal with our economy so we can get it going.\n  I know one of the issues that often comes up is the so-called \nentitlement reform. This is not the subject we are dealing with on the \nAppropriations Committee, but I would like to talk briefly about how we \ndo impact the funding of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n  I would like to take a minute to talk about Medicaid. I want to talk \nabout what Medicaid funds. Remember, Medicaid, by and large, is not in \nour Appropriations Committee. Medicaid is not in our Appropriations \nCommittee, but the people who work for Medicaid are. And that is a \ndifferent topic.\n  I want everybody to understand Medicaid because it is a subject of \ngreat debate--and often a prickly debate. Eighty percent of the \nbeneficiaries on Medicaid are children. Usually they are children of \nthe working poor. It helps them to get the health care they need for \nthe early detection of hearing problems. It may also be for a child \nwith diabetes the family is concerned about.\n  Although 80 percent of the beneficiaries are children, 80 percent of \nthe money goes to seniors or people in nursing homes or assisted-living \nhomes due to some form of neurological or cognitive impediment.\n  Now, I don't want to sound like an MD, I don't even have a Ph.D, but \nfrom talking to my constituents, I do know 80 percent of those in long-\nterm care facilities are often there due to something related to \ndementia, such as Alzheimer's or a neurological impediment such as \nParkinson's.\n  Let's talk about NIH--and, remember, NIH does funding at the Bethesda \ncampus in Maryland, and it also gives grants to brilliant researchers \nwho are usually working in academic centers of excellence. Those \ncenters could be Johns Hopkins or the University of Maryland or the \nUniversity of Alabama or Kentucky. Those grants are competitive and \npeer-reviewed.\n  Let me get to the point I am trying to make. By funding NIH and the \nNational Institutes of Aging, we are on a breakthrough trajectory for \nfinding the cognitive stretch-out for Alzheimer's.\n  I have been on this for more than 20 years because my dear father, \nwho ensured my education and looked out for me all the way through \nraising me as a young lady, died of the consequences of Alzheimer's. \nAlzheimer's is an equal opportunity catastrophe for the high and mighty \nand for the ordinary. Our own endearing President Ronald Reagan died of \nthe consequences of Alzheimer's, as did my father, ordinary people, men \nand women who helped build America.\n  So we need to make public investments in research to find the cure \nfor Alzheimer's and, if not a cure, cognitive stretchout. What do I \nmean by cognitive stretchout? It means if we have early detection, new \ntools, new MRI technology, new ways of identifying it early on, what \ncould we do to prevent memory loss? If we could do it in 3 to 5 years, \nwe would reduce the cost of Medicaid spending. If we find a cure for \nAlzheimer's alone--and I am not even talking about Lou Gehrig's disease \nor Parkinson's--we could reduce the Medicaid budget by 50 percent--5-0.\n  Nancy Reagan has spoken about it. Sandra Day O'Connor has spoken \nabout it. Barb Mikulski is speaking about it. Most of all, America \nspeaks, through the Alzheimer's Association and other groups. They \nmarch for the cure. They march for the stretchout. In that one area \nalone, we could have a dramatic impact on the lives of American \nfamilies and on the future of Federal spending in Medicaid. It would \nmeet a compelling human need. When a person has Alzheimer's, the whole \nfamily has Alzheimer's. I remember my dear mother, as my father became \nmore and more lost in his memory, had to work a 36-hour day, as the \nfamily did as well, looking out for him. We were more than willing to \ndo it.\n  I was born in the 1930s. I was a school girl in the 1940s and 1950s. \nThere wasn't much talk about educating girls. But not from my father. I \nhave two wonderful sisters. My father wanted his girls to have an \neducation. He felt that by giving us an education, he could give us \nsomething nobody would ever take away from us so we would be ready for \nwhatever life sent us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority time has expired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I have no objection but----\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Oh, I am sorry. I didn't realize----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No objection, I just need about 7 or 8 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Let me just finish this, if I might. I need just 2 \nminutes. I didn't realize the Senator from South Carolina was on the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I just want to make this point. My mother and father \nsaw to my education. My father's business burned down when I was a \nsenior in high school. My mother moved Heaven and Earth for me to go to \ncollege. When my father was stricken with the consequences of \nAlzheimer's, I was determined to move Heaven and Earth to help him. \nThere was little help available.\n  It is not just about my father. It is about mothers and fathers \neverywhere. Let's spend the money where the people want us to spend it. \nLet's meet a compelling human need now and do the research we need to \ndo to help those families and help the Federal budget in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to bring the body's attention to \na recent decision by the Obama administration to place the son-in-law \nof Osama bin Laden, Mr. Abu Ghaith--I think I am pronouncing the name \ncorrectly--into Federal district court in New York charged with \nconspiracy to kill American citizens. He has been presented to our \ncriminal justice system. He is, in my view, the classic example of an \nenemy combatant.\n  I will be, along with Senator Ayotte, writing the Attorney General \nasking for a rundown of how long he was interrogated before he was read \nhis Miranda rights. I believe this is a classic example of a person of \ngreat intelligence value who should have been held as an enemy \ncombatant at Guantanamo Bay for intelligence-gathering purposes as long \nas it took to get good intelligence. He, in my view, is a treasure \ntrove of information about not only al-Qaida but maybe things going on \nin Iran. There is an allegation of his being held in Iran for a very \nlong time as their houseguest, for lack of a better word.\n  I fear greatly we are beginning to go back to the criminal justice \nmodel that\n\n[[Page S1682]]\n\npreceded 9/11. The first time the World Trade Center was attacked, we \nhad the Blind Sheik case and the prosecutors did a wonderful job of \nprosecuting the Blind Sheik and his conspirators in Federal court. But \neverybody at that time treated al-Qaida and terrorism as a criminal \nthreat.\n  After 9/11, we changed our model. The attacks of 9/11 were viewed as \nan act of war and we authorized military force to go after al-Qaida and \naffiliates by allowing us to use the law of war model regarding al-\nQaida operatives. From 9/11 forward, we can now hold them as enemy \ncombatants.\n  Under the law of war--I have been a military lawyer for 30 years--\nthere is no Miranda right component. If a person is captured as an \nenemy prisoner, he or she is not read their rights or provided a \nlawyer. When a commander hears we have a highly valued member of the \nenemy in our custody, the first thing the commander wants to know is \nwhat intelligence have we gathered. The last thing on the commander's \nmind is where we are going to prosecute them.\n  So when we are fighting a war, the purpose of interrogating an enemy \nprisoner is to find out information about enemy activity so we can win \nthe war and protect our troops. In criminal law, the purpose is to \nconvict somebody for a crime. Under criminal law--domestic criminal \nlaw--we cannot hold someone for interrogation purposes. We can't ask \nthem about what they have been up to, what they know, and I don't \nsuggest we should. They are entitled to a lawyer and Miranda rights and \nthat is the way it should be.\n  But we are fighting a war, at least in my view we are fighting a war. \nI wish to remind the Nation--I doubt if we need a whole lot of \nreminding but every now and then apparently we do--this is the Twin \nTowers on fire, beginning to crumble from an attack on 9/11. This is \nthe Pentagon, the damage done to the Pentagon, and 300 people lost \ntheir lives there, and this is the Shanksville, PA, site of Flight 93.\n  To those who suggest we are not in a war, I could not disagree more. \nI would say the single biggest loss of life in the war on terror was \nthe first day; the very first day the war began, September 11, 2001. Do \nmy colleagues remember where they were? Do they remember their \nreaction? The first three battles in this war cost us the most lives of \nany day in the war. We have lost a lot of soldiers, and our hearts go \nout to them, but there has never been a day when Americans bled more \nthan 9/11 itself.\n  There are three battlefields in this war: New York, over 2,000 people \nkilled; the Pentagon, around 300 killed; Shanksville, PA, the entire \nmembership of that airplane was killed. To the people of flight 93: You \nfought back. You weren't fighting against a bunch of criminals. You \nfought back against a bunch of terrorists who were trying to take the \nlast airplane and crash it into this building or some other building in \nWashington. To those who died on that flight, you are the first line of \ndefense. You, above all others, were the first ones to fight back. I \nwill not let your fight go unnoticed. You were not fighting a bunch of \ncriminals. You were fighting people who are at war with us.\n\n  I wish we had understood in 1998 we were at war and not used a \ncriminal model. If we had kept the Blind Sheik in military custody, \ninterrogated him for a very long time, lawfully and humanely--because I \nbelieve that as a military lawyer--maybe we could have gotten \ninformation that would have prevented 9/11.\n  Here is why I am so upset. The person in custody in New York is the \nson-in-law of Osama bin Laden. Again, I remind my colleagues, this is \nthe bloodiest day in the war on terror. These are three battlefields \nthat cost us 2,900 lives. Over 2,900 American citizens died on the \nfirst day of the war.\n  Now, years later, we are still capturing people. The person we \ncaptured--and I congratulate all those who were involved in bringing \nthis man into our custody. This person over here to the left sitting by \nOsama bin Laden is his son-in-law. He left Kuwait in 2000 and went to \nAfghanistan. He pledged allegiance to bin Laden. He was the \nspokesperson for al-Qaida. He was one of the key guys trying to get \nother people to pledge allegiance to al-Qaida and bin Laden.\n  So in 2000 he went to Afghanistan and he joined with bin Laden and \nbecame his son-in-law. He founded a charity that was used to support \nterrorist organizations.\n  On 9/11, after the attacks, he was one of the first people to speak \nand to glorify the attacks about how they attacked our homeland. I will \nget that quote later; I don't have it with me. He said: My brothers, we \nfinally hit the homeland. We finally hit them in the heart of where \nthey live.\n  On October 10 in a video he said: Americans should know the storm of \nplanes will not stop. There are thousands of the Islamic nation's youth \nwho are eager to die, just as the Americans are eager to live.\n  All I can say is if this man was interrogated by our intelligence \nofficials and the FBI for hours, not days, before he was read his \nMiranda rights--under the law of war, we have the opportunity available \nto us to hold them indefinitely as a prisoner, an enemy combatant, a \nmember of the enemy force, and to lawfully interrogate him without a \nlawyer, without reading him his Miranda rights because we are trying to \ngather intelligence and make sure we can prevent future attacks and to \nfind out what this vicious enemy is up to. We did not take that \nopportunity.\n  This administration is refusing to use Guantanamo Bay, one of the \nbest military jails in the history of the world--very transparent, well \nrun, and it is the place he should be today, not in New York City \nawaiting trial in Federal court.\n  It is not about Federal court not being available in the war on \nterror. Article III courts have done a good job in many cases of \nprosecuting terrorists but so have military commission tribunals at \nGuantanamo Bay, where KSM, the architect of 9/11, is being prosecuted \nunder the Military Commissions Act.\n  My complaint is that this man was, within hours, read his Miranda \nrights and given a lawyer and cut off the ability of our government to \nfind out what he knew about the war on terror, current operations, and \nfuture operations. He should have been at Guantanamo Bay, interrogated \nby our military for as long as it took to find out what he knew. If the \nadministration is telling me we got all we needed from this man in 1 \nday, they are offending my intelligence. I have been a military lawyer \nfor 30 years. I understand what is going on at Guantanamo Bay, the \ninformation we have received over years. In some cases, it took months, \nif not years, to get the total picture of what a detainee knew. So if \nthe administration is telling me and the American public the time they \nhad with this man before they read him his Miranda rights was enough, \nthen they are offending my intelligence.\n  They are making a huge mistake. The decision not to treat him as an \nenemy combatant and putting him at Guantanamo Bay for interrogation \npurposes under the law of the war is one of the most serious mistakes \nwe have made since 9/11. We are beginning to criminalize the war.\n  This was not an intelligence decision or a military decision; it was \na political decision, because they will never convince me or almost \nanybody else in America that interrogating him for hours was enough. \nThe reason he was interrogated for hours and not days is that they did \nnot want to take him to Guantanamo Bay. The reason he was read his \nMiranda rights is they are pushing everybody back into the criminal \njustice system.\n  All I can say is that Guantanamo Bay has been reformed. It should be \nthe place we take people such as he, as an enemy combatant, to be \ninterrogated under the law of war, and we are using the criminal \njustice model in a way that will come back to haunt our Nation. We are \nbeginning to criminalize the war. I want my colleagues to know we are \ngoing down a very dangerous path, and I will do everything in my power \nto get this administration and future administrations back in the game \nwhen it comes to fighting a war because I believe very much, I say to \nmy colleagues, that we are in a state of war with an enemy who does not \nwear a uniform, who has no capital to conquer, no Air Force to shoot \ndown, and no Navy to sink. The only thing between them and us is our \nbrave men and women in the military and good information. This man was \ninterrogated for hours when he should have been interrogated for \nmonths.\n\n[[Page S1683]]\n\n  We are beginning to do what got us into this mess to begin with, \nlooking at al-Qaida as a group of common criminal thugs rather than the \nwarriors they are.

Madam President, seeing the press of business here, I will \nbe brief. I wanted to take the opportunity to rise and simply speak to \nthe importance of the poultry industry, something that spreads across \nthe Delmarva Peninsula and is central to the State of Maryland, State \nof Delaware, and many other States in our country.\n  With the sequester having kicked in, many of us who are from States \nthat have livestock or poultry processing are aware of the impending \nand significant negative impact on our home States and our economies, \non people's employment, and on their opportunity to continue to support \ntheir families. So I wanted to briefly speak in support of what I know \nare Senator Mikulski's tireless efforts to ensure that the 6,200 meat \nand poultry processing plants in this country do not get needlessly \nshut down.\n  In the last quarter of the last calendar year alone, 2.2 billion \nchickens and turkeys were inspected by the meat inspectors of the Food \nSafety and Inspection Service. This poultry industry, which is \nnationwide, provides vital employment to the people of Delaware, \nMaryland, and many other States.\n\n  Secretary Vilsack of the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates \nthat furloughs, if implemented, of these safety inspectors could cost \n$10 billion a year in losses and $400 million a year in lost wages just \nfor those directly employed.\n  The private sector grows and the private sector has opportunity when \nFederal inspectors are a part of the total ecosystem of poultry in this \ncountry. We raise great turkeys, we raise great chickens in this \ncountry. We have the world's leading poultry industry, but the Food \nSafety and Inspection Service is a vital part of it.\n  I commend Senator Mikulski for her tireless effort to make sure we \nfind some responsible way through the sequester to ensure it does not \nneedlessly harm and put out of work the tens of thousands of \nDelawareans and Marylanders who rely on this vital industry for their \nopportunities going forward.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, as we begin our work this afternoon, I \nwished to come to the floor to make a few comments about the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill which is now going to be included in the \namendment offered by Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby as part of an \nappropriations bill coming over from the House. This is such an \nimportant step forward, not just for the government but for the private \nsector jobs which depend on reliable, transparent, and appropriate \ngovernment spending, for the whole country. We have been in gridlock \nand stopped on our funding bills for months now. We have not been \ntalking about what makes Americans happy and prosperous--smart \ninvestments in their future and their interests.\n  We have been fighting about appropriations bills. That fight, \nhopefully, is coming to an end because of the extraordinary leadership \nof the Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, the senior Senator from \nMaryland, and the newly minted--not new to the committee, a true \nveteran of the Appropriations Committee--chairwoman of our committee. \nShe is in an able partnership with Senator Shelby of Alabama, a \nlongstanding appropriator who understands practical politics and \ncompromise is necessary to move anything of importance through this \nbody. I can't thank them and their staffs enough for salvaging several \nof these important bills.\n  They weren't able to come to an agreement on everything. I and others \nare still troubled we will not see much progress in the areas of \neducation and health, as much as we would like, but that is for another \nday. We are going to move forward on the sections we may move forward \ntogether. One of those areas is funding for homeland security, which is \na pretty big bill by Federal Government standards. It is not the \nlargest, it is not the smallest, it is $42 billion. That is not chump \nchange. It is a significant amount of money the taxpayers provide to us \nto make decisions about their security. It funds everything from Border \nPatrol and protection to Customs and Immigration.\n  It funds the Coast Guard, which is a very important part of our \noperations. We feel that directly as a coastal State in Louisiana and \nare very familiar with the needs of coastal communities. The Coast \nGuard is always there.\n  It funds a number of other entities. I do not want to fail to mention \ncyber security, which is one of the newest, most frightening threats to \nour country. This threat didn't even exist 20 years ago. You may see \nthe ever-evolving capacity of people who would do us harm: not just \ngovernments that don't like the United States, not just groups that \ndon't like the United States, but individuals who have some bone, some \nbeef, some anger, and may actually act out in unbelievable ways through \nthe Internet by attacking sensitive material and data.\n  This is not just an attack to the government functions of our \ncountry, but we have seen any number of attacks on our private \ninfrastructure. This is so critical to our existence, whether it is our \nwater systems, our financial systems, our utility systems, our \nelectricity systems. I could go on and on.\n  This is a very important responsibility for the Federal Government to \nstep up and figure out, working with the Department of Defense, \nDepartment of Commerce, and the Department of Homeland Security, which \nI chair. This is no insignificant matter.\n  On the contrary, it is not only important for us to have the right \nmoney but\n\n[[Page S1684]]\n\ninvest it in the right places. We are trying very hard to do that. This \nis why it would have been very dangerous, in my view, to have this bill \nstuck. We would be funding last year's priorities, not being able to \naccount for all the new intelligence which has come in over the last 12 \nmonths. This is an evolving, ever-growing, ever-changing threat. We \nwould have been spending taxpayer money funding last year's threats, \nnot tomorrow's threats.\n  This is why Barbara Mikulski, the chair of our committee, fought so \nhard to say we must move some of these appropriations bills forward to \nensure appropriate funding and not wasting the taxpayer money. She was \nright. She was able to negotiate with Senator Shelby a yes--not a no, \nnot a maybe but a yes--for the homeland security bill, and I could not \nbe a happier chairman.\n  I also want to thank Senator Coats, who is my able ranking member \nfrom Indiana. He worked hand-in-glove with me to put this bill \ntogether. Our staffs worked very closely together. We had a few minor \ndisagreements and views. We were able to work them out and work through \nit, obviously. This bill is here with his signature and mine on it. We \nwere able to negotiate in very good faith with our House counterparts, \nand I want to thank them.\n  Chairman Mikulski says the four corners have signed off on our \nappropriations bill, both in the House and the Senate, the Republicans \nand the Democrats. It took some give and take, but that is what we need \nto do.\n  I want to highlight a few areas in the bill people have been very \ninterested in. First, the bill includes total discretionary spending of \n$39.6 billion. As I said, $42 billion was what it was a few years ago. \nLike every committee, we have taken a cut, we have taken a reduction. \nContrary to what you might hear, we are tightening our belts and we are \ncutting into some muscle. We are cutting into some bone. It is not \neasy, but it is necessary.\n  However, there is a point where you can't keep cutting or you won't \nbe able to provide the security in the phrase homeland security. It \nwill just be homeland. There won't be a big security piece around us \nbecause we have chopped it up. When people who want to harm this \ncountry discover this, they will find the weakness.\n  I am not trying to scare up additional funding, but I am speaking the \ntruth. Do you want to secure a border? You may talk about it or you may \nactually build one. If you want a strong Customs agency, which moves \npeople through quickly but ensures no bad things come into our country, \nyou need to fund it. This does not happen on a wish and a prayer.\n  We have a flat budget. We have reorganized to accommodate what \nSenator Coats and I believe are the priorities for the Members here \nrepresenting the people. The Coast Guard, cyber security, border \nsecurity, travel facilitation I will return to in a moment.\n  For the Coast Guard, the bill includes $9 billion in discretionary \nspending, which is $400 million above the President's request. We have \ncut out some other things, but those of us on the committee believe the \nCoast Guard is important. The Coast Guard is on the front line for drug \ninterdiction, which I don't have to explain to people. It is not \nclassified information that now we have drug kingpins owning submarines \nwhich bring drugs into the United States. People read about this. It is \ntrue. It is not science fiction. We need to make certain the Coast \nGuard has access to stop drugs from coming into our country in smart, \naggressive ways, working in partnership with other governments.\n  I don't have to remind everyone about the oilspill, the terrible \naccident. That trial is still going on in New Orleans as I speak, with \nhundreds of lawyers still debating the worst oilspill in the history of \nthe country. Who showed up? The Coast Guard. They have to have all \nsorts of equipment to be able to respond for drug interdiction, which \nis different than an oilspill cleanup; and, of course, people are \nrescued literally every day by the brave men and women of the Coast \nGuard who risk their lives to keep our commerce and our recreational \nboating moving throughout this Nation.\n  We have $557 million for production of the sixth national security \ncutter. Let me say something about this that people don't understand. I \nsee my good friend Dick Shelby, and he most certainly understands this \nas a Senator from Alabama, but I want people who are not on our \nAppropriations Committee to understand something. When most people in \nAmerica buy a big item, such as a house or even when they send their \nkids to college, they finance that. They take that big hit, such as a \n$40,000 loan to send their child to college for 1 year or $120,000 or \n$160,000 for 4 years, if they are going to a very fancy, expensive \nschool. Happily, for some of us, at LSU we get a great bargain and a \ngreat education for $10,000. But for some families even $10,000 for 4 \nyears is a lot of money. They do not pay cash for that. They finance \nthat. The Senator from Alabama knows this.\n  Under the rules in Washington, we cannot finance most things. People \ndon't understand this. We have to pay cash. So because we need that \nnational security cutter, I had to find $557 million in our budget to \npay for it this year, even though it takes a long time to build it.\n  I think this should be changed. Senator Snowe, who was the chair of \nthis Committee on Defense, Navy, for many years, thought it needed to \nbe changed, but it has not changed as yet. I want people to know the \npressures we are under in this bill, because sometimes when we have to \nfund these big items in one year, basically, we have to pay cash.\n  Now, yes, ultimately this money is being borrowed through the general \nfund--and I don't want to get into a technical argument--but as far as \nwe are concerned, we are paying cash for it in our budget--$557 million \nthis year for the national security cutter.\n  We are also funding $77 million for long lead time, $335 million for \nsix new fast response cutters, $90 million for a new C-130 J aircraft, \nand I have invested, at my priority, $10 million for military housing \nfor the Coast Guard.\n  The Army, the Navy, the Air Force have been upgrading their housing. \nThe poor Coast Guard, because they are smaller and they are more \nisolated, is not in areas where we can take advantage of that public-\nprivate partnership that is working so well. I think our Coast Guard \nfamilies need some support, and I was able to find some funding there \nfor them.\n  I don't need to take much more time. I don't know if the Senator from \nAlabama is here to speak, but I will take 5 more minutes, and if he \nneeds me to cease, I will.\n  But I want to also point out that we put some investments in the bill \nto address the cyber threat, which the President has described, and I \nagree with him, as one of the most serious economic and national \nsecurity challenges we face as a nation. This bill includes $757 \nmillion, which is $313 million above last year, and I was happy to do \nthat. I think this is a priority. We have moved other items around in \nthe budget because this is a real threat, it is evolving every day, and \nwe have to have the research and technology to address it and work with \nthe private sector to see what we can do to keep their network safe and \nour government strong.\n  The bill includes $7 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund. This was \nalso a battle we fought. The money is in there for Sandy, for Isaac, \nfor Irene, for Ike, for Gustav, for Rita and Katrina and there are a \nfew other storms that are, even after 6 or 7 years, still open. So this \nis money there for them to finish their recovery.\n  In science and technology, the bill includes $835 million, a 25-\npercent increase. I want to say one other thing, and I think Senator \nShelby will agree with me, that people don't understand how important \nit is that the Federal Government invests in research and development. \nYes, private companies do invest in research and development, but some \nof the investment we do is truly so farfetched that no one in their \nright mind would invest in it because there is no immediate return. Yet \nwe have seen, time and time again, when the Federal Government steps up \nand makes those long-term investments in research, what happens--\nsomething is discovered. The Internet was a good example of research \nthrough the Department of Defense, and I could give other examples. But \nsoon enough, the private sector realizes, oh my gosh, this research is \nbreakthrough--such as that which came from our research in health on \nour DNA and all the new and exciting technologies in health.\n\n[[Page S1685]]\n\n  I can tell you our State is benefiting a great deal from the research \ndone 20 years ago on fracking. That wasn't done by Exxon or Mobil, it \nwas done by the Federal labs out West because of research money in one \nof our bills. I am not sure which bill it was, but potentially in \nenergy, and that is what is leading to the revolution in natural gas. \nAs to this baloney that the Federal Government doesn't have to invest \nin research and technology, we do it in partnership with the private \nsector, and it is the best system in the world. We would be \nshortchanging ourselves and our future economic growth if we didn't \ncontinue it.\n  Finally, just one more word about another priority. I have put some \nadditional funding by moving some things around for Customs and \nImmigration and for TSA. I am not the only Senator who represents a \nState that depends, in large part, on the hospitality tourism and \ntrade. I could list many States in our country that do as well, but let \nme tell you about Louisiana. We believe in hospitality. We believe it \nis a good business. We enjoy having people come to our State. They \ncome, and we all have a great deal of fun and excitement with our \nfestivals and our fairs. But at the end of the day, we make money and \nwe create jobs and it is an important industry. I am alarmed at the \nfallout of international travel to the United States since 9/11. It has \nonly increased by about 1 percent.\n  To put that into perspective--and I believe this number is correct, \nbut I will check it for the record--as the Senator from Alabama knows, \ninternational travel in the world has increased by something like 400 \npercent. So people are going to China, they are going to Korea. There \nis a growing middle class, and what middle-class people do, besides buy \nhomes and send their kids to school, is travel. It is a middle-class \nthing. We now have more middle-class people in the world than ever, but \nthey are not coming to the United States because we are not investing \nin the kinds of infrastructure in our airports and ports that provide a \nsafe but pleasant environment. So I am working very closely with the \nInternational Travel Association--and I want to thank them publicly for \nthe work they are doing--because I am one Senator who believes in this. \nI think the President has also said that international travel means \njobs for Americans right here at home. It is something they cannot \ntransport.\n  For border security, the bill maintains the legislatively mandated \nstaffing floor of 21,370 border patrol agents and provides $76 million \nabove the request for Border Patrol staffing within customs and border \nprotection.\n  Similarly, the bill provides $240 million above the request for \nmaintaining current staffing levels of frontline CBP officers at our \nland, air, and sea ports of entry. The fiscal year 2013 budget request \nfor CBP submitted to Congress over 1 year ago resulted in an overall \nfunding shortfall of more than $320 million. This bill fills the vast \nmajority of that shortfall through internal savings and reductions in \nother, lower priority areas. CBP will continue to face challenges in \nmeeting its staffing requirements and I am committed to helping this \nimportant agency fulfill its critical missions.\n  The bill includes $1.46 billion for first responders grants, an \nincrease of $200 million above fiscal year 2012. These grants ensure \nour frontline responders are trained and equipped for catastrophic \ndisasters. Recent examples of grant investments that supported disaster \nresponse are: communications assets, search and rescue units, \ngenerators, and medical equipment used during the 2011 tornadoes in \nArkansas, Alabama, and Missouri; joint operations centers, rescue \nboats, and hazardous materials equipment used during Hurricane Sandy in \nNew York, New Jersey, and Connecticut; and cutting-edge mobile vehicle \nradios and an upgraded 911 call center used during Hurricane Sandy in \nMaryland.\n  While the response to more frequent severe disasters has improved, \nthe funding in this bill will help address remaining gaps in \npreparedness. For instance, the recent National Preparedness Report \nfound that State and local governments are less than halfway to \nachieving needed recovery capabilities and defending against the \ngrowing cybersecurity threat.\n  Finally, in an effort to maximize resources for frontline missions, \nthe bill approves the request to eliminate $800 million in \nadministrative costs and rescinds $307 million in unobligated balances \nassociated with low-priority programs. The bill also requires 30 \nexpenditure plans to ensure oversight of taxpayer dollars.\n  I would like to conclude by emphasizing my concern with the impact \nsequester will have on the Department of Homeland Security. Despite the \nsmart investments that are made in this bill, the problem of sequester \nremains.\n  The Secretary of Homeland Security has testified before the \nAppropriations Committee that these automatic budget reductions will be \ndisruptive and destructive to our Nation's security and economy.\n  At our busiest airports, peak wait times could grow to over 4 hours \nor more during the summer travel season. Such delays would affect air \ntravel significantly, potentially causing thousands of passengers to \nmiss flights with economic consequences at the local, national, and \ninternational levels. New flights that bring in hundreds of millions of \ndollars to the U.S. economy would be delayed or potentially denied due \nto reduced staffing.\n  Sequestration will also impact our Nation's land borders. For \nexample, daily peak wait times at the El Paso Bridge of the Americas \ncould increase from 1 hour to over 3 hours.\n  The Coast Guard will have to reduce operations by up to 25 percent \nimpacting drug and migrant interdiction efforts.\n  The sequester will impact our ability to detect and analyze emerging \ncyber threats and protect civilian federal computer networks, and\n  FEMA will delay implementing critical reforms to improve disaster \nresponse and recovery.\n  The Border Patrol workforce could be reduced by 5,000.\n  I urge Senators to work together on a bipartisan basis to repeal this \nill-conceived sequester and approve legislation that includes balanced \ndeficit reduction.\n  I again want to thank the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Mikulski; the vice chair, Senator Shelby; and the ranking \nmember on the Homeland Security Subcommittee, Senator Coats for their \nhard work in including the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill for \nfiscal year 2013 in this essential legislation to fund the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I am very happy to speak about this bill, but I do see the leaders \nare on the floor--the chairman and the ranking member--and I want to \npersonally thank them both for bringing our appropriations bills to the \nfloor. I have spoken about homeland security, but there are other bills \nthat need to be talked about this afternoon. I am happy we could work \nout this agreement with my Republican counterparts, and, again, I thank \nthe chairman and the ranking member for their extraordinary leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I just want to follow up on some of the \ncomments the Senator from Louisiana has made--very positive comments \nabout research and the role of the Federal Government in all aspects of \nresearch. She is a very hard-working member of the Appropriations \nCommittee and she has been involved in a lot of this.\n  Whether it is research on health issues--the National Institutes of \nHealth on cancer or you name it--information technology, energy, which \nthe Senator from Louisiana referenced--there are so many good things \nthat come out of this, and I believe, overall, the Senate and the \nHouse, on both sides of the aisle, realized this. But with all the \nbreakthroughs in information technology we have had, we have only to go \nback to the research and development the Federal Government did that \nbasically brought us our Internet to realize that didn't just happen. \nIt was built over many years, with many ideas and research. Look at it \ntoday. We have all benefited from this overall.\n  There are threats to this information technology, in everything we \nuse today dealing with energy; for example, our power grid, because a \nlot of that, as we all know, is computer driven and operated, our \nbanking system's information technology, our military, our traffic\n\n[[Page S1686]]\n\ncontrol systems we rely on every day, and I am sure our trains and \nother vehicles we run. There are threats to this today. A lot of us \nknow it as cyber security threats, and they are real.\n  So as we do research in this area, as we continue our research, we \ncannot forget that. That is a job we all have to work together on, and \nI believe, on the Appropriations Committee, this is a good start today \nfor challenges in our future to the security of our information \nsystems--our grid, our banking system, our Federal Reserve, and I can \ngo on and on because it affects everything in our everyday life, and we \nshouldn't forget it.\n  I think we are off to a good start today. Senator Mikulski, the chair \nof the committee, and I believe this is the first time in a few years \nwe have come to the floor trying to work together on appropriations, \nand we are determined to make this regular order work. I believe the \nmajority of the Senators on my side of the aisle--the Republicans--and \nthose on the Democratic side of the aisle will, in a few days, bring \nthis to a head and we will do something good for the American people \nand bring forth some certainty and some good legislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, other Senators on the Appropriations \nCommittee--and all are welcome to come and comment, but those on the \nAppropriations Committee actually assigned to do the work will be \ncoming throughout the afternoon to actually describe the content of the \nbill. I would like to talk about the content.\n  We on Appropriations have 12 subcommittees. Of those 12 \nsubcommittees, each has a chair and a ranking member from the other \nparty. The reason I am telling you this is to describe what it takes to \ndo a bill.\n  So through all of last week, after we got the guidance of our caucus, \nthe guidance of the authorizing committee, the guidance from the \nleadership, we began to put a bill together. It is not easy. My own \nstaff and Senator Shelby's staff worked through that first snowstorm we \nhad, took computers home and worked all day and through the evening. I \nwas back and forth. We wanted to make sure there was no fog in our \nbill. And then out of that the subcommittees gave recommendations.\n  The reason I say that is that took us to Thursday. We didn't \ncomplete, from our end, the framework and substance of the bill until \nSaturday. That means me, the Democratic majority--the majority party \nhas the responsibility of putting the bill together, but this is not a \none-woman show here. So after we did, we gave it to our counterparts, \nwho have been in consultation on broad principles, negotiations between \nthe subcommittees, consultation with the authorizing committees on \npolicy, where we are heading.\n  Then when we got it to Senator Shelby and his staff, they had to \nexercise their due diligence. We wanted them to do the due diligence. \nWe wanted them to look through every aspect of that bill to make sure \nwith our word of honor, which we have had together for more than 25 \nyears, that there were no hidden agreements, that there were no \nsurprises parachuted in that if we woke up, neither would be happy \nabout.\n  I must compliment Senator Shelby and his staff. They worked through \nthe weekend doing every line item to make sure, when they gave Senator \nMcConnell and the Republican caucus their best assessment, they had a \nchance to look at every single line item, and they sure did it, and \nthey worked hard.\n  So there are those who would say: We would have liked to have had the \nbill sooner. We would have liked to have been able to get the bill \nsooner. But we are talking about the funding for the entire United \nStates of America. That is a lot of lines and that is a lot of items \nthat had to be gone through methodically, diligently, and meticulously, \nand we moved as expeditiously as we could.\n  So we then had our bill, and I really wanted to share it with the \nHouse. I think we have been working with the House in a very \nconstructive way, communicating, but it took until very late yesterday \nafternoon for us to complete our process as members of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  I would have really loved getting this bill to the floor and filing \nthis bill sooner, but in order to do it right, and not only the right \ncontent but the right way, to make sure the appropriate committees were \nable to exercise their due diligence, their vigilance, their scrutiny, \nwe now present a bill to the entire Senate.\n  So I hope we can move forward on our legislation. We want Members to \ntake a look at it. We hope we can work on amendments this afternoon. I \nhope we have permission to go to our bill. We have two great amendments \nlined up--different philosophies, but that is what it is.\n  I talked to Senator Ayotte on the floor a couple of weeks ago during \nsequester. Bring up the amendments. We have an amendment by Senator \nHarkin on the Labor-HHS content, and we have an amendment to be offered \non President Obama's health care bill. There is a Senator who would \nlike to have the full Senate decide whether we should defund it. This \nis an important national debate. Let it come on out. The only way we \ncan get to that is by letting us go to the bill.\n  We have an arcane procedure in the Senate called a motion to proceed. \nIn order to be able to vote, we have to get permission to proceed. I \nwant to get to amendments. I want to have a real debate on real issues. \nWhere are we on Labor-HHS? What is the Senate's full view on the \nfunding of ObamaCare? Let's get out there, and instead of fussing over \nprocedure, let's get to real content. Let's talk about the real issues \naround funding and what we should be doing to pass the continuing \nresolution to keep America's funding going but where the majority rules \nand we have our bill.\n  So let's get to the situation where we can move through the bill, \nwhere we can offer amendments. Regardless of how you feel about \namendments, we all feel Senators have the right to offer amendments. \nLet's get to it. Let's get the job done. Let's show we can function as \nthe greatest parliamentary body in the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am somewhat amazed and stunned. You would \nthink that someone who is given an answer to the question--yes--should \npretty much be satisfied.\n  We have been trying to keep the government from shutting down. I \nappreciate the work done by the Speaker. I didn't agree with his bill, \nbut I appreciate what he did, and he did it in a timely fashion.\n  The chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Mikulski, has \nbeen negotiating with her Republican counterpart, Richard Shelby, for \ndays now. They worked all weekend, late into Sunday night, and they \nworked out a bipartisan agreement. They offered the amendment here. Now \nwe hear from a couple of Senators: Let's not take up the bill. They \nneed more time.\n  I thought people wanted to have an open amendment process on this \nbill. Offer amendments. Now it appears that the day is gone. I guess we \nwon't be able to offer amendments today. I have said all along that we \nwould turn to it as soon as possible. Our Republican colleagues said \nthey want to see the first amendment that was to be offered. They saw \nthat. They were originally given to certain people in the leadership \noffice on Saturday about noon, and there has been every effort to work \ntogether on this matter. They wanted to see the first amendment that \nwill be offered. I have indicated that was done; they saw it. There \nwere negotiations to get to where that is. But now Senators want to \nprevent us from going to the bill. Remember, if I file cloture today, \nthe earliest we can have the vote is Thursday.\n  We are going to finish this CR, and we are going to finish the budget \nbefore there will be an Easter recess. That is a fact. So everyone \nshould understand that delaying on this--because they want to read the \nbill more deeply, I guess--doesn't really make a lot of sense.\n\n[[Page S1687]]\n\n  We are going to do the budget resolution. I have made that clear, and \nI emphasize that now. And the Republicans have been talking about--even \nthough it is basically without foundation--that we haven't had a budget \nresolution. We haven't needed one. We had one that was not a \nresolution, it was a law that set the standards for what we would do \nwith our budget. It set ceilings on how much we would spend. As a \nresult of that, we were able to get the funding for our subcommittees \nand appropriations. But they want a budget resolution, which isn't as \ngood as law, and we are going to do everything we can to get that done.\n  So if Republicans object to allowing the Senate to be in \nconsideration of a bill negotiated with Republicans, then the only \npeople who will be disadvantaged are other Republicans who want to be \nable to offer amendments.\n  So I regret that again we have come to this. Just when you think it \ncan't get worse, it gets worse. There are things we have to do. The CR \nis one of those. If it means cutting into the April recess--we have 2 \nweeks to do a lot of things people have planned for some time--then \nthat is what we will need to do. But I am stunned.\n  I learned about this when we had the President at our caucus. I \nreally am flabbergasted that here we are on the eve of doing something \ntogether, regular order, but regular order around here is stopping \nevery bill from going on the floor. That is what the regular order is \nhere. I thought we had some kind of an agreement at the beginning of \nthis Congress that this wasn't going to go on anymore. We had that 2 \nyears ago. We changed the rules here a little bit.\n  There is going to be tremendous angst within my caucus and I think \nthe country to continue trying to legislate with the burdens that we \nbear, that just one or two people do everything they can to throw a \nmonkey wrench into everything we do. As a country, we are being looked \nat as being inoperable. It is too bad. It is not good for this \ninstitution, and it is really not good for the country.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, if people are watching us on C-SPAN--and \nthey do, in our own country and around the world--they will say: Well, \nit is Tuesday afternoon, 3:30. What is happening in the Senate? We see \ntwo Senators--able, seasoned, experienced. Where is the debate? Where \nare the amendments? Where is the clash of ideas in an open and public \nforum on what is best?\n  We are not doing that because we have arcane rules that Senators can \nput what they call a hold on a bill so we cannot proceed. In the old \ndays that was a good idea; you placed a hold. This goes back to \nstagecoach days. You are an Indiana man, you understand that, I say to \nthe Chair respectfully. But it was so you could get back. You would put \na hold on a bill if you believed I offered legislation that could hurt \nIndiana, and in your stagecoach you could dash back here.\n  We don't have stagecoaches anymore. In fact, we are all right here. I \nwould like to be able to move this bill. There are those Senators who \nwant more time. They could actually be looking at the bill if they \nwould let us go this afternoon, because we have two amendments that \nwould take us to 5 or 6--well, gosh now--until this evening. But we \nwould get two amendments done on two pretty big topics, one of which \nshould be, are we or are we not going to fund the President's health \ncare initiative?\n  We need to move this bill. What is it that Senator Shelby and I are \ntrying to do? We are trying to pass a continuing resolution to fully \nfund the Federal Government with the scrutiny and oversight of the \nCongress by October 1. Right now we have the CR, as it is called, the \nfunding. The continued funding expires March 27. Some people might say \nthat is 15 days from now. Not really because we have to pass our bill, \nwe have to go to the House, and then we have to have a bill signed by \nthe President. We would like to do that before the Easter-Passover \nrecess, for which we break next week. We would really like to do it.\n  I know one of my colleagues is on the Senate floor. I recognize the \nright for Senators to review and scrutinize a bill. I have done it \nmyself. I respect that.\n  In the days when we were skeptical and even suspicious of one \nanother, you wanted to look at it to make sure there were no cheap \ngimmicks, no little fast hand motions, no earmarks parachuted in. But I \ncan say this: After the Democrats finished the bill, we gave it to \nSenator Shelby and his staff. This bill has been very much scrutinized \nso that any of those tricks of the old days are not here.\n  I really need everybody's attention. There is a lot of conversation \ngoing on.\n  What I want to say is this: If anyone spots something they think is a \ncute gimmick, I would sure like to know about it. I recognize the \nSenators' rights, but I ask them if we could at least proceed to the \nbill where, while we debate these two big amendments, we would do it.\n  Would I have liked to have made it available 72 hours ago? The answer \nis, yes. But given the magnitude of what we did and the due diligence \nnecessary by the Republicans, it was physically and intellectually \nimpossible, not with the scrutiny and oversight not done until \nyesterday. When we get back to regular order it will be better. But I \nfeel like I have multiple decks I have been dealt: a real deck, a \npinochle deck, a poker deck, and so on.\n  I am making a plea that we go to our bill, recognizing the Senators \nshould scrutinize the bills and recognizing Senators' rights to offer \namendments. That is simply my plea. Some of my colleagues are on the \nSenate floor, and I will be happy to engage in a conversation with \nthem, two of whom I have enormous respect for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first, I want to tell the chairwoman of \nthe Appropriations Committee that I actually very much appreciate her \nwork. I actually trust her to do the right thing. But we got this bill \nlast night at 9 o'clock. It is a 500-page bill. It has multiple levels \nof authorizations in it that we found so far--authorization on an \nappropriations bill. It has what I would consider--and we haven't been \ncompletely through it--some things that are totally counterintuitive to \nwhere we find ourselves today in terms of spending money.\n  Before I could grant a unanimous consent--and I will; as soon as we \nget through with the bill I plan on granting unanimous consent. But I \nwant to know, we just heard the majority leader say he can't understand \nwhy somebody wants to read this bill. We are talking about in excess of \n$1 trillion. That is one of the problems, one of the reasons we are $17 \ntrillion in debt. It is because people don't read the bills.\n  I also want to say to my friend from Alabama, I have the greatest \npraise for him. He knows some of the heartburn we have on this, but we \nknew that was coming from the House. But to not allow us the time to \nassess what you have produced by being able to read and study the bill \nis going against the best traditions of the Senate. It is also going \nagainst common sense.\n  How do we know whether we want to offer amendments unless we have \nbeen able to read the bill? Are we just to blindly say: Whatever you \nwant to do we are going to approve it because we have a deadline at the \nend of this month?\n  I am willing to do whatever is necessary to make sure we get a \ncontinuing resolution, but I am not willing to do that blindly. I am \ngoing to study this bill. We have three Members' staff working on this \nfull time. They have been working since last night. They are \ninvestigating and looking at this bill. I will not go into the details \nof the things we have seen so far, but we ought to at least have the \nopportunity before we rush into granting unanimous consent to go \nforward.\n  I plan to allow unanimous consent, but I will not do so until I know \nwhat the agreement is going to be in terms of amendments. Even if we \nread the bill and have some good ideas, we don't know whether we are \ngoing to be able to offer any. This is an appropriations\n\n[[Page S1688]]\n\nbill. We ought to be able to offer amendments with our ideas on ways to \nsave this country money, increase its efficiency, increase its \neffectiveness, and still meet the deadline that the chairwoman \noutlined.\n  I hope the Senator understands why we are not in a mood to grant it \nuntil we actually know what we are talking about. To ask anything less \nof us would be asking us to deny the very oath we took when we came \nhere.\n  With that, I yield the floor and thank my colleague John McCain for \nbeing here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, along with the Senator from Oklahoma, I \nintend to object. I think the Senator made the case. I will remind my \ncolleagues that 1 week ago Senator Coburn and I sent a letter to \nSenator Reid and Senator McConnell with copies to Senator Mikulski and \nSenator Shelby.\n  We stated in one sentence:\n\n       We write to inform you of our intention to object to \n     entering into a time agreement before consideration of a \n     continuing resolution until we have had at least 72 hours to \n     review its contents.\n\n  That is what we wrote. That is what we asked for.\n  I will remind my colleagues again, it is a 587-page bill of over $1 \ntrillion that we got at 9 p.m. last night. Is there anyone who has had \ntime to read this entire bill that is 587 pages long? We are talking \nabout $1 trillion, and we are holding up the Senate? We have had since \n9 p.m. last night until 3:30 p.m. this afternoon to examine a 587-page \nbill of over $1 trillion.\n  What we have already found--and we have not finished, but we hope to \nbe finished with examining this legislation within a few hours--is the \nmost egregious pork-barrel spending during a time of sequestration. I \nfind it mind-boggling. We spent 3 weeks in December on the floor of \nthis Senate doing the fiscal year 2013 Defense authorization bill. \nThere are provisions in this CR that were directly prohibited in the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  I respect the knowledge of the Senator from Alabama and the Senator \nfrom Maryland on defense issues, but we spent 3 weeks and hundreds of \nhours in hearings including amendments and markup. For example, we said \nthere would be no money for Guam until we have a coherent strategy laid \nout by the administration as to how we were going to implement the base \nrealignment. The fiscal year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act \nprohibited expending that money.\n  What have they crammed into this 587-page bill? There is $120 million \nfor a public regional health laboratory and civilian wastewater \nimprovements in Guam. Why? I ask my friend from Alabama: Why does this \ndirectly contradict the authorization bill which was just passed that \nsaid no money would be given to Guam for these purposes until such time \nas we had developed the strategy for the base realignment in Guam? Is \nit because the Senator from Alabama and the Senator from Maryland know \nsomething more than the Defense authorization bill authorizers did? We \nhad debate, discussion, and authorization of this, and we specifically \nprohibited it.\n  So here we are. We have not been able to deploy an aircraft carrier \nbecause of sequestration. We have had to cut down on flying hours. We \nhave had to reduce maintenance. We have had to make all kinds of tough \ndecisions as to the men and women who are serving, not to mention the \nequipment, operations, and maintenance.\n  What have we already found out in this bill? I want to assure my \ncolleagues I am not making this up. There is an additional $5 million \nfor the National Guard Youth Challenge program. I think the National \nGuard Youth Challenge Program is a pretty worthwhile project, but is it \nworthwhile when we are having to keep a carrier from deployment? There \nis $5 million for the National Guard STARBASE Youth Program; another \n$154 million for the Army, Navy, and Air Force ``alternative energy \nresearch initiatives.'' This type of research has developed such \nshining examples as the Department of Navy's purchase of 450,000 \ngallons of alternative fuel for $12 million, which is over $26 per \ngallon.\n  There is $18 million for unspecified ``industrial preparedness,'' $16 \nmillion for Parkinson's disease research. That part is out of Defense, \nmy friends. That is not out of Health and Human Services; it is out of \nDefense. There is $16 million for neurofibromatosis research, $16 \nmillion for HIV-AIDS research, which is a worthy cause, but it is taken \nout of Defense. There is $9 million for unspecified radar research, \n$567 million for unrequested medical research, $20 million for \nuniversity research initiatives, and $7 million for the Civil Air \nPatrol program increase.\n  The list goes on and on, and we have not finished. How in the world \ndo we have a provision ``for an incentive program that directs the \nDepartment of Defense to overpay on contracts by an additional 5 \npercent if the contractor is a Native Hawaiian-owned company,'' how in \nthe world is this justified during this time of sequestration?\n  I note the presence of our leader on the floor, and I want to assure \nthe leader, with all due respect, that this is a 587-page bill of over \n$1 trillion. We got it at 9 p.m. last night. I hope that in a few hours \nwe will be able to finish examining this bill. What we have found so \nfar is so egregious it is hard to imagine that anybody--in light of the \nsequestration and the damage it does to the lives of the men and women \nwho are serving the military--could have added these kinds of \nprovisions and, frankly, is beyond anything I think I have ever seen in \nthe years I have served in the Senate.\n\n  I yield to the distinguished majority leader, but before I do, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Object to what?\n  Mr. President, through the Chair to my friend from Arizona, this is a \n587-page bill that has been available to the public because the vast \nmajority of this bill is identical to what the House already passed--\nidentical. He, along with his staff and the Senator from Oklahoma, have \nhad days and days to look this over.\n  I want to make sure everyone understands I can only do so much. I try \nnot to be too sensitive, but the Senator from Oklahoma seems to have a \nproblem--I assume he was referring to me or perhaps he was referring to \nSenators Durbin, Schumer, and Murray. Here is what he said on one of \nthe Sunday shows:\n\n       ``The Senate's not nearly as dysfunctional as it is made \n     out to be . . . '' said Coburn. ``Our problem in the Senate \n     is the leadership in the Senate.''\n\n  I don't know if he is referring to Senator McConnell, I don't know \nwhom he is referring to, but one day he should look in the mirror.\n  I want to try and get along here. The vast majority of the stuff that \nis in this bill came from the House of Representatives. It has been \navailable for days. I cannot remember what day we received this. I \nthink it was last Wednesday or thereabouts, so it has been many days.\n  I know Senator McCain very well. He and I came to the House and the \nSenate together. I understand how he feels about these issues. I don't \nblame him for being upset about some of the things in this bill, but it \nis not our fault. We are trying to get a bill to fund the government, \nand what we need to do is get on the bill.\n  I am criticized for not allowing amendments to be offered. We cannot \nhave amendments offered until we get on the bill. I think it would be \nmuch better if we could get on the bill. If people want to offer \namendments, it is kind of jump ball here. We have 100 Senators, and a \nfew of them want to offer amendments. We cannot dictate what amendments \nwill be offered before we even get on the bill.\n  I hope my friend from Arizona will take some time with the staff and \nlook the bill over--it has been around since last Wednesday or \nthereabouts--so we can get on the bill. The time is being wasted. We \nhave to finish this and the budget before we leave for Easter vacation.\n  We can do the bill this week, next week or the week after that. We \nhave to get this done. I am not trying to fight with anybody, but as I \nsaid, I do have some sensitivities about my friend from Oklahoma \ncontinually berating the leadership in the Senate. I have come to the \nrationalization that maybe he is talking about his own leadership. I \ndon't know.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask through the Chair if my friend would yield for a \nquestion.\n\n[[Page S1689]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Mr. McCAIN. First of all, I appreciate very much the majority \nleader's responsibility to make sure we take up and pass legislation. \nThere are many times when I have to say that the majority leader has \nbeen frustrated by some events and individuals which arouses my \nsympathy for the responsibility he has and his inability to carry out \nhis duties.\n  I point out to my friend from Nevada that we just got this bill last \nnight, so to rely on the fact that a House bill should be our guide \nwhen we know there were many provisions added--at least some provisions \nthat were added that we already found in the Senate version of the \nbill--I would hope he would understand we need a little more time to \ntry to get through the entire bill, which I hope will be sooner rather \nthan later. Once that is done, then we can--as the majority leader \nsaid--be open for amendments.\n  I hope the majority leader understands our point of view, that this \nis bill over $1 trillion with 587 pages. For us to take sort of an act \nof faith that this is the bill that came from the House is obviously \nnot the case.\n  Mr. REID. If my friend would yield-- Mr. McCAIN. I appreciate the \nmajority leader's responsibilities, and I appreciate his frustration. I \nhope he will understand ours and we will try to move this as quickly as \npossible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. For many years and decades Senator McCain has been a \nwatchdog of what goes on with spending in this country. I expect that \nfrom him, so I don't say that in a negative fashion. I don't have a \nproblem with Senator McCain looking over this legislation so he feels \ncomfortable with moving on to it, and then if he has amendments to \noffer, we can move on amendments. I have no complaint about John \nMcCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me thank the Senators from Maryland \nand Alabama for their leadership on this bill. I might say to my \nfriend, the Senator from Arizona, that I have a new assignment in the \nAppropriations Committee following the departure and passing of our \ngreat friend Senator Danny Inouye. I am trying my best to make sure we \nare doing our best on national defense, which I know is near and dear \nto the Senator from Arizona.\n  There was an extraordinary effort made in the House to accommodate \nthe Department of Defense in the continuing resolution as well as \naccommodating military construction and veterans. I think it is a good \nbill. It comes over to us with provisions that will be helpful with \nsome of the problems and challenges they will face.\n  What these Senators have tried to do is to add several other areas of \nagreement in the appropriations process. If I am not mistaken, most \neverything they have added has been subject to debate within the \nsubcommittee and full committee. So there is no attempt here to conceal \nanything, and we knew full well that the watchful eye of the Senator \nfrom Arizona and his friends would be applied to this bill.\n  I think what we were trying to achieve today is to start the \namendment process--not to close it down but start the amendment \nprocess. That would give Members who want to come forward with an \namendment the time to offer those amendments and others the time to \nreview this legislation closely. I think that was our goal, only to \nhave this shut down now, where no amendments can be taken up or \nconsidered. Without foreclosing the Senator from Arizona or the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, wouldn't it be a healthier situation for us to be \nactively considering amendments of Members who know what they wish to \noffer at this point?\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The point of the Senator from Illinois is very well made, \nbut unless we know the entirety of the bill, we don't know what our \npriorities are as far as amendments are concerned. I am sure the \nSenator knows that even though amendments are going to be allowed, \nthere is going to be a limited number of amendments. We know how things \nwork around this place come Thursday afternoon.\n  All we are asking is to give us a little more time. It was 9 o'clock \nlast night when we received the final version of the bill.\n  I would say to my friend from Illinois, unless we know what is in the \nbill in its entirety, it is hard for us to know what the priority \namendments we intend on proposing are. I think we are nearly through \nthe examination of the bill. I do not wish to impede the progress of \nthe Senate on this legislation. I know how important it is.\n  I also hope my friend will understand that we asked a week ago to \nhave 72 hours, which is the normal Senate procedure, to examine the \nbill before we consider it. I understand the exigencies of the moment--\nall the back and forth between both sides of the Capitol--but I don't \nbelieve, for a $1 trillion bill, 587 pages, it is too much to ask for \nabout 12 hours, or 14 hours, 15 hours--we have our staff working full \ntime, and I wish to assure the Senator we will have it done soon.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I might engage further in this \ndialogue, I see the Chair is seeking recognition. But there are \nSenators on both sides who have amendments ready to go. They have ideas \nthey wish to present to the Senate for consideration. Without \nforeclosing the Senator from Arizona and his colleagues of the \npossibilities to offer amendments tomorrow or whenever they are \nprepared to, I don't know why we want to shut down this deliberation \ntoday. We can consider some of these amendments and still not in any \nway prejudice the rights of Senators to review the bill and offer \namendments of their choice.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Look, my dear friend, every Senator has their \nresponsibilities in this body. I have a responsibility particularly \nwhere defense is concerned. We spent 3 weeks on this legislation, \nincluding hundreds of amendments, hours and hours of debate, markup in \nthe committee of hours and hours, hundreds of hours of hearings by the \nleaders of our military and the administration. I haven't finished \nexamining the defense part of this bill.\n  Now, why am I so worried about the provisions of this bill? Because \nthere are provisions in this bill that directly contradict the Defense \nauthorization we spent weeks on. We prohibited money for Guam, OK? We \nprohibited it. Now there is $120 million in the bill for it. So that \nmakes me curious as to what else is in this bill.\n  So I think for me to go back and tell my constituents in Arizona, who \nare heavily dependent on our national defense and our bases, to say, \nYes, I went ahead without even reading the whole bill, without even my \nstaff going through the entire bill; we were in such a hurry with our \nover $1 trillion legislation that they didn't want me to hold up the \nSenate so people could propose amendments--that is not my duty to the \ncitizens of Arizona.\n  So I say with respect to my friend, I respect the rights of all other \nSenators. I hope the rights of the Senator from Oklahoma and my rights \nwould be respected and that includes reading a piece of legislation \nthat is 587 pages long.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I might respond to the Senator, the Department of \nDefense Appropriations Act for 2013 provides $604.9 billion, including \n$87.2 billion for overseas contingency operations. That is a reduction \nfrom the 2012 level of $633.2 billion.\n  There are no changes in the defense section of this bill. There are \nno changes in the bill that was passed by the House of Representatives \nlast week. The bill fully complies with the spending caps in the Budget \nControl Act. It contains no Member-requested earmarks, in compliance \nwith the earmark moratorium. There are cuts in the defense budget to \ndefine programs with excess funding, scheduled delays, and the like.\n  The bill includes 671 cuts as it came out of the House to programs in \nthe budget request of funds that are not needed for the remaining 6\\1/\n2\\ months of the year.\n  I might say to my friend from Arizona, this is what the House passed. \nWe have not added anything to it that I think would be of Senate \nauthorship that changes it in substance.\n  So I understand. It is the Senator's right. I respect his right and I \nwill\n\n[[Page S1690]]\n\nfight for his right as a Senator. But I would hope that at least for \nthose Senators prepared to offer amendments, without in any way \nprejudicing the right of the Senator from Arizona to do so, we could \nproceed with the amendment process.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, again, I thank my friend from Illinois and I thank \nhim for his point of view. I understand it. I understand the \nfrustration of our two leaders on the Appropriations Committee and \ntheir desire to get this done. I understand the time clock is running \nout. We are talking about a very short period of time. But I have to \nrepeat to the Senator from Illinois one more time: I am not going to go \nback to my State and say, By the way, I started the amendment process \nand debating on a bill that I hadn't read. I don't do that, and I hope \nthe Senator from Illinois respects it. I hope in a very short period of \ntime we can agree to proceed and have vigorous debate and amendments.\n\n  I also have to say this is remarkable. Here we are, I say to my \nfriend from Illinois, in a period of sequestration, and there is a \nprovision in here for $15 million for an incentive program that directs \nthe Department of Defense to overpay contracts by an additional 5 \npercent if the contractor is a Native Hawaiian-owned company. That \nboggles the mind. It is unbelievable. While we are keeping ships tied \nup at the pier because we can't deploy them, we are now going to tell \nNative Hawaiian companies they are going to be overpaid by an \nadditional 5 percent if they are based in Hawaii. What is that all \nabout? That is why the Senator from Oklahoma and I have to read the \nbill. I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Would the Senator from Arizona yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, ma'am.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We acknowledge the validity of the concerns of the \nSenator from Arizona. We also acknowledge that we would have liked very \nmuch for people to have seen this 72 hours in advance. There was no \nintent to stiff-arm. Please understand that. We weren't trying to be \ncute and come in late and all that. It was just the sheer physicality \nof moving the bill, not getting it from the House until Thursday. So \nthere was no intent to not honor the request of the Senator from \nArizona, in which he was very plain, and he has been consistent in \nevery bill. The Senator's request was not unusual and it was no \nsurprise. So that is essentially where we are.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say to the Senator, the distinguished \nchairperson, I respect that and I would never impugn her motives. I \nsaid I thought I understood the time constraints the Senator from \nMaryland is under, given the House and the Senate and all that. I \ncertainly did not intend to believe that there was anything----\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I just wanted to assure the Senator from Arizona of \nthat and I have respect for the Senator and his regard for the purse.\n  Does the Senator from Arizona have a sense of when he will be \nfinished reviewing the bill?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think in a very short time. I have to coordinate with \nthe Senator from Oklahoma, but I think within a couple of hours.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We would appreciate it in any way the Senator feels he \ncan exercise his traditional due diligence. We are not going to engage \nin arguments, but we would like to go ahead if we could get something \ngoing even later on this evening.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I say to the distinguished chairwoman, I will go \nback to my office right now, get together with Senator Coburn, and see \nif we can't come up with a definite time, and I assure the Senator from \nMaryland it will be a short period of time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. And if perhaps there are amendments the Senator from \nArizona could share with Senator Shelby. I expect there to be \namendments from Senators McCain and Coburn. It wouldn't have been a \nreal bill if they did not offer amendments. It somehow or another \nwouldn't have counted in the process. So we look forward to it. If we \ncan move it in an expeditious way, and courteously understanding the \nSenator's right to offer amendments, I think we can get going.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will try to carry out my mission as \nassigned by the distinguished chairperson. I thank her for her \nleadership and her excellent work. I thank both leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will not engage the Senator from Arizona \nwith questions. I don't want to delay his reading time.\n  I appreciate the work the distinguished chair of the Appropriations \nCommittee has done, and the distinguished ranking member, the senior \nSenator from Alabama. I worked with both of them for decades on the \nAppropriations Committee. I know they are diligent. They are hard \nworking. In fact, I recall a discussion with the distinguished senior \nSenator from Maryland when she agreed to take this assignment. I told \nher I couldn't think of anybody better on our side of the aisle to be \nthe chair of this committee because I know how hard she works and how \nwell she works with the ranking member.\n  I spoke also with the distinguished Senator from Alabama at the \ntime--again, somebody who knows how to get things done on \nappropriations. He and I have negotiated things over the years. We have \nalways kept our word to each other, just as the Senator from Maryland \nhas. Now it is time to debate the bill on the floor and it pains me \nthat having got this far, two senators are preventing anyone else from \noffering amendments.\n  It is unfortunate we are discussing a continuing resolution because \nif left to the three Senators who are currently on the floor--the \nSenator from Alabama, the Senator from Maryland, and myself--we know we \nwould be fully capable of completing action on individual \nappropriations bills. In fact, they were painstakingly negotiated by \nthe Senate and the House as part of an omnibus legislative package last \nDecember. But then, for reasons we don't have to go into here, a year's \nwork of seven appropriations subcommittees was dumped in the \nwastebasket, not because of the two leaders but because of others.\n  Unfortunately, that means we have been funding the government on \nautopilot. None of us who have spent time on the Appropriations \nCommittee wants this because we know it wastes money and sequestration \nwill make a bad situation even worse.\n  Having said that, I think what Chairwoman Mikulski and Ranking Member \nShelby have done in negotiating this continuing resolution is far \nbetter than putting the government on autopilot as we did last \nDecember.\n  I wish to talk about title 7 of this resolution, which concerns the \nDepartment of State and Foreign Operations. The House continuing \nresolution included several changes in the fiscal year 2012 \nappropriations act. The Senate incorporated those changes with minor \nmodifications. Senator Lindsey Graham and I included other changes we \nbelieve are critical to our national security. Top officials at the \nState Department and the Pentagon agree with us.\n  We did our best to avoid spending money on things that may have made \nsense in fiscal year 2012 but are a waste today. I will give an \nexample. The House continuing resolution includes another $250 million \nfor the Iraq police training program, the same amount as in fiscal year \n2012. Yet the State Department plans to spend zero in fiscal year 2013. \nThat is just an example of why we should go, if we could, by the \nregular order, because nobody wants this money.\n  There have been a lot of changes in the world since December 2011 \nwhen the 2012 bill was signed by the President. There is the \ncatastrophe in Syria, with millions of people fleeing their homes, \nwhich threatens to engulf the entire region. Benghazi and Mali are \nother examples. Conditions are changing in Egypt, Afghanistan, and in \nour own hemisphere. We face growing challenges in East Asia and the \nPacific.\n  Now, we should not say, as these challenges come up--sometimes \novernight--that well, two or three years ago we passed a bill, so there \nis no need to do one this year. The world does not stand still.\n  I think the chairwoman is doing a superb job, and Ranking Member \nShelby is showing, as usual, his many years of experience and hard \nwork. I thank Senator Lindsey Graham and his staff, who have provided \nvery constructive input.\n\n[[Page S1691]]\n\n  In the past, appropriations bills were always a bipartisan effort. We \nworked together. I think of Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens on this \nfloor working things out; my predecessor as President pro tempore, \nSenator Inouye, and Senator Cochran working things out.\n  Title VII of this resolution is a grand total of 11\\1/2\\ pages. Out \nof over 500 pages, it is 11\\1/2\\ pages. It should not take long to \nread. We do not expect amendments, but if we get them, I hope we can \nact on them quickly.\n  Mr. President, if nobody is seeking the floor, I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be allowed to continue for 5 minutes as though in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n             Arrest and Prosecution of Sulaiman Abu Ghaith\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week the Obama administration \nannounced that Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, had \nbeen brought to the United States to be prosecuted. Several of us who \nhave oversight in particular committees were notified a week before \nthis became public. We were briefed on what was happening as he was \nbeing flown here to this country to be prosecuted.\n  I commend the work of our Nation's dedicated law enforcement and \nintelligence officials who are helping bring him to justice. I was \nbriefed on exactly what they did and how they did it, and there was a \nsuperb combination of work by the Justice Department and intelligence \ncommunities, at the CIA, FBI, and other agencies. And I applaud the \nObama administration for their unanimous decision within the National \nSecurity Council to prosecute him in a Federal court.\n  We have reason to be proud of our courts. Our Federal courts are an \nexample of impartiality, competence, and integrity seen the world over. \nWe, as Americans, are not afraid to take somebody who has acted against \nus and prosecute them in our courts. We should not act as though we are \nafraid and simply say that we can't have them in our Federal court, and \nthat we should just lock them up in Guantanamo.\n  As a practical matter, our Federal prosecutors have established a \ntremendous record of convictions of terrorism defendants. They have \nconvicted over 450 terrorism-related defendants since September 11, \n2001.\n  The military commissions at Guantanamo Bay--where some said they \nwanted to send Abu Ghaith--are largely untested. There have only been 8 \nconvictions there--not the 450 we have seen in Federal courts but 8--\nand on average the sentences handed down in military commissions are \nshorter than those given in the Federal court. In fact, two of these \nmilitary commission convictions were overturned just last year. Indeed, \nbased on the recent decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \nCircuit, it is unclear whether a conspiracy case against this defendant \ncould even be legally sustained in a military commission at Guantanamo \nBay.\n  Why do we act as though we are afraid to bring this terrorist before \nour Federal courts where we bring mass murderers and everybody else, \nand instead argue that we should send him off somewhere where he may \nnever be convicted? In fact, regardless of the outcome of a military \ncommission proceeding against Abu Ghaith, it is possible that he could \nhave been stuck there without the possibility of a Federal prosecution, \ngiven the shortsighted limitations on detainee transfers imposed by \nCongress. When you look at how well the Federal courts have done, I am \nsurprised to hear people criticize the decision to bring him before an \nArticle III Federal court.\n  I would say that using our justice system is not mutually exclusive \nfrom gathering intelligence. In fact, from public accounts--and I refer \nto what has been in the press--it appears the FBI gathered information \nand intelligence from him for about a week before he was formally even \narraigned in court last week. In fact, according to one of the \nprosecutors, law enforcement officials were able to obtain detailed, \nextensive audio recordings and roughly 22 pages of post-arrest \nstatements from Abu Ghaith. And the fact is, also, as we have seen in \nsome of these other cases, once you present the defendant in court, \noftentimes they continue to cooperate and talk.\n  It is clear to me that President Obama's national security team did \nthe right thing. But we also show the rest of the world that we are not \nafraid, that as Americans we are not cowering and afraid to use our \ncourts, and that we are not afraid to use the law and procedures that \nhave made us free and strong.\n  We have had several hearings in the Judiciary Committee on how best \nto handle terrorism suspects. I am convinced that the Attorney General \nand the administration must have all options available. For example, \nthe case of the Fort Hood shooter went to a military trial, as it \nshould have. That case involved a military officer committing a crime \non a military base against other military personnel, even though \ninfluenced by somebody from al-Qaida overseas. But in the Abu Ghaith \ncase we have somebody that we can and should prosecute on conspiracy \ncharges in Federal court. As a former prosecutor, I have looked at \nthat, and I have absolute faith in the abilities of our Federal courts \nand our prosecutors and law enforcement officials to bring terrorists \nto justice. They have a tremendous record.\n  Let's not be afraid of these people. Let's not say: Oh, we have to \nhide them down there in Cuba at Guantanamo Bay. No, we are Americans. \nWe are America. We are not afraid of terrorists. Bring them before our \ncourts, and let them face American justice. Let them face our \nprosecutors and our courts. Let's do it in a way that we can show the \nrest of the world how justice truly works. When we tell them, why \naren't you running your courts in an open way, or when we criticize \nother countries, as we often do, let us not give them an opportunity to \ncome back and say, well, you don't do it that way yourselves. No--we \ncan and must say that we do. We have captured the son-in-law of Osama \nbin Laden, who conspired with him to commit a horrible crime against \nour Nation. It took us years to find him, but we got him. We brought \nhim back here. And now we are taking him to court, and we are going to \nlet a jury decide his guilt or innocence. That is the way it should be \ndone. That is the American way. And that shows that we do not have to \nhide. We Americans are willing to stand up and face those who would \nattack us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, before the distinguished Senator from \nVermont leaves the floor, I really wish to compliment him not only in \nthe way he has moved legislation but really the values, the American \nvalues, behind it. I think he has worked steadfastly on a bipartisan \nbasis with Senator Lindsey Graham on our foreign operations. This is \nwhat has been called soft power, but there is nothing soft about it. It \nis part of our smart power strategy.\n  And what has it meant? It has meant healing the sick, feeding the \nhungry, making sure children whose legs have been blown off with land \nmines have an opportunity for rehabilitation or for the children of \nHaiti who lost their limbs because of the horrific nature of the \nearthquake--taking lessons learned from other places in the world, that \nthey have a chance to do it.\n  Baltimore is the home of the Catholic relief organization. These are \npeople who serve the world without religious creed. They serve whomever \nis in need. The way they extol the virtues of what they have been able \nto do has been amazing. What they say to me is that because of the work \nSenator Leahy has done, they are able to leverage philanthropic \ndollars. Rather than being in lieu of government, they can leverage it \nbecause we are coming in to help the children, to help the children \nlearn to walk, and they then come in with community development so that \nthey learn a trade, so that we are literally rebuilding the lives of \nchildren in Haiti but also giving them a future where they are going to \nearn a livelihood. It is pretty terrific.\n  We have President Clinton, who does his global initiative like in \nHaiti, but we all have to be in it together, whether it is Bill Gates--\nthe women of the Senate on a bipartisan basis last week met with \nMelinda Gates in terms of the great Gates Foundation, and they talked \nabout their health care initiatives.\n  We said: Well, what does all this mean in terms of us?\n\n[[Page S1692]]\n\n  They said: If you do the job only government can do, we can then do \nwhat we need to do.\n  This is unique. I do not know of other countries in the world that \nquite work with this synergy, letting our private philanthropic \ncommunity do splendid, inspirational work. But they need a government.\n  The other thing we are able to do in this bill is provide something \nvery near and dear, which is embassy security. We know we wanted to do \nmore. We know that over the last couple of years the House has denied \n$400 million in embassy security. So we are heartsick at the way our \nAmbassador died. And while there is all that back-and-forth over \ntalking points, which we are not getting into, the fact is that we need \nto protect our American men and women working in embassies because they \nare at a duty station, and now that duty station has become a battle \nstation. We need to make sure we provide embassy security in the best \nway possible. We can debate policy, management, and so on, but at the \nend of the day we need to put money in the Federal checkbook to do \nthat.\n  We lost an Ambassador in Benghazi. I lost an Ambassador, and America \nlost many others a few years ago at Khobar Towers. One was our Consul \nGeneral. His name was Bartley. He was the highest ranking African \nAmerican in the Foreign Service. His son was interning with him. They \nblew up the Embassy. He and his son died. We need to look out for these \npeople. There was also a young lady who was there from the community, \nfrom CDC, working to make sure we were doing the right health \ninitiatives, teaching, educating the leadership there. She died. Again, \nthey were at their duty station, which has now become a battle station.\n  So I compliment the Senator for the children, his work on land mines, \nand his work on feeding the hungry. And do you know what. We make wise \nuse because of the strong oversight. I know the Senator from Vermont \nlistens to the inspector general, scrutinizes those GAO reports. We get \na dollar's worth of assistance, and at the end of the day America is \nstronger because of what we do in this bill.\n  I wish to salute the Senator for his sense of bipartisanship, his \nleadership and stewardship not only in this bill but over the years. \nThe Senator should be saluted, and I want to make sure this bill moves \nforward so we can get on to next year and even do a better, smarter \njob.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Maryland \nfor her kind comments. We do a lot. It is interesting. In the foreign \naid part, it is less than 1 percent of our budget. But what we do is \nshow the face of America--the best of the face of America throughout \nthe world. The distinguished Senator has been, throughout her career, \nboth in the other body and here, a strong supporter of those programs \nand made life better for an awful lot of people who never know who \nSenator Mikulski is or Senator Leahy or anybody else. All they know is \nthat life is better because of the things we have done.\n  I was in Haiti just a couple of weeks ago. I have been there several \ntimes since the earthquake. I have seen how our programs have helped, \nincluding the Leahy War Victims Fund, which helps land mine victims \naround the world. The Senator from Alabama knows, as he was there with \nme a year ago.\n  I saw youngsters with prosthetics learning to walk again. I saw \npeople from other parts of the world who were inspired by what the \nUnited States was doing.\n  I remember a physician from Brussels who had gone to Haiti. When I \nasked him why he spent so much time volunteering there, We were \nspeaking French with each other, but I remember the emotion in his \nvoice as he grabbed my arm and said, ``pour les enfants,'' for the \nchildren. Those children are not rich. They are not powerful. They will \nnever vote for us. But we are human beings, and we have a \nresponsibility.\n  The Senator from Maryland has spoken about security at our embassies. \nWe tell people to go to some of the most dangerous parts of the world \nand show the best face of America. We have a responsibility to protect \nthem. We have tried to get that money passed only to have had it held \nup in the other body. Let's continue our work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, the bill Chairwoman \nMikulski and Senator Shelby have compiled is an excellent example of \nhow hard work, cooperation, and good-faith negotiating can produce \nresults in a body which is too often paralyzed by gridlock. The \ncombined omnibus and CR, while not all I would wish for, is a balanced \napproach to keeping the government functioning through the remainder of \nthe fiscal year while avoiding the specter of a government shutdown.\n  The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill is \none of five bills in this package, and it reflects the agreement \nreached between the Senate and the House last fall. The Senate bill is \nidentical to the House-passed MILCON-VA bill, and it sends a strong \nmessage of support to our Nation's vets and military families, \nincluding previously appropriated advances for vets' medical care. The \nfiscal year 2013 bill provides a total of $144.8 billion for military \nconstruction, family housing, the VA, and four related agencies, \nincluding Arlington National Cemetery. Of that amount, $71.9 billion is \ndiscretionary funding. This includes $10.6 billion for military \nconstruction, $61 billion for the VA, and $347 million for related \nagencies.\n  This bill deserves the full support of the Senate. The alternative is \na continuing resolution which is out of step with current requirements \nor a crippling government shutdown. A CR would be disastrous for \nmilitary construction. The CR prohibits new starts, which would block \nexecution of 97 percent of the fiscal year 2013 military construction \nprogram. As a result, more than 250 MILCON projects in 42 States, the \nDistrict of Columbia, and overseas which are funded in the bill before \nus would be put on indefinite hold in the CR.\n  For the VA, a CR would not provide advance funding for fiscal year \n2014 for vets' health care. Advance funding is an important tool to \nprotect funding for vets' health care from the very predicament we find \nourselves in today.\n  Another small but important program in this bill which would be \nscuttled by a CR is funding for needed cemetery expansion at Arlington \nNational Cemetery. All of these problems are solved in this omnibus \npackage.\n  Our Nation's vets, our military troops and their families, have made \nand are continuing to make great sacrifices in defense of this Nation. \nThe bill before us recognizes and honors that commitment by funding a \nwide array of programs essential to the health and well-being of both \nvets and military families.\n  I urge the Senate to support this bill.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would like to compliment the Senator from South \nDakota, who does an excellent job as assistant chairman on the \nSubcommittee on Military Construction, VA. He has worked steadfastly to \nbring up this bill. We are in agreement with the House. I wish to share \na sense of urgency why this needs to happen.\n  In this bill, thanks to the leadership provided here, it increases \nfunding to improve and accelerate claims processing to increase staff, \nbusiness processes, and infotech enhancements. This kind of sounds \nbloodless and technocratic, but I stand before you today to tell you we \nhave a claims processing crisis for our veterans, particularly in the \narea of applying for disability benefits.\n  I hate to tell you, Baltimore has one of the worst records. There are \nmany reasons for this situation. It wasn't my fault. We let the \ninfrastructure deteriorate, there are staffing issues, and there are an \nincredible number of our men and women coming back from the longest war \nwe have fought with incredible injuries, with some bearing the \npermanent impact of the war, and\n\n[[Page S1693]]\n\nthey are eligible. Many have multiple problems. This is not your World \nWar II benefit claim.\n  So we have a backlog. We need to deal with that backlog; otherwise, \nshame on us. Those men and women fought hard. They gave it everything \nthey had. Thanks to the skill and dedication of military medicine, we \nsaved more lives in combat than in any other war.\n  I don't want to sound like an epidemiologist; I am a Senator. The \nfact is we have reduced what doctors call morbidity and mortality. That \nis the good news back to the hospital from the battlefields, from \ntraining medics, all the way to Germany, all the way now to Walter Reed \nNational Military Medical Center in Bethesda.\n  What is the issue when they come back home? Because we have saved \ntheir lives, they have injuries. It means they have some level of \ndisability. They may not be totally disabled, but they are eligible. If \nthey have a permanent injury, they should have a permanent benefit from \ntheir government. While they were on the frontline, they should not \nneed to stand in line to have their claims processed.\n  We have some claims which take as many as 3 or 4 years to complete. \nWe need to pick it up. We need to up our game.\n  These are improvements. We have spoken to General Shinseki. I know \nthe gentleman. The chairman of the committee has talked to him and was \nquite vigorous and insistent in his advocacy. I had General Shinseki \ncome to Baltimore. I was ballistic about the claims situation in \nBaltimore. What did we need? We needed increased staff.\n  Did you know we do most of our disability claims by paper? We might \nas well be doing it by papyrus.\n  When you look at it--I am rarely brief, but I am short--the average \ndisability claim, which I know you have gone to look at, sir, is \nsometimes 6, 8, and 12 inches tall. That is just the VA. In order to be \ncertified you need to have the military give you information, you need \nto have Social Security give you information, and you need to have \ndoctor information. In the meantime, somebody who lost a leg, somebody \nwho has lost an arm, somebody who has lost so much time fighting a war, \nwe ask too much from too few for so long who are there waiting for \ntheir benefit.\n  We need to go digital. If we are going to run government like a \nbusiness, let's give them the standard business tools. That means more \ntechnology.\n  I really want to thank the Senator from South Dakota and his \nRepublican vice chair for much of what they have done in this bill. \nWhat is nearest and dearest for me are two things: increased funding to \ndeal with the claims process to receive what they deserve and also \nadvance funding for VA medical to enable the veterans to receive the \nhealth care they were promised, they need, and they deserve. If you \never want to talk about an earned benefit, it is the men and women who \nneed VA medical care and the men and women who need their claims \nprocessed to receive what they deserve and what they are entitled to.\n  This in and of itself is a reason to ensure we don't have a \ngovernment shutdown and blow this program out of the window. I want to \nthank the Senator for his advocacy and also for taking good intentions \nand putting them in the Federal checkbook.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I rise today to speak about an amendment \nto the pending matter, an amendment I intend to file when it becomes \nprocedurally appropriate to do so.\n  The amendment I intend to file is about foreign aid to the nation of \nEgypt. But let me start by talking about foreign aid in general because \nthere is a lot of debate about that and a lot of concern around the \ncountry about foreign aid. In fact, a lot of places I go people ask me: \nWith things so tough here in the United States, why do we give money to \nother countries? Why are we giving money to other countries?\n  That is a very good question to ask. First, I would say, and I would \ncaution people, that foreign aid is not 20 percent of our budget. It is \nnot 30 percent of our budget. It is actually, on some days, less than 1 \nto 3 percent of our total budget.\n  Secondly, I would say that foreign aid has a very useful role. Just \nto set the table, I think people need to understand that our foreign \naid has accomplished a tremendous amount of good around the world. For \nexample, the USAID programs to fight HIV/AIDS in Africa has helped save \nmillions of people. Millions of people are alive today because of the \ngenerosity of the American taxpayer.\n  It has helped to alleviate poverty. I think you should look at some \nof the great examples of foreign aid like the Marshall Plan or the work \nwe undertook to rebuild Japan and the alliances we have today as a \nresult.\n  One of the great stories of foreign aid is South Korea, a nation that \nwas long a beneficiary of foreign aid--and not just from the United \nStates but from the world--and today it is a donor in many of these \nforums.\n  So that is the good news about foreign aid--and foreign aid is \nimportant because it increases our influence. It is part of how we can \ninfluence what is increasingly a global economy. I think it is \nimportant to understand when people talk about the American economy, we \ndon't just live in a national economy anymore. We live in a world \nwhere, increasingly, things that happen to you on a daily basis--the \nprice of things that you are buying--some of these things are set \nhalfway around the world not just halfway down the street or halfway \nacross the city. So foreign aid is important because it deals with \nAmerica's influence around the world and, in particular, our ability to \ninfluence things toward our national interests.\n  Foreign aid is not charity. Although it may be charitable, and \nalthough it may be motivated by us and our efforts to advance our \nprinciples and the things we think are right, foreign aid is not \ncharity. Foreign aid is designed to further our national interests. \nThat means every single dime we give in foreign aid should be \nconditioned toward our national interests, should be about furthering \nour national interests. And I think that is true all over the world, \neverywhere we give it, whether it is military aid or economic aid.\n  I think today we have one example of a place where we should start to \nexamine how we give our foreign aid and examine it in a way that allows \nus to maximize our national interests. That country I want to talk \nabout today is Egypt, and there is a lot of concerning things happening \nin Egypt.\n  We have all been witness to the amazing Arab spring and all the \nchanges that it brought about to the region, potentially democracy, et \ncetera. And Egypt, obviously, has been a prime example of that, a \ncountry where all this has been occurring. It has brought to power a \ngovernment that largely is governed today by the Muslim Brotherhood.\n  Here is the good news. The good news is these changes have occurred, \nand, theoretically, there is a more open society. The bad news is some \nof the people who have been brought to power bring with them an \nideology that at times is troubling and, in fact, in practice has been \ndeeply troubling.\n  For example, we have seen efforts in Egypt to undermine democratic \ninstitutions. We have seen efforts in Egypt to undermine the judiciary. \nWe have seen open examples in Egypt of the freedom of religion being \nundermined. We have seen women and women's rights regress. We have seen \nirresponsible economic behavior in Egypt. And we can talk about the \ncauses of all this, but this is the reality of what is going on in \nEgypt.\n  In addition to that, we should be deeply concerned about Egypt's \nability or willingness to live up to their security arrangements with \ntheir neighbors, particularly our strong allies in Israel. They have a \ncommitment they made years ago to securing the Sinai, to preventing \nweapons and terrorists and others from crossing through the Sinai and \ninto the Gaza Strip and into Israel. This is a commitment and an \nobligation they have, and we should be\n\n[[Page S1694]]\n\nconcerned about their unwillingness or inability, or both, to live up \nto these commitments.\n  So what I am asking for in this amendment is for us to reexamine the \nway we give foreign aid to Egypt, not to get rid of it because there is \na real danger that we can start to lose some of these foreign aid \nprograms. The American people are fed up with story after story of \ncountries that are benefiting from our generosity, and then they open \nthe newspaper and they read inflammatory comments that are made about \nus. They open the newspaper or turn on cable television, and they see \nreports from these countries where democracy is being undermined, where \nthe rights of women are being trampled, where religious minorities are \nbeing persecuted, and they have a right to ask: Why are we giving so \nmuch money to these countries?\n  We actually have a record in Egypt of working very closely with their \nmilitary organizations, and we hope that can continue. But we also want \nto ensure that Egypt continues to move toward a direction of true \ndemocracy.\n  Democracy is not just having elections. Having elections is one part \nof democracy. You have to govern like a democrat. You have to govern in \nan open process where you allow people to speak out, opposition parties \nto organize, have a court system that doesn't skew things in your favor \nand against the opposition. You don't just have to have elections to \nhave a democracy; you need a lot more than that.\n\n  We saw last week where former Senator Kerry, now Secretary of State, \nawarded a sum--by the way, we have given over $70 billion of aid to \nEgypt since the 1940s. That is not an insignificant sum. But we look \nnow at the $250 million in aid they received last week, and I believe \nthat was unfortunate.\n  We have significant interests in ensuring that Egypt remains at peace \nwith Israel, that the Morsi government does not undermine the \ndemocratic process, and that human and political rights of all \nEgyptians--including that of religious minorities and women--are \nrespected, and our foreign aid should reflect that.\n  So what this amendment which I intend to propose does is a few \nthings. Let me begin by saying this is not about canceling foreign aid \nto Egypt per se. This is about restructuring it in a way that lines up \nwith the national interests of the taxpayers of the United States of \nAmerica. I will have more to say about this amendment when the \nappropriate time to file it comes up, but let me just briefly describe \nit, and I hope to gain support from my colleagues and the public at \nlarge.\n  First, it would block the disbursement of additional economic support \nfunds and new--not the existing but new--foreign military financing \ncontracts until Egypt begins to enact economic reforms and the \nadministration certifies that Egypt has done a few of the following:\n  It has adopted and implemented legal reforms which protect the \npolitical, the economic, and religious freedoms; it is not acting to \nrestrict the political, economic, and religious freedoms and human \nrights of the citizens and residents of Egypt; it is continuing to \ndemonstrate a commitment to free and fair elections and is not taking \nany steps to interfere with or undermine the credibility of such \nelections.\n  Another condition is that it has lifted restrictions in law and \npractice on the work and the funding of Egyptian and international \nNGOs--nongovernmental organizations--comprising those in human rights \nand democracy fields. Those include the International Republican \nInstitute, the National Democratic Institute, and Freedom House; that \nit is fully implementing the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty; that it is \ntaking all the necessary actions to eliminate smuggling networks and to \ndetect and destroy tunnels between Egypt and the Gaza Strip--tunnels \nthat are used to smuggle weapons and terrorists into the Gaza Strip--\nand is taking all other necessary actions to combat terrorism in an \nincreasingly ungovernable space of the Sinai.\n  The second thing it does is it begins to recalibrate the U.S.-\nEgyptian security relationship toward Egypt's actual security needs.\n  Now, let me say this: It does not appear--and I don't know of anyone \nwho would disagree with this--that Egypt has any imminent threat of \nbeing invaded by any one of their neighbors. It is not going to happen. \nEgypt's real security needs are its ability, No. 1, to live up to its \nobligations to stamp out terrorism within its borders and, in \nparticular, to secure the Sinai, to close those tunnels that lead to \nGaza. But the second security need it has is internal--in particular, \nstreet crime.\n  One of the ways Egypt is going to be able to rebuild its economy is \nthrough tourism, and I am not a tourism expert, but I think muggings, \nmurder, and kidnappings are not good for tourism. People don't usually \nvisit countries where these things are happening. This is the actual \naid that Egypt needs in terms of its security.\n  It doesn't need tanks, it doesn't need jet fighters. It is not going \nto be invaded by a foreign country. That is not its real threat. I \nunderstand their desire to have those things--and, by the way, there \nare existing contracts to give them those things. But their real \nsecurity needs are largely internal, and we want to recalibrate our \nmilitary aid in the future to Egypt to meet their actual needs.\n  To that end, the amendment would require an analysis of Egypt's \nsecurity requirements, produced by the Department of Defense in \nconsultation with the Egyptian Government, and to be shared with the \nrelevant congressional committees both in the House and the Senate. We \nalso want the administration to certify that the Department of Defense \nhas allocated a portion of Egypt's foreign military financing--no less \nthan $100 million--toward counterterrorism tools, including the \nequipment and training related to border security, and to address the \ninstability in the Sinai.\n  We also want a report on all FMF contracts the Department of Defense \nhas carried out over the last 10 years, as well as the Department's \nplans for contracting over the next decade. I think it is wise to look \nat what we have done in the past, to fully understand the contributions \nthe American taxpayer has made to Egypt's security in the past. But we \nalso need to see the contracts that are pending move forward. All of \nthese need to be aligned so we can ensure the aid we are giving them \nisn't just what they want, but it, in fact, is what they need, within \nthe confines of what is in our national security and in our national \ninterests because, once again, this is our money.\n  We should begin to shift U.S. assistance away from military programs \nand increasingly toward civilian assistance. So what this amendment \nwould do is require the administration to begin a dialogue with the \nEgyptian Government and with the Egyptian civil society about the need \nto rebalance our system away from its current, almost obsessive focus \non military aid by reallocating economic funds not provided to Egypt \nduring periods when certification is not in effect toward democracy and \ngovernance programs, including direct support for secular, democratic, \nnongovernmental organizations, as well as programming and support for \nrule of law and human rights, good governance, political competition, \nconsensus building, and civil society.\n  We should look at transferring the interest earned in Egypt's \naccount. They have an account where this money sits when we give them \nthis aid. Those accounts have a lot of money and generate a lot of \ninterest. We should be able to take that interest that is generated \nfrom these funds and make it available and allocate these funds for \ndemocracy and for governance efforts.\n  Last but not least, we should require the President to submit a \nreport to the Congress describing the specific results of an Egyptian \npolicy review that includes a dialogue with the Government of Egypt and \nalso civil society on how to rebalance the U.S. military and economic \nassistance.\n  Now, as most of these bills will have in them, this is going to have \na national security waiver. In essence, if the Secretary of State comes \nto us and says: It is in our national security not to implement or \nfully implement this amendment at this time, as they do with almost all \naid programs, they would have the right to do that. But they are going \nto have to do it every 180 days, at least twice a year, so we can be \nsure we are keeping up with the transition that is going on in Egypt.\n  Let me briefly address a few of the arguments that are going to come\n\n[[Page S1695]]\n\nagainst this potentially. One is that we have this incredibly strong \nrelationship with the Egyptian military, and we don't want to undermine \nthat. This is not intended to do that. We value that relationship. We \nhope it will continue to grow stronger. But the reality of it is, No. \n1, these are hard-earned taxpayer dollars. At a time when the United \nStates of America really doesn't have a lot of money to throw away--in \nfact, it has no money to throw away--we have to ensure the aid we give \nis aid that is effective, that is actually doing what it needs to be \ndoing, not simply going to a wish list of some general or military \nofficial somewhere. This is not about cutting off the Egyptian \nmilitary; this is about recalibrating our relationship with them to \nensure that what we are making available to them is not just what they \nwant, but it is what they need. That is the first thing I would say in \nthat argument.\n  The second argument I would have--and we hope this day will never \ncome--but as Egypt continues to transition, we don't know what the \nEgyptian military is going to look like 2 years from now, 5 years from \nnow, 10 years from now. In fact, many of the top people we have been \ndealing with in the past aren't in those positions anymore. They have \nbeen replaced by the new government. And I would tell you, history is a \nlesson.\n  If the Morsi government and the Muslim Brotherhood take Egypt in a \ndirection that is not in our national interests, that is not in the \nbest interests of the region or our allies in the world, they are not \ngoing to be able to do that unless they replace the military leadership \nwith people who agree with them on these things. So while we hope that \nnever happens, we hope to do everything we can to prevent that from \nhappening, we hope the Egyptian military will continue to be governed \nand run by professional men and women. But we can't guaranteed that, \nand we don't know what the Egyptian military will look like 5 years \nfrom now or 3 years from now.\n  That is why it is so important this waiver provision require the \nSecretary of State to do so twice a year, so we can keep up on the \nrecent events. Who would have predicted 3 years ago that the events \nthat happened in Egypt would have happened in our time? Yet they did. \nSo we can't predict what Egypt is going to look like 3 years from now. \nWe hope it will be better, but we don't know.\n  The other argument I have heard is, well, this is going to offend \ntheir sovereignty. They don't like us to tell them what to do with the \naid we give them. The Egyptians are not going to take kindly to the \nidea of the United States dictating to them.\n  I, quite frankly, don't understand that argument because this is our \nmoney. They don't have to take our foreign aid. They don't have to \naccept it. But our foreign aid has never been--or should never have \nbeen--a blank check. This idea that somehow the money we are going to \nmake available to people should be unconditional, quite frankly, \ndoesn't make sense to me. This is our money. If they don't want the \naid, they don't have to take it. But if they are going to accept our \naid, we should have some say in it.\n  If it is the U.S. dollars of the U.S. taxpayer that are going toward \nthis program, shouldn't the American people, through their elected \nrepresentatives and their government, have some say--if not a \npredominant amount of say--over how these dollars are spent and on what \nthese dollars are spent? And shouldn't we ensure those countries are \nheaded in a positive direction, not in a direction that acts against \nour national interests?\n  I believe in foreign aid. I think foreign aid is important for the \nUnited States. But it needs to be done the right way. I think it needs \nto be done the right way across the board, in all of our aid programs. \nBut this is one that is pressing, that is right in front of us.\n\n  I recently took a trip to the Middle East. I went to Jordan. I went \nto Israel. In many places where I went, I heard over and over again a \nlot of concern about the direction Egypt is headed. They are going \nthrough a balancing act right now, is what it appears. On the one hand, \nyou have a deeply seated ideology that I think many people would find \noffensive. We have heard some of the past comments of the President of \nEgypt. We have heard some of the past comments of some of the \nleadership in the Muslim Brotherhood. It is downright offensive, and \nthat is their ideology. We have seen some of that seep through in their \npublic policymaking.\n  We also understand there is a pragmatic argument going on. They know \nthey cannot survive in government and in power if they don't have an \neconomy. They know--at least, I hope they know--they have to take steps \nto reform their economy. They have to take steps to increase their \nsecurity so tourism will return. They know they need to do these \nthings, and right now they are calibrating those two things: the \npragmatism of needing to secure their country and needing to provide \nfor economic growth versus their ideology.\n  In the ideological base of the Muslim Brotherhood that is calling for \na rapid expansion of Islamist-type rule, you can see those pressures \nbuilding within Egyptian society in and of itself. I think U.S. aid has \nan opportunity to tilt that conversation toward pragmatism. If we are \nsmart about how we use our foreign aid, we can actually help tilt that \nconversation away from the ideology and toward pragmatism, toward \nsecurity that is not designed to crack down on internal dissent, that \nis not designed to one day wage war against their neighbors in Israel \nor anywhere else, but in fact is designed to provide security against \ncommon street crimes, security against terrorism, to seal those tunnels \nin Gaza, to live up to their international obligations.\n  I think if we condition this the right way, we can help encourage \nthem to take on the kind of economic reforms that Egypt needs to have \nthe kind of economy they need. After all, that was the heart of the \nArab spring, the heart of the Arab spring where hundreds of thousands \nof unemployed people--starting in Egypt particularly--were desperate \nfor a better future and didn't think they could find it. Then they \nlooked at a government that they saw as repressive and corrupt, and \nthey wanted to replace it. But not with this.\n  The reason I feel so strongly about this is that as the Egyptian \nleaders are undertaking this cost-benefit analysis--should they lean \nmore toward ideology or should they lean more toward pragmatism--\nthrough our foreign aid we actually have an opportunity to push them, \nto nudge them, to encourage them toward pragmatism.\n  I hope I can achieve bipartisan support for this amendment. I hope \npeople will find it to be thoughtful and insightful. In the days to \ncome, I look forward to addressing more questions that my colleagues \nmay have on it. We are going to put some releases out about this, and I \nhope my colleagues will become interested in helping us achieve its \npassage.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, you have heard me speak to the \nDemocratic caucus and to the press that moving the continuing \nresolution, or I should call it the continued funding resolution--\nremember, continuing the funding for fiscal year 2013 to our fiscal New \nYear's Eve, October 1, is our goal. We don't want a government \nshutdown, we don't want a government slam-down, lockdown. So we have \nbeen working very diligently on a bipartisan basis to fashion the bill \nthat would get 60 votes so we would be filibuster-proof.\n  In the old days, majority ruled. Now it is supermajority. That is not \na fight I am going to do here on this bill. My job is to keep the \ngovernment funded, to work in an open, transparent, bipartisan and \nhopefully bicameral way.\n  I said this was like the last helicopter leaving a disaster area. I \nwas trying to get the cargo on it to make sure we protected national \nsecurity. We honored compelling human need, particularly for women and \nchildren in the area of education and health care, and we also looked \nat how we could generate jobs--not in government but government-\ngenerated jobs in the private sector, such as transportation, and make \nimportant investments in\n\n[[Page S1696]]\n\nscience and technology that come up with the new ideas for the new \nproducts that will create jobs in our country and hopefully even for \nexport around the world. That is what I have been trying to do.\n  I also had to give up a lot. I had to give up the funding for \nObamaCare. This was not my choice. I know there will be an amendment \noffered to even defund it further. I happen to believe in what we did \nwith President Obama's health care framework. I liked ending \ndiscrimination against women. I liked ending the discrimination against \npeople who have children with preexisting conditions. I liked funding \nthe amendment that provided access for women for mammograms, and for \nchildren for early detection and screening. But we could not do it.\n  One of the other things we could not do was we could not add a very \nmodest pay raise for Federal employees. This bill will continue the \nexisting pay rates. It is necessary to avoid a government shutdown for \nthe entire government. Shutting down the government would make a tough \nsituation worse for Federal employees. It would jeopardize our economic \nrecovery. Shutting down the government would threaten the viability of \nsmall and medium-size businesses. It would even threaten the safety of \nour families, our economy, maybe even our country.\n  This is not a happy day for me and it is not a happy day for the \nmillions of people who work diligently for the Federal Government. I \nhave the great honor to represent 130,000 Federal employees--I wish you \ncould tour Maryland with me, the way I have been up to your home \nState--each one doing important work for the Nation. And who are they, \nthese employees? They are people who work at the National Institutes of \nHealth, finding cures or ways to contain diseases--the next vaccine to \nhelp the flu endemic or protect us against a pandemic.\n  They are the civilian employees at the National Security Agency. We \nemploy the largest number of mathematicians in the world. What do they \ndo? They invent the kind of technology that breaks the codes and \nprotects us--now in this whole new cyber domain. They are the people \nwho run the weather satellites. The European model might have done a \nbetter job last week than they did, but do you know why? Because we \nhave not had the resources to fund them the way the Europeans have.\n  I have employees at FDA right this very minute at their jobs, looking \nat medical devices to see if they are safe. Right at this very minute \nthey are working with the private sector, which is bringing them new \npharmaceuticals, new biotech and biologics that they could look at to \nsee if they are safe and effective so they could go into clinical \npractice to help save lives here and be certified by the FDA, which \nwould give us the ability to sell them around the world. We say to \nthem: We know what you are doing, but tough luck; we can't give you a \npay raise because we say we have out-of-control spending. I don't think \nwe have out-of-control spending. Do we have to be more frugal? Do we \nhave to be smarter? Do we have to get more value for the dollar? \nAbsolutely. We are onto that. But don't attack Federal employees for \nthe mismanagement of the Federal Government. That is right here. That \nis what we do. Don't blame them and don't make them pay the price. It \nis like making the middle class pay the price for more domestic cuts \nwhile we protect subsidies to corporate jets.\n  These 130,000 Federal employees help run the Hubbell Space Telescope, \nmore discoveries--the most important telescope since Galileo invented \nthe first one. I can't tell you how bad I feel that we are not at least \ngiving them a .05-percent pay raise. And they are facing sequester, \nwhich could mean for many of them a 20-percent pay cut, if they are \nfurloughed.\n  I visited NIH to see what was the impact of sequester. There was \nCarol Greider from Hopkins. She won the Nobel Prize 2 years ago. We are \nproud of her. NIH, within a week of my arrival there to meet with them, \nas I have done so often--they cut cancer rates 15 percent. Instead of \npinning medals on them, we say: You don't get a pay raise. We have more \nimportant things to do with the money. You are the problem.\n  I don't think they are a problem at all. I think they are part of the \nsolution--coming up with ways to help compelling human needs and \ncreating jobs in our country in life sciences and giving us something \nto sell overseas. I think it is wrong to keep asking them for more when \noil and gas companies make record profits and we don't ask them to give \nup tax breaks. It is wrong when we can't close one tax loophole that \nsends jobs overseas. When Senator Murray brings up her bill, I will \ntalk more about these lavish tax earmarks. This is not the time and \nplace. But it is time to say we have to protect our civil service.\n  Senator Rubio just spoke about Egypt and he said they have to be able \nto govern. It is not enough to just bring down a dictator. That is an \nexcellent point. We have to govern, too. And the hallmark of a \ndemocracy is a civil service that has integrity, that is promoted on \nthe basis of meritocracy, that is independent of politics, doing \nmissions that serve the Nation in research, technology, administering \nprograms that help get transportation funding to Governors to build \nroads, bridges, and fund our pent-up demand for physical \ninfrastructure, and then in human infrastructure--education, health \ncare. That is what a democracy does and you need a civil service that \nis independent, has integrity and is promoted and hired and so on on \nthe basis of meritocracy. What is the hallmark of a despotic, \nautocratic government, be they Communist or just plain despots? They \nare corrupt. You get ahead by taking a bribe, by doing a party favor, \nby looking the other way, on so many other things where you cannot even \nopen a business or get a permit or so on unless there is a series of \ntipping fees. You can't get through an airport unless you bribe your \nway through it. That is what a corrupt, despotic, autocratic government \ndoes.\n\n  But when you visit democracies, the first thing you see is they have \na civil service. What is the civil service? Integrity, competency, \nincorruptible. But we say: Yeah, yeah, you know, we know you have a \nPh.D, or we know you are the blue-collar worker who manages the \nfacilities at NIH to keep the lights on so the researchers can do their \nwork. It is those people who help us have a great country, and a \ncountry we can be proud of.\n  I hope we resolve this sequester thing, with layoffs and furloughs \nand potential cuts of 20 percent. I wish we could have at least said \none thing to the Federal employees, that we are at least going to give \nyou a .05--a half of 1 percent--pay raise. I didn't like it because I \nthought it was so skimpy and Spartan.\n  But I will say this. The helicopter could not take off if it was on \nit. I think this is a terrible mistake. I hope in next year's regular \norder we can make this up. But I want to say to my Federal employees \nthis was a Draconian choice. Do we try to give you a pay raise that \nwould be important to you? Every penny and every dollar counts.\n  You led the Consumer Protection Agency. You certainly have the \nreputation, Madam President, of being a real fighter for the consumer, \nand you were the first in America to do a study that showed people were \ngoing bankrupt not because they bought too many Volvos, ate out too \nmuch, or lived a life of brie and wine and so on. It was because of \nmedical catastrophes that faced them. You were the first to tell us \nabout that, so you know about family incomes and what makes them and \nwhat breaks them. But I say this to you: Thank you for your work.\n  And I want to say to the Federal employees, thank you for your work. \nI wanted to do it with a modest pay raise, but right now my duty in the \nsituation I find myself in reluctantly is that the way I serve you is \nto make sure there is no government shutdown. Because you know what. In \nmy heart and in my mind--and as I see how different places function--\nthere is no such thing as a nonessential Federal employee. Everybody at \nthe workplace and who serves the Nation is doing their job with \nhonesty, integrity, meritocracy, and is incorruptible. Let's make sure \nwe honor them. We have to get this bill done. Let's get on the Murray \nbudget and right our economy. Whatever problems we have, don't blame \nthe Federal employees for the decisions made by the Congress to get us \nin the deficit and debt we are in.\n\n[[Page S1697]]\n\nThey didn't do it, we did it. We should take the pay cut, not them.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I have been listening to the remarks of \nmy colleague from Maryland, and as we say down South, she is spot on. \nBefore she became chairperson of the Appropriations Committee, she was \na member of that committee for many years. We worked together when I \nwas chairman of the subcommittee and she was the ranking member and \nwhen she was the chairperson and I was the ranking member. We both came \nfrom the House. We were on the same committee in the House. We worked \ntogether. We struggled with each other from time to time, but in the \nend, we knew we had to come up with a product, and that is what we are \ntrying to do here today.\n  I was hoping we could bring this bill to the floor. As the Senator \nfrom Maryland has been saying, there are a lot of Members who want to \noffer amendments. We could offer some amendments and debate them \ntonight and perhaps even vote on them tonight. We know we have this \ndeadline. At the end of March the CR expires, along with the funding of \nthe Government of the United States. I don't think any party--Democrat \nor Republican--is interested in any way of going to the brink again. It \nserves no purpose. It creates uncertainty in the marketplace; it \ncreates uncertainty with the role we play in the Senate and the House.\n  As the Senator from Maryland has said, we have worked together. We \nhave a continuing resolution which came from the House, with the \nDepartment of Defense and the MILCON-VA--military construction and VA--\nin it to fund until September 30, which is the fiscal year. It is about \n6 months from now. We have added to the legislation which we hope to \nbring before the Senate the Commerce, Justice, Science Subcommittee, of \nwhich she is the subcommittee chair and I am the ranking member. We \nhave worked together on that. Agriculture, which affects everybody in \nthis country one way or the other, and homeland security, which is the \nessence of the security of this country at home, have been added by the \nSenate.\n  We scrubbed these bills all weekend. Both sides scrubbed them. I have \ngiven up things I would personally like, and she has given up things, \nprobably including some things from the Democratic leadership. We have \ndone the same over here. We are doing this to show the American people \nthat America comes first. We need to show we can work together. We need \nto pass these bills. The sooner they get up here, the sooner amendments \ncan be offered by Republicans and Democrats, the sooner we get the \nprocess working and we get into the debates. That is what this \nlegislative body is all about.\n  The CR we are bringing up--or the hybrid CR--is funded at the fiscal \nyear 2012 levels, and it is consistent with the Budget Control Act. It \nwould leave the sequester in effect. It gives some leeway--some but not \nunbridled--to enable the situation with sequester to maybe work a \nlittle better. I think it is good policy and bad procedure.\n  We are going to have to cut because we cannot sustain deficits of $1 \ntrillion. We cannot continue to go down the road we are on. We have to \nchange the trajectory of this country. We cannot sustain ourselves if \nwe have a $20 trillion or $25 trillion debt. Whether you are a \nDemocrat, Republican, Libertarian, Independent, or whatever you are, \nyou should want a strong monetary policy and a strong economic policy.\n  We have a few more years left, and this is a good start here in the \nSenate. If we can get this bill up and pass it, then the House will do \nsomething. We will fund the government until September 30, which is \nwhat we are supposed to do. If we do that, then we can start on the \n2014 budget. From there we can perhaps go to regular order. That is \nwhat we wish to do in the appropriations process so we are not going \nfrom crisis to crisis.\n  What we have done in the House and the Senate--and the White House is \ninvolved in this too--in recent years is we have been lurching from \ncrisis to crisis, and then we come up to the deadline and people say: \nOh, we have to have certainty. So we kick the can down the road a few \nmore yards. That is not the way to do business. This country is too \nimportant. The business community needs certainty, people in government \nneed certainty, and I think this is a good first start. I hope we can \nget this process moving.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, as I rise to talk about the budget \nthat was released in the House of Representatives, I want to first \ncommend our chair Senator Mikulski and ranking member Senator Shelby \nfor working together. I could not agree more with what Senator Shelby \nsaid about getting back to regular order and getting back together. \nThis is an example of what we need to do. I want to commend both \nSenators.\n  We obviously have very different points of view. People can come \ntogether and listen to each other and be willing to compromise, which \nis not a bad thing. I don't know any part of life where we don't \ncompromise. I have been trying to figure that one out. When you have \nchildren, wouldn't it be nice not to have to compromise? Somehow we \nalways have to. I want to commend both of our leaders on the \nAppropriations Committee.\n\n  I am very hopeful we can return to regular order and hash out our \nvery different perspectives and very different views of the country. I \nthink we have seen that today with Chairman Ryan with the Republican \nbudget. We will see a different view tomorrow with Chairman Murray \ncoming through with a budget as we work through the budget in committee \nthis week and then on the floor. This way reasonable people can sit \ndown and listen to each other and find a path forward.\n  Most importantly, I think if we listen to the American people we \nrepresent--their values and their priorities--we can move forward. I do \nfeel strongly that what has been released today in the House is the \nwrong set of values; it is the wrong approach. Actually, I am surprised \nwe are seeing the same kind of budget we have seen for the last couple \nof years come out of the House--particularly one where the public spoke \nso strongly against the foundations of what is in that budget. It has \nbeen called a balanced budget. It is anything but balanced.\n  Overall, it is my understanding that there is an identification of \nsome $5 trillion that will be cut in spending, but nobody says where. \nThen they say: Oh, the budget is balanced. Well, as our leaders on \nappropriations know, we actually have to get in and say where it is \ngoing to be cut so we can balance the budget, which this does not do. \nIt does not balance the budget, and it is certainly unbalanced when it \ncomes to the values represented in the budget.\n  I have to start with the one issue that is so concerning to me, and \nthat is the whole question of Medicare. Once again we are seeing in the \nRepublican budget of the House the effort to eliminate Medicare. It \nbasically eliminates Medicare as an insurance plan. It basically says: \nYou go out and find private insurance. They changed the names to \ndifferent things. They tried to make it sound better, but it all comes \ndown to the fact that people will be given a voucher. Good luck trying \nto find private insurance.\n  It was the private insurance sector and the lack of affordable \ninsurance for seniors which created Medicare in 1965. As we get older, \nwe lose more health care because we are more expensive to cover. Before \nMedicare, it was very difficult to find affordable insurance. In fact, \nit was impossible for many people. As Americans we came together and \nsaid: If you are 65 or older or if you are disabled in this country, \nyou have the right to have insurance and health care available and \naffordable to you. We created a health insurance system called \nMedicare. By the way, Medicare costs dramatically less to administer \nthan any private sector plan. We are talking 3 percent or 4 percent to \nadminister Medicare as opposed to 15 percent, 20 percent, 25 percent \ngoing to administrative costs and profits and so on. So it is very \nefficient.\n  There are issues we need to address, and we have been doing that. In \nfact, we have put in place cost savings over the next 10 years by \neliminating overpayment to insurance companies that do what is called \nMedicare Advantage. It is interesting that while Chairman Ryan and the \nHouse Republicans say\n\n[[Page S1698]]\n\nthey are going to do away with Medicare, they put the $700 billion we \nsaved by stopping overpayments to insurance companies--as well as doing \nother things for prevention and cost savings--in their budget. After \ncriticizing it, they want the savings, but they turn around and want to \neliminate Medicare. It is a very interesting combination of things here \nthat is a hocus-pocus kind of approach with smoke-and-mirrors as far as \nhow they are coming up with their budget.\n  The bottom line is very clear: It guts Medicare. It guts Medicare, \nbut not in order to fund or strengthen Medicare services or health care \nservices in some way. The astounding thing is they continue to put \nforward a budget that guts Medicare in order to continue tax giveaways \nfor the very wealthy and well-connected people in this country. It \nmakes no sense. It makes no sense, and our budget will be very \ndifferent than this one.\n  Medicare has been a great American success story. Medicare and Social \nSecurity have lifted a generation of Americans out of poverty. It has \ngiven them the ability to live longer and healthier lives. It has \nallowed my mom, who is on her way to 87, to play with her now great-\ngrandchildren. By the way, my three grandchildren are the most \nbeautiful children in the world. My mom is able to play with them and \nbe healthy and active because of something called Medicare which was \nput in place to give her the opportunity to pay into a system so she \ncould have health care and be able to live a longer life. That is a \ngreat American success story.\n  We know we are living longer. The greatness of Medicare is that \npeople are healthier and living longer, and so we know we have to do \nsome refiguring here and have some savings. We are already doing that. \nOver the next 10 years we are putting in place $700 billion in savings \nby focusing more on prevention. We are focused more on wellness visits \nand helping people on the front end before they get very sick, as well \nas cutting overpayments.\n  We are now hearing that Medicare is going to have a $500 billion \nsavings as well, and that insurance rates and growth have actually \nslowed. We are seeing the actuaries reconfigure the savings. CBO, the \nbudget office, reconfigured the cost of Medicare and Medicaid to create \nmore savings because of things we have begun to do. Thanks to health \ncare reform we are able to focus more on prevention and people being \nable to see a doctor. We are able to do all those things that save \nmoney without cutting health care for people.\n  We are very committed to making sure we have savings in Medicare and \nthat we strengthen Medicare for the future. Whatever decisions we need \nto make, we need to do that for Social Security and other areas as \nwell. The difference we have is, we think it should exist. We think it \nshould exist as a health insurance plan. I cannot imagine any way in \nwhich our Senate majority would ever vote for what is in the budget \nthat was released by the Republican caucus today. So we are looking at \nvery different priorities.\n\n  In the area of Medicaid, we are also looking at very different \npriorities. The majority of Medicaid, in terms of the number of people, \nare children; the majority of money under Medicaid is actually spent on \nseniors--on nursing homes, people who are in extended care facilities, \nand so on. Again, when we think about the budget being released in the \nHouse of Representatives by Chairman Ryan and the Republicans, they go \nright to Medicare, eliminate Medicare as an insurance plan, and then \nthey block grant and cut Medicaid, which goes to the poorest seniors in \nnursing homes, so they get a double whammy in the budget that has been \nreleased by Chairman Ryan and the House of Representatives.\n  We also know they are slashing investments for middle-class families \nas well as the vulnerable, as well as public safety, police, and fire. \nI just left my mayors from Michigan coming in and talking about what \nhas happened to them on the frontlines. We have trickle-down cuts, and \nthey end up with it all in their laps, having to figure out how to \nprovide local services. When we talk about the fact that there would be \ndramatic disinvestments or cuts in public safety, police, fire, and so \non, they are appalled and desperately worried about how they are going \nto make sure they can respond to the people who live in their \ncommunities.\n  In education, cuts, of course, to Head Start, financial help for \npeople to be able to go to college, all of which are good things.\n  Roads and bridges.\n  Another piece that is very concerning to me is our nutrition programs \nwhich have been put in place for families who have challenges. People \nhave lost their jobs and they need some help with putting food on the \ntable for their families. We are seeing that program, the SNAP \nprogram--Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program--gutted with $160 \nbillion--$160 billion in cuts that would leave millions of children, \nmillions of families without help. Interestingly, the spending on the \nnutrition programs, on SNAP, is actually going down. Why? Because it is \nthere when people need it, when they have a crisis, and then the \nspending is not used when families go back to work. So we are seeing \nover $11 billion in decreases in spending because the economy is \nimproving and people are going back to work. That is the way we want to \nbring spending down.\n  Interestingly, within my purview as chair of the Agriculture \nCommittee, I am also deeply concerned about the cuts in the Republican \nbudget in the House to crop insurance. Within our farm bill, we have \ntwo disaster assistance programs. One is for families, which is \nnutrition assistance. It goes up and down with the economy. The other \nis crop insurance for farmers and ranchers, which goes up and down with \nthe economy.\n  We have had huge droughts and late freezes on our orchards and others \nwhere folks have been decimated, but because of crop insurance this \nyear, rather than doing ad hoc disaster assistance all over the \ncountry, we have crop insurance. People buy crop insurance are covered \nif they need it, and we have been able to see farmers sustain \nthemselves because crop insurance has worked. So crop insurance costs \nagain go up and down based on whether there are disasters. Supplemental \nnutrition goes up or down whether or not there is a family disaster. \nBoth of those are hit in this budget and make absolutely no sense.\n  I can assure my colleagues that in the farm bill we will present \nagain to colleagues as we did last year--and we are so grateful for the \nbipartisan support we had--we will strongly support efforts around crop \ninsurance as well as nutrition.\n  Finally, let me just say that very different values are presented in \nthe budget presented by Chairman Ryan and the Republicans in the House \nby going after the middle class, actually raising middle-class taxes in \norder to fund more tax breaks for the wealthy and the special interests \nin the country; gutting Medicare and using that money for additional \ntax cuts for the very wealthy; gutting our investments in science, \ninnovation, and education to grow the economy in order to pay for more \ntax cuts for the wealthy.\n  This story seems to go on and on and on. It always comes back to the \nsame place: The wealthy, the well connected, the special interests do \nvery well. Middle-class families get hit, seniors get hit, the \nvulnerable get hit, children are hit and are asked to pay the tab for \ntrying to bring down a deficit that, frankly, they didn't create. So \nthat is the story in the House.\n  Our chairwoman of the Budget Committee, Senator Murray, will present \na very different story tomorrow, one that is focused on growth in the \neconomy, supporting the middle class, protecting Medicare and Medicaid \nand Social Security for the future, and making investments that grow \nthe economy.\n  One of the things I know after working on the issue of jobs for a \nlong time is that we will never get out of debt with 12 million people \nout of work in this country, so we better be focused on jobs and \nsupporting the private sector to create jobs--large businesses, \nmanufacturers, small businesses, partnering on innovation, education, \nand so on. That has to be part of our long-term strategy to get out of \ndebt as well as making smart cuts and other kinds of smart investments.\n  Again, I come to the floor to commend colleagues who are on the floor \nshowing the right way to do things--to work together, to listen to each \nother, to work across the aisle on a bipartisan\n\n[[Page S1699]]\n\nbasis to get things done. We have a very different picture going on in \nthe budget committees. We have a long way to go when we start with \neliminating Medicare as we know it, but the House Republicans are \nsaying, no, we want to strengthen Medicare for the future and keep it \nintact for seniors. All the other issues we are in a very different \nplace. But I think it is very important that we make a commitment to \nlisten to each other and do our best to find a path forward. We need to \nfind a path. People are counting on us to get things done. They are \ncounting on us to both grow the economy and create jobs and have a \nstrong middle class and they are counting on us to reduce the deficit, \nall of which we can do if we are willing to work together and listen to \neach other and find a path forward.\n  I thank my colleagues for giving me the time. I wish to congratulate \nthem again on the work they are doing. I ask that we work together as \nwe go forward in completing the task on growing the economy and \nreducing the deficit.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, when I go back to Indiana and meet with \nHoosiers, they often ask why Washington seems to experience a crisis \nevery few weeks. It is a debt limit battle. It is a threat of a \ngovernment shutdown. It is the fiscal cliff on New Year's Eve. It is \nthe sequester. And the list goes on and on, including the funding \nbattle we are in now. Of course, the next round of the debt limit \ndebate is scheduled for May, and on and on it goes. Hoosiers and I \nthink most Americans--and I think most Members of this body--are \ngetting awfully tired of this soap opera drama that occurs every few \nweeks here.\n  I think we need to move to the point where we can address the major \nissues. One of the steps in doing that is to fund this government for \nthe next 6 months. I do not know of anyone here who wants a government \nshutdown. We do have some urgent things we need to do. We do need to \naddress our funding imbalance that is significantly creating a major \nproblem for us, but in order to get there, we have to do some interim \nthings here to keep the country functioning. We need to commit to go \nforward and do the big things. In the meantime a 6-month funding \nresolution has been brought forward here. There are things in this that \nnone of us are going to like. Everybody is going to have problems with \nparts of this. Everybody is going to think it should have been \nfashioned just a little bit differently.\n  The leaders of the Appropriations Committee have put a great effort \ninto constructing a resolution that I think will adequately fund this \ngovernment going forward, but they do so with the understanding that \nthe commitment to address our spending issues and the commitment to do \neverything we can to put together a large plan in order to deal with \noutgoing issues is absolutely necessary. Hopefully, that will be \naccomplished in the next few months. To start that, you have to have a \nbudget.\n  I am pleased now that we are going to be taking up a budget debate in \nterms of the next fiscal year's funding, and we will be taking that up \nnext week. So these two measures together, with the sequester that is \nalready in place and actions that have already been taken, hopefully \nwill be putting us on a path to fiscal health and solvency.\n  Every family, every business, even local and state governments have \nto operate on a budget or they cannot maintain and establish the kind \nof fiscal discipline necessary to get to the point where they are not \nspending more money than they are taking in. We have seen a cataclysmic \nplunge into debt that has enormous impact on the future of this \ncountry, and we have to address that.\n  Vice President Biden once said: Show me your budget, and I will tell \nyou what you value. Well, for 4 years we have been waiting to see a \nSenate budget, so we do not know what is valued. Finally, we are \ngetting to the point where we will address that.\n  I think the responsibility to provide a budget on which to operate is \nnot only lawful, as it is currently enshrined in our statutes, but it \nis a moral obligation we must fulfill as a body. Without casting blame \non one side or the other, it is time that we go through the budget \nprocess and establish the direction in which this government will go in \nterms of spending for the next fiscal year.\n  Given our soaring national debt and out-of-control spending, \neventually we are going to have to make very tough choices that we have \nbeen avoiding for years. The more we prolong these challenges we face \nand the longer we wait to act, the harder it is going to be. We have \nthe responsibility to wisely spend the taxpayers' dollars and not to \nask more of them than is absolutely necessary to perform our essential \nfunctions.\n  I am urging my colleagues to go forward in doing what is necessary to \nkeep this government operating but do so with the commitment that we \nwill address these tough questions, that we will address the necessary \nprocedures and make the tough, necessary decisions to put our country \non a fiscal path to health. Without that, we are jeopardizing our \nfuture, and we are condemning millions of Americans to unemployment or \nunderemployment. We are growing at half the historic rate and have been \nfor the last 4 years. If this stands the way it is, we will continue to \nsee a country in decline, and, more importantly, we will continue to \nsee people hurting. We will continue to see people without meaningful \nwork. We will continue to see an inability to provide the kinds of \nopportunities, innovation, and creativity that have made this country \nso successful in the past.\n  So with that, Madam President, there does not appear to be anyone \nready to speak. I am happy to stop now, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, in the midst of this momentous \ndebate, truly one which will determine the future of the country, I \nrise on a matter of equal importance, in my view.\n  Today we welcomed to the Capitol 26 bicyclists, riders who left \nSaturday morning on this journey. This journey led them to travel the \nroads from Newtown, CT, to dramatize the importance of actions against \ngun violence in the United States.\n  I have said about Newtown that we saw on December 14 of last year \nenormous evil and depravity in the deaths of 20 beautiful, innocent \nchildren and 6 dedicated, courageous educators who literally perished \ntrying to save the lives of those children. We saw evil that day in \nConnecticut, but we also saw enormous goodness and heroism in the \neducators who sought to save those children and the first responders \nwho charged into the school. They did so not knowing what would befall \nthem, what they would see, and thereby stopped the massacre.\n  The community came together in support of the families and all who \nwere affected so deeply by that tragedy. This community has \ndemonstrated enormous strength and courage over these months. It is an \nexample of the quintessential values which make us proud to be an \nAmerican.\n  The riders who came to the Capitol, who rode from Newtown on a rough \nand difficult journey, also showed something profoundly significant and \nimportant about Newtown as a community, as well as about themselves. \nThey included as an honorary rider a parent of one of the victims, \nChris McDonnell, who was at the departure, and his wife, Lynn, who was \nalso there at the beginning, although she didn't ride.\n  They carried with them, those 26 riders, the memory of Grace \nMcDonnell. As one of them said--, Monte Frank, who organized and led \nthe effort--Grace was on their wheels. They carried with them the \nmemory of Grace, but they also carried the hopes and\n\n[[Page S1700]]\n\nhearts of America. Everywhere they went on that journey, people stopped \nthem, thanked them and honored them, as I seek to do today here on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two letters, \nboth written to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the ranking \nmember, along with Senators Murphy and myself, letters written by Lynn \nand Chris McDonnell and a separate letter written by the families of \nsome of those victims.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 11, 2013.\n     Hon.

Chris Murphy,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senators Grassley, Blumenthal, and \n     Murphy: We are 32 family members of victims who were killed \n     in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December \n     14, 2012--innocent children and their educators responsibly \n     going about their day.\n       No one can describe our pain and the brutal day-to-day \n     emotions we suffer. No one can bring our loved ones back and \n     no one from our community of Newtown, Connecticut will ever \n     go back to ``normal.''\n       In the midst of our anguish we have learned about the \n     dangerous loopholes in our nation's gun laws and we are \n     compelled to speak out to save others from suffering what we \n     have endured. We are writing today to express our deep \n     conviction and support for the President's plan to reduce gun \n     violence in America.\n       Specifically we are asking members of Congress to:\n       1. Require a criminal background check for every gun sold \n     in America that includes a review of all disqualifying \n     records and meaningful record keeping for all sales--in the \n     same manner that Federally licensed dealers are currently \n     required;\n       2. Ban military-style assault weapons and high-capacity \n     ammunition magazines; and\n       3. Make gun trafficking a federal crime, with real \n     penalties for straw purchasers;\n       The epidemic of injury and death from gun violence is a \n     plague on America, especially since the toll it takes on our \n     families is preventable. Our nation's families deserve to be \n     safe and free in their schools, movie theaters, workplaces \n     and their homes. We ask Congress, in honor and memory of our \n     loved ones, to support the measures that the President has \n     put forward to help stem the epidemic of gun violence.\n       Our precious children and family members who were so \n     brutally murdered on December 14th deserve nothing less.\n           Sincerely,\n       Jackie Barden, Mother of Daniel Barden; Mark Barden, Father \n     of Daniel Barden; Neil Heslin, Father of Jesse Lewis; \n     Veronique Pozner, Mother of Noah Pozner; Len Pozner, Father \n     of Noah Pozner; Gilles Rousseau, Father of Lauren Rousseau; \n     Teresa Rousseau, Mother of Lauren Rousseau; Andrew Rousseau, \n     Brother of Lauren Rousseau; Matthew Rousseau, Brother of \n     Lauren Rousseau; Suzanne Connors, Sister of Mary Sherlach; \n     Jane Dougherty, Sister of Mary Sherlach; Joseph Greene, \n     Brother of Mary Sherlach; Carlos Soto, Father of Victoria \n     Soto; Donna Soto, Mother of Victoria Soto; Carlee Soto, \n     Sister of Victoria Soto; Carlos M.

Chris Murphy,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy, Grassley, Blumenthal and Murphy, On \n     December 14th our family was forever torn apart by gun \n     violence. On that day we lost the love and light of our \n     family, our daughter Grace. Grace and nineteen of her 1st \n     grade classmates and six teachers were senselessly murdered \n     at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. One can not describe the \n     pain and anguish that our family has experienced, a pain that \n     goes beyond just our immediate family, but permeates our \n     entire community.\n       In the wake of our darkest day, we have become acutely \n     aware that the state of our gun laws in America is at best \n     ineffective. While no one thing led to the devastation that \n     occurred in Sandy Hook on December 14th, it will be a \n     compressive approach that leads us to preventing such loss of \n     life in the future.\n       We are writing today to express our conviction and support \n     for the President's plan to reduce gun violence in America. \n     Specifically we are appealing to members of Congress to:\n       Require a comprehensive criminal background check for every \n     gun sold in America that includes a review of all \n     disqualifying records and meaningful record keeping for all \n     sales--in the same manner that Federally licensed gun dealers \n     are required;\n       Ban all military-style assault weapons and high capacity \n     ammunition magazines;\n       Establish gun trafficking as a federal crime, with \n     substantial penalties for straw purchasers.\n       We hope that all of our nation's elected representatives \n     will step forward with the moral courage and commitment \n     needed to tackle the grave issue of gun violence that \n     confronts us. We ask that action is chosen over inaction when \n     it comes to protecting the most vulnerable among us, our \n     children.\n       We appeal to you as parents to honor the memories of those \n     lives lost at Sandy Hook and support the measures that the \n     President has put forward to reduce the epidemic of gun \n     violence.\n       That much is owed to our children.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Chris & Lynn McDonnell.\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. These letters summarize the reason for their journey \nin very specific terms, stating:\n\n       In the midst of our anguish we have learned about the \n     dangerous loopholes in the Nation's gun laws, and we are \n     compelled to speak out to save others from suffering what we \n     have endured. We are writing today to express our deep \n     conviction and support for the President's plan to reduce gun \n     violence in America.\n       Specifically, we are asking Members of Congress to:\n       1. Require a criminal background check for every gun sold \n     in America that includes a review of all disqualifying \n     records and meaningful recordkeeping for all sales--in the \n     same manner that federally licensed dealers are currently \n     required;\n       2. Ban military-style assault weapons and high-capacity \n     ammunition magazines; and\n       3. Make gun trafficking a Federal crime, with real \n     penalties for straw purchasers.\n       The epidemic of injury and death from gun violence is a \n     plague on America, especially since the toll it takes on our \n     families is preventable.\n\n  The letters go on.\n  As I told them when they arrived, an event which was electric, \nliterally in the shadow of the Capitol, their journey sent a message. \nVery simply, all of us who believe we must stop a scourge and epidemic \nof gun violence, all of us must keep on pedaling. We must do as they \ndid. Even though our road, like theirs, may be rough and uphill at \ntimes, we need to keep on pedaling and working. Never give up. We need \nto keep faith with those victims and their families, the 26 victims of \nthat massacre at Sandy Hook. When they rode to Congress, their message \nto us is we need to keep faith with those victims and assure Newtown \nnever happens again. If it happened in Newtown, it can happen anywhere \nin America. It is not just a mass shooting which is involved, it is the \n2,500 people who have been victims of gun violence since December 14, \nall around Connecticut, all around the Nation, not only in communities \nsuch as Newtown, the quintessential New England town, but on the \nstreets of Bridgeport, New Haven, Hartford, in neighborhoods, in big \ncities, rural areas, and suburban towns.\n  Team 26 is really Team Connecticut and Team America. It brings those \nvalues, courage, and strength Newtown had shown to Congress. Congress \nneeds to heed and hear the country, just as people on their route \nhonored Team 26. The American people believe we must do something about \ngun violence in America. They believe overwhelmingly, the polls show \n80, 90 percent on all of these issues. They want action from this \nCongress.\n  As the President of the United States said to all of us in his State \nof the Union, the American people want a vote. The victims' families \nfrom Tucson, Virginia Tech, and Aurora deserve a vote. This is why Team \n26 made this journey, and why they embody the conscience of America. \nThe letters they\n\n[[Page S1701]]\n\nhave written to Senators here call for action on measures which are \ncommon sense and common ground. We can reach a bipartisan compromise if \nwe recognize the carnage, death, and destruction that is the result of \ngun violence in America.\n  These measures are law enforcement tools. Background checks enable \nenforcement of existing laws, the prohibition against criminals, drug \naddicts, domestic abusers, and the seriously mentally ill from \npurchasing guns, not just from federally licensed dealers. Background \nchecks are necessary to enforce that law, just as is the prohibition on \npurchase of ammunition by those same categories of people. Likewise, \nthe Federal ban on illegal trafficking and straw purchases is necessary \nto enforce existing prohibition. We have work to do.\n  I want to conclude by thanking those who are all family, who have \nstood strong and spoken out. Every time they do, it is with grief and \npain. Anyone who spent time with them--and I have been privileged to \nspend hours and hours, days, over these past months with those \nfamilies, as well as first responders, who still bear the scars, \nemotional scars, which are deeply felt.\n  I have great admiration for their courage and strength. I hope this \nbody will take heart from it and will take their leadership as a \nmessage we must act, we must vote, we must do something about gun \nviolence in America.\n  I am proud to welcome Team 26.\n  I ask unanimous consent the full list of all riders and their support \ngroup be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Rider #1.

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I wish to comment on the remarks by \nour colleague from Connecticut, Senator Blumenthal.\n  I say to the Senator, we in Maryland want to once again express our \ncondolences to the people of Newtown. We have lost people in gun \nviolence, nothing like you have, but we have it there. Most recently \nwhen a high school opened, a young man who needed mental help came in \nand one of our young men was shot. Fortunately, he survived. He is an \nintellectually challenged young man, full of spunk. He has been made an \nhonorary Raven, honorary Oriole. Lady Gaga, who is his favorite, even \nsent him CDs.\n  We need to deal with this issue. We need to deal with guns and--I \nagree with the NRA--we need to deal with mental health. We need to put \nmental health in the Federal checkbook to train the professionals, do \nthe research and know we are doing the right thing.\n  One of the fathers from the Newtown tragedy has cycled through \nMaryland to raise the issue through all of the awful rain in the only \nway he can to speak up for his daughter.\n  I want to congratulate the Senator and his colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Murphy, for continuing to be steadfast. I wish to \nsay we support you not only with words but deeds. It is wonderful to \nexpress our condolences, to send toys to the children, to do all of \nthat. We need to put money in the Federal checkbook. We must first of \nall confirm our BATF Administrator. The very person in charge of guns \nshould be confirmed. We need to then look at our own legislation about \nillegal guns, all of what the Senator is talking about.\n  On the mental health side, the Senator was a member of the HELP \nCommittee. I know now Senator Murphy of Connecticut is on the HELP \nCommittee, the Presiding Officer also. We need to look, even now as we \nlook at the CR, how we may do the right research.\n  I wish to close with one melancholy thing, which is a consequence of \nthe sequester. Senator Harkin with the HELP Committee held a hearing on \nmental health. The Director of the Institute on Mental Health was on \nthat committee, and I believe the Presiding Officer was there. I asked \nhim what would be the consequences of sequester on the National \nInstitute of Mental Health, since everyone wants mental health, and \nthat is the research.\n  This is what he replied: We are not going to fund certain research \nprojects.\n  Let me tell you one that holds such promise it is going to be a sad \nday for us not to do it. Here is the test--and, please, I am not a \nscientist and certainly not a neurological scientist. But there are \ncertain kinds of mental health problems that come on onset, \nparticularly on young males, who are postpuberty, often after high \nschool or as they go into college. As in Aurora, the young man who shot \nthe people was already a graduate student. These things come on.\n  The Director of the NIH mental health said they wanted to do research \nfor early detection, biochemical as well as environmental. This is not \nto earmark, paint them in a corner, or push them in a corner and \nstigmatize them, but they could receive that help early.\n  We need to know more. Whether that study is a good idea--I am sure it \nis, it is peer reviewed--I wish to say to the Senator, the reason we \nneed to get this bill done, the budget done, and go on to regular order \nis to actually put money in the Federal checkbook to do what the \nAmerican people want. We can do great gun control legislation on the \nthis floor, but I want to support that mental health component.\n  I call upon the NRA and all of its members to support us to move the \nFederal budget, look at the mental health aspects. I believe we would \nhave bipartisan support. I believe we would have grassroots support. At \nthe end of the day not only would we prevent gun violence, but along \nthe way, the President's brain initiative. We could learn a lot more \nand we could help our people. This is what I mean when I say we need to \nfund compelling human need and do the research. But I salute the \nSenator for his advocacy. And my condolences to the people of Newtown, \nbut not with words, let's get to the deeds and let's get the deeds \ndone.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I wish to briefly thank my great colleague and friend \nfor those remarks stated so eloquently. I could not agree more. Mental \nhealth has to be part of a comprehensive strategy, as does school \nsafety. No single measure for gun violence control can do it alone.\n  That is why I began by referring to the momentous debate we are \nhaving today about the future of initiatives such as mental health. And \nI join in challenging the NRA--for all its opposition, staunch and \nsteadfast, against any measure trying to stem or stop gun violence in \nAmerica--to join in seeking common ground on mental health initiatives \nand other measures that are common sense. I urge gun owners--\nresponsible people who enjoy recreation and hunting--as well as others \nwho are intent on stopping violence in America to support these mental \nhealth services for diagnosis and treatment. That is why I have joined \nin those measures as well for the Judiciary Committee and the HELP \nCommittee.\n  But I really wish to thank the Senator from Maryland for her \nincomparable and invaluable leadership on this issue.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n[[Page S1702]]\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I think today has been an interesting \nday here in the Senate. We have been trying--the Senator from Maryland \nand I--to get the bill we have been talking about to the floor so \npeople will have an opportunity to offer their amendments, to debate \ntheir amendments, and we in the Senate will be able to vote them up or \ndown. That is what this process is about.\n  Although I know it is getting late in the evening, I am hoping we can \nlock in some time agreement with the leadership. I am sure Senator Reid \nand Senator McConnell are working on that, as well as Senator McCain \nand Senator Coburn. But if we could get started on this tomorrow and \nhave a healthy debate, there are some issues that ought to be brought \nup.\n  I wish to take a few minutes to review a few of the outlines of what \nwe hope to accomplish this week--what is in this bill and what is not.\n  What this bill would do is allow agencies the additional ability to \naddress priorities in light of sequester cuts. We all know they were \nDraconian--good policy, as I said, but bad process. The proposed \nlegislation the Senator from Maryland and I are bringing to the floor, \nhopefully, is in full compliance with the spending caps required by the \nBudget Control Act, and it brings, with the sequester, the total to \nunder $1 trillion. So we are doing some serious cutting, but we ought \nto do it wisely by what we do.\n  Both sides have given in to get to where we are. There is no new \nfunding for ObamaCare, no new funding for Dodd-Frank, no State-specific \nearmarks.\n  The bill enables the Department of Defense--and we all care about \nsecurity--to better implement sequester, and it increases the DOD \ntransfer authority for reprogramming, thus mitigating a portion of the \nnational security impact of the sequester and other across-the-board \ncuts.\n  The bill also ensures that veterans programs receive adequate \nfunding--$2.5 billion above the fiscal year 2012 levels--for VA \ndiscretionary spending. So that is a good increase.\n  The bill requires greater accountability of government employees \nattending conferences, including associated expenses, so that we don't \nread these horror stories of people going to conventions and living \nhigh off the hog while people are struggling to make ends meet.\n  The bill also prohibits the transfer of Guantanamo prisoners to the \nUnited States, among other things.\n  The legislation would provide additional funding for worldwide \ndiplomatic and facility security in the post-Benghazi environment. When \nwe send somebody overseas, we want to make sure, whether it is an \nAmbassador, an employee, or somebody going temporarily, that they are \nas safe as we can keep them. We know we live in a dangerous world, and \nsome parts of the world are more dangerous than others.\n  This bill provides over a $3.1 billion increase over fiscal year 2012 \nin assistance to Israel. Israel is the only democracy--I believe a real \none--in that area and is a great friend of ours.\n  The legislation keeps in place the pay freeze for Federal employees \nfor the remainder of this year, the fiscal year ending September 2013.\n  The bill prohibits distribution of any funds to ACORN, its \nsubsidiaries, or successors.\n  It rescinds $50 million from the EPA to restrict its ability to \nimplement certain environmental regulations.\n  It rescinds $10 million from the ObamaCare, as we call it, \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board, which is the rationing board, some \npeople call it.\n  The bill continues a provision to clarify the prohibition of Federal \nfunds being used to lobby State and local legislative and executive \nauthorities.\n  These are just some of the provisions in here, but I think tomorrow \nwe will talk about more. Overall, I think we have put together a worthy \nand credible package, and I hope the Senate will soon get a chance to \nstart debating it seriously.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I would like to compliment the Senator \nfrom Alabama, my vice chairman. He outlined how we tried to look at \nthis bill and scrub it for nonsense or no sense, OK?\n  I know we are waiting for the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, to \nlift his hold. I know he is looking closely at the bill. A few years \nago, when I was moving the Commerce-Justice bill, he found that one of \nthe agencies was hosting a conference and they were paying $4 a \nmeatball, so we called it the lavish meatball amendment. Often, the \nSenator from Oklahoma has great ideas. You know, Madam President, that \npeople from Oklahoma have great ideas, and so we would like him, as \nquickly as he can, to lift the hold so we can move our bill and he can \noffer amendments. And I hope he is scrubbing it. I am sure somewhere he \nwill find a rogue meatball. I don't want to minimize what he is doing. \nHe really does scrub for foolishness and folly, and if he has a \nfoolishness-and-folly amendment, I probably will support it. I can't \ntolerate it either. My constituents really work hard for their money, \nand they want the money they pay in taxes to work hard for them.\n  So, Madam President, I see the distinguished majority leader here on \nthe floor. I am hoping that we are going to have a solution to some of \nthat deadlock here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it used to be, before the last Congress, \nthe Senate had two speeds: one for deliberation and one for getting \nthings done. Senators saved the deliberation speed for truly great \nissues of the day, and when we needed to get the country's business \ndone, we came together to work things out. It used to be that all \nappropriations legislation was business the Senate came together to \nwork on and to finish. Sometimes it was 1 day, sometimes it took 4 or 5 \ndays, but we got it done.\n  These days--for the last 3 years--the Senate has one speed: slow--\nreal slow. And we haven't had appropriations bills for a number of \nyears because we haven't been able to do them because of the speed--\nslow. Even when we are talking about preventing a government shutdown, \neven when there is broad agreement across party lines that we want to \nprevent a government shutdown, even then we are stuck in slow.\n  Madam President, when we got the bill from the House, I didn't like \nit especially, but, as I said earlier--and I still feel this way--the \nSpeaker at least got it to us at a decent hour, not at the last minute. \nThese two good Senators, Shelby and Mikulski, worked very hard for days \nto get this done. Now, frankly, I didn't like some of the things \nSenator Mikulski agreed to, but I was with her, and we agreed to do the \nthings together because we wanted to get a bill done. We swallowed a \nlot of pride. She gave up things in her bill she has worked on for \ndecades and gave in to others so that they would feel better about this \nbill.\n  So then we come here today and are blindsided. This bill has been in \nthe public for days. It passed the House last week, and 85 to 90 \npercent of the bill that is the so-called amendment was in the House \nbill.\n  We are going to finish this bill or not finish it before the recess. \nIf we can't get 60 votes, then it will fail and the government will \nshut down but not for anything we have done--not for anything we have \ndone. We have a few Senators who are doing everything they can--and \nhave been doing it for years--to throw a monkey wrench into everything \nwe do here. We should have been legislating today.\n  I came to the floor last week and said we are going to have a CR, we \nare going to have amendments. I said that when we opened the Senate \nyesterday. I have tried my best to move to this bill.\n  The Senate cannot continue like this. I took everyone at good faith \nat the beginning of this Congress when we made a few changes. I thought \nthose changes would be helpful. To this point, they have done zero \nbecause we have had no cooperation from the Republicans.\n  The Senate has changed, Madam President. I am sorry the Presiding \nOfficer, who has a wonderful background, has not seen the Senate and \nhow it really should work. A small group of Senators has kept the \nSenate in slow, slow gear. They have prevented us from even starting \ndebate on this important bill. We can't even start the debate on it. \nPeople want to offer amendments.\n\n[[Page S1703]]\n\nWe had Senator Harkin waiting to offer an amendment, and we had Senator \nCruz here waiting to offer amendments. They can't. We are through for \nthe night, so we have wasted basically 2 days when we could have been \nconsidering amendments to this bill, and that is a shame.\n  We have a limited number of Senate days. In our lives, we have a \nlimited number of days. The time of the Senate is too precious to spend \nit this way, so I am filing cloture on this bill. We will have a vote \non proceeding to it on Thursday. How about that? Isn't that great? We \nare going to vote to proceed to it. So we will be on the bill Thursday, \nand we can start offering amendments on Thursday.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  I have a cloture motion at the desk, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I hope the record is very clear that I do \nnot criticize Senator Shelby. He has done his best. He was a tremendous \nadvocate for what he thought should be in this bill. But we are going \nto have Senators stand up and talk about what is wrong with this place \nwhen, after all the work that goes into a bipartisan bill, we are \nstymied from going to that bill and offering amendments.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, a question for the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. This is tough, but the leader has to govern the Senate \nand move the bill. But a question for the people who watch us and don't \nknow what all these parliamentary maneuvers mean. If there is an \nagreement to move forward with amendments, is it possible that tomorrow \nwe could vitiate it?\n  Mr. REID. With the tremendous work Senator Coburn has to put into \nthis so he can finish it in the next 12 hours, maybe we can move to the \nbill tomorrow. But I know he has a lot of work to do on the bill, so we \nwill have to see how he feels about it tomorrow.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I really want to thank my vice \nchairman, Senator Shelby, for being on the floor all day today in \nanticipation that we would have already voted on two amendments. I \nthink he and I both regret the present situation.\n  I would hope the Senator who has grave concerns and waited to read \nthe bill could really finish it overnight. We worked every night, I \nmust say, not only my staff, but in talking to the Senator, and we were \navailable to each other by phone. I was talking to Congressman Rogers, \nour House counterpart, and we were working. I know that Saturday night \nwe didn't close out until 9 o'clock at night; Sunday, not until 11 \no'clock at night. That is why we wanted to get this over, so they could \nlook at it.\n  So I say to those holding up the bill, I would like you to work \nthrough the evening the way we worked through the evening. If you want \nto see if there are other issues--and we acknowledge the Senator's \nright to do that, but, really, we do not want to face a shutdown, and \nthere is this other issue of the Budget Committee that we would like to \nget on the floor. What a great message to the American people that with \ngood will and sensibility and give-and-take--and there was a lot of \ngive-and-take--we can govern.\n  My hope is that by the time we get to the end of next week--actually, \nthe end of this week--we will have passed the continuing funding \nresolution and we will have passed a budget, with ample debate.\n  The Senator and I, House Members, Senate Members--we welcome \namendments. We welcome debate. But what is frustrating to me is that we \nhave had a very interesting day, but we had two amendments pending, two \ndifferent viewpoints on health care and human services. We could have \ndebated and been able to dispose of them in a way that would have \nbrought honor to the institution and moved our legislation forward.\n  So let's show we can govern. Let's really show we can govern. And I \nhope we can get to our bill tomorrow and not necessarily go through the \nwhole usual filibuster rules.\n  Again, I thank the vice chairman, Senator Shelby. I thank Senator \nMcConnell for the way he helped and conferred on many issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I want everyone to hear what I am saying \nnow. If somebody comes to me and says: You can get on the bill if you \ngive me these amendments, I won't agree. We will have cloture on it on \nThursday.\n  We are through the dealmaking stage. We have been dealmaking on this \nbill--an important piece of legislation--for more than a week, and if a \nSenator comes to me and says: You can go to the bill tomorrow, but I \nwant to make sure I have all these amendments, the answer is no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, had we been able to move to this bill, \nwe could have probably debated already and voted on a number of \namendments because this is very essential legislation. There is a lot \nin this bill, a lot of good in this proposed legislation.\n  I hope that reason will prevail and that people, even if they have \nsome amendments, will come to the floor, as I said earlier, and offer \nthem. Let's debate them, and let's get to regular order, up or down. \nThat is what it is about. But I think the essentials of this bill are \nsolid and good. We have gone into this, and we will go into it more and \nmore. We want the process to work, but the process is not going to work \nif we don't get the bill up so we can go to the regular order.\n  So I hope tonight that things will work out and we will get going. \nThis is important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I came to the floor to speak on an \nentirely different issue, but before I do that, I would like to commend \nAppropriations Chair Mikulski--and I do like saying that, \nAppropriations Chair Mikulski--and Ranking Member Shelby for all of the \nwork they and their staffs and the other Senators on the Appropriations \nCommittee have done to try to put together a continuing resolution that \nis going to keep this government open.\n  I share the frustration and the concern we have heard expressed on \nthe floor tonight about the hold-up when we thought there was agreement \nto get this done.\n  So I appreciate all the work that has been done, and hopefully we can \nget past this and get this bill done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator from New Hampshire is a member of the \nAppropriations Committee; is that correct?\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. That is correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Is this her first year on the committee?\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. It is.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Does the Senator from New Hampshire know what regular \norder is? This is not a quiz.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I was hoping to learn that this session because \nunfortunately we have not had a lot of regular order in terms of moving \nappropriations bills and the budget through the Senate. As I talk to my \nconstituents,\n\n[[Page S1704]]\n\nthey really want to see us do that. They want to see us work together \nto move the agenda forward for this country, just as the chairwoman and \nSenator Shelby have done in the last week.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator is exactly right. What we are trying to do \nis to run a rescue operation to keep the continuing funding going on--\nreally, the President will submit his budget next week, and the Budget \nCommittee will be off and running. We will actually hold hearings on \nevery subcommittee, and it will be an open and transparent process. \nMembers will be able to participate, and we will return to that bill by \nbill. When you are dealing with a bill that has all 12 subcommittees in \nit and it is $1 trillion, they think, wow. But we are going to do that \nregular order.\n  I thank the Senator. I am so happy she is on the committee. I look \nforward to showing her what regular order is.\n  I know the Senator is going to stand up, as she has done on so many \noccasions, to champion the cause of women; is that correct?\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. That is correct. And I appreciate the leadership the \nSenator has shown.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Well, in the dignified way of the Senate and the way we \ntalk, go for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/12/senate-section/article/S1704-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, the world came together once again \nlast week to celebrate International Women's Day. Today I want to \nbelatedly commemorate that special day here on the floor of the Senate \nand welcome the passage of this year's International Women's Day \nresolution, which I am proud to say that I cosponsored on a bipartisan \nbasis with my colleague Senator Collins, and we had 14 other cosponsors \non that resolution.\n  International Women's Day is observed all over the world. It honors \nthe economic, political, and social achievements of women past, \npresent, and future. It also highlights just how far women around the \nworld still have to go and the many barriers and closed doors they \ncontinue to face in the fight for equal rights and opportunities.\n  I want to recognize and celebrate this year's nine recipients of the \n2013 State Department International Women of Courage Awards. This \nprestigious annual award recognizes women who have shown exceptional \nleadership in advocating for women's rights and empowerment around the \nglobe, often at great risk to their own well-being.\n  One of those recipients I want to talk about is Razan Zeitunah. She \nis a human rights lawyer in Syria, and she has made it her mission to \ntrack the ongoing atrocities that have been committed by the Assad \nregime. Mrs. Zeitunah was forced into hiding after the government \naccused her of being a foreign agent when she began reporting on these \natrocities. Despite living in fear for her life, with her husband in \nprison, Mrs. Zeitunah continues to risk so much to make sure the world \nknows all about Assad's brutal crackdown on the people of Syria.\n  She is one of nine remarkable women who are being honored by the \nState Department this year, each with an equally inspirational story to \ntell.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the names of \nall nine honorees.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Malalai Bahaduri\n       Tsering Woeser\n       Julieta Castellanos\n       Nirbhaya ``Fearless''\n       Dr. Josephine Obiajulu Odumakin\n       Elena Milashina\n       Fartuun Adan\n       Razan Zeitunah\n       Ta Phong Tan\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. While I am very pleased that the Senate was able to \ntake up and pass the International Women's Day resolution last night, I \nam also extremely disappointed that this bipartisan resolution was \nobjected to at the eleventh hour over a clause that addressed the \nimpact of our changing climate on women in developing nations, and I \njust want to read that clause.\n\n       Whereas, according to the International Union for \n     Conservation of Nature, women in developing countries are \n     disproportionately affected by changes in climate because of \n     their need to secure water, food, and fuel for their \n     livelihood.\n\n  That was the extent of the clause that was objected to. \nUnfortunately, this clause from the resolution was blocked by a Member \nof the Senate on the other side of the aisle. It was a clause that was \nincluded in the 2011 resolution that unanimously passed in the Senate.\n  Just this past weekend, Navy Admiral Locklear, the commander of the \nU.S. Pacific Command, was asked during a 2-day trip to New England what \nwas the biggest long-term security threat facing the Pacific region. \nHis answer was very clear: climate change--this from an admiral who is \ndealing with a bellicose North Korea and escalating conflict between \nJapan and China in the East China Sea. His answer to what is the \nbiggest threat to America is climate change. Yet we have one of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle who objected to a clause that \npoints out what is very clear in data around the world, and that is the \nimpact changes in our climate are having on women who are so often the \nfood gatherers for their families.\n  This issue of climate change is not going away anytime soon. We can \ndeny that it exists, but it exists. The data is clear, and I believe we \nneed to come together to address this serious concern to help other \ncountries find ways of mitigating the harmful effects of climate \nchange.\n  Just as climate change deserves attention, we also need to continue \nour effort to promote equal rights and equal opportunities for women \neverywhere. We know that all of society benefits when women are more \nfully integrated into their communities and countries, and we need to \nremain focused on this effort. That is why International Women's Day is \nso important, and that is why passing a resolution to talk about that \nin this body is so important.\n  I am sorry we couldn't agree on everything, but I do think it is \nimportant for us to recognize International Women's Day and also to \npoint out areas of disagreement that clearly are going to remain at the \nforefront in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I was sitting in my office listening to \nSenator Reid, meeting with my staff on the bill we have on the floor, \nand I wanted to explain to the American people what this bill is.\n  This bill was published last night at 9:00. We got it at about 9:45. \nIt spends well over $1 trillion. And I agree with the majority leader, \nit is important that we pass this bill, but knowing what is in it \nbefore you can decide where you would like to try to amend it is asking \nsomething of Senators that they can't give.\n  So I understand the majority leader's frustration, but I would also \nmake a couple points.\n  In this bill is $8 billion taken out of the victims' compensation \nfund. That is not tax money. That is money which criminals have paid \ninto a fund to give restitution to children and women around this \ncountry for the harm that has occurred from the crime that has been \ncommitted upon them, and we are stealing $8 billion from that fund. In \nthis bill, we are taking it away--not tax dollars but fines and \npenalties--and we are going to spend it somewhere else. You talk about \nbeing for women and children? This bill is exactly the opposite of \nthat. Money that is due them we are not going to let them have. We are \ngoing to go spend it somewhere else.\n  So knowing those things are in the bill is one of the reasons we \nought to read the bill before we can know whether we are going to offer \namendments on it.\n  I would also make one final point. The vast majority of this bill \npassed the Appropriations Committee in the Senate last spring and early \nsummer. There is not one of the things that are in this bill that the \nAppropriations Committee hadn't already done, and we had a deliberate \nchoice to not put these bills on the floor last time. So if we are in a \nsnit over the problems we are having, it is because the bills didn't \ncome in regular order to the floor of the Senate so there could have \nbeen a conference.\n\n[[Page S1705]]\n\n  By the way, the House passed 12 of the 13. Our committees worked 12 \nof the 13 out. So they came out in regular process. They were not \nallowed to come to the floor.\n  We have just about finished studying the bill. We have no problems \nmoving on the bill and giving consent to move on the bill once we have \nlooked at the bill. But for the majority leader to say that Members of \nthe Senate can't have amendments after having their staff work since \n9:45 last night to look at the bill and attempt to make amendments to \nthe bill, that doesn't fit on a trillion-dollar bill. And when the \nAmerican people find out what is in this bill that should not be in it, \nand the options that we can offer of what should be in it, I think they \nare going to agree that maybe we ought to make some changes.\n  I understand the frustration of the majority leader, but I also \nunderstand our rights. This is not about filibustering anything. This \nis about being an informed Senator who knows what you are doing and \nknows how to make a decision about how to amend the bill. We can call \nit something other than that, but it is not. It is about doing our job. \nThe fact is, we got this last night.\n  What I would say to everybody who was fine with us going on it \nwithout having read it, I would say there is a problem with their \nposition in the Senate in terms of their oath to do what they were sent \nhere to do, which is to read what you are voting on, know what you are \nvoting, and prepare amendments to what you are voting on.\n  We have this outburst at 16 hours after we got an almost 600-page \nbill? That doesn't fit with any common sense. We have instructed our \nside we are willing to go ahead and allow this to move forward but in a \nprocess that recognizes that this bill is not perfect, just as both the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee and the ranking member said. \nWe do not have any problems with it moving forward. We do have problems \nspending money we don't have on things we don't need, and we ought to \nbe able to offer amendments that would highlight that whether the body \nagrees with it or not--that would highlight it so the American people \ncan see it. We may not be allowed, based on what the majority leader \nsaid, to offer any amendments. He is the majority leader. But if that \nis the case, we are probably going to be here all through the weekend \nbecause that is a right each Senator has and they ought to be able to \noffer them--especially on a $1 trillion appropriations bill.\n  I hope Senator Reid has a good night's sleep. I will try to call him \nin the morning and work out an accommodation that will allow this bill \nto move so we do not have to be here on the weekend. I don't want to be \nhere this weekend, but I will if it is the right thing to get the point \nout and let American people know.\n  Right now we are having no tours of the White House. I can show you \nhundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars that are under the \ncontrol of the executive that they could save that are a whole lot less \nimportant than tours of the White House. The same goes for us in the \noperation of our House, in terms of the Senate and the House.\n  I am sorry I irritated Senator Reid. I am sorry he is upset with me, \nbut I am going to do my job. I have been here, I am in my ninth year, \nand I have always kept my obligation to the people of this country to \nmake sure I am thinking about the long term, I am thinking about \npriority on how we spend money and the best way, the right way, and \noffering amendments, whether they pass or not, offering those ideas. \nThat is because that is not only my privilege but it is my obligation.\n  With that I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/12/senate-section/article/S1705-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING YVONNE RICE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

HANNAH GAY\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, today I rise to recognize the work of \nDr. Hannah Gay, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the \nUniversity of Mississippi Medical Center's Blair E. Batson Hospital for \nChildren in Jackson, MS. On March 3, the news broke that one of Dr. \nGay's patients, a baby born with the human immunodeficiency virus, or \nHIV, had been ``functionally cured'' of the infection. Now 2\\1/2\\ years \nold, this child is only the second person in history to be cured of the \nvirus. The infant was born to her HIV-infected mother at a rural \nMississippi hospital and then transported to the University of \nMississippi Medical Center, where she came under the care of Dr. Gay. \nOnly 30 hours after the baby was born, Dr. Gay began an immediate and \naggressive approach to treatment that seems to have made all the \ndifference in this child's life.\n  News of Dr. Gay's work and this baby's apparent cure has been \ncelebrated around the world. This development opens a significant door \nto advance research and treatment for HIV and AIDS, the acquired immune \ndeficiency syndrome. Millions of children around the globe have been \ninfected at or during birth, and it is my hope that the spread of HIV \namong newborns will begin to slow and eventually stop with what has \ntaken place in Mississippi what one doctor at Johns Hopkins University \nMedical School called a ``game-changer.''\n  I share the pride of all Mississippians in Dr. Gay, a native of \nJackson, for her achievement and her dedication to our State. She not \nonly teaches and practices at the University of Mississippi Medical \nCenter, but received her training there. As a mostly rural State, \nMississippi faces many health care challenges, and our homegrown health \ncare providers give us the best chance of finding solutions so that \nMississippians can live healthy lives. Dr. Gay's work at the University \nof Mississippi Medical Center is addressing critical needs in our State \nwith the potential to impact other countries and regions that struggle \nwith the scourge of HIV.\n  Congratulations, again, to Dr. Gay and her colleagues. Thanks to \nthem, one child has the opportunity to lead a normal, healthy life, and \nwe may be one step closer to ending the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. I \nwish all the best to researchers at the National Institutes of Health \nand other institutions as they explore the potential for Dr. Gay's \nmethod of treatment. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the Clarion Ledger article from March 7, 2013, titled: \n``Congratulations in order for Dr. Hannah Gay, UMC.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Congratulations in Order for Dr. Hannah Gay, UMC\n\n                 [From ClarionLedger.com, Mar. 7, 2013]\n\n       Yes, great things do happen in Mississippi.\n       That's something we've known all along. But the rest of the \n     world seems to see us sometimes as a caricature of the lists \n     we make--high in obesity, low in education and income.\n       But recent news that a baby born with HIV was likely cured \n     at the University of Mississippi Medical Center by \n     pediatrician Dr. Hannah Gay is something so powerful that the \n     rest of the world could not help but notice.\n       Globally, it is arguably one of the most important stories \n     to come along in years for the health community--real hope \n     that HIV,\n\n[[Page S1706]]\n\n     the virus that causes AIDS, can be cured. That's why when the \n     case was presented at the 20th Conference on Retroviruses and \n     Opportunistic Infections in Atlanta last Sunday, the story \n     made headlines in newspapers throughout the world.\n       The story is: A baby was born to an HIV-positive mother at \n     a rural hospital who was then transported to Jackson's UMC. \n     At 30 hours old, the baby tested HIV positive and Dr. Gay, a \n     pediatric HIV specialist at the hospital, put the baby on an \n     intensive drug therapy that continued until the child was 18 \n     months of age. Tests along the way showed a progressively \n     lower viral presence in the infant's blood until it reached \n     undetectable levels at 29 days of age. The child, a little \n     girl, is now 2\\1/2\\ years old. She is healthy, with a normal \n     immune system--meaning she is considered HIV free.\n       The child is only the second person in history according to \n     health experts to have been cured of the HIV virus. It is \n     also described as the first ``functional cure'' of an HIV-\n     infected infant, which could lead to eliminating HIV in \n     children throughout the world altogether.\n       And, it happened right here in Mississippi.\n       It's not that we are surprised. UMC and its staff, \n     comprising more than 9,000 full and part-time employees, have \n     long been known for excellence. It is Mississippi's only \n     academic health science center, which strives to educate \n     tomorrow's health care professionals and eliminate \n     differences in health status of Mississippians based on race, \n     geography, income or social status.\n       The stories of success over the years are too many to list \n     here. But it's important at this critical moment, as UMC and \n     Dr. Gay stand at the center of the world health stage for \n     work that could ultimately change the fortunes for so many \n     around the world, that we celebrate this accomplishment.\n       We congratulate UMC, Dr. Gay and the thousands of others \n     who work for and with Mississippi's outstanding health \n     facility. If there was any doubt before, the world certainly \n     knows now--we do great things in Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/12/senate-section/article/S1706-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1706-S1707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGETARY REVISIONS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, committee allocations and budgetary \naggregates were previously filed pursuant to section 106 of the Budget \nControl Act of 2011. On December 18, 2012, those levels were revised \npursuant to the Budget Control Act. Today, I am further adjusting those \nlevels, specifically the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations \nfor fiscal year 2013 and the budgetary aggregates for fiscal year 2013.\n  Section 101 of the Budget Control Act allows for various adjustments \nto the statutory limits on discretionary spending, while section 106(d) \nallows the Chairman of the Budget Committee to make revisions to \nallocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments. \nThis adjustment accounts for changes resulting from the following \nbills:\n  One, the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA, P.L. 112-240).\n  Two, the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 (P.L. 112-77).\n  Three, the Senate substitute amendment to the Continuing Resolution \n(H.R. 933).\n  ATRA reduced the overall discretionary spending level by $4 billion \nand redefined the firewalls. The supporting tables reflect totals that \ncorrespond to the revised security/nonsecurity definition included in \nATRA. As such, I am reducing the security budget authority allocation \nby $2 billion, the nonsecurity budget authority by $2 billion, and the \ntotal outlays by $2.315.\n  The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act and the Senate amendment to \nthe Continuing Resolution are eligible for adjustments under the Budget \nControl Act.\n  The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act includes $5.379 billion in \nbudget authority that is designated as disaster relief and $41.669 \nbillion that is designated as an emergency. That funding is estimated \nto result in $3.257 billion in outlays in 2013. The adjustment filed on \nDecember 18, 2012 included revisions related to the Disaster Relief \nAppropriations Act. Removing the adjustment for the Senate bill and \nincluding the enacted bill nets to a reduction of $8.909 billion in \nbudget authority designated as an emergency, a reduction of $6.309 \nbillion in outlays designated as an emergency, and an increase of $592 \nmillion in outlays designated as disaster relief. Furthermore, the \nDisaster Relief Act includes $3.459 in budget authority and $344 \nmillion in outlays as nonemergency and non-disaster funding, which is \nnot eligible for an adjustment.\n  The Senate amendment to the Continuing Resolution includes $98.683 \nbillion in budget authority designated as Overseas Contingency \nOperations (OCO), $11.779 billion in budget authority for disaster \nrelief, $483 million in budget authority for program integrity, and \n$41.669 billion for emergencies. This is estimated to result in $55.766 \nbillion in outlays in 2013.\n  Consequently, I am revising the budgetary aggregates for 2013 by a \ntotal of -$9.883 billion in budget authority and -$8.603 billion in \noutlays. I am also revising the budget authority and outlay allocations \nto the appropriations committee by -$3.504 billion in security budget \nauthority, -$6.381 billion in nonsecurity budget authority, and -$8.605 \nbillion in total outlays, pursuant to the new security/nonsecurity \ndefinition included in ATRA.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing the \nchanges to the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations and the \nbudgetary aggregates be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          BUDGETARY AGGREGATES\n (Pursuant to section 106(b)(2)(C) of the Budget Control Act of 2011 and\n          section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                $s in millions                      2012         2013\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCurrent Spending Aggregates:\n    Budget Authority..........................    3,075,731    2,986,115\n    Outlays...................................    3,123,589    3,006,559\nAdjustments:*\n    Budget Authority..........................            0       -9,883\n    Outlays...................................            0       -8,603\nRevised Spending Aggregates:\n    Budget Authority..........................    3,075,731    2,976,232\n    Outlays...................................    3,123,589    2,997,956\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* Excludes $2 million in off-budget Social Security funds.\n\n\n           REVISIONS TO THE BUDGET AUTHORITY AND OUTLAY ALLOCATIONS TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS\n  (Pursuant to section 106 of the Budget Control Act of 2011 and section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act of\n                                                      1974)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                           Previous           Previous                              Revised\n                                       Allocation/Limit   Allocation/Limit                      Allocation/Limit\n       In millions of dollars             Under Old          Under New          Adjustment         Under New\n                                          Definition         Definition                            Definition\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFiscal Year 2012:\n    Security Discretionary Budget               816,943                  0                  0            816,943\n     Authority......................\n    Nonsecurity Discretionary Budget            363,536                  0                  0            363,536\n     Authority......................\n    General Purpose Discretionary             1,320,414                  0                  0          1,320,414\n     Outlays........................\nFiscal Year 2013:*\n    Security Discretionary Budget               639,663            805,008             -3,504            801,504\n     Authority......................\n    Nonsecurity Discretionary Budget            565,836            400,491             -6,381            394,110\n     Authority......................\n    General Purpose Discretionary             1,284,553          1,284,553             -8,605         1,275,948\n     Outlays........................\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* The American Taxpayer Relief Act redefined the discretionary firewalls for fiscal year 2013.

Madam President, on Sunday, March 10, 2013, Wyoming \nlost a beloved veteran and citizen, Leo Sanchez. I would like to tell \nmy colleagues about this patriot.\n  There is a Marine Corps saying, ``Marines never die; they regroup at \nthe pearly gates and wait for Saint Peter to issue them orders.'' Those \nwho knew Leo are certain he is running through a list with Saint Peter \nregarding his ideas to improve heaven.\n  Leo served our great Nation first in the Army National Guard and then \nin the Marine Corps. He fought in Korea. Following his service, he came \nhome to Wyoming and had a successful career as an educator. His desire \nto serve his community did not end in the classroom; Leo became an \ninvolved member of every veteran organization. His priority was helping \nfellow veterans from every branch and period, at every opportunity.\n  It is impossible to measure the loss of a man like Leo Sanchez. His \nabsence will be felt by Wyoming for generations. Leo was one of my \nState's great treasures. He always gave more than he himself required. \nI could always count on seeing Leo in uniform beaming with pride and \ncelebrating fellow veterans and our Nation's patriotic events.\n  Leo was not only a veteran but a beloved teacher. Leo's legacy is in \nthe children of Wyoming, those whom he taught and inspired. Leo \nrecognized a secret that very few embrace: regardless of the conditions \nof the day, America will always remain great as long as her children \nunderstand patriotism and choose to live their lives to those patriotic \nstandards.

Madam President, as the cochair of the Senate Community \nPharmacy Caucus, I rise to recognize the fifth annual NACDS RxIMPACT \nDay on Capitol Hill. This is a special day where we recognize \npharmacy's contribution to the American healthcare system. This year's \nevent, organized by the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, \ntakes place on March 13-14. Hundreds from the pharmacy community--\nincluding practicing pharmacists, pharmacy school faculty and students, \nState pharmacy leaders and pharmacy company executives--will visit \nCapitol Hill. They will share their views with Congress about the \nimportance of supporting legislation that protects access to community \nand neighborhood pharmacies and that utilizes pharmacists to improve \nthe quality and reduce the costs of providing health care.\n  Advocates from 37 States have travelled to Washington to talk about \ntheir contributions in over 50,000 community pharmacies nationwide. \nThese important health care providers are here to urge Congress to \nrecognize the value of pharmacists and protect access to these \nmedication experts as a part of\n\n[[Page S1708]]\n\nour health care delivery system. And just as these providers travelled \nto meet with us, over 100 Members of Congress have toured a local \npharmacy over the past 5 years.\n  Patients have always relied on their local pharmacist to meet their \nhealth care needs. The local pharmacist is a trusted, highly accessible \nhealth care provider deeply committed to providing accurate \nprescriptions, catching possible drug interactions and helping patients \ntake medications as prescribed.\n  As demand for health care services continues to grow, pharmacists \nhave expanded their role in health care delivery, partnering with \nphysicians, nurses and other health care providers to meet their \npatients' needs. Innovative services provided by pharmacists do even \nmore to improve patient health care. Pharmacists are highly valued by \nthose that rely on them most--those in rural and underserved areas, as \nwell as older Americans, and those struggling to manage chronic \ndiseases. Pharmacy services improve patients' quality of life and \nhealth care affordability. By helping patients take their medications \neffectively and providing preventive services, pharmacists help avoid \nmore costly forms of care later. Pharmacists also help patients \nidentify strategies to save money, such as understanding their pharmacy \nbenefits, using generic drugs and obtaining 90-day supplies of \nprescription drugs from local pharmacies. The importance of medication \nadherence and the effectiveness of local pharmacists in delivering \npatient care is resonating with policymakers.\n  Pharmacists are the Nation's most accessible healthcare providers. In \nmany communities, especially in rural areas, the local pharmacist is a \npatient's most direct link to health care. Eightly-six percent of rural \nAmericans reside within a 10-mile radius of a sole community pharmacy. \nUsually these pharmacists are substantially closer than their \nphysicians. Pharmacists are one of the most trusted professionals. \nPharmacy has a long history of receiving, filling, billing and \ndispensing prescriptions in tandem with patient counseling. Utilizing \ntheir specialized education, pharmacists also play a major role in \nmedication therapy management, disease-state management, immunizations, \nhealth care screenings, and other health care services designed to \nimprove patient health and reduce overall health care costs.\n  As the face of neighborhood health care, pharmacies across the Nation \noffer these and other cost saving programs and services to patients. \nFor more than a century, pharmacies and pharmacists have made a \ndifference in the lives of Montanans and all Americans through these \nimportant patient care services, and it is critical we work to support \ntheir unique contributions.\n  As we refine health care reform and seek new strategies to improve \nhealth and reduce costs, pharmacists will play a critical role. They \nhelp patients adhere to their medications and that improves health \noutcomes and reduces the risks of adverse events and unnecessary costly \nhospital readmissions and emergency room visits. Pharmacists as \nproviders with a comprehensive understanding of a patient's medical \nneeds, are uniquely qualified to work with patients to help manage all \nof their medications and play an essential role in helping them take \ntheir medications as prescribed. Unfortunately, only one half of \nAmericans living with chronic diseases adhere to their drug regimens. \nThis patient non-adherence costs the Nation's economy an estimated $290 \nbillion each year, not to mention the avoidable loss of quality of life \nfor patients and their loved ones. Congress recognized the important \nrole of local pharmacists when it included a Medication Therapy \nManagement, MTM, benefit in Medicare Part D. As we have seen the \nincreasing value of this benefit in improving patient health outcomes, \nI support community pharmacy's efforts to strengthen the MTM benefit so \nit is available for seniors and others struggling with chronic \nconditions and other illnesses.\n  Today, I celebrate the value of pharmacy and support efforts to \nprotect access to neighborhood pharmacies and utilize pharmacies to \nimprove the quality and reduce the costs of health care. In recognition \nof the fifth annual NACDS RxIMPACT Day on Capitol Hill, I would like to \ncongratulate pharmacy leaders, pharmacists, students, and executives \nand the pharmacy community represented by the National Association of \nChain Drug Stores for their contributions to the good health of the \nAmerican people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/12/senate-section/article/S1708-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          THIBODAUX, LOUISIANA\n\n Mr. VITTER. Madam President, today I recognize the City of \nThibodaux. This month, Thibodaux, LA, celebrates its 175th anniversary. \nFirst named Thibodauxville to honor Henry Schuyler Thibodaux, the city \nwas both a trading post between New Orleans and Bayou Teche in the late \n1700s and also a popular settling place for Acadians, Africans, \nItalians, and Spaniards coming to Louisiana during that time. However, \nit wasn't until 1838 that Thibodaux became the official name. In fact, \ncity resident and Louisiana Governor E.D. White, Sr., commissioned the \nname change.\n  Thibodaux is also where the Battle of Georgia Landing was fought \nduring the Civil War, and the Battle of Lafourche Crossing happened a \nfew miles east. Affectionately known as the Queen City of Bayou \nLafourche, Thibodaux's history can be seen in places such as the Laurel \nValley Village, home of the oldest working sugar cane plantation in the \nUnited States, and the home of Governor E.D. White. Both are listed on \nthe National Register of Historic Places.\n  Along with Governor White, Governor Francis T. Nicholls also was a \nnative of Thibodaux, and Nicholls State University is named in his \nhonor. Governor White's son, E.D. White, Jr., served as U.S. Senator \nfrom 1891 to 1894. Later, he was an associate justice and chief justice \nof the United States Supreme Court from 1894 until his passing in 1921. \nA statue of Chief Justice White stands in our U.S. Capitol \ncommemorating his service to Louisiana and the Nation. These are just a \nfew of the historically significant residents of Thibodaux.\n  The City of Thibodaux, its people, and Cajun heritage are at the \nheart of the culture and traditions that have made Louisiana great. \nLouisiana and the City of Thibodaux's history are represented through \nour culture, our traditions, and especially our food. They all \nsymbolize who we are and the devotion we have to preserving our \nheritage.\n  Thibodaux's motto is ``Where Yesterday Welcomes Tomorrow,'' and it is \nmy honor to celebrate the City of Thibodaux's 175th anniversary while \nlooking forward to its bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/12/senate-section/article/S1708-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1708-S1709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \nIRAN THAT WAS DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 12957 ON MARCH 15, 1995--PM 5\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \npermanent the special rule for contributions of qualified conservation \ncontributions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural \nHeritage Conservation Extension Act of 2013.\n  As we continue to find ways to tackle the important issues of this \nnation's long-term future, we begin this new congress with an \nopportunity to take responsibility. This includes the ways we look to \nsafeguard our land. Today, I am introducing the Rural Heritage \nConservation Extension Act as part of our collective mission to ensure \na prosperous nation for future generations.\n  We all know our land has a deeper worth than the goods we have \ncultivated or extracted from beneath the earth. It is our heritage. And \nwhen a piece of our heritage is lost, we do not simply lose its future \nvalue in dollars. We also lose the wildlife habitat and the open areas \nthat may be enjoyed by people from around the world, on top of the very \npersonal value it has held for generations of landowners. It is our job \nin government, as stewards of the land, to safeguard this precious gift \nfor our grandchildren and to provide support to the farmers, ranchers \nand other hard-working landowners who rely on it to make a living.\n  For this reason we have decided to provide targeted income tax relief \nto small farmers and ranchers who donate their land under a qualified \nconservation easement. The provision increases the deduction amount \neligible farmers and ranchers may receive for charitable contributions \nof qualified conservation easements by raising the adjusted gross \nincome limitation from 50 percent to 100 percent and extending the \ncarryover period from 5 years to 15 years. For all other landowners, \nthe AGI limitation was raised from 30 percent to 50 percent. This \nprovision was included in the fiscal cliff package and will expire at \nthe end of this year. The bill before you, the Rural Heritage \nConservation Extension Act of 2013, will make this valuable incentive \npermanent.\n  Conversation easements have been established as an effective land \npreservation method across the country. In Montana, we currently have \nover 2.1 million acres covered by conservation easements. To some, that \nmay seem like a large amount, but this is Montana, and those easements \nare only 2.2 percent of the total state land area. But we leverage far \nmore value out of these easements because they are often located within \nor next to large tracts of public lands. In Montana, we fully recognize \nthe importance of using these easements to protect our lands. Now is \nthe time to help my country and my State to do all they can.\n\n[[Page S1712]]\n\n  This legislative body, the individual States, and the Nation together \nshould stand up for future generations and declare that the time for \nland preservation is now. I believe that we should do all we can to \nhelp landowners afford to choose conservation and preservation, and \nthis bill is a step in the right direction. Let us get rid of the \nuncertainty that comes with temporary provisions and build on the \nsuccess of what we have already begun to do. Let us pass the Rural \nHeritage Conservation Extension Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Cardin, Ms. \n        Klobuchar, Mr. Franken, Ms. Warren, and Mr. Cowan):\n  S. 527. A bill to provide for the adjustment of status of certain \nnationals of Liberia to that of lawful permanent residents; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Liberian Refugee \nImmigration Fairness Act along with Senators Whitehouse, Cardin, \nKlobuchar, Franken, Warren, and Cowan.\n  In December 1989, Liberia became engulfed in a devastating 7-year \ncivil war, which killed over 150,000 people, displaced more than half \nthe population, and destroyed the country's infrastructure. Thousands \nof Liberians who were forced from their homes sought refuge in the \nUnited States and in 1991, were granted Temporary Protected Status, \nTPS. Since that time, the status of many of these refugees, as well as \nmany of those who fled to the United States during Liberia's second \ncivil war, 1999-2003, has been extended through renewals of both TPS \nand Deferred Enforced Departure, DED.\n  America is now home to these law-abiding and tax-paying Liberians. \nThey came here to escape violence and are strengthening our \ncommunities. Many now have children of their own who are U.S. citizens, \nsome of whom serve in the U.S. military. They are here legally, and \nthey continue to work hard and play by the rules.\n  We are currently less than 20 days away from the expiration of DED on \nMarch 31, 2013. In the short term, I have been joined by several \ncolleagues in urging the Administration to extend DED so Liberians who \nhave lived here legally do not face deportation.\n  The Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act, which I have \nintroduced every Congress since 1999, offers a more long-term solution. \nIt seeks to provide a path to citizenship for qualifying Liberian \nrefugees. After decades of perennial uncertainty about whether they \nwill be able to stay in their communities or whether their families \nwill be split up, this bill would give eligible Liberians the \nopportunity to apply for legal permanent residency, and begin the \nprocess of finally becoming citizens.\n  Currently, a bipartisan group of my Senate colleagues is working \ntowards a comprehensive immigration reform bill. I look forward to \nworking with them and others to include the Liberian Refugee \nImmigration Fairness Act in immigration reform. I thank Senators \nWhitehouse, Cardin, Klobuchar, Franken, Warren, and Cowan for \ncosponsoring this bill and urge our colleagues to join us in taking the \nnext steps to finally provide a path to citizenship for qualifying \nLiberians.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 537. A bill to require the Small Business Administration to make \ninformation relating to lenders making covered loans publicly \navailable, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as Chair of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, I remain focused on the needs of \nsmall businesses. Much of what we do on the committee involves \noverseeing the Small Business Administration's contracting, counseling, \nand capital programs, and we are always looking for ways to improve \nthem. As our country slowly recovers the economic downturn, one of the \nmost pressing issues facing small business owners is access to capital.\n  In the past two fiscal years alone, the Small Business \nAdministration, SBA, supported over $30 billion in loans to \napproximately 60,000 small businesses each year through its 7(a) and \n504/CDC lending programs. As of September 2012, there were over 2,400 \nSBA lenders nationwide. While the SBA currently releases some \ninformation publicly about SBA lending activity, it is extremely \ndifficult to find and comprehend if you are not an SBA lending \nprofessional. If a small business, mayor, or governor wants to \ndetermine SBA lending activity in their area, they lack the ability to \ndo so easily.\n  I come to the floor today to introduce a bill that would increase \naccountability at the SBA in its lending reporting activity. The \nCommunicating Lender Activity Reports from the Small Business \nAdministration, CLEAR SBA, Act would require the SBA to establish an \nonline database to provide consumers with more transparent, user-\nfriendly data about their local SBA lenders.\n  More specifically, the CLEAR SBA Act would require the SBA to post a \nuser friendly Lender Activity Index on the SBA website. Users will be \nable to access the following data for any given bank: name of bank or \nCertified Development Company, CDC, number of SBA loans each lender \nmade, total dollar amount of SBA loans of each bank or CDC, zip code of \nlender activity, not where every single loan was made, but a list of \nevery zip code where the bank has made an SBA loan, industries lent to, \nhospitality, manufacturing, service, software, etc., stage of business \ncycle, new, or existing business, and business specific information, \ni.e. Women Owned Businesses, Minority Owned Businesses, or Veteran \nOwned Businesses. Data will be available for the year to date and users \nwill be able to compare to 3 previous fiscal years. Both quarterly and \nannual data will be included.\n  I would like to emphasize that this proposal has already received \nbipartisan support. In the 112th Congress, the SBA Lender Activity \nIndex was included as a provision in Title II of the SUCCESS Act. On \nJuly 12, 2012, the Senate voted on the SUCCESS Act. On July 12, 2012, \nthe Senate voted on the SUCCESS Act as part of Senate Amendment 2521 to \nS. 2237, the Small Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act of 2012. Although \nthe amendment came up short of the 60 votes needed to end debate, the \nSUCCESS Act received a strong 57 bipartisan votes, including five of my \nRepublican colleagues. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto come together in support of this common sense proposal to increase \ntransparency and accountability at the SBA.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n\n                                 S. 537\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

   the restriction of access to higher education on the basis of \n     religion, the sentencing of twelve Baha'is associated with \n     Baha'i educational institutions to lengthy prison terms, the \n     continued denial of access to employment in the public \n     sector, additional restrictions on participation in the \n     private sector, and the de facto criminalization of \n     membership in the Baha'i faith.'';\n       Whereas, on December 20, 2012, the United Nations General \n     Assembly adopted a resolution (A/RES/67/182), which called \n     upon the government of Iran ``[t]o eliminate discrimination \n     against, and exclusion of . . . members of the Baha'i Faith, \n     regarding access to higher education, and to eliminate the \n     criminalization of efforts to provide higher education to \n     Baha'i youth denied access to Iranian universities,'' and \n     ``to accord all Baha'is, including those imprisoned because \n     of their beliefs, the due process of law and the rights that \n     they are constitutionally guaranteed'';\n       Whereas, on February 28, 2013, the United Nations Special \n     Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran issued a report (A/HRC/22/56), which stated, \n     ``110 Bahai's are currently detained in Iran for exercising \n     their faith, including two women, Mrs. Zohreh Nikayin and \n     Mrs. Taraneh Torabi, who are reportedly nursing infants in \n     prison.'';\n       Whereas, in March and May of 2008, intelligence officials \n     of the Government of Iran in Mashhad and Tehran arrested and \n     imprisoned Mrs. Fariba Kamalabadi, Mr. Jamaloddin Khanjani, \n     Mr. Afif Naeimi, Mr. Saeid Rezaie, Mr. Behrouz Tavakkoli, \n     Mrs. Mahvash Sabet, and Mr. Vahid Tizfahm, the seven members \n     of the ad hoc leadership group for the Baha'i community in \n     Iran;\n       Whereas, in August 2010, the Revolutionary Court in Tehran \n     sentenced the seven Baha'i leaders to 20-year prison terms on \n     charges of ``spying for Israel, insulting religious \n     sanctities, propaganda against the regime and spreading \n     corruption on earth'';\n       Whereas the lawyer for these seven leaders, Mrs. Shirin \n     Ebadi, the Nobel Laureate, was denied meaningful or timely \n     access to the prisoners and their files, and her successors \n     as defense counsel were provided extremely limited access;\n       Whereas these seven Baha'i leaders were targeted solely on \n     the basis of their religion;\n       Whereas, beginning in May 2011, Government of Iran \n     officials in four cities conducted sweeping raids on the \n     homes of dozens of individuals associated with the Baha'i \n     Institute for Higher Education (BIHE) and arrested and \n     detained several educators associated with BIHE;\n\n[[Page S1714]]\n\n       Whereas, in October 2011, the Revolutionary Court in Tehran \n     sentenced seven of these BIHE instructors and administrators, \n     Mr. Vahid Mahmoudi, Mr. Kamran Mortezaie, Mr. Mahmoud \n     Badavam, Ms. Nooshin Khadem, Mr. Farhad Sedghi, Mr. Riaz \n     Sobhani, and Mr. Ramin Zibaie, to prison terms for the crime \n     of ``membership of the deviant sect of Baha'ism, with the \n     goal of taking action against the security of the country, in \n     order to further the aims of the deviant sect and those of \n     organizations outside the country'';\n       Whereas six of these educators remain imprisoned, with Mr. \n     Mortezaie serving a 5-year prison term and Mr. Badavam, Ms. \n     Khadem, Mr. Sedghi, Mr. Sobhani, and Mr. Zibaie serving 4-\n     year prison terms;\n       Whereas, since October 2011, four other BIHE educators have \n     been arrested and imprisoned, with Ms. Faran Hessami, Mr. \n     Kamran Rahimian, and Mr. Shahin Negari serving 4-year prison \n     terms, and Mr. Kayvan Rahimian serving a 5-year prison term;\n       Whereas the efforts of the Government of Iran to collect \n     information on individual Baha'is have recently intensified \n     as evidenced by a letter, dated November 5, 2011, from the \n     Director of the Department of Education in the county of \n     Shahriar in the province of Tehran, instructing the directors \n     of schools in his jurisdiction to ``subtly and in a \n     confidential manner'' collect information on Baha'i students;\n       Whereas the Baha'i community continues to undergo intense \n     economic and social pressure, including an ongoing campaign \n     in the town of Semnan, where the Government of Iran has \n     harassed and detained Baha'is, closed 17 Baha'i owned \n     businesses in the last three years, and imprisoned several \n     members of the community, including three mothers along with \n     their infants;\n       Whereas ordinary Iranian citizens who belong to the Baha'i \n     Faith are disproportionately targeted, interrogated, and \n     detained under the pretext of national security;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran is party to the \n     International Covenants on Human Rights and is in violation \n     of its obligations under the Covenants; and\n       Whereas the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, \n     and Divestment Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-195) authorizes \n     the President and the Secretary of State to impose sanctions \n     on individuals ``responsible for or complicit in, or \n     responsible for ordering, controlling, or otherwise \n     directing, the commission of serious human rights abuses \n     against citizens of Iran or their family members on or after \n     June 12, 2009'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the Government of Iran for its state-sponsored \n     persecution of its Baha'i minority and its continued \n     violation of the International Covenants on Human Rights;\n       (2) calls on the Government of Iran to immediately release \n     the seven imprisoned leaders, the ten imprisoned educators, \n     and all other prisoners held solely on account of their \n     religion;\n       (3) calls on the President and Secretary of State, in \n     cooperation with responsible nations, to immediately condemn \n     the Government of Iran's continued violation of human rights \n     and demand the immediate release of prisoners held solely on \n     account of their religion; and\n       (4) urges the President and Secretary of State to utilize \n     all available authorities, including the Comprehensive Iran \n     Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010, to \n     impose sanctions on officials of the Government of Iran and \n     other individuals directly responsible for serious human \n     rights abuses, including abuses against the Baha'i community \n     of Iran.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url":
