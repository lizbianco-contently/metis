Mr. President, for most of her life Anna Ledesma has been \nafraid. She was a model student at Centennial High School in Las Vegas, \nan artist and a member of the Key Club. As one of the top academics of \na large high school, she received the Millennium Scholarship to study \nnursing at the College of Southern Nevada. Now she is studying hard for \nher nursing exams. But 23-year-old Anna has lived for a long time with \nthe constant fear that she will be deported. She is an undocumented \nimmigrant. She was born in the Philippines and brought here by her \nparents when she was 7 years old. She was in the second grade.\n  This is what Anna told the Las Vegas Sun newspaper:\n\n       I would tell myself that they're not going to deport me \n     because I'm a nursing student and I'm working really hard and \n     I want to make a difference in my community . . . [But] all \n     the time, constantly in the back of my head, I think about \n     being deported and having to start over.\n\n  Thanks to a directive issued last year by President Obama, Anna and \n800,000 other young people like her--young people who are American in \nall but paperwork--won't be deported. President Obama's directive \nsuspended deportation of DREAMers--students brought to America \nillegally when they were children. These young people share our \nlanguage, they share our culture, and they share our love for America, \nwhich in most cases is the only country they have ever known. Like \nAnna, the DREAMers are talented, patriotic young men and women who want \nto defend our Nation in the military, get a college education, and work \nhard to help their communities and our country.\n  Still, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives sent a \nchilling message last week to Anna and others when it voted to roll \nback President Obama's directive. Republicans voted to resume \ndeportation of upstanding young people--I repeat, just like Anna--who \nwere brought to this country illegally through no fault of their own. \nThat is why it is vital that Congress act at long last to fix this \nNation's broken immigration system.\n  President Obama's directive is temporary--and squarely in the \ncrosshairs of the tea party-driven Republican rightwing. The directive \nis also no remedy for more than 10 million others--many of whom are the \nparents or siblings of DREAMers--who are living here without the proper \npaperwork.\n  But a permanent commonsense solution to our dysfunctional system is \nin sight. The bipartisan legislation on\n\n[[Page S4028]]\n\nwhich the Senate is now working is the solution our economy needs, it \nis the solution immigrant families need, and it is the solution Anna \nneeds.\n  This bill isn't perfect. That is the nature of legislating. \nCompromise is necessary and inevitable. But this measure takes \nimportant steps to reform our broken legal immigration system, \nstrengthen border security, and hold unscrupulous employers \naccountable.\n  Over the next 3 weeks Senators will propose a number of ideas to make \nthe legislation better. Some will offer ideas to make it worse. But \nthose suggestions must preserve the heart of the bill--a pathway to \nearned citizenship that begins by going to the back of the line, paying \ntaxes and fines, learning English, and getting right with the law. \nWhether we are Democrats or Republicans, whether we are from red States \nor blue States, we can all agree that the current system is broken. We \ncan all agree on the need for action. This bipartisan legislation is \nour best chance in many, many years to bend the system toward it \nworking right. We need to mend this broken system.\n  The Senate is about to engage in this important debate about the kind \nof country we are and must continue to be. This Nation was founded on \nthe promise that success should not be an accident of birth but, \nrather, a just reward for hard work and determination. It is no wonder \nso many people from so many nations wish to share that promise, but \nthey can't all get the promise of coming to America, and that is what \nthis legislation is all about.\n  The United States has always welcomed immigrants, and that is never \ngoing to change. For those like Anna, the words of the Jewish proverb \nare appropriate: Dreams do not die. Therefore, it is up to us to help \nfulfill those dreams and fix our broken immigration system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/10/senate-section/article/S4028-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine).

Under the previous order, the time until 5 \np.m. will be divided, with the Senator from Alabama or his designee \ncontrolling 2 hours and the Senator from Vermont or his designee \ncontrolling the remaining time.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when the Senate Judiciary Committee held \nlengthy and extensive markup sessions to consider the Border Security, \nEconomic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, or S. 744--the \nbill before us--we worked late into the evenings debating the bill. We \nconsidered hundreds of amendments. But what was interesting and what we \nheard the most about was the fact that the public was able to witness \nour consideration firsthand. They saw all our proceedings streamed live \non the committee's Web site and broadcast on C-SPAN. We made available \non our website proposed amendments, and reported developments in real \ntime throughout the committee process. I know this made a difference \nbecause I was receiving e-mails and calls from all over the country \nfrom people watching it. Whether they agreed or disagreed on a \nparticular matter, they said how much it meant to them to actually know \nwhat the Senate was doing. And Members from both sides of the aisle \npraised the transparent process and the significant improvements in the \nbill made by the Judiciary Committee.\n  The bill, as we amended it, was passed out of committee by a \nbipartisan two-thirds majority. Again, everybody worked together, set \npolitics aside, and allowed the American people to see what we were \ndoing. In many ways this is how we did it when I first came to the \nSenate, except we didn't have a way of streaming things live and we \ndidn't have C-SPAN, so it is even more transparent now.\n  I appreciate what President Obama said this weekend about immigration \nreform. I agree with him that we have to move in a timely way. Of \ncourse, the time is now for the Senate to act, so I hope we can take \nsome of the same steps in the Chamber that we took in the Judiciary \nCommittee during our debate of this legislation to have an efficient \nand transparent process. After all, look at the markup of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee: both parties--and it goes across the political \nspectrum as well as geographically, from the west coast to the east \ncoast, from southern borders to our northern borders.\n  During our committee consideration last month, an editorial in the \nBarre Montpelier Times termed our proceedings a ``lesson in \ndemocracy.'' Our committee proceedings demonstrated to the American \npeople and the world how the Senate can and should fulfill its \nresponsibilities despite our differences.\n  The ranking Republican on the committee, the senior Senator from \nIowa, and I were on different sides of the legislation, but we were \nable to work well together. I hope we can continue to work here on the \nSenate floor in a bipartisan way. Although he voted against the bill, \nthe senior Senator from Iowa said had his vote been necessary to report \nthe bill to the Senate, he would have voted to do so. I appreciate that \nsentiment, and I look forward to his cooperation.\n  I have proposed to Senator Grassley, who as the ranking Republican on \nthe Judiciary Committee will be managing the bill for the minority, \nthat we try to replicate here in the Senate the fair and transparent \nprocess we were able to achieve in the committee. To that end, once the \nSenate is able to proceed to the bill, I suggest we establish a filing \ndeadline for amendments, as we did at the outset of our committee \nconsideration. Ideally, then we will be able to take these amendments \nand group them and thereby work together by issue and by titles, as we \ndid in the committee. It makes it a lot easier for the public as well \nas for the Senate to know what we are doing on the bill. It will help \nus with the Senate's timely consideration of this important \nlegislation.\n  Of course, in order for Senators to be able to file amendments and \nwork on the bill, the Senate has to proceed to the bill. Republicans \nand Democrats worked together to develop this legislation. Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle, including the Senator from Alabama, who \nhas already spoken on the Senate floor at length about this \nlegislation, had amendments adopted in committee. Almost none of the \nmore than 135 amendments adopted by the Judiciary Committee were \nadopted on party-line votes. So we should be able to work together to \nensure consideration of amendments and then proceed to a vote on final \npassage without filibusters.\n\n  The American people want us to vote yes or no, up or down. They do \nnot want us to add delaying tactics that allow us to say, well, maybe \nwe would have been for it or maybe we would have been against it. They \nexpect more of their Senators. Vote yes or no.\n  I had hoped the Senate would turn immediately to the consideration of \namendments to this important bill. I regret that tomorrow afternoon, \ninstead, we will vote on cloture on a procedural motion to allow us to \nbegin debate on the bill. The legislation before us is the result of a \nbipartisan group of Senators who came together and made an agreement. \nIt was initially a proposal from the so-called Gang of 8. It came \nthrough the committee process a product of a group of 18, supported by \na bipartisan majority of the Judiciary Committee.\n  If Senators who have come together to help develop this bill keep \ntheir commitments, I have no doubt we will be able to end this \nunnecessary filibuster and pass this fair but tough legislation on \ncomprehensive immigration reform.\n  There is broad agreement that our Nation's immigration system is \nbroken and is in need of a comprehensive solution. There is also broad \nagreement in this Nation that people are tired of unnecessary delays in \nthe Senate. They would like to see us do the work we are\n\n[[Page S4029]]\n\npaid to do, the work we were elected to do, and vote yes or no, not \ncontinue voting maybe by delaying. This bipartisan legislation will \nachieve this. Given the impact the broken system has on our economy and \nour families, we cannot afford delay. This is a measure on which the \nSenate should come together to consider and pass. We should do what is \nright, what is fair, and what is just.\n  Comprehensive immigration reform was last on the Senate floor 6 years \nago. When it was blocked by the minority party--the Republican Party--\nthe former chairman of our immigration subcommittee, Ted Kennedy, said:\n\n       A minority in the Senate rejected a stronger economy that \n     is fairer to our taxpayers and our workers. A minority of the \n     Senate rejected America's own extraordinary immigrant history \n     and ignored our Nation's most urgent needs. But we are in \n     this struggle for the long haul. . . . As we continue the \n     battle, we will have ample inspiration in the lives of the \n     immigrants all around us. He was right. We are back--in \n     strength.\n\n  I had the privilege of serving in the Senate with Senator Kennedy \nfrom the time I arrived until the time he died. I know how passionately \nhe felt about this issue. I also know, both from then and now, that a \nsmall minority of the Senate that continues to reject this measure \nshould not prevail this time and close the door on so many people in \nour country--both those who are citizens and those who aspire to become \ncitizens.\n  I have taken inspiration from many sources, from our shared history \nas immigrants, from the experiences of my own grandparents, from my \nwife's parents, from our courageous witnesses Jose Antonio Vargas and \nGaby Pacheco and, as Senator Kennedy noted, from the millions of \nAmerican families that will be more secure when we enact comprehensive \nimmigration reform.\n  During his testimony before the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Vargas asked \nthe committee:\n\n       What do you want to do with us? What do you want to do with \n     me?\n\n  Poignant questions. But this legislation answers Mr. Vargas, and it \nsends a message to the millions of others who are looking to Senators \nto be true to our ``extraordinary'' history and tradition as a nation \nof immigrants.\n  I am encouraged that some on the other side of the aisle are \nsignaling their support for this legislation. I welcome the support of \nthose who supported immigration reform in the past, who support this \neffort again.\n  I trust that those Republican Senators who helped draft this \nlegislation--and helped us greatly--will be with us for the long haul, \nbe firm in their commitments, and will defend the legislation they \nasked the other 14 members of the Judiciary Committee to consider and \napprove.\n  I will hope and expect that they will not look for excuses to abandon \nwhat has been and what needs to be a bipartisan effort because \neverybody had to give some on this bill. The bill now before the Senate \nis not the bill I would have drafted. I voted for amendments in the \nJudiciary Committee that were rejected, and I voted against some \namendments that were accepted. I withheld an amendment on what, to me, \nis an issue of fundamental fairness in ending discrimination, after \nRepublican Senators pledged to abandon their support for this bill had \nthat amendment been offered. I cannot begin to tell this Senate how \nmuch it hurt to withdraw that amendment. But despite many shortcomings \nas a result of compromise, the bill before the Senate is worthy of this \nChamber's immediate attention and support.\n  It is time for us to stop voting ``maybe'' and instead proceed to \nthis bill and get to the business of legislating. After all, that is \nwhat the American people, Republicans and Democrats alike, expect us to \ndo. The Congress was unable to achieve this goal during the last \ndecade. Now, in the second decade of the 21st century, we again have \nthe opportunity to make the reforms we so desperately need to carry us \nforward and strengthen our Nation. As I said on the Senate floor late \nlast week, if a majority of us stand together, if we stay true to our \nvalues and our agreements, I believe we can pass legislation to write \nthe next great chapter in America's history of immigration--a chapter \nfor which succeeding generations will thank us.\n  Mr. President, before I conclude on this issue, I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of the editorial I referred to be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows;\n\n                  [From the Times Argus, May 11, 2013]\n\n                          Lesson in Democracy\n\n       In a remarkable demonstration of the way democracy \n     ordinarily works, Sen. Patrick Leahy held a mark-up session \n     Thursday allowing the Senate Judiciary Committee to shape a \n     new immigration bill.\n       A mark-up session occurs when a committee discusses and \n     debates a bill, marking it up with amendments, giving both \n     sides a say and putting on display for the world to see the \n     differences and compromises. In watching a mark-up session, \n     we are able to observe senators in the actual process of \n     lawmaking.\n       That an important issue should be subject to an open and \n     public mark-up session would not be so remarkable were it not \n     for the remarkable distortion of the legislative process that \n     has occurred in recent years by the manipulation of \n     legislative rules.\n       Lately, we have become accustomed to seeing major pieces of \n     legislation used as chips in an unsavory game of poker, with \n     all the cards in the hands of a few players. Action on budget \n     and debt ceiling votes has been held up until the last minute \n     when leaders are forced by a looming deadline to reach a \n     deal. The members themselves, instead of being engaged in the \n     process of lawmaking, are left to twiddle their thumbs until \n     they get the call from their leaders that a deal has been \n     struck.\n       Everyone complains that making laws is like making sausage: \n     You don't want to see what goes into it. But when the deal-\n     making happens behind closed doors, cynicism can be the only \n     response. The decision by Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary \n     Committee, to hold several lengthy open mark-up sessions on \n     the immigration issue is a sign that both Republicans and \n     Democrats see a way through the thicket. If the Republicans \n     were interested merely in blocking the bill, they could use \n     their usual tactics. But given the importance of the Hispanic \n     vote and the party's record of hostility toward minorities, \n     some Republicans have recognized they must deal with the \n     issue.\n       Protracted debate about bills in committee ought to be the \n     norm. It is what committees are for. But the process has \n     perils that legislators sometimes seek to avoid by using the \n     rules to foist a measure on the body where a majority can \n     hurry it through. It is unlikely that the Democrats could \n     hurry anything through the Senate these days, so Leahy has \n     decided to take the risks inherent in the amendment process \n     to craft a bill that will win at least some Republican \n     support.\n       The immigration bill is the product of the so-called Gang \n     of Eight, a group of four Democrats and four Republicans who \n     have sought to forge a bipartisan compromise on immigration. \n     They are looking for a way to achieve both border security \n     and a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants \n     who are here illegally. Hard-line anti-immigration members \n     will never be placated; the Senate will be working toward a \n     formula allowing the skeptics who worry about border security \n     enough assurance that they can lighten up a little on the \n     punitive measures.\n       Senate bills follow a perilous path, particularly these \n     days, when Republican use of the filibuster has created what \n     amounts to a political oligarchy: the rule of the minority \n     over the majority. This was the bitter lesson that Leahy \n     learned on gun control legislation, which also began in his \n     committee. The bill calling for universal background checks \n     had majority support on the Senate floor, but the minority \n     was able to quash it by use of the filibuster.\n       And yet this is why Leahy retained his position as chairman \n     of the Judiciary Committee rather than moving to the \n     Appropriations Committee. The appropriations process has \n     become subject to the poker game, which robs the committee of \n     its authority in creating and marking up a bill. As chairman \n     of Judiciary, Leahy is giving the nation a lesson in \n     democracy. It's a lesson that needs to be retaught.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, seeing nobody seeking recognition, I ask \npermission to speak as in morning business on an issue we will vote on \nlater today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Rural Gigabit Pilot Program\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let me speak on an important issue the \nSenate will be voting on later today, my amendment to the farm bill. \nThe Internet has made a fundamental difference in our lives. From how \nwe shop to how we stay connected to one another, there are few aspects \nof life the Internet does not touch. In the 21st century, access to \nhigh-quality, high-speed Internet is not a luxury but a necessity.\n  Unfortunately far too many Americans, particularly those living in \nrural areas, like so many in my own State of Vermont, can only dream \nabout having access to this kind of critical infrastructure. We must \ntake action to correct this.\n\n[[Page S4030]]\n\n  I am pleased the Senate will vote today on an amendment I have \noffered that sets our sights high for real, ultra-high-speed Internet. \nIn some areas, these next-generation networks are already being built. \nThese networks offer gigabit speed--speed that is 100 times faster than \nwhat we are accustomed to today.\n  These networks bring with them innovation and jobs. Over the next 5 \nyears these networks are going to become more widely adopted in urban \nareas, but rural America is at risk of falling further behind. If that \nhappens, rural Americans will be left behind. They will lose potential \neconomic growth. They will cede engines of innovation to urban areas \nthat are equipped with ultra-high-speed Internet capability.\n  My amendment will establish a pilot program within the Rural \nUtilities Service Program that is part of the farm bill to fund up to \nfive projects to deploy ultra-high-speed Internet service in rural \nareas over the next 5 years. The pilot is narrow in scope. It is \ncarefully crafted to ensure that the main focus of the RUS Program is \ndeploying service to unserved rural areas, while at the same time \ngiving RUS the flexibility to find the best rural areas to test gigabit \nservice investment. This will help pave the way for the Internet \ninfrastructure that rural communities across the Nation will need as \nour economy turns the corner into this next generation of Internet \nservice. Next-generation gigabit networks have the potential to \ntransform rural areas. They can dramatically improve education and \nhealth care. They have the potential to bring the innovations of \nSilicon Valley to the Upper Valley of Vermont and to rural areas across \nthe country.\n  Rural America has so much to offer in our way of life, but without \nthe great equalizer of high-speed Internet, it cannot live up to its \nfull potential. So now is the time to invest in these networks. One \nneed only look at the number of applications Google received for its \nGoogle Fiber project to know that cities and towns throughout the \ncountry understand the innovation and economic growth that comes from \ngigabit networks. If we are going to invest money in rural networks, it \nmakes sense that we invest some of it in networks that are going to be \nfuture-resilient.\n  The broadband revolution of the last decade brought a bright new \nfuture for many areas of the country, but I know firsthand that many \nrural areas are still playing catch-up. As the next generation of \nbroadband investment begins this decade, let's learn from those past \nmistakes and test our investment in gigabit networks in rural America.\n  I thank Chairwoman Stabenow for working with me since the committee \nfirst started on this amendment and for her commitment to improve the \nquality of life for rural America, and I thank those Senators--both \nRepublicans and Democrats--who have supported me. Most importantly, \nrural America supports it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum \nand ask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as we look forward to a difficult and \nyet overdue debate about immigration, I wanted to share my thoughts on \nthe legislation. I want to speak about the committee process as well as \nthe substance of the bill before us. I also want to share my personal \nexperience from the 1980s and how we can learn from history. Finally, I \nwant to express my hope for what I think the bill should look like \nbefore it leaves the Senate.\n  I do not know of any Senator who says the status quo is the way it \nought to be. In other words, this issue being on the floor of the \nSenate is very appropriate. But while we are here, we need to \nconcentrate on getting immigration right for the long term. In 1986, \nthe last time we had major legislation going to the President, I was \nthere. I lived it. I voted for it.\n  I acknowledge that what we did in 1986, we got it wrong. We cannot \nafford to make the same mistakes of yesterday. From our national \nsecurity to our economic security, too much is at stake. So do not \nrepeat 1986. See that the borders are absolutely secure. No excuses \nfrom that point. No exceptions on that point.\n  Now, we are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. \nIt is my solemn responsibility to respect the law and ensure that law \nis upheld. Do it the right way, not the easy way. Take what time is \nnecessary to get it right. We know what works in Congress and what does \nnot work. I think if we look back at health care reform as an example, \nwe know that we did it in too hurried of a way and, consequently, \nquestions about carrying out that legislation now are legitimate points \nof discussion.\n  Earlier in the year when a bipartisan group of eight Senators \nreleased their framework for reform, I was optimistic that the authors \nwere going to produce legislation that lived up to the promises. In \ntheir framework they stated:\n\n       We will ensure that this is a successful permanent reform \n     to our immigration system that will not need to be revisited.\n\n  Without a doubt this is a goal we should all strive for. We must find \na long-term solution to fixing our broken system. So I was encouraged. \nThe authors, in the framework released to the public before bill \nlanguage was available, said the bill would ``provide a tough, fair, \npractical road map to address the status of unauthorized immigrations \nin the United States contingent upon our success in securing our \nborders and addressing visa overstays.''\n  Who can argue with that point? That is exactly what we all believe a \npiece of legislation should do. At the time this bill was put forward \nand the framework was put forward, I reserved judgment until I saw the \ndetails of their proposal. I thought the framework held hope, but I \nrealized the assurances that the Group of 8 made did not really \ntranslate when the bill language emerged. It seems as though the \nrhetoric was spot on, but the details were dubious.\n  This is what was professed by the authors: that the borders would be \nsecured and that the people would earn their legal status. That was not \nwhat the bill actually did. The bill, as drafted, is legalization \nfirst, border secured later, and tracking visa overstays later, if at \nall.\n  In 1981, when I was a freshman Senator, I joined the Judiciary \nCommittee and was active in the subcommittee process. We sat down and \nwrote legislation. We had 150 hours of hearings, 300 witnesses before \nwe marked up a bill in May 1982. Hundreds of more hours and dozens more \nhearings would take place before the 1986 passage.\n  This year we had 6 days of hearings. We spent 18 hours and 10 minutes \nlistening to outside witnesses. We had a hearing on the ``needs of \nwomen and children,'' another hearing focused on ``building an \nimmigration system worthy of American values.''\n  The Judiciary Committee received the bipartisan bill at 2:24 a.m on \nApril 17. We held hearings on April 19, 22, and 23. We heard from 26 \nwitnesses in 3 days. We heard from the head of the Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement agency union. We heard from economists and \nemployers, law enforcement and lawyers, to professors and advocacy \ngroups. We even heard from people who are undocumented, proving that \nonly in America would we allow someone not right with the law to be \nheard by the American people.\n  One of the witnesses was Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano. We \nattempted to learn about how the bill would affect the functions of the \nexecutive branch and whether she saw the same flaws many of us were \nfinding. Unfortunately, we have not received responses from Secretary \nNapolitano to the questions that we raised at her hearing on April 23. \nWe should have the benefit of hearing from the Secretary as to certain \nquestions that were raised about this legislation, particularly when it \ncomes from somebody in the executive branch who has to enforce what is \nlaid before her.\n  After those hearings the committee was poised to consider the bill \nthrough a markup process. Our side of the aisle made it clear that we \nneeded to have an open and transparent process, so we started work on \nMay 9. We held five\n\n[[Page S4031]]\n\nall-day sessions where Members were able to raise questions, voice \nconcerns, and offer amendments. Hundreds of amendments were filed. I \nalone filed 77 amendments. Of those, I offered 37. Of those 37, 12 were \naccepted, 25 were rejected.\n  Those on the other side of the aisle will boast that many Republican \namendments were adopted in committee. They are somewhat right. However, \nonly 13 of 78 Republican amendments offered were agreed to; 7 of those \nwere from members of the Group of 8. But get this: Of the 62 Democratic \namendments proposed, only 1 of those 62 amendments was rejected, and \neven that one was just narrowly rejected.\n  Commonsense amendments offering real solutions were repeatedly \nrejected. Those that were accepted made some necessary improvements. \nBut get this: The core provisions of the bill remain the same coming \nout of committee as they were introduced into the committee.\n  I respect the process we had in committee. Chairman Leahy deserves \nthanks from all of us on the committee because he promised an open, \nfair, and transparent process. Quite frankly, it was. It is a good \nformat for what needs to take place on the floor of the Senate if the \nlegislation that is finally voted upon is going to have credibility.\n  In that committee we had a good discussion and debate on how to \nimprove the bill. It was a productive conversation focused on getting \nimmigration reform right in the long term. Yet I was disappointed that \nalliances were made to ensure that nothing passed that would make \nsubstantial changes or improvements in the bill. Many of those people \ngave high praise to the amendments being offered but continued to vote \nagainst them.\n  I have often spoke about the 1986 legislation and how that law failed \nthe American people. Now 99 other Senators are probably going to get \nsick of me reminding them of my presence there in 1986 and saying that \nwe screwed up, because at that time promises were made and those \npromises were not kept. We said it was a one-time fix, just like the \nGroup of 8 said they have a one-time fix. But that one-time fix did \nnothing to solve the problem.\n  In fact, it only made matters worse and encouraged illegality. People \ncame forward for legal status, but many more illegally entered or \noverstayed their welcome to get the same benefits and chance at \ncitizenship. The 1986 bill was supposed to be a three-legged stool: \ncontrol undocumented immigration, a legalization program, and reform of \nlegal immigration.\n  We authorized $422 million to carry out the requirements of the bill \nand even created a special fund for States to get reimbursed their \ncosts. The 1986 bill included a legalization program for two categories \nof people: one for individuals who have been present in the United \nStates since 1982, and the second for farm workers who have worked in \nagriculture for at least 90 days prior to enactment. A total of 2.7 \nmillion people were legalized. We also had enforcement in that 1986 \nlegislation.\n  For the first time ever we made it illegal to knowingly hire or \nemploy someone who was here undocumented. We set penalties to deter the \nhiring of people here undocumented. We wrote in the bill that ``one \nessential element of immigration control is an increase in the Border \nPatrol and other inspection enforcement activities of the Immigration \nand Nationalization Service in order to prevent and to deter the \nillegal entry of aliens into the United States and in violation of the \nterms of their entry.''\n  Unfortunately, the same principles from 1986 are being discussed \ntoday: legalize now, enforce later. But it is clear that philosophy \ndoes not work. Proof of that is it did not work in 1986. So proponents \nof legalization today argue we did not get it right in 1986. How true \nthey are. I agree the enforcement mechanisms in 1986 could have been \nstronger. There was no commitment to enforcing the law or making sure \nwe protected every mile of our border.\n  Knowing what I know now, an immigration bill must ensure that we \nsecure the border first. Legalization should only happen when the \nAmerican people have faith in the system. There needs to be a \ncommitment to enforce the laws on the books, and, as important, there \nneeds to be a legal avenue that allows people to enter and stay legally \nin the country.\n  Now, if you want to know how important securing the border is, just \ncome to my townhall meetings in Iowa. So far I have been in 73 of our \n99 counties. When immigration comes up and I talk about legislation, \nthere are outbursts that we do not need more laws; why do we not just \nenforce the laws that are on the books--things such as ``bring the \ntroops home.'' ``Put them down on the border.'' ``Then we won't have a \nproblem.'' Unfortunately, the bill before us repeats our past mistakes \nand does very little to deliver more than the same promises we made in \n1986, which promises turned out to be empty. Instead of looking to the \npast for guidance on what to do in the future, the bill before us \nincorporates the mistakes of the past and, in some cases, even weakens \nthe laws we currently have.\n\n  Those of us who are complaining, as I have just complained, have a \nresponsibility to put a proposal before this body that will correct \nthose things we think are a repeat of the mistakes of 1986, and we will \ndo this.\n  To further explain this bill, the bill ensures that the executive \nbranch, not the Congress or the American people through their Congress, \nhas the sole power to control the situation. First, the bill provides \nhundreds of waivers and broad delegation of authority. Two, the \nSecretary may define terms as she sees fit. In many cases, the \ndiscretion is unreviewable, both by the American people and by other \nbranches of government. Can you believe that? Unreviewable.\n  The bill undermines Congress's responsibility to legislate, and it \nweakens our ability to conduct oversight. We should learn a lot of \nlessons from past legislation. We should be doing more legislating and \nless delegating. Think of the recent things that have come out that the \nIRS has too much power.\n  In health care reform, there are 1,963 delegations of authority to \nthe Secretary to write regulations. You might think you understand a \n2,700-page piece of legislation that the President signed 4 years ago, \nbut you aren't going to know what that legislation actually does until \nthose 1,963 regulations are written. I think we are waking up to the \nfact that we delegated too much and legislated too little. We shouldn't \nbe making that same mistake with this piece of legislation and, as it \nis written, we are making that mistake.\n  I wouldn't have such strong resentment about this issue if I knew I \ncould have faith in this administration or any future administration. \nBy the time this thing gets down the road, that is going to be a future \nadministration to actually enforce the law.\n  Show me the evidence. The President and the administration have \ncurtailed enforcement programs. It claims record deportations, but then \nwhat does the President say? He turns around and he says the statistics \nare--and this is his word--``deceptive.''\n  The Secretary says the border is more secure than ever before, but \nshe denounced any notion of securing the border before people here who \nwere undocumented were given legal status. The administration \nimplemented the DREAM Act by executive fiat, saying Congress refused to \npass a bill so it decided to do something on its accord. It did that 1 \nyear after the President told a group of people he didn't have the \nauthority to do it. They provided no legal justification for the \nactions and very few answers about how they were implementing the \ndirective.\n  The refusal of any executive branch of government, whether it is \nRepublican or Democratic, to refuse accountability raises a lot of \nquestions. They refuse to be transparent and forthcoming with Congress \non almost every matter.\n  When this bill was introduced, I had to question whether the promise \nfor border security 10 years down the road would ever be fulfilled. No \none disputes that this bill is what I have said already, a bill that \nlegalizes first and enforces later. That is the core problem. That is a \ncore problem from the standpoint of everybody who is going to tell us \non this floor and during these weeks of debate that immigration reform \nis overwhelmingly popular. I am not going to dispute that.\n  Understand that there are very many things that are caveats in a \npoll. No. 1\n\n[[Page S4032]]\n\nis that we ought to have border security. The core problem is that \nenforcement comes after legalization, a core problem, and the main \nreason I could not support it out of the Judiciary Committee. It is the \nmain reason. It is unacceptable to me, and it is unacceptable to the \nAmerican people.\n  The sponsors of this bill disagree. If they would read their own \nlegislation, they would realize this fact. Later in the week I will \ndiscuss an amendment I plan to offer to change this central flaw, but \nallow me to tell my colleagues who are not on the committee about this \nmajor objection I have.\n  We have millions of undocumented people in this country. Under this \nbill, Congress would give the Secretary of Homeland Security 6 months \nto produce two reports, one on border security strategy and the other \non border fencing strategy. As soon as those two documents are sent to \nthe Hill, just as soon as they come up here, the Secretary then has \nfull authority to issue legal status, including work permits and travel \ndocuments, to millions of people who apply.\n  The result is the undocumented population receives what the bill \ncalls registered provisional status after two plans are submitted. \nRegistered provisional immigrant is RPI. RPI status is more than \nprobation. RPI status is outright legalization.\n  After the Secretary notifies Congress that she believes her plan has \nbeen accomplished, newly legalized immigrants are given a path to \nobtain green cards and a special path to citizenship.\n  Without ensuring adequate border security or holding employers \naccountable, the cycle is destined to repeat itself. I used the \ncommittee process to attempt to strengthen border security. My \namendment to fix the trigger so the Secretary would need to report to \nCongress on a fast-track system and show that the border was secured to \nget congressional approval before legalization would proceed was \ndefeated. We used the committee process to try to track who was coming \nand going from our country. Amendments to require a biometric exit \nsystem at all ports of entry, which is current law, were defeated.\n  We tried to hold employers accountable and stop the magnet for \nillegal immigration. My amendment to speed up implementation of an \nemployer verification system was defeated.\n  At the end of the day, the majority argued against securing the \nborder for another decade. The triggers in the bill that kicked off \nlegalization are ineffective and inefficient.\n  If we pass the bill as is, there will be no pressure on this \nadministration, future administrations, or those in Congress to secure \nthe border. There will be no push by the legalization advocates to get \nthe job done.\n  This is what is so important about when does legalization take place, \nbefore the border is secure or after the border is secure. Once the \nplans are presented, there will never be any pressure from advocates \nfor legalization, or anybody else who is interested in solving this \nproblem, to push to get the job done.\n\n  Moreover, the bill gives Congress the sole discretion over border \nsecurity, fencing strategy, and implementation of these strategies \nwithout any input from Congress.\n  We have a lot of questions. Will the Secretary, who believes the \nborder is stronger than ever before, be willing to make it even \nstronger? Will a Secretary who does not believe a biometric exit system \nis feasible ensure that a mandated system is put in place? Will a \nSecretary who does not believe anything should stand in the way of \nlegalization ensure the triggers are achieved?\n  Proponents of the legislation claim it includes the single largest \nincrease in immigration enforcement in American history. Proponents say \nmandatory electronic employment verification is a solution to future \nillegal immigration. It is concerning that the bill delays for years \nthe implementation of a mandatory electronic employment verification \nthrough which 99.7 percent of all work-eligible employees are confirmed \nimmediately today.\n  I will speak later in the days ahead about how this bill weakens \ncurrent law, particularly laws on the books to deter criminal behavior. \nIt concerns me greatly that the bill we are about to consider rolls \nback many criminal statutes, but also that there is nothing in the bill \nthat enhances the cooperation between the Federal Government and State \nand local jurisdictions. In fact, it preempts State laws that are \ntrying to enforce Federal laws currently in place.\n  We have a lot of work cut out for us. I know there are some who don't \nwant to see a single change in this legislation.\n  For me, this bill falls short of what I want to see in strong \nimmigration reform. The fact is we need real reform, not gimmicks that \nfail to fix the real problem and secure our border. We need to be fair \nto millions of people who came here the legal way, not bias the system \nin favor of those who sneaked in through the back door. We need a bill \nthat truly balances our national security with our economic security.\n  This is what we can do to improve the bill: I remain optimistic that \non the floor we can vote on commonsense amendments that better the \nbill. Serious consideration will be given to amendments that strengthen \nour ability to remove criminal gang members, hold perpetrators of fraud \nand abuse accountable, and prevent the weakening of criminal law. We \nmust seriously consider how the bill works to the detriment of the \nAmerican workers and find consensus around measures that require \nemployers to regroup and hire from homegrown talent before looking \nabroad, but also improving the mechanism by which people can come here \nwhen they are needed. We must be willing to close loopholes in our \nasylum system, prevent criminals and evildoers from gaining immigration \nbenefits, and ensure that we are improving our ability to protect the \nhomeland.\n  I assure my colleagues I have an open mind on this legislation. I \nwant immigration reform. I want to get it right this time, not make the \nsame mistakes I did in 1986. I want a bill I can support. To do that, I \nneed to see a stronger commitment to border security. I need to know \nfuture lawbreakers won't be rewarded, and that there will be a \ndeterrent for people who wish to enter or remain illegally in the \ncountry.\n  Basically and simply, I want the words of this bill to match the \nrhetoric of those proposing the plan. The bill sponsors want a product \nthat can garner around 70 votes in the Senate. Doing so, they seem to \nthink, would send a message to the House that they should rubberstamp a \nbill that passed the Senate and send that bill to the President. I \ndon't think that is going to happen. The House is prepared to move on \nits own legislation.\n  There will be a conference, which is a rare occurrence around here, \nby the way. A conference of the two Houses will ensure that the bill \nbenefits from various checks and balances that we worship through our \nConstitution.\n  I am not trying to jump ahead to the next step of the process, I am \nsimply telling my colleagues this bill has a long way to go through the \nlegislative process. It needs to change before it is accepted by the \nAmerican people or sent to the President. If they are serious about \ngetting this done, more compromises will be made.\n  Allow me to end by echoing the words of President Reagan:\n\n       Our objective is only to establish a reasonable, fair, \n     orderly, and secure system of immigration into this country \n     and not to discriminate in any way against particular nations \n     or people. Future generations of Americans will be thankful \n     for our efforts to humanely regain control of our borders and \n     thereby preserve the value of one of the most sacred \n     possessions of our people: American citizenship.\n\n  That was President Reagan.\n  The path we take in the days ahead will shape our country for years \nto come. It is my hope we can find a solution while learning from our \nmistakes and ensuring that future generations don't have to revisit \nthis problem down the road.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, our current immigration system is a travesty. \nIt is inefficient, uncompassionate, and dangerous. It doesn't serve \nAmerica's economic or social interests, and it undermines respect for \nthe rule of law and for our Democratic institutions.\n  Fundamental reform is both badly needed and long overdue. That is why \nI\n\n[[Page S4033]]\n\nsupport immigration reform, and it is also why I initially joined a \nbipartisan group of Senators to try to find common ground on this \nissue. But it is also why I left that group and why today I must oppose \nthe so-called Gang of 8 immigration bill.\n  At the outset of this debate, the gang promised a grand immigration \nbargain: strict border security in exchange for a pathway to \ncitizenship for approximately 11 million illegal immigrants already \nhere. Even before the bill was introduced, gang members distributed \ntalking points that lauded the bill's beefed-up security provisions, \nnew visa reforms, and measures that would make the pathway to \ncitizenship long and tough.\n  But once the gang produced actual legislation, and Senators, the \nmedia, and members of the public began to read the bill, it was clear \nthe talking points did not reflect the reality of the legislation \nitself. After pointing out glaring discrepancies between claims about \nthe bill and the actual text, Senators were told they would have an \nopportunity to make changes during the markup in the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  But the four gang members on the committee banded together as a block \nwith Democrats to defeat virtually all substantive amendments proposed \nto the bill. Congressional approval of the border security plan? No. \nImprove interior enforcement and strengthen workplace verification? \nRejected. Manage the flow of new legal immigrants? Failed. Limit access \nto some of America's most generous welfare programs? Blocked.\n  As a result, the bill that will come to the Senate floor this week is \nessentially the same huge, complex, unpredictable, expensive, and \nspecial interest-driven, big government boondoggle it was when it first \ncame to the committee.\n  The bill does not secure the border, it doesn't build a fence, and it \ndoesn't create a workable biometric entry-exit system for immigrants to \nthis country. What standards and benchmarks it does set, the bill \nsimultaneously grants the Secretary of Homeland Security broad \ndiscretion to waive. It will, however, immediately legalize millions of \ncurrently illegal immigrants, make them eligible for government \nservices, and put them on a pathway to citizenship.\n  Many critics compare the gang bill to the failed 1986 immigration \nlaw, which, similar to this one, also promised border security in \nexchange for amnesty but did not deliver on its promises. But the gang \nbill actually reminds me of a more recent piece of legislation: \nObamaCare. Similar to the President's health care law, the gang bill \nwas negotiated in secret by insiders and special interests who then \nessentially offered it to Congress as a single take-it-or-leave-it \nproposition.\n  The bill grants broad new powers to the same executive branch that is \nmired in scandal for incompetence and abuse of power. Total cost \nestimates are in the trillions, according to some. Rather than fix our \ncurrent immigration problems, the bill makes many of them worse. \nHowever well-intentioned, the Gang of 8 bill is just an immigration \nversion of ObamaCare.\n  That is why true immigration reform must be pursued on a step-by-step \nbasis, with individual reform measures implemented and verified in the \nproper sequence. Happily for immigration reformers such as I, this \nappears to be the approach being pursued in the House of \nRepresentatives. It is the only one that makes sense.\n  First, let's secure the border. Let us set up a workable entry-exit \nsystem and create a reliable employment verification system, one that \nprotects immigrants, citizens and businesses alike from bureaucratic \nmistakes. Then let's fix our legal immigration system to make sure we \nare letting in the immigrants our economy needs in the numbers that \nmake sense for our country.\n  Once these and other tasks--which are plenty big in and of \nthemselves--are completed to the satisfaction of the American people, \nthen we can address the needs of current undocumented workers with \njustice, compassion, and sensitivity.\n  Since the beginning of this year, more than 40 immigration-related \nbills have been introduced in Congress between the House and the \nSenate. By a rough count, I could support more than half of them, eight \nof which have Republican and Democratic cosponsors. We should not risk \nforward progress on these other bipartisan reforms just because we are \nunable to iron out each of the more contentious issues.\n  The Gang of 8 bill is not immigration reform. It is big government \ndysfunction. It is an immigration version of ObamaCare. All advocates \nof true immigration reform, advocates on both the left and the right \nside of the aisle, should therefore oppose it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this week we begin a historic debate. For \nthe first time in 25 years we will actively debate the comprehensive \nreform of America's immigration laws.\n  I will be the first to admit that I come to this debate with a \nprejudice, with a bias. Similar to many Americans, I am the child of an \nimmigrant.\n  In 1911, 102 years ago, my grandmother came to this country with \nthree little children. One of those children was my mother. She was 2 \nyears old when she arrived in America, in Baltimore. My grandmother \ndidn't speak a word of English, but somehow she managed to get my mom \nand my aunt and uncle on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad train to St. \nLouis, MO. They were on their way to East St. Louis, IL, to meet my \ngrandfather.\n  Just one floor and a few steps away is my desk for the majority whip \noffice. Behind my desk is a naturalization certificate from my mother. \nI keep it as a reminder of who I am and where I came from and the fact \nthat the Durbin family--and in her case the Kutkaite family--were \nimmigrants to this country. I am sure my grandmother never imagined \nthat one of her grandchildren would be standing here today representing \nthe State of Illinois in the Senate of the United States. That is my \nstory, that is my family's story, and it is America's story.\n  Perhaps it is partly because of this family history, but I believe \nimmigration is the defining positive force in America.\n  How can you tell when a country is in decline, when immigrants stop \nwanting to come to it. Many other developed countries have had this \nexperience. They have watched their economies decline and fail. That \nhas never been the experience in America. Look at our history. Every \ngeneration, immigrants coming to our shores from around the world have \nmade us stronger. Immigrants do not take away. They add to society. \nThey are hard-working men and women with the courage to leave \neverything behind and to come and try to build a new and better life \nfor themselves and their children. Every succeeding wave of immigrants, \nevery generation of immigrants brings new life to America.\n  But today our immigration system is broken and doesn't reflect our \nheritage as a nation of immigrants. There are millions of undocumented \nimmigrants in our country who want to be full-fledged Americans. They \nhave strong family values. They contribute to our economy and take some \nof the hardest jobs in our Nation. But under current law there is no \nway for many of them to even get in line to be legalized. We can't turn \nour backs on the people who are already in this Nation, already \nyearning to be officially part of the American family.\n  They sit next to us in church. Their kids go to school with our kids \nand grandkids. They are the ones who serve our food at the restaurants \nand clean up the tables afterward. They clean our homes. They care for \nour kids and grandkids and they care for our elderly parents and \ngrandparents.\n  When I first came to the Senate in 1997, I got a surprise phone call \nfrom Ted Kennedy. I was still pinching myself, thinking I am going to \nserve in the same place as Ted Kennedy. He said: I have a request for \nyou, Dick. I would like you to be a member of my Immigration \nSubcommittee on Senate Judiciary. He was the chairman. I accepted his \ninvitation.\n  I had sat in that gallery and watched Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator\n\n[[Page S4034]]\n\nBobby Kennedy on the floor of the Senate. I was just a student at the \ntime. I thought, I am going to have a chance now to sit in the same \ncommittee room with this man and speak to the issue of immigration. I \ndidn't think 16 years later I would be standing on the floor of the \nSenate, with Senator Kennedy gone, and we would still be struggling to \nfix America's broken immigration system. We have been through a lot in \nthat period of time.\n  Twelve years ago I wrote a bill called the DREAM Act. That bill would \nallow immigrant students who came to the United States as children to \nearn their citizenship by attending college or serving in the military. \nI have been fighting to make that the law of the land. I have called it \nfor a vote on the Senate floor. We have received majority votes, but I \ncould never ever break the filibuster. I could never get the 60 votes I \nneeded.\n  In the last decade, with the leadership of Senator Ted Kennedy and \nSenator John McCain, we have made serious efforts to pass comprehensive \nimmigration reform legislation, but we have always fallen short.\n  Prior to this particular debate, I can recall sitting in a room right \noff the Senate floor with another young Senator named Barack Obama \nworking on immigration reform. It has been our challenge. Now the \nSenate is going to take up this issue again this week. This is the best \nchance we have had in 25 years to finally get this job done.\n  Six months ago I sat down for the first time with seven other \nSenators, four Republicans and three other Democrats. On my side of the \ntable: Chuck Schumer of New York, chairman of the Immigration \nSubcommittee; Senator Bob Menendez, a leader with the Congressional \nHispanic Caucus; and Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who knows this \nissue firsthand from his State; on the other side of the table, John \nMcCain; Senator Marco Rubio of Florida; Senator Lindsey Graham of South \nCarolina; and Jeff Flake of Arizona. They started calling us the Gang \nof 8. I have been in so many gangs around here, I think I need to get \nsome tattoos, but I am not likely to do that. But these gangs are \nconstructive efforts to solve problems.\n  This is a diverse group. Think about sitting across the table from \nMcCain, Rubio, Graham, and Flake. There sits Schumer, Durbin, Menendez, \nand Bennet--a lot of differences. But what brought us together was the \nrealization that if we couldn't reach an agreement, neither would the \nSenate. If we couldn't bridge the differences between Democrats and \nRepublicans, conservatives and others in our negotiations, the Senate \nnever would.\n  We set out to get the job done. Several times I wasn't sure if we \nwere going to be successful.\n  The Republicans had a bottom line. They wanted strong measures to \nsecure our border with Mexico and to prevent future illegal \nimmigration. We had a bottom line on our side of the table, too: a \ntough but fair path to citizenship offered to 11 million undocumented \nimmigrants. We met for 4 months. We met 24 times, long and difficult \nsessions. A couple of those sessions I thought were the last ones, we \nwould not be back another day, but we returned. We made concessions. \nEverybody gave a little. At the end of the day we reached an agreement.\n  We announced in January our set of principles and then we started the \nhardest part, drafting the actual legislation. By the middle of April \nwe finally had a bill almost 850 pages, if I am not mistaken. It is \nhere now. I probably ought to take a look and make sure I got the page \nnumbers correct. This version is a lot longer because it is the \ncommittee substitute, but it is more than 850 pages.\n  We heard testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee from dozens of \nwitnesses, supporters, and opponents. Then in May we sat down for a \nmarkup, which is where we actually amend the bill. I have been a member \nof the Judiciary Committee for 15 years and I have never been through a \nmarkup like that. Senator Pat Leahy of Vermont, President pro tempore \nof the Senate, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, pledged he \nwould make this markup open and fair to both sides--and he did. It took \nus 3 weeks. We met 5 times for a total of 37 hours on this bill. More \nthan 300 amendments were offered. We debated and voted on 212 of them, \nincluding 112 by Republicans and 100 by Democrats. Mr. President, 136 \namendments, or changes, were adopted and all but 3 of those 136 passed \nwith a bipartisan vote. The spirit of bipartisanship was in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee as it was in our meetings leading up to it.\n  Finally came the vote for reporting the bill out of committee. It was \none of those historic moments which no Senator present will ever \nforget. When Chairman Leahy announced the 13-to-5 vote in favor of this \nmeasure, the room erupted in applause and cheers. People stood up at \ntheir seats and came up and embraced one another, realizing we had just \nmade history.\n  Let me go through the basics of the bill. First, our bill will secure \nthe border and stop future illegal immigration. The border of the \nUnited States today is safer and stronger than it has ever been in 40 \nyears. We have invested billions of dollars. We have doubled the number \nof Federal personnel working on the border, monitoring the coming and \ngoing of people across that border every single day. We have reached a \nlevel of competence and security we never dreamed of. Now we are going \nto do more. We have promised the Republicans at the table we will \nsecure that border with even more technology and more investment.\n  Each year we spend about $18 billion policing the border between the \nUnited States and Mexico--$18 billion. That is more than the combined \nexpenditures for all of the Federal law enforcement agencies--FBI, \nSecret Service, Drug Enforcement Administration, Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms, and U.S. Marshals Office. We spend more than that each year \non the border and now we will invest even more.\n  For those who argue we are not serious about border protection, \nbelieve me, we are. The investments will be made with the very best \ntechnology, with the advice and cooperation of the States affected by \nthese decisions, to make that border as safe as humanly possible. We \nhave made amazing progress.\n  We can do more. The Border Patrol agents, over 20,000 of them at work \ntoday, are better staffed than at any time in the 88-year history of \nthat agency. The Department of Homeland Security has completed 651 \nmiles of border fencing out of the 652 miles mandated by Congress. I \nwas a skeptic when they said they would put fences on the border. I \nreally was. My belief was if you build a 10-foot fence it was an \ninvitation for a 12-foot ladder, and my belief was they could easily \novercome it. They put fences in places where they could work and they \nput other devices in places where fences won't work. Significant \nresults have been shown. Cities on the southern border are among the \nsafest in the country. Violent crimes in the border States have dropped \nan average of over 40 percent over the past 20 years and the top 4 big \ncities in America with the lowest rates of violent crime are all in \nborder States: San Diego, Phoenix, El Paso, Austin.\n  Our bill will do more. We set a clear, tough target for border \nsecurity. The bill requires the Border Patrol to have 100-percent \npersistent surveillance of the southwest border. In other words, the \nBorder Patrol will have to be able to see in real time every single \nperson who crosses that southwest border illegally. We also required a \n90-percent effectiveness rate for southwest border sectors. In other \nwords, the Border Patrol will have to stop 90 percent of all people who \nattempt to enter the country illegally in each border sector. It \nrequires the Department of Homeland Security to create a southern \nborder security plan and a southern border fencing strategy within 6 \nmonths after the bill is passed. The border security plan will spell \nout the personnel, infrastructure, and technology necessary to achieve \nthis 90-percent effectiveness rate.\n  The bill approves $3 billion for this border plan, $1.5 billion more \nfor a fencing strategy. If the Department of Homeland Security does not \nreach 90 percent effectiveness within 5 years, the Border Commission, \nmade up of southwestern State officials and bipartisan Presidential and \ncongressional appointees, is empowered to employ additional steps to \nsecure the border. Our bill appropriates up to $2 billion in additional \nspending, if necessary, for those measures. Anyone who takes a\n\n[[Page S4035]]\n\nlook at this--and you will hear many of the critics in the next few \nweeks say ``they are just not serious about the border''--believe me, \nwe are. We have been. We continue to be. We put the resources on the \ntable, with the cooperation of the States bordering Mexico, to make \nsure we have done absolutely everything within our human capability to \nkeep that border safe and strong and secure.\n  Of course, improving border security overlooks one very obvious \nweakness: Forty percent of the undocumented immigrants in the United \nStates did not cross the border illegally. They came into the United \nStates legally on visas: students, visitors. Similar visas were given \nto them and they overstayed. They were supposed to come to go to \ncollege and they stayed after college. They were supposed to come for a \nvacation or family event and they overstayed their visas, so 40 percent \nof the undocumented people overstayed their visas. We address that.\n  This bill requires the electronic tracking of people who enter and \nexit America. We require, in this bill, that all visas, passports, and \nother travel documents for immigrants who are entering or exiting the \nUnited States be in the form of a machine-readable document which can \nbe scanned as they enter and leave the country so we will know who is \ncoming and going. The bill mandates this machine-readable system be \ninteroperable with the databases that are used by Federal immigration \nand law enforcement agencies and the intelligence community. We are \ntrying to integrate all of this information about people coming and \ngoing and living in this country, to make us safer and make the system \nwork.\n\n  This gives the authorities real-time access to information to connect \nthe dots across law enforcement data bases, including the FBI \nfingerprint check, name check, and the NCIC list. The new machine-\nreadable entry-exit system will access this information when \ndetermining whether to issue a visa or deny entry.\n  I say to those observing this debate, when you hear just the two \nthings I have mentioned, you have to say this bill, S. 744, is going to \nmake America safer. The border is going to be stronger. We are going to \nknow who is coming and going in America.\n  And there is more. We also need to address the job magnet that brings \nillegal, undocumented people into the United States. We need to make it \nmore difficult to hire undocumented people. Our bill does it. We \nrequire all employers to use a mandatory electronic employment \nverification system to verify the employees are legal. Job applicants \nwould have to show identifying documents such as a U.S. passport, \ndrivers license, or biometric work authorization card that includes \nphoto identification. The employer in any business, in any town across \nAmerica, with access to a computer goes to the E-Verify system, enters \nthe vital information about the person sitting across the table, pushes \nthe button and waits to see if the photo that comes across the computer \nscreen is the same photo as the one that has been presented. There is \nthe verification. The employment can continue to go forward.\n  Our bill will reform our legal immigration system to strengthen our \neconomy, our families, and our workers. We need to ensure that families \nwho have been separated for many years can be finally reunited. \nEmployers should be given a chance to hire an immigrant worker when \ntruly needed, but first--and I insisted on this throughout--we require \nthat you have to offer the job to an American before you bring in a \nforeign worker.\n  Our first obligation, whatever State we represent, is to the people \nwe represent, particularly those who are out of work. This bill \nrequires when there is a job opening, before you can offer it to a \nforeign worker you must offer it to an American. Maybe they cannot fill \nthe job. Maybe they do not have the qualifications. Maybe you need some \nspecialty. Then you can go forward under specific conditions here, with \nlimitations, in hiring that foreign worker.\n  We have been told by the business community, especially high tech, \nthat there is a need for more high-skilled workers in our country. Last \nweek I went to the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. There \nwas an incubator there. In small suites of offices, amazing things are \nunderway. Some of them I cannot even explain to you. I am a liberal \narts lawyer, OK? The closest I ever got to real science was political \nscience and that doesn't count. I tried to listen and absorb as much as \nI could about what they were doing at this fabulous institution. Some \nof the things they are doing there are dramatically reducing the cost \nof producing biological vaccines and medicines--medicines that are \nused, for example, in cancer therapy--to cut the cost in half. They \nhave been experimenting on new ways to do that.\n  I met a young man named Bo Sung, from China. The man who was \nintroducing us was from India himself and he was the head of the \nproject. He said: ``This young man came to the Illinois Institute of \nTechnology, and to Chicago, to get an advanced degree. He is \npossibly,'' he said, ``the smartest student I have ever had in any \nclass--straight As in China, learned English and came here to learn \nmore.'' He is working on this project. I got to meet him. He was kind \nof shy, friendly, in a way, standing off to the side. They brought him \nover.\n  I said to him: Let me ask you, Mr. Sung, would you be interested in \nstaying in the United States and developing this project?\n  He said: If I could, I would.\n  Here was a man, brought for education in the United States, who will \nsoon be given a choice to go back to China or to stay in the United \nStates. His preference was to stay here. We require in this bill that \nif you have an advanced degree in STEM subjects--science, technology, \nengineering, and math--an advanced degree, and you have a job offer, \nthat you be offered a green card. A green card is a path to \nlegalization and citizenship. I think that is a smart thing to do.\n  I can recall attending the graduation at the same school a few years \nback where it seemed every advanced degree was going to someone from \nIndia or South Asia. I thought to myself: What a sad situation. We are \nhanding them advanced degrees, which they earned in the United States \nat the best schools, and we are handing them a map on how to find their \nway back to O'Hare and leave.\n  This is a better approach. If there is a job offer, we need to keep \nthis talent in America. It will not just employ that person, it will \nemploy many others who can work for the companies they are going to \nhelp. Employers, under our bill, will be given a chance to hire \ntemporary foreign workers when they truly need them, after they have \ntried to recruit Americans for the same jobs. We also require that any \nemployer who hires a foreign worker must pay a fee to be set aside for \na fund to help train Americans.\n  Let's put the cards on the table here. If you go to the graduation \nceremonies at these schools, the best engineering schools in America, \nyou will find a majority of foreign students. That is the reality \ntoday. So let's change the reality. Let's take the fees we will collect \nwhen these foreign workers, trained in the United States, are brought \nhere to work--take the fees and create, as we do in this bill, \nscholarships and college funds for American engineering students. Let's \ngrow our own in this country. Let's make sure we have young people \ncoming out of our high schools and colleges who are prepared to get \nadvanced degrees who are from America. There is nothing wrong with \nthat. That is our first obligation, and this bill will do that.\n\n  In Illinois, more than 40 percent of the students who earned master's \nor doctoral degrees in a STEM field are temporary nonimmigrants.\n  In 2011, almost 2,700 specialists in advanced fields such as computer \nscience, programming, and biomedicine who earned degrees in Illinois \ncould not obtain visas upon their graduation. Yet in Illinois alone we \nwill need 320,000 STEM graduates in the next 5 years.\n  It makes no sense. They are trained at the best schools in Illinois, \nwe need them in Illinois, and then we tell them to leave?\n  It makes no sense.\n  Our bill allows employers to sponsor for a green card any student who \ngraduates from a U.S. school with an advanced degree in STEM fields if \nthey will be working in a STEM job. We also have a significant increase \nin H-1B visas for skilled workers. We now have a limit of about 65,000 \nH-1B visas a\n\n[[Page S4036]]\n\nyear. It can go up to 115,000, depending on the supply and demand, and \neven as high as 180,000.\n  For the first time employers will be required to post the job on the \nDepartment of Labor Web site for 30 days before they hire a foreign \nworker, which goes back to the point I made earlier--first, the job is \noffered to an American.\n  Under current law, employers are permitted to pay H-1B visa holders \nsubstandard wages. We changed it. We raised the wages to be paid to the \nH-1B workers. We don't want to create the incentive to bring in low-\nwage foreign workers. We want a good wage to be offered to an American \nfirst.\n  We also take important steps to crack down on the biggest abuse of H-\n1B visas--outsourcing of American jobs. When most people think of H-1B \nvisas, which are visas to bring in professionals, most people think of \nhigh-tech companies such as Microsoft and Google hiring engineers they \nneed and paying them top dollar. The reality today is dramatically \ndifferent.\n  In fiscal year 2012 all of the top 10 H-1B visa applicants were \noutsourcing foreign firms. These 10 companies used 40 percent of all \nthe H-1B visas. Under current law employers can legally use the H-1B \nvisa program for outsourcing. We changed it. We phased out the abuse of \nthe H-1B system so that those using the H-1B program will be actually \nhiring the employees they need.\n  One of the items in this bill near and dear to all of us--certainly \non our side of the table--is a path to citizenship.\n  During the last Presidential campaign one of the candidates on the \nother side advocated what he called self-deportation--that is the \nphrase he used--of undocumented immigrants who are currently living in \nour country, to leave. He was basically forcing undocumented people to \nleave.\n  It wouldn't work, it is impractical, and I think it is fundamentally \nwrong. Instead, we need a fair and firm solution strengthening our \nnational security and our economy that is true to our heritage as a \nnation of immigrants. Our legislation creates a tough but fair path to \ncitizenship.\n  What it boils down to is we need to say to the 11 million \nundocumented people in America: If you can prove you were here \ncontinuously before December 31, 2011, you have a chance to step \nforward, register with the government, and submit yourself to a \nbackground check. If there is a serious problem with your criminal \nbackground, you are finished. Leave. You cannot become a citizen. But \nif there is not, you can pay your taxes, pay a fine, live legally in \nAmerica, work legally in America, travel, and come back into this \ncountry, and work towards citizenship over time.\n  It is a long process. They will be monitored. They will be forced to \nlearn English to make sure they and their children can be part of \nAmerica and its future. We would do this over a 13-year period of time. \nWhat we have today is de facto amnesty. We have 11 million undocumented \npeople, and we don't have a law to apply--at least not one that is \nenforced on a regular basis. Our new law, if passed, will create a \nlevel playing field.\n  According to the Center for American Progress, if our bill becomes \nlaw, undocumented immigrants will increase their earnings by 15 percent \nover 5 years, leading to $832 billion in economic growth and $109 \nbillion in tax revenue over the next 10 years. It also will create an \nestimated 121,000 jobs.\n  I have sat down with workers, particularly union workers, in my \nState. They say: Senator, what are you doing to us? You are bringing in \nall of these people who will now be competing with us in the workplace.\n  I asked them to stop for a moment and reflect on the following: These \nundocumented workers are competing with them today. We can find a brick \nlayer, a plumber, somebody who can put on a roof in virtually any major \ncity in America, and many of those folks are undocumented. In many \ncases they are getting paid many times less than a minimum wage, and \nthey are competing with other workers legally here in America. We \nchange all of that. They come forward, identify themselves, and they \nare bound by the laws of this country. It is going to help them \nultimately, but it helps workers in general so they are not facing this \nunfair competitive advantage.\n  I see Senator Cornyn is here, and I want to give him a chance to say \na few words. But first I want to close by speaking about two things \nbefore I do.\n  At the beginning I mentioned that 12 years ago I introduced the DREAM \nAct. The DREAM Act was a response to a call to my office in Chicago. \nThere was a young girl in the city of Chicago who came to that city \nfrom Korea through Brazil. Her mother and father brought her into \nChicago with her brother and sister, and they were very poor.\n  Her father wanted to be a minister and have a church. He never \nrealized that dream, and he stayed at home and prayed for that dream \nevery day. Her mother finally said: Somebody has to earn some money. So \nshe went to work at a local dry cleaners.\n  Well, the kids were raised in a one-room efficiency with hammocks so \nthey could sleep, get by with what little they had, and it was a pretty \ndesperate circumstance. This young woman, whose name is Tereza Lee, had \nto basically go to school and look through the wastebasket after lunch \nto find food that other kids had thrown away so she could eat. That is \nhow desperate she was.\n  Somewhere along the way she was invited to become part of the Merit \nMusic Program. What a wonderful program. About 10 years ago a woman in \nChicago said: As my legacy, I want to create the Merit Music Program \nwhich offers free musical instruments and musical instruction to the \npoorest students in our public schools. It has worked miracles. One \nhundred percent of the kids in the Merit Music Program go to college. \nWell, Tereza Lee was one of them.\n  It turned out Tereza Lee was an accomplished music student who \nlearned the piano. They finally gave her a key to the Merit Music \nProgram building because it was warm, and she liked to stay there late \nat night and play the piano. She got so good they said: You have to \napply to the Juilliard School of Music and the Manhattan School of \nMusic in New York.\n\n  She got the papers----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for 4 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. She had the application to fill out, and it asked for her \ncitizenship and nationality. At that point, she turned to her mom and \nsaid: What should I put there?\n  Her mom said: I don't know. When we brought you here, you were on a \nvisitor's visa, but we never filed any more papers.\n  Tereza said: What are we going to do?\n  Her mom said: Let's call Senator Durbin.\n  They called my office, and we checked the law. The law was not very \nkind to a young person in that circumstance. It said she had to leave \nAmerica immediately and stay away for 10 years and apply to come back.\n  She was 17 years old. It didn't make any sense. She didn't do \nanything wrong. She was brought here as a baby.\n  I introduced the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act said young people who came \nto the United States under the same circumstance as Tereza and were \nbrought here before the age of 16, finished high school, had no serious \ncriminal issues, and could finish at least 2 years of college or enlist \nin the military would have a chance for citizenship. I have been trying \nto pass that ever since.\n  These DREAMers, which they now call themselves, have started stepping \nforward and telling their stories. They are in some peril when they do \nthis, but they want America to know who they are. Some of them have \namazing stories to tell.\n  I will tell two stories very quickly. This is Alejandro Morales. He \nwas brought to the United States from Mexico at the age of 7 months and \nraised in Chicago. His dream was to become a U.S. marine. He enrolled \nin the Marine Math and Science Academy in Chicago and excelled in \nschool in the Young Marines Program. He eventually rose to become the \nCity Corps staff commander, the highest ranking cadet of 11,000 junior \nROTC students in Chicago.\n  In a letter he wrote to me he said:\n\n       I want to serve and fight to protect my country. I am an \n     American; I know nothing but the United States.\n\n\n[[Page S4037]]\n\n\n  Last week, in a sad, tragic, mean-spirited vote, the House of \nRepresentatives passed an amendment to deport DREAMers such as \nAlejandro. It is a shameless display of lack of understanding of this \nfine young man and thousands more just like him who want to be a part \nof America's future. Losing him will not make us any stronger.\n  Let me introduce another DREAMer. This is Issac Carbajal and his \nmother Victoria. Issac was brought to the United States from Mexico \nwhen he was 5 years old. They settled in the suburb of Portland, OR, \nand he went to high school there. A military recruiter told Issac he \ncould have a promising career in the Armed Forces.\n  He sought the advice of a family friend, Dr. John Braddock. John and \nhis wife Kim came to think of Issac as another son. Issac met the \nBraddock family shortly after arriving in this country.\n  In a letter to me John wrote that Issac ``loved this country, his \ncountry.'' They both believed the recruiter who told Issac he could \nenlist in the military and apply for citizenship in 2 years.\n  In January 2011 when Issac went to San Diego to enlist in the \nmilitary, he was immediately arrested, turned over to ICE, and deported \nto Tijuana the next day. He was dropped off alone in a country he had \nnot seen in almost 15 years with no identification and nothing but $18 \nin his pocket.\n  Now he is barred from returning to the United States for 10 years. He \noriginally went to enlist in the military. Although it has been almost \n2\\1/2\\ years since he has been deported, he still wants to come back \nand serve in the Armed Forces of the United States.\n  There are so many stories just like this of these DREAMers who want \nto make this a better Nation. The strongest DREAM Act provisions that \nhave ever been crafted are included in this bill and agreed to on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  Let's pass this bill. Let's end this debate after a fulsome exchange \nof ideas and amendments. Let's end this debate with a strong bipartisan \nvote that says both Republicans and Democrats understand that this \nNation of immigrants must renew its commitment to every generation to \nour heritage. We need to renew our commitment to those people in our \nfamilies who had the courage to get up and come to this great Nation, \nface great sacrifice, and succeed and build what we call home: the \nUnited States of America.\n  Now it is our turn. Let's not only prove we can do the right thing \nfor them and the heritage of this Nation, let's prove that every once \nin a while this great institution of the Senate can actually get some \nimportant work done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we have been working on immigration reform \never since I came to the Senate about 10 years ago. I have sponsored \nlegislation--most notably with the former Senator Jon Kyl in 2005--\ncalled the Comprehensive Border Security and Immigration Reform Act.\n  The legislation I have worked on since I have been in the Senate has \ndealt with virtually every aspect of the issues that immigration \ntouches on--from high-skilled visas and guest worker programs to border \nsecurity to enhancement of our ports of entry. The staffing at those \nports of entry is important. It makes it possible for legitimate \ncommerce and trade to go back and forth, most notably, with Mexico \nwhich shares 1,200 miles of common border with my State of Texas.\n  As a result of that bilateral exchange, 6 million jobs are created in \nthe United States alone. I believe I have been involved in some of the \ntoughest parts of the immigration debate, and as I have joked to my \nstaff and family, I have the scars to prove it.\n  The truth is this is a new topic in many ways to so many Members of \nthe Senate because 43 Senators have come to this Chamber since the last \ntime we debated this topic in 2007. While the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee has had the opportunity to vote on this important \nlegislation, the rest of the body has not had a chance to weigh in and \noffer their contributions, hopefully, with an eye toward improving the \nbill and making it something of which we can be proud.\n  When I first read the bill produced by the so-called Gang of 8, I saw \nmany improvements in our current broken immigration system. For \nexample, the bill, as written by the Gang of 8 and now passed out of \nthe Judiciary Committee, allowed more STEM graduates; that is, \ngraduates from our colleges and universities with math, science, and \nengineering degrees, to gain admission to our country as legal \npermanent residents and eventually citizens. Further, I think the bill \nmakes some improvements in terms of family unification. It brings \nfamilies together who are split because of archaic and unworkable \nprovisions in our immigration law. I think the bill also helps take an \nimportant step toward regaining the public's confidence.\n  The Federal Government is actually up to writing laws that can be \nenforced and will actually work as advertised. That is where the E-\nVerify provisions are so important. It makes sure employers only hire \npeople who are legally eligible to work in this country. In that same \nvein, this bill as originally written would provide some enhanced \npenalties to employers who would game the system by evading legal \nworkers and hiring people who cannot legally work in the United States.\n\n  All of these provisions enjoy broad bipartisan support. Yet, coming \nfrom a border State, as I said--one that shares 1,200 miles of common \nborder with Mexico, through which the overwhelming majority of illegal \nimmigration across our borders occurs--I believe there are dramatic \nimprovements needed in this bill when it comes to securing America's \nborders and promoting public safety, and those cannot be disentangled \nfrom one another.\n  We know that the same border that allows somebody who wants to come \ninto this country to work and have a better life--certainly something \nwe can all understand and empathize with--also permits drug cartels and \nhuman traffickers to penetrate our borders and apply their dangerous \ntrade.\n  We have also learned over time that our 2,000-mile southern border is \nvery diverse. In other words, if a person is from California and their \nview is that the border of the San Diego area where they have double-\nfencing and mounted patrols, in essence, by the Border Patrol--that may \nwell work to control the border in San Diego, but it may not work in \nArizona or in Texas. As a matter of fact, we have seen dramatic \nimprovements in Arizona. Two of the Members of the Gang of 8, Senator \nMcCain and Senator Flake, have been very diligent in working on those \nissues in their State.\n  However, I must tell my colleagues that, coming from the State of \nTexas, where we have the longest extension of uncontrolled border in \nthe country, there is a lot of work that needs to be done because of \nthis diversity, and that is the spirit in which I intend to offer \namendments to help improve border security and public safety.\n  Now, the bill grants permanent legal status to millions of \nundocumented immigrants as currently written without any guarantee of \nsecuring the border. How would that possibly be a good idea? In other \nwords, there are many Americans who, in their humanity and out of \nsimple human compassion, understand that the 12 million or 11 million \npeople who are currently undocumented or who are in illegal status in \nthis country--they understand we are not going to do a massive \ndeportation of those 12 million people. It is just not going to happen. \nWhat they would be willing to do is to accept a legal status for those \nindividuals if they can be assured the immigration bill that is \nactually passed will work as advertised.\n  Those eligible for immediate legalization under the current bill \nwould include those already deported immigrants as well as people who \nhave been convicted of serious crimes such as domestic violence, child \nabuse, and drunk driving. How could that possibly be a good idea? We \nneed to fix those provisions and fix the bill in the process.\n  Meanwhile, unfortunately, this bill also weakens current law with \nregard to people entering the country legally but failing to leave when \ntheir visa expires. This is the so-called biometric entry-exit system \nwhich has been the law of the land since 1996. When we wonder why \npeople are skeptical about the Federal Government's commitment to \nactually enforce the law as written, exhibit A is this 1996 requirement \nfor a\n\n[[Page S4038]]\n\nbiometric entry-exit system that has never been implemented. Visa \noverstays account for 40 percent of illegal immigration. Don't we want \nto fix that provision of the bill? Yes, we should, and, yes, we will if \nmy amendment is adopted.\n  This bill also hides from law enforcement officials certain critical \ninformation necessary to detect fraud. One of the big problems with the \n1986 amnesty that Ronald Reagan signed based on the premise that there \nwould be enforcement and no need to ever provide another amnesty again, \nthat this would actually be enforced, was that there was so much fraud \nassociated with it because of the confidentiality requirements of the \nlaw. Those same mistakes have been repeated in the underlying bill, and \nthat needs to be fixed.\n  My amendment--something we call the RESULTS amendment because we need \nnot just new promises, we need actual results--fixes these problems.\n  First, it requires the Department of Homeland Security to gain \ncomplete situational awareness and full operational control of the \nSouthwestern border, with ``operational control'' defined as at least a \n90-percent apprehension rate of illegal border crossers. Ultimately, \nthe goal needs to be not just focused on how many we apprehend but on \ndeterrence. Law enforcement generally operates when people are deterred \nfrom violating the law because they fear being captured and the \npunishment that goes along with it. So that ultimately needs to be our \ngoal, but it will never happen unless we capture at least 90 percent of \nthe people who come across, thus sending the message that the American \nborder is now secure.\n  My amendment would also require the use of a biometric exit system at \nall airports and seaports where Customs and Border Protection is \ncurrently deployed, and it requires national implementation of E-\nVerify. Again, that system will allow employers not to be the police \nbut to have a simple and easy way to verify that the individuals who \npresent themselves for employment at their place of business are \nlegally qualified to work in the United States.\n  The biggest difference between my amendment and the underlying bill \nis that my amendment guarantees results, while the Gang of 8 proposal \nmerely promises results.\n  I have to tell my colleagues that perhaps with all of the confluence \nof scandals occurring in Washington, DC, including the IRS debacle and \nthe Health and Human Services Secretary shaking down and raising money \nfrom the very people she regulates, there is a lot of what I would call \na confidence deficit in Washington, DC--particularly given Washington's \nabysmal record in enforcing our immigration laws. But it is important \nto distinguish between promises and results.\n  Remember, the Federal Government has promised to secure our border \nfor the last quarter century, and the trail of broken promises, as I \nsaid, goes back to 1986 when Congress passed an amnesty program while \nassuring voters they would see results on border security and \nenforcement. As everyone knows, we got the amnesty but not the \nenforcement in 1986, and the underlying bill suffers the same problems. \nAt the very least, we should try to learn from history and not repeat \nit. Unfortunately, the underlying bill fails to acknowledge those \nlessons we should have learned about steps we need to take in order to \nguarantee results rather than make repetitive promises we ultimately \ndon't keep.\n  I understand why the American people don't trust Washington. I \nunderstand why they dismiss some border security promises as rhetoric. \nThat is why my RESULTS amendment is so important and essential to \naccomplishing the goal of bipartisan immigration reform.\n  As I said, right now Congress and Washington have a major credibility \nproblem. No one believes we are actually serious about actually \nsecuring the borders and stopping the hemorrhaging of humanity across \nour southern border into the United States, including not just people \nwho want to work but people who are up to no good--the human \ntraffickers and the drug dealers. I am afraid the Gang of 8 bill in its \ncurrent form would make this problem worse. So I believe the true \npoison pill would be the failure to take sensible measures by adopting \namendments such as mine which are designed to actually solve the \nproblem and guarantee results rather than ignore this important \ncredibility gap Washington has.\n\n  As I said, we do not need promises, we need results, and that is what \nmy amendment would provide. Instead of enacting so-called triggers that \nare just really talking points disguised as policy, it is time for us \nto adopt real triggers that condition the pathway to citizenship on \nWashington and the bureaucracy and Congress hand-in-hand working to \nmake sure the law is enforced as written.\n  The majority leader reportedly, according to Politico, has somehow \ncalled my amendment a poison pill. We have heard that kind of language \nbefore. This is an effort designed to discourage those who would \nactually create a workable, results-driven immigration reform system \nfrom even offering their ideas. The irony is the majority leader hasn't \neven read my amendment because it hasn't been reduced to legislative \nlanguage yet. He has prematurely called it a poison pill. In fact, the \ntrue poison pill would be failure to adopt such a sensible approach \nthat would guarantee results so that when it goes to the House, we can \nsee we are actually serious about delivering an immigration reform bill \nthat functions as advertised and not just another series of hollow \npromises.\n  Strengthening border security and enhancing interior enforcement are \nnot alternatives to fixing our broken immigration system; they are \ncomplements to the kinds of sensible reforms Members of both parties \nhave endorsed. Indeed, the provisions of my amendment actually build on \nthe framework created by the bipartisan Gang of 8 proposal. The \ndifference is, again, that we don't just make the promises, we don't \njust require the issuance of a plan, we actually require metrics to \nmeasure success, and we hold the feet of Congress and the bureaucracy \nto the fire to make sure those metrics and those goals are actually \nachieved.\n  Even as we debate the most controversial issues, we should be doing \neverything possible to promote the type of legal immigration that \nbenefits our society and our economy as well. It is with that spirit in \nmind that I will be introducing at a later time my RESULTS amendment, \nand I encourage my colleagues to take a look at it and join me in \nstrengthening this underlying bill, making it more likely, not less \nlikely, that we will actually pass a bill that will be taken up by the \nHouse of Representatives and eventually be presented to the President \nfor his signature.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to express my appreciation to \nthe Senator from Texas. He is a superb member of the Judiciary \nCommittee. He offered an amendment to this effect in the committee. I \nthought it should have passed. It would have helped with a flawed bill. \nBut it was voted down. I know that he is working even harder now, and I \nknow that whatever he proposes will be the kind of legislation that \nwill strengthen this bill.\n  I share with the American people a deep frustration with the current \nfailed operation of our immigration system and share some fundamental \nprinciples of immigration reform that have been expressed by the Gang \nof 8.\n  The Gang of 8 has said the current system is broken. I agree. But \nmore accurately, we should say the current law and procedures are not \nbeing properly carried out and are resulting in monumental illegality \nin our country--something that is not worthy of a great nation.\n  The Gang of 8 says that we must toughen our approach to border \nsecurity and that we can do better. They implicitly, even openly \nacknowledge that our government officials have a long history of failed \nborder enforcement and that they cannot be reasonably trusted to \nenforce the law. So even when the American people plead with our \ngovernment to do something about the illegality, for decades this \ngovernment has failed to do so.\n\n  I agree that the gang has touched on something important. But the \ngang acknowledges, in effect, the governing class and the activists and \nspecial interests want amnesty, and these groups lack interest in or a \nwill to sustain a\n\n[[Page S4039]]\n\npolicy of fair enforcement in the future. They say we have to guard \nagainst that, but that is what happened before. They acknowledge that. \nAnd I agree.\n  To ensure that amnesty does not take effect immediately, with only \npromised enforcement in the future--which never occurs, it seems, as \nhappened in the 1986 amnesty bill--they have promised that they have \ntriggers that ensure amnesty will not result unless enforcement occurs. \nThat is the promise: We have triggers and we have mechanisms so that \nyou cannot get amnesty unless enforcement occurs. We have a guarantee \nof that, and we will ensure that happens.\n  So I agree with the sentiment and this concern because we know what \nhas been happening. I have been engaged in this debate since I have \nbeen in the Senate, but I do not agree their legislation comes close to \nfulfilling this promise. It just does not. That is the rub. The \ncomprehensive immigration bill does not fix our failing system. The \nprovisions, the faux triggers, the expression of interest in fencing, \ncommissions, will work no better than current law. It will not end the \nillegality in the future.\n  So I will discuss some of the flaws in their plan today, but I want \nto make one thing clear. I think most Americans believe in immigration. \nI know they do. Most Americans are concerned about people who have been \nhere a very long time and have had no real problems in their lives \nother than the immigration illegality, and they are prepared to reach \nout and do some compassionate things for them to give them a legal \nstatus that allows them to raise their families and their children who \nhave become citizens. They are willing to do that, but they are \nconcerned about the future.\n  Will we end up again, like in 1986, where a bill is passed that \npromises enforcement, but the amnesty occurs immediately, and then the \npromises in the future do not ever occur? What was Wimpy's line? ``I \nwill be glad to pay you tomorrow for a hamburger today.'' I am glad to \nsay we will have amnesty tomorrow, but I want the enforcement today in \nconcrete.\n  A recent Rasmussen poll explains how the people view this issue--\nactually it was within the last few days. By a 4-to-1 margin, people \nsay the enforcement should come first. Yes, they are willing to be \ncompassionate, willing to wrestle through a fair and decent way to \ntreat people, but they do believe that enforcement should come first \nbecause we have not had it before.\n  On this point the instincts of our citizens are correct. Their \ncompassion is real. Their respect for the rule of law is real. They \nknow amnesty has an erosive, corrosive impact on the rule of law, and \nwe have to be very diligent to ensure in the future that we are not \ncreating the kind of events that erode our law even more. People are \nnot biased. They approve of our system of 1 million people immigrating \nhere every year, but they do want the system followed fairly.\n  The Gang of 8, in their public statements, seem to say that is what \ngood policy should be. That is what they have been talking about. That \nis what they expect the American people to hear about their \nlegislation. That is what they have promised them they are working on, \nand that has been produced and laid out here.\n  They say they, too, are upset about what is happening. They say their \nplan will end illegality in the future, and it is the toughest \nimmigration law in history. One Senator of the gang in the committee \nsaid it was ``tough as nails.'' Thus, without equivocation, they say we \nmust have enforcement. But it is in the future, and we have a plan \nwhere you can sleep well at night and know it is going to happen.\n  So that is the fundamental test of where we are in this legislation. \nThere are a lot of problems with the bill--a lot of very serious \nproblems--and we will talk about them. But I think fundamentally the \nquestion is just: Have our sponsors laid forth a strategy that will \nwork?\n  Let's examine the key components of any system that is laid out, see \nhow it deals with them. There are two ways to become an illegal \nresident of America. One is to come by visa, overstay that visa, and \njust not return home. Forty percent of the people here illegally came \nlegally by visa, but they just refused to go back home at the time \ntheir visa expired. The other way is simply to cross the border \nillegally, and we have had that by the millions in recent years.\n  This legislation does not fix the enforcement defects of either one \nof those entry methods. I have studied this issue. It can be done. We \ncan fix both of them. It is within our grasp. It is something we can \naccomplish, and I would like to see us do so.\n  Unfortunately, analysis of this bill shows we have a problem. First, \nthe Gang of 8's written principles that they announced at the beginning \nof their discussions said the path to citizenship in their bill would \nbe ``contingent upon securing the borders and tracking whether legal \nimmigrants have left the country when required.''\n  So that is both areas: the failure to leave upon expiration of a visa \nand the illegal crossing of the border.\n  Senator Rubio went so far as to say:\n\n       The process of legalization . . . none of that happens-- \n     None of that happens--until until we have been able to \n     certify that indeed the workplace security thing is in \n     place, the visa tracking is in place, and there is some \n     level of operational control of the border.\n\n  That was in January of this year.\n  Well, that is right. We should not be doing this until we can certify \nand we know we have this system under control.\n  But around the same time it was reported that Frank Sharry, the head \nof the proamnesty group, America's Voice, said Democratic Senators \nprivately reassured amnesty advocates that the border commission--one \nof the so-called triggers--would not be constructed in a way that would \nhold up the amnesty process for too long. He said the Democrats cannot \n``allow the commission to have a real veto'' over setting in motion the \npath to citizenship. He also noted that the Democrats see the \ncommission as ``something that gives the Republicans a talking \npoint''--a talking point--to claim they are prioritizing tough \nenforcement, giving themselves cover to back a process that ``won't \nstop people from getting citizenship.''\n  In other words, the gang apparently seemed to be quite happy to allow \npeople to go out and make these promises. But to the people who are \nactively engaged for amnesty, they said: Do not worry about it. It is \nnot going to keep anybody from getting their full legality and \neventually citizenship.\n  This should be a concern because the American people are unhappy with \ntheir government. The American people have asked for a lawful system of \nimmigration for 30 years, and the Congress has refused to do so. They \nhave passed laws that they have said will work and never have had them \neffectively carried out, never effectively ending the illegality, and \nthe American people are unhappy about it.\n  I have suggested Mr. Sharry's statement is a good indication that the \npeople who are behind this bill--particularly the staff and special \ninterests and lawyers who have come together from all kinds of groups \nto help write the bill--do not care about enforcement in the future. \nAll they care about is what they want today. That is letting the cat \nout of the bag, and the American people need to be very nervous about \nit. They have every right to be because I will talk about the history \nof some of the things that have been happening, and it should make \nevery American concerned.\n  Shortly before the bill was introduced, the lead sponsor, Senator \nSchumer, frankly and openly--this is after the initial comments--openly \non ``Meet the Press'' said this:\n\n       First, people will be legalized. . . . Then we'll make sure \n     the border is secure.\n\n  It is undisputed that the bill will provide amnesty first without a \nsingle border security or enforcement measure ever having to be put in \nplace.\n  On Sunday, in an interview with Univision, Senator Rubio said:\n\n       First comes legalization, then comes this border security \n     measure and then comes the permanent residency process. What \n     we are talking about here is the permanent residency system. \n     Regarding legalization, a vast majority of my colleagues have \n     already accepted that: that it must take place and that it \n     must start at the same time we start with what has to do with \n     security. That is not conditional. Legalization is not \n     conditional.\n\n  What he is saying is that there is no condition in this bill--no \nrequirement\n\n[[Page S4040]]\n\nof any security to be achieved before the legalization occurs. The \nlegalization occurs without condition, and then it is just a mere \npromise in the future to effectuate a legal system that we have not \ndone for the last 30 years. Even the Wall Street Journal agrees with \nthat analysis.\n  Indeed, nothing at all needs to happen for those eligible for the \nDREAM Act and for agricultural workers amnesty to receive it. Their \nprocess, which covers roughly 4 million people is not connected in any \nway to any trigger or enforcement measure whatsoever.\n  The American people reject such a policy. That is not what they have \nasked for. That is what the June 7 Rasmussen poll said. The Rasmussen \nreport says this: The bill ``legalizes the status of immigrants first \nand promises to secure the border later. By a 4 to 1 margin, voters \nwant that order reversed.''\n  That is the polling data, and I think that is a good response from \nthe American people. They know the system has been manipulated before.\n  Madam President, I see our majority leader. I know he is a very busy \nman.\n  I say to Senator Reid, I have some time left before 5 o'clock, but if \nyou have something that needs to be done--\n  Mr. REID. At 4:30. The Senator can talk until 4:30. Go ahead and talk \nuntil 4:30.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. In a 2009 Department of Homeland Security report, \nprepared by the research arm for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices, it says this:\n\n       Virtually all immigration experts agree that it would be \n     counterproductive to offer an explicit or implied path to \n     permanent residence status (or citizenship) during any \n     legalization program. That would simply encourage fraud and \n     [encourage] illegal border crossings that other features of \n     the program seek to discourage. In fact, for that reason and \n     from that perspective, it would be best if the legislation \n     did not even address future permanent resident status or \n     citizenship.\n\n  This a government agency making a plainly commonsensical statement \nthat is virtually undeniable. A grant of amnesty is going to be \ncounterproductive, and it is the kind of thing that would incentivize \nactions that our policies are designed to discourage--illegal entry \ninto the United States.\n  Indeed, increased illegal entries into our country are happening \nright now. The numbers are going up. Just on hearing that there is an \namnesty plan afoot, immigration illegality is increasing.\n  According to the Border Patrol, so far in this year 90,000 people \nillegally crossing the border have been taken into custody. That is 50 \npercent more than the same time last year. And 55,000 of them--I would \nnote for those who are interested in this and recognize the \ninternational nature of it--55,000 of the 90,000 are not Mexican \nnationals.\n  During markup, Senator Grassley offered an amendment to require the \nSecretary to certify to Congress that she had maintained effective \ncontrol over the entire border for 6 months before amnesty begins, but \nit was rejected by a 12-to-6 vote.\n  We were told the bill would have the toughest enforcement measures in \nthe history of the United States, potentially in the world, and would \nfix the illegal immigration problem once and for all. Would that not be \ngreat? That is one of the Gang of 8 members on national TV, ``Meet the \nPress,'' recently. Would that not be good? I think that is something we \nshould strive for. But does the legislation do this?\n  I see the majority leader. He approved my time this afternoon. I have \nonly so much of it left. I am due to have the floor until 5. I see \nthere is important business to be done.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/10/senate-section/article/S4040-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WELCOMING SENATOR CHIESA\n\n  Mr. REID.

Senator Chiesa--I am sure we will struggle with that name \nfor a little while until we get used to it, but I think I have done it \njust about right--has served as attorney general for the State of New \nJersey.\n  As attorney general, he has done some very remarkable work. He has \nworked with law enforcement and the State legislature to combat human \ntrafficking, to protect children from predators, to crack down on gang \nviolence. He implemented a successful gun buyback program that took \n10,000 weapons off the streets, including 1,200 illegal guns.\n  I commend him for his efforts to keep New Jersey's streets safe, \nprotecting Americans from gun violence. As we all know, that was \nsomething that was very close to Senator Lautenberg's heart.\n  Prior to becoming attorney general, he served for 2 years as chief \ncounsel to New Jersey Governor Christie, after leading the Governor's \ntransition team. He spent 7 years in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the \nDistrict of New Jersey and more than 10 years in private practice. He \ngraduated from the University of Notre Dame, got his law degree from \nCatholic University in the District of Columbia and certainly because \nof that is familiar with the District of Columbia.\n  I am confident he will serve the people of New Jersey with honor.

Mr. President, I wish to join the distinguished \nmajority leader and the Republican leader in welcoming my new colleague \nfrom the great State of New Jersey, Jeff Chiesa, and his family to the \nSenate. I look forward to working with him closely on the issues of \nimportance to New Jersey and to the Nation.\n  We have heard some of his exemplary milestones in his career. He is a \ncareer attorney and someone who has served in public service. He \ncertainly has the Governor's confidence, as is evidenced by the time he \nspent with him at the U.S. Attorney's Office, then in the Governor's \ntransition, which he led, as well as being his chief counsel and the \nattorney general of the State of New Jersey, for which he has had some \nextraordinary opportunities to both protect\n\n[[Page S4041]]\n\nand promote the general welfare of the people of the State of New \nJersey.\n  Jeff's father was a chemical plant worker who died when Jeff was 8 \nyears old. So he and his two sisters were raised by his mother who was \na teacher. I am sure his family is very proud of him today as the \nfather of two children. They are extremely proud of him for all he has \ndone throughout his career and particularly today as he becomes the \nnewest Member of the Senate.\n  He was asked at the press conference with the Governor, when the \nGovernor announced him as his designee, what did he intend to \naccomplish in the Senate. For those of us who have served in the Senate \nfor a while, we know it takes a little while, and that is a tough \nquestion to ask someone, what they are going to be able to accomplish \nin 5 months.\n  But I think Senator Chiesa comes at a time in which we are having \nsome momentous debates in this Nation. Certainly, as it is ongoing on \nimmigration reform, he will have an opportunity to cast some critical \nvotes in that regard. I look forward to talking with him about some of \nthose issues as well as other critical issues that will come before the \ncountry over the next 5 months.\n  I look forward to working with him on behalf of the people of the \nState of New Jersey and our Nation. I am sure, even though it is only 5 \nmonths, he is going to make a significant mark in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. HIRONO.)

Madam President, I am delighted to see the \nadministering of the oath to our new Senator. As a former Federal \nprosecutor, I know he understands much of the Federal law we deal with \naround here. Having been one of those myself, I welcome him and believe \nthere will be many gifts and experiences he has had from that role that \nwill help him serve in the Senate, writing laws that will actually be \nthe laws enforced by his former fellow prosecutors around the country.\n  A closer examination of the legislation before us, this is it here, \nover 1,000 pages now. But you have to study it because it makes all \nsorts of references to ``except as provided by'' in this section and \nthat section and subsection E(2)(I)(1)(3) and things like that. It is \nhard to read. But a close examination reveals that the promised \nenforcement of immigration law in the future that is so critical, and \nthe American people deserve, the American people have asked for, for \ndecades, is not there.\n  The triggers are not triggers at all. In fact, it would actually \nweaken even current law, granting the Secretary of Homeland Security, \nnow Secretary Napolitano in particular, unprecedented power to \ndetermine how and when the border is secured, if ever. Remember, at \nthis moment, the Secretary of Homeland Security is being sued by \nFederal law officers, ICE officers, Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nofficers, of her own department because they say she is issuing \ndirectives to them to keep them from complying with plain Federal law.\n  In other words, she is directing them not to comply with Federal law. \nThe Federal judge has taken the case and allowed it to go forward and \nis taking testimony on it. But the bill that illegal immigrants can \nreceive amnesty, not when the border is secured but when Secretary \nNapolitano tells Congress she is starting to try to secure the border. \nWithin 6 months of enactment of the legislation, Secretary Napolitano \nneed only submit to Congress her views on a comprehensive southern \nborder strategy and a southern border fencing strategy and give notice \nthat she has begun implementing whatever plans she decides to \nimplement. At that point, she may begin processing applications and \ngranting amnesty. Indeed, she will be doing that without any border \nsecurity or enforcement measures ever being required to be in place.\n  The reality is, once amnesty has been granted, it is never going to \nbe revoked. Under this scheme, enforcement is unlikely ever to occur. \nThat is just like 1986, which Senator Grassley earlier today, ranking \nmember on the Judiciary Committee from Iowa, who was here in 1986, says \nwas a great failure at that time. He voted for the bill. He says it was \na mistake. It was a mistake because we did not put in mechanisms to \nensure that in the future the enforcement would actually occur.\n  That is why he opposes this bill. Frank Sharry, the head of America's \nVoice, a pro-amnesty advocate, recently said about these triggers, \n``The triggers are based on developing plans and spending money, not on \nreaching that effectiveness''--\n  In other words, not reaching an effective system of security in the \nfuture--it is not tied to that. Then he goes on to say, ``which is \nreally quite clever.'' Really clever, is it not, to see if they can \nfool the American people. They have written something that looks like a \nreal trigger, that has teeth in it, that says you do not get your \namnesty and legal status until enforcement occurs. But when we read the \nbill it is not there. Mr. Sharry actually lays it out.\n  In fact, in 2007, Senator Isakson first came up with an idea of a \ntrigger mechanism. That gained popularity. I think he was the one who \nwrote the language that was in that bill. It is much stronger than this \none. It was much stronger than what is in the bill today. Actually, it \nhad the potential to work.\n  Remember, this was what was said when the bill was rolled out. \nBasically, they said the American people, we got a good bill. You can \ntrust us. The enforcement will occur because we have triggers in the \nbill to guarantee it is enforced. That is not so, is it? Colleagues, \ndoes that not make you uneasy? Should it not make the American people \nuneasy, when they have seen Congress time and time again avoid going \nforward with real law enforcement?\n  The bill states that the southern border strategy should detail a \nplan for achieving and maintaining ``effective control'' of the \nsouthern border. Effective control is defined as ``persistent \nsurveillance,'' which itself is not defined, plus ``an effectiveness \nrate of 90 percent or higher.'' What effectiveness rate? This is \ncalculated by dividing the number of apprehensions and turnbacks in a \nsector during a fiscal year by the total number of illegal entries in \nthe sector during that fiscal year.\n  But this does not account for those who escape detection by the \nBorder Patrol. During her testimony before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Secretary Napolitano all but acknowledged the effectiveness \nrate is meaningless because, by definition, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity has no idea how many people avoid detection.\n  How can you have that formula? The measure is subject to almost \nlimitless manipulation.\n  One thing we all should remember, having been involved in this for a \nnumber of years now, the border should already be secure. It should \nalready be secure. The Secure Fence Act of 2006, passed by both Houses \nof Congress, already requires, right now, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to maintain 100-percent operational control of all land and \nmaritime borders and required the Homeland Security to do so within 18 \nmonths of the bill having been passed in 2006. That mandate has been \nignored, not complied with, and the border is certainly far from 100-\npercent operational control.\n  We are going to pass a new bill that is even weaker than this and \nexpect it is going to result in some major improvement in law \nenforcement?\n  By contrast, the rejected 2007 immigration bill set a stronger target \nof 100-percent operational control of the entire border, which had to \nbe met before illegal immigrants could be given the probationary legal \nstatus.\n  The current bill is essentially the same as the failed 1986 bill. It \nis legality immediately and a promise of enforcement in the future.\n  It is important to know that nothing in the bill prevents Secretary \nNapolitano from submitting a strategy--that\n\n[[Page S4042]]\n\nis all she has to submit, is a strategy--that simply reiterates her \npublicly stated views about the border. She says first that the border \nis ``more secure than it has ever been.''\n  While the bill states that Homeland Security shall start ``the \nimplementation'' of the plan ``immediately after'' submission and give \nnotice to Congress of its commencement and provide reports on its \nprogress, nothing in the bill actually requires the Secretary to \nimplement anything. It just doesn't. It is not there. All she has to do \nis start the amnesty process, what she intends to do, and then to \nsubmit reports in the future.\n  We have heard there will be more fencing. You have heard that talk. \nThe bill is going to make sure we have more fencing. But no language in \nthe bill requires the Secretary to construct any fencing at all. \nRather, the bill states the Secretary shall submit to Congress, within \n6 months of enactment, her views on a fencing ``plan'' to identify \nwhere fencing, if any, including double-layer fencing, infrastructure \ntechnology, including ports of entry, should be deployed along the \nborder.\n  The problem is Secretary Napolitano, who will be responsible for \nimplementing these provisions, has said multiple times that no further \nfencing is necessary. She recently testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee that Homeland Security would prefer to rely on drones and \nhigh-tech surveillance:\n\n       We would prefer money . . . if we have our druthers, we \n     would not so designate a fence fund.\n\n  Does it make more sense to use technology to observe people entering \nthe country illegally, or does it make more sense to stop them from \nentering?\n  After the Secure Fence Act was passed in 2006 requiring 700 miles of \ndouble-layer fencing, they said, well, we are not going to build \ndouble-layer 700 miles of fencing. We have a better idea. We are going \nto have a virtual fence. We are going to use technology, balloons, and \nthings of that nature. We have this sophisticated plan. They spent $1 \nbillion on that plan--totally abandoned; an utter failure.\n  That is what is upsetting the American people in this country. \nPromises are made. We are going to build a fence. We all vote for a \nfence. Then, oh, no, we are not going to vote for a fence, we have a \nbetter idea. Then we spend $1 billion and get zero for it.\n  This is not necessary. We can make great improvements at the border \nif we have the will to do so. The will and the determination is what is \nlacking.\n  Proponents of this bill have repeatedly said ``this legislation \ncontains the toughest border immigration enforcement measures in U.S. \nhistory.'' If that is the case, then why is the bill weaker than \ncurrent law? Why is it weaker than in 2007, the bill that was offered \nand rejected? Congress overwhelmingly passed the mandate to build a \nfence in 2006--and I was engaged in that debate--by 80 to 19 votes, \nwith the support of then-Senators Biden and Obama. Vice President Biden \nand President Obama voted for it. It hasn't come close to having been \nbuilt.\n  I think we have 36 miles of fencing having been completed, when the \nbill called for 700. If we had done that, we would be in a lot better \nplace to ask the American people today, let's be compassionate and see \nif we can't do something kind to people who have entered our country \nillegally.\n  According to a Rasmussen's poll in April of this year, a substantial \nmajority of Americans want the fence built, but Congress has failed to \ndo so. The bill would authorize $8.3 billion in additional funding to \ncarry out all of its provisions.\n  You notice, it has some fencing language in it, $1.5 billion, but \nwhat is the $1.5 billion for? Is it to build a fence? You can build a \nlot of fence with that much money. No. It is for the developing of a \nfencing strategy, and the other things that money would be spent for \ntoo.\n  In fact, a fence does save money. Since the fence is a force \nmultiplier, fewer Border Patrol agents will be needed. They can cover \nmore miles, and it reduces costs. It makes a clear statement to the \nworld that the United States is serious: Our borders are no longer \nopen. Don't come here illegally. If you do, we are going to apprehend \nyou, and you will be disciplined in some fashion and deported. If we do \nthat, we will see a dramatic reduction in the number of people coming \nto our country illegally.\n  During our Judiciary Committee markup on this legislation, an \namendment sponsored by Senator Leahy was adopted that says nothing in \nthis provision ``shall require the Secretary to install fencing'' if \nthe Secretary in her discretion determines that fencing is not \nnecessary. Of course, she says she doesn't favor more fencing.\n  In addition, the amendment requires that the Secretary consult with \nthe Secretaries of Interior, Agriculture, States, local governments, \nIndian tribes, and property owners, before she could ever build a \nfence, and to minimize the impact on the environment, culture, \ncommerce, and quality of life for residents.\n  Well, you always try to do those things. All of this is an indication \nthat with regard to the question of barriers and fencing to enhance the \nlawfulness at our border, this bill doesn't do it. Actually, this bill \nis hostile to it. Can you see that language in there? This was \ndiscussed at Judiciary. It passed in the committee.\n  Only 36.3 miles of fencing out of the 700 has ever been completed. \nHad the rest of it been completed, we would be in a lot better shape \ntoday.\n  We were told:\n\n       If, in 5 years, the [Secretary's border security] plan has \n     not reached 100 percent awareness and 90 percent \n     apprehension, the Department of Homeland Security will \n     lose control of the issue and it will be turned over to \n     the board of governors to finish the job.\n\n  That was Senator Rubio on the ``Mark Levin Show.'' This commission \nthey talk about at the border, the mere existence is left to the sole \ndiscretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security only if she determined \nthat Homeland Security, her own department, ``has not achieved \neffective control'' of the border 5 years after enactment.\n  Wait 5 years, and if she hasn't done the job--she has certified she \nhasn't done the job, and after the legalization has already been \ngranted--it is then entirely up to the Secretary to determine whether \nher plans are ``substantially completed'' and ``substantially \nimplemented''--then and only then would the Southern Border Security \nCommission be formed.\n  The bill's proponents claim the commission would be ``a powerful and \nimportant policy-making body,'' and that the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity will be compelled to implement the commission's \nrecommendations. That was one of the Gang of 8's news releases.\n  Not so. The commission is empowered only to make recommendations to \nthe President, the Secretary, and Congress, which are then to be \nreviewed by the Comptroller General. Nothing in the bill requires any \nother commission's recommendations to be implemented. They don't have \nany power. Once it makes its recommendations, the commission dissolves \nin 30 days, kaput.\n  As Byron York noted in the Washington Examiner in his column today:\n\n       There is nothing in the bill requiring the commission to \n     finish the job of border security, and indeed it would have \n     no authority to do so.\n\n  Indeed, it would have no authority to do anything, really, except \nissue a report.\n  The second issue that deals with illegality in our country is the \nvisa question. We were told the path to citizenship in the bill would \nbe ``contingent upon . . . tracking whether legal immigrants have left \nthe country when required.'' That has a plain meaning, have they left \nwhen required.\n  Under current law, we have a mechanism where people are fingerprinted \nand they are identified when they come into the country. There is no \nclocking out when they leave the country.\n  What does the bill do? Does it fix that problem? Let's look at the \nhistory of it. The bill rolls back the requirements in current law, \nlaws that were passed on six different occasions by Congress since 1996 \nfor a biometric exit system. We have a biometric entry system at some \npoints, but not an exit system. Yet instead of forcing the \nadministration's hand, making this happen, this bill gives in to the \nexecutive branch's obstinacy over at least two administrations and \nprovides for only an ``electronic,'' not biometric, exit system, and \nonly at air and seaports, not land ports.\n\n[[Page S4043]]\n\n  It is estimated that nearly 40 percent of the illegal population here \ntoday are visa overstays. GAO, our Government Accountability Office, \nhas repeatedly said a system such as the one called for in this bill \nwill not reliably identify visa overstays, and that without a biometric \nexit system:\n\n       DHS cannot ensure the integrity of the immigration system \n     by identifying and removing those people who have overstayed \n     the original period of admission.\n\n  That is the Government Accountability Office's objective, nonpartisan \nanalysis of the legislation.\n  Beyond violating our laws, visa overstays pose a substantial threat \nto national security. Visa overstayers come from all over the world. \nThe 9/11 Commission, after the 9/11 attacks, recommended that:\n\n       The Department of Homeland Security, properly supported by \n     Congress, should complete, as quickly as possible, a \n     biometric entry-exit system.\n\n  In a report entitled ``Tenth Anniversary Report Card: The Status of \nthe\n9/11 Commission Recommendations,'' they came back together to see how \nwell their recommendations had been carried out. They praised the fact \nthat we have an entry system, a biometric entry system known as US-\nVISIT. It has been proven to be valuable, they say, in national \nsecurity too.\n  Despite this successful deployment of the entry component of US-\nVISIT, the Commission notes there is still no comprehensive exit system \nin place. As important as it is to note when foreign nationals arrive, \nit is also important to note when they leave. Full deployment of the \nbiometric exit component of US-VISIT should be a high priority. Such a \ncapability would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence \nofficials in August and September of 2001 in conducting a search for \ntwo of the 9/11 hijackers who were in the United States on expired \nvisas.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 954, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 954) to reauthorize agriculture programs through \n     2018.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Stabenow (for Leahy) amendment No. 998, to establish a \n     pilot program for gigabit Internet projects in rural areas.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 \np.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I see the distinguished Senator from North Dakota on \nthe floor. This is Senator Heitkamp's first farm bill we are about \nready to vote on. She has been an extraordinary voice and really hit \nthe ground running. It is my pleasure to yield 5 minutes to her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, I would first like to thank the \nSenator from the great State of Michigan for her incredible leadership. \nI met her over a year ago and knew she was a force to be reckoned with, \nnot only because she has red hair but because she is someone who \nunderstands that to move something forward, we need to have compromise \nand we need to understand that a farm bill represents the interests of \nthe entire country, not just the interests of maybe the Great Plains \nStates or the Southern States or even our urban areas that care \ndesperately about nutrition. She understands that we need to forge a \nbill that can pass both Chambers and keep our country moving.\n  The fact is that agriculture is a shining star in the American \neconomy today. When we look at States such as North Dakota and Nebraska \nand Kansas and South Dakota, all agriculture-based States, we see they \ndid not have the deep trough of this recession because agriculture did \npretty well. And why did agriculture do pretty well? Because the last \nfarm bill that was crafted provided an appropriate balance of concern \nfor our long-term fiscal obligations along with providing our producers \nwith a legitimate and appropriate safety net.\n  We have a farm bill today that is even better that we are going to be \nvoting on. Why is it better? Because it not only provides that \ncertainty and that safety net for American producers--the backbone, \nhistorically, of our economy--but it reduces the deficit $24 billion by \neliminating a process of direct payments, by cutting some unnecessary \nexpenditures, by streamlining conservation, and by taking a look at a \nrational and reasonable approach to some of the issues regarding \nnutrition.\n  So I am very proud today to stand before this body about to cast one \nof my first votes--not the first vote but one of my first votes--doing \nwhat is absolutely essential for the North Dakota economy; that is, \npassing a farm bill.\n  I want to give an idea of what North Dakota is all about because we \nlike to brag but also because people forget about North Dakota being an \nagricultural State with so much attention having been focused in recent \nmonths and recent years on our dramatic energy development. So let me \ngive a rundown on what we do in North Dakota as far as our production. \nWe are No. 1 in barley; No. 1 in beans, dry and edible; No. 1 in navy \nbeans and pinto beans; No. 1 in canola, flaxseed, and honey; No. 1 in \nlentils and dry edible peas; No. 1 in all forms of sunflower; No. 1 in \ndurum wheat and spring wheat; and we are No. 2 in sugar beets and No. 2 \nin all wheat. So 90 percent of North Dakota's land base--90 percent--is \nengaged in agriculture. It is the backbone of what we do.\n  As we talk about the importance of public policy not only to protect \nour producers but to give them opportunities for certainty, I would \nlike to talk about two unique things of which I am exceptionally proud.\n  The first is that this Crop Insurance Program will provide the safety \nnet so many of our young farmers in our States need to get engaged in \nthe business of farming. Why is that important? Well, 10 years ago when \nI was still in elected office, I would go to farm meetings and look \naround the table, and everybody was in their fifties and sixties and a \n50-year-old farmer would be a young farmer. Now we go to those same \nmeetings, and sitting around that table are 20- and 30- and 40-year-old \nfarm families saying: We want to engage in the business of agriculture. \nAnd that is good for the world because we not only need to produce our \nproducts for America, we need to produce our products for the entire \nworld.\n  So this is a farm bill that strikes the right balance. It is a farm \nbill that addresses the priorities not only of my State but hopefully \nthe priorities of this country. There are 16 million jobs--16 million \nAmerican jobs--depending on this bill.\n  The second point I wish to make about this bill--and people remind me \noccasionally that it is a year late because we have already gone to one \nextension since I have been here--is that it is a bill which will send \na message to the American people that we need to provide certainty once \nand for all. We need to do things in a timely fashion, and I think \nmoving this farm bill right now is moving it in a timely fashion.\n  This is an excellent piece of legislation, and I urge all of my \ncolleagues to vote for it.\n  I thank the chairwoman from Michigan for her excellent and \nexceptional leadership, along with her ranking member Senator Cochran, \nwho has been so instrumental in forging the compromises that make today \npossible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, at this point I want to take a moment \nbefore we vote today to recognize folks who have worked so hard to get \nus to this point.\n  First of all, I thank my colleagues in advance for coming together \none more time and leading for rural America--for farmers, for ranchers, \nfor the 16 million people who have jobs because of agriculture in this \ncountry. It has been a long road for the Agriculture Reform, Food, and \nJobs Act, and I have been blessed and pleased to have a wonderful \npartner and ranking member,\n\n[[Page S4044]]\n\nthe distinguished Senator from Mississippi. He has been a partner every \nstep of the way, and I thank him and look forward--as the House \nhopefully this time will complete their work--to having the opportunity \nto go to conference and crafting an agreement we can then present back \nto the Senate. I can't thank Senator Cochran and his staff enough for \ntheir wonderful partnership.\n  We started this last year. We had 3 weeks that the farm bill was on \nthe floor of the Senate. We had 73 votes, adopted 42 amendments, and we \ntook that as the basis for the bill this year. Once the House did not \ntake up the bill--and, in my judgment, walked away from rural America \nlast year--we had to come back and do it again, so we used the work \nproduct the Senate did last year as the basis of our work, and we had 2 \nweeks of debate on the floor of the Senate. We have added 14 more \namendments to the bill that is in front of us.\n  So I thank the majority leader for his hard work and leadership and \npatience. As always, he knows how important agriculture is to our \neconomy, how important it is to support rural communities and families \nand consumers around our country. I appreciate that he has not just \nonce but twice given us precious time on the Senate floor so that we \ncould do our job in standing up for rural America and for consumers \nacross this country.\n  I am proud we once again voted--or are about to vote today--in a \nbipartisan way to move this bill forward. This bill has been bipartisan \nfrom start to finish, and I believe that is the reason for our success. \nI am grateful to colleagues who have worked in such a diligent way on \nboth sides of the aisle. There are many leaders on both sides of the \naisle on this bill. We wouldn't be here today without leadership on \nboth sides of the aisle, and I am very grateful for that. This is how \nthe Senate is designed to work, where people who care very deeply on \nboth sides of an issue can sit down--in our case, around a table in the \nSenate agriculture room--look each other in the eye, talk to each \nother, listen, and make the compromises necessary to come together with \na balanced bill. That is what we did.\n  Last year we passed the farm bill, as I said before, in a bipartisan \nway as well. The House Agriculture Committee passed a bipartisan farm \nbill last year, but for whatever reason the full House didn't consider \nthe bill. It was allowed to expire. The good news is that this year it \nlooks as though it is going to be different. That is good news for \nrural America and the men and women who work hard every day to give us \nthe safest, most affordable, most abundant food supply in the world--in \nthe world.\n  I thank my incredible staff, who have done this now not once but \ntwice. Actually, because we engaged and had a work product when the \nsupercommittee deficit commission was operating, we have actually done \nthis three times. I think they could do farm bills in their sleep. \nHopefully they have not been sleeping when they have been writing this \none, but I am very grateful for their leadership.\n  I thank Chris Adamo, my terrific staff director for the Agriculture \nCommittee, who is living and breathing these issues every minute and \nonly takes occasional breaks to go fly fishing in Michigan. We have a \nhistoric agreement on conservation and crop insurance in this bill \nthanks to his leadership and that of our team.\n  Jonathan Coppess, our chief counsel, and Joe Shultz, our economist \nextraordinaire, who understand the ins and outs of agriculture like \nnobody else, have done so much as we have transitioned in this bill \ntoward market-based risk management tools for our farmers.\n  Jonathan Cordone, our general counsel, crossed every ``t'' and dotted \nevery ``i'' in this bill, and frankly, there are a lot of them. He has \nbeen keeping track of all the amendments and making sure this process \nruns smoothly.\n  Karla Theiman, who leads our livestock and dairy issues, has helped \nmake the energy title something we could really be proud of. I am very \ngrateful for all her leadership and hard work.\n  Tina May, who wrote our original conservation title and then decided \nto go have a baby, is amazing. She knows more about conservation than \nanyone I know, and we are very proud that not only the conservation \ntitle in the Senate but one that is very similar in the House bears the \nmark of her hard work and leadership.\n  I do want to note that Jonathan Coppess had a son during the last \nfarm bill and Tina had a son during this farm bill. So I am not sure \nwhat it is about farm bills, but we will see what comes next.\n  One thing about Tina's maternity leave is that it allowed us to get \nthe T2 team back together. Kevin Norton came back from the USDA to work \nwith Catie Lee, as they picked up very excellently the heavy load and \nmade it look easy. Thanks to them, our country will have healthy \nwildlife habitats and clean, fishable waters for generations to come.\n  Jacqlyn Schneider, who is another of our farm bill veterans, ably led \nour nutrition team and has done such a wonderful job. She has done so \nmuch for the diversity of American agriculture through organics, fruits \nand vegetables, and all the things we call specialty crops, as well as \nJess Taylor. Jess has done terrific work in partnership as well.\n  Brandon McBride led our efforts to reorganize the rural development \ntitle and worked so hard this year to make sure the energy title \ncontinued to grow the economy in rural America.\n  Russ Behnam is our expert on technology issues--biotechnology \nissues--on crop protection and has lent very important expertise to our \nefforts. I am grateful.\n  Cory Claussen led our efforts on dairy last year, and his hard work \nled to the major advances we have made in this bill for beginning \nfarmers and ranchers as well as for our veterans who want to get into \nagriculture.\n  I am very proud that in our bill we have a new agriculture liaison \nfor our veterans. So many of our men and women coming home are from \nsmall communities around America, and they want to have the opportunity \nto go into farming, and we want to help them do that.\n  Cory is also leading our CFTC efforts, so Cory's work is just getting \nstarted. Hanna Abou-El-Seoud, who kept the trains running on time, made \nsure we were all prepared and prepped--no easy job as well. Alexis \nStanczuk and Kyle Varner, who is the newest member of our team, have \nonce again done a great job doing whatever needed to be done in order \nto help us be successful. Jessie Williams, Nicole Hertenstein, Jacob \nChaney, and our entire great team on the committee have helped us to \nget to this point.\n  I also wish to say thank you to my chief of staff Dan Farough, who \nmanages our personal office; Matt VanKuiken, my terrific legislative \ndirector who followed the floor procedure and made sure everything was \nhappening as it should; Bill Sweeney, my great deputy chief of staff; \nCullen Schwarz, my communications director; and Ben Becker, our press \nsecretary who made sure we were telling the story of rural America and \nthis farm bill and the reforms in it every day. We couldn't have done \nit without them and our entire team, Matt Williams, Will Eberle, and \nAlex Barriger.\n  I wish to thank my State team and all of the outreach efforts led by \nthe outstanding Teresa Plachetka, Kali Fox, Mary Judnich, Brandon \nFewins, and Korey Hall, making sure that Michigan is truly represented \non every page.\n  This was a bipartisan effort, and I wish to thank everyone on Senator \nCochran's team, especially T.A. Hawks and James Gleueck, for their \nleadership. Once again, Doug Elmendorf's CBO farm team came through \nthanks to Jim Langley and everyone on their team.\n  I wish to thank Kasey Gillette from Senator Reid's office, who is \npart of our extended family. It is great working with her again. This \nis like a second annual family reunion, always having Kasey with us.\n  Nothing could get done around here without our excellent floor staff \nwho have been led by Gary Myrick and Tim Mitchell, and thank you to \neverybody on our team for their very long hours as usual.\n  Of course, we wouldn't have had anything to pass without the amazing \nexpertise of our legislative counsel team, Michelle Johnson-Wieder and \nGary Endicott, and their invaluable assistance;\n\n[[Page S4045]]\n\nlast, but not least, the great team at the USDA and who I believe is an \nabsolutely terrific Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack, and his \nGeneral Counsel's Office.\n  There are so many people to thank. I will stop. There are other \ncolleagues who wish to speak. I just want everyone to know that when \nyou take basically 12 different chapters or titles--any one of which \ncould be its own piece of legislation--and put it together in something \ncalled a 5-year farm bill, it happens because of a tremendous amount of \ntalent and experience and hard work and it happens because, in our \ncase, we have what I believe is the most seasoned Agriculture Committee \nformer chairs, former Secretary of Agriculture. We have people who know \nagriculture and care about it deeply. With so much talent and \nexperience, it has been a real privilege--and continues to be--to chair \nthis committee.\n  This farm bill is the product of 2 years of hard work by a long list \nof talented people. As we vote today, we support 16 million people who \ndepend on agriculture for their jobs. We are providing $24 billion in \ndeficit reduction on a bipartisan basis. We are providing policies that \nwill conserve our land and our water resources for generations to come; \nthat help families who have fallen on hard times keep food on the table \nfor their children; a bill that helps our veterans get started in \nagriculture; that supports our small towns all across America; and \nrecognizes the diversity of American agriculture and strengthens \nefforts to give families the opportunity to buy fresh local food in \ntheir supermarkets and have it available in their schools. This farm \nbill creates jobs.\n  I am very proud of the work we have done, and I ask all of our \ncolleagues to support us in voting yes today on this bill.\n  I yield 5 minutes to Senator Klobuchar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I rise in support of this very \nimportant bill.\n  First, I wish to thank Senator Stabenow for her leadership, as well \nas the Senator from Mississippi. It was a true bipartisan effort. As I \nheard her list all the names of these wonderful staff people who worked \non this bill, I also wish to mention my staff director Adam Durand.\n  The other thing I wish to mention is this wouldn't have happened \nwithout Senator Stabenow, with her ever optimistic view, never giving \nup on this bill.\n  It has been 354 days since the Senate passed its last farm bill--I \nhave been counting it down--and this is long overdue. This got done in \nrecord speed because we had gone through all of these issues, 70-\nsomething amendments, last time, and this time we were able to get the \nfarm bill through the Agriculture Committee in record time--in 3 hours. \nNow it is on the floor, and I predict we will have strong bipartisan \nsupport.\n  You ask why. First of all, last year our country experienced the \nworst drought since 1956, costing the country tens of billions of \ndollars. In Minnesota 74 counties were eligible for disaster relief due \nto drought.\n  This year the late spring and wet conditions have prevented many \nfarmers in my State from even getting their crop into the ground. Dairy \nfarmers have been especially hurt because of the alfalfa shortage \nbecause of the rot because of the water.\n  We can't do anything about the weather, but we can make sure our \ncountry has a steady food supply and that we are not dependent on \nforeign food. How do we do that? By having a smart, fiscally sound farm \nbill.\n  I can tell you what we have is a bill that literally saves the \ntaxpayers $24 billion in 10 years over the last farm bill. That is why \nit makes no sense for me to play a game of green light-red light and at \nthe end of the year we are going to extend the last farm bill that is \neven more expensive, when we have a very smart farm bill here.\n  It matters in my State. My State is No. 1 in turkeys, sweet corn, \ngreen peas, and oats, No. 2 in spring wheat, No. 3 in hogs and \nsoybeans, and No. 4 four in corn. But it is more than the crops and the \nsugar beets and the wheat. We don't just raise livestock. We don't just \nproduce crops. We also produce the foods--milk at Land O'Lakes, the \nturkey at Jennie-O, the animal feed at Cargill, the Spam at Hormel.\n  When we look at this farm bill, we have to understand it involves not \njust our farmers--in fact, that is the smaller percentage of the farm \nbill than, say, the nutrition program--but it also involves our entire \neconomy and how that all goes together from energy on down. What I like \nabout this farm bill is it does connect these dots and makes sure we \nhave a strong economy across the board, starting with our farmers, also \nincluding strong conservation efforts.\n  I see the Senator from North Dakota Ms. Heitkamp. She and I, along \nwith Senator Hoeven, worked very hard to make sure there were strong \nprovisions in this bill for the conservation efforts, which include our \nretention of water with floodings in the Fargo-Moorhead area, also \nmaking sure we had strong efforts for agriculture research, something \neveryone in our country cares about as we move forward.\n  We streamlined the conservation program from 23 to 13 programs. The \nbill funds the energy title programs, which this last extension did not \ndo, and it also does a lot with ag research. I also had some of my \namendments included which help beginning farmers and ranchers; that \nincludes reducing the cost of crop insurance for beginning farmers by \n10 percent. The second amendment helps beginning farmers access land \nfor grazing.\n  These are just a few of the things in this bill. We are excited about \nthis bill.\n  I would just end by saying, as Senator Stabenow did, that this is a \ncall for action. The Senate has gotten its act together. We were able \nto work out a bipartisan compromise in the committee. We are able to \nget a strong vote on the floor. Now it is time for Speaker Boehner to \ncall up the House bill so then we can work out the differences--as we \nshould--in regular order, in conference committee.\n  Our farmers deserve nothing less, the kids who depend on these school \nnutrition programs deserve nothing less, and the conservation efforts \nin our country, those who hunt, those who fish, those who enjoy the \noutdoors, deserve nothing less.\n  It is time to get this bill done. We will vote on it tonight and then \nit goes over to the House. I would like to get this bill out of the \nHouse by the time we are ready to head into August, where we talk to a \nlot of our farmers and they have a few words to say every time we speak \nto them. I think the House would like to hear good things for a change.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan in urging approval of this bill by the Senate. It \nhas been a pleasure working with her and other members of the \nAgriculture Committee to produce a farm bill that meets the needs of \nthose involved in agriculture production and the consumers of the crops \nproduced by American farmers and ranchers.\n  This farm bil1 will also encourage and reward protection of water, \nsoil and forestry resources.\n  The bill also authorizes and improves Federal nutrition programs \nadministered by the Department of Agriculture. It contains reforms to \nthe nutrition title to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse.\n  This bill deserves the support of the Senate.\n  The Senate debate on the farm bill has included votes on a number of \namendments over the last 2 weeks. American agricultural producers \ndeserve the certainty that comes with a strong 5 year farm bill. I am \npleased that we have come up with a bill that will meet that need.\n  This legislation will provide farmers in all regions of the country \nwith a robust and workable safety net, while also reducing by $24 \nbillion the cost of the programs authorized by current law.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I yield time now to the Senator from \nFlorida for a colloquy with myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                                Greening\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I am grateful to the chairman of the \ncommittee to engage in a colloquy with me\n\n[[Page S4046]]\n\nabout a devastating disease of bacteria called greening, which is \ndevastating the citrus industry. We know of no cure. The bacteria kills \nthe citrus tree in 5 years, and we are not going to have a citrus crop \nor industry unless we can find a cure for this bacteria.\n  The bacteria is transported by an insect called a psyllid, and once \nthe psyllid bores its snout into the bark of the tree and the bacteria \nis injected into the foam or sap of the tree, it will kill the tree. \nThey found various methods of spraying to try to prolong the life of \nthe tree, but in essence the tree will die in about 5 years. It is in \nevery grove in Florida. It is now in the citrus industry in California \nand Arizona and they have found the psyllid likewise in other gulf \ncoast States--Alabama, Louisiana--and greening is also in the State of \nGeorgia.\n  So what we are trying to do is set up a trust fund, which is \nauthorized in the bill, and to get it funded in order to find a cure \nfor this disease so an industry that has become so important to the \nentire country can be saved.\n  I have talked at length with the chairman of the Finance Committee \nSenator Baucus, who has been very supportive. As a matter of fact, we \npassed a similar bill out of the Finance Committee in the last \nCongress. I plan to work with Senator Baucus and Senator Stabenow to \nmake sure this trust fund becomes a reality as we move forward with \nthis farm bill.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would just indicate to my colleague who has been such \na strong advocate for his State, for his growers, his people--I am very \ngrateful for that.\n  He has made his case very strongly. I understand that once a tree is \nexposed to the disease, there is no cure. The tree will die within 5 \nyears. It must be entirely replaced. In fact, as the Senator indicated, \nthis is something that affects many States--not only Florida but Texas, \nCalifornia, Louisiana, Alabama, Arizona, Georgia as well. So I know \nthis is a serious issue for our citrus growers, and I am committed to \nworking with Senator Baucus to make sure the trust funds for citrus, as \nwell as cotton and wool, are included in the final conference \ncommittee.\n  I know these are concerns shared by a number of our colleagues, and I \nlook forward to working with the Senator from Florida as well as other \ncolleagues. This is a very important issue.\n  Mr. NELSON. I thank Senator Stabenow for her commitment to helping \nfund a cure for citrus greening, and it is just that; it is an \nemergency situation.\n  Because of the devastating nature of this citrus greening disease, \nthe citrus research trust fund must have guaranteed funding in the farm \nbill. We simply can't wait any longer. Graciously, Senators Stabenow \nand Baucus have both been so encouraging and have agreed with me \npersonally to restore the funding mechanisms of the trust fund when the \nSenate and the House go to conference on the farm bill. When this farm \nbill makes its way to the President's desk, the citrus trust fund needs \nto be a fully functional and a funded component.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, let me just say in conclusion that I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to ensure there is a \nguaranteed source of funding for the citrus trust fund. I understand \nthe devastation to an entire industry that he is speaking about to and \nlook forward to working with him.\n  Mr. NELSON. I would just conclude by saying that I not only speak of \nthis for my State of Florida, of which citrus is one of its primary \nindustries and now the product of which is a staple on every American \nbreakfast table, but I speak also of our sister States, Arizona, \nCalifornia--and, by the way, to the Presiding Officer I can say that \nthe psyllid and the bacteria are in the State of Hawaii as well--\nGeorgia, Louisiana, and Alabama. I am very grateful for this \ncommitment.\n\n\n                     USDA Biobased Markets Program\n\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to talk with \nthe Chairman today to get clarity about the products that will be \nincluded in the USDA Biobased Markets Program. The Senator's hard work \nand vision on the issue of innovation in natural resources industries \nhas provided the essential leadership to support growth in this \ncritical economic sector.\n  I greatly appreciate the work that she and Senator Cochran did to \nexpand the program's application in this farm bill, including the \nexplicit definition of forest products and the expanded definition of \ninnovation as it applies to the program.\n  The Senator and I both represent States that have strong forest \nproducts industries in fact in Maine there are over 16,700 people who \nare employed by the forestry, logging, wood products, and pulp and \npaper industries. This industry also helps ensure that Maine's 233,000 \nfamily woodland owners have income to conserve and sustain their \nworking forests. Both of our States' forest-based economies have been \nhit hard by the downturn in the housing market as well as increased \npressure overseas so it is important that we do not further hinder them \nin any way.\n  I have learned recently of the USDA Biobased Markets Program and the \nfact that in some cases, this program favors foreign products and other \nbiobased products over forest products, which are some of the most \nbiobased products in existence.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Senator for raising this important issue. \nIn Michigan the same industries employ over 24,600 people and I agree \nthat these jobs are vital to the economy. I was pleased to be able to \nlay out a clearer path forward in this farm bill for the inclusion of \nforest products in USDA's Biobased Markets Program.\n  Mr. KING. I would like to clarify that it is not the Committee's or \nthe Senator's intent to exclude forest products from this program. And \nI would also like to clarify the meaning of the new provisions around \ninnovation in the program.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes, it is our intent to include forest products that \napply an innovative approach to growing, harvesting, sourcing, \nprocuring, processing, manufacturing, or application of biobased \nproducts. Products should be included regardless of the date of entry \nof the product into the marketplace.\n  Mr. KING. Let me give the Senator an example of a forest products \nmanufacturer in my home state that I believe is incredibly innovative \nin how they grow and source their materials for their products.\n  Verso Paper Company has 1600 employees at their two mills in \nBucksport and Jay. They make coated commercial printing papers that \nutilize manufacturing technologies that deliver increasingly improved \nprint quality through new coating formulations that incorporate newly \ndeveloped chemicals and materials. These products are some of the most \nbiobased products in the marketplace and should be eligible for the \nprogram.\n  In addition to these changes in their product, Verso has also in the \nlast few years, significantly increased innovation in the sourcing of \ntheir products, by increasing the amount of certified, sustainable \nfiber that feeds their mills.\n  An improvement in this year's bill is the addition of language that \nallows for innovation in the sourcing and application of biobased \nproducts. In regards to innovation in sourcing of biobased products \ndoes the Senator agree that innovations like forest certification \nsystems would qualify products for the program?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I appreciate the Senator mentioning Verso, since they \nalso have a mill in Quinnesec, MI and recently made a significant \ninvestment in upgrading its energy system. It is our intention that \nproducts that are sourced with innovative sourcing strategies like \nforest certification systems and products that have improved their \nmanufacturing are included in the program.\n  Mr. KING. I thank the Senator. And what about companies like Robbins \nLumber in Maine that produces solid wood products, like 2x4s or \nflooring? While the product may be the same product that has been on \nthe market for decades, the company producing it now generates all the \nheating for the mill and offices as well as the energy for drying \nlumber from their own biomass waste, as compared with using energy from \nthe grid. Further, they have worked with several organizations to \npermanently conserve thousands of acres of land for wildlife habitat \nand recreation.\n  Ms. STABENOW. That truly is what we are trying to inspire with this \ninnovation provision we are trying to help companies think outside the \nbox in\n\n[[Page S4047]]\n\nhow they can improve their processes. Their efforts in both energy \ngeneration from waste and land conservation are both excellent examples \nthat they are doing so.\n  Mr. KING. I thank the Senator. Again I truly appreciate the attention \nto this issue and look forward to working with you and USDA in the \nimplementation of this legislation to support the important forest \nproducts industry which has been an integral part of the economy of \nthis country for centuries.\n Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I would like to make a few \nremarks about the farm bill that's before the Senate this week.\n  As my colleagues know, this is our second attempt in 2 years to pass \na new 5-year farm bill. The Senate passed its version last Congress, \nwhich is essentially the same bill we are debating today. Last year, \nthe House refused to consider the Senate bill with good reason. This \nbill is loaded with costly farm subsidies and hidden pet-projects. I \nbelieve most Americans would be angered to know how we are wasting \ntheir hard-earned tax dollars.\n  Congress already plunged our Nation into $16 trillion worth of debt \npartially through farm bills like this. On average, Congress spends \nabout $1 trillion more annually than the Federal budget allows. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget office, the budget deficit for \nfiscal year 2014 will be about $624 billion. This bill alone--all one-\nthousand pages--will cost nearly $1 trillion. That's almost $1 billion \nper page. We must reduce the size of the Federal Government and the \nfarm bill is certainly ripe for cuts.\n  I will concede that my colleagues on the Senate Agriculture Committee \ndid make some effort to eliminate our more outdated farm subsidy \nprograms like the Direct Payments Program, which spends about $5 \nbillion a year to pay farmers of staple crops like corn whether or not \nthey grow anything. Direct payments have held on for decades until now. \nPerhaps that gives the American public a sense of the shelf-life of the \nnew farm subsidies we are debating today.\n  Unfortunately, the savings generated by eliminating direct payments \nare plugged back into the farm bill to finance new, more expensive \nsubsidies like those that are part of the Federal Crop Insurance \nProgram. While I agree that our farmers need some form of safety net, \nfarm bill crop insurance isn't ``insurance'' as most people know it. \nCrop insurance is just a roundabout way to influence the free market, \nsubsidize overproduction and ultimately fleece consumers. Taxpayers \nspend $14 billion a year subsidizing about 60 percent of insurance \npremiums for everything from oysters to almonds. Even non-food products \nlike tobacco get $33 million a year in crop insurance handouts. Worse \nyet, crop insurance isn't about protecting famers against crop losses \ndue to weather or infestation; it protects farmers against revenue \nloss. I am hard pressed to think of any other industry in America that \ncan take out an insurance policy at the taxpayer's expense to ensure \ntheir profits. This is clearly egregious when one realizes that \ncommodity prices are at record-highs.\n  This is all part of farm bill politics. In order to pass a farm bill, \nCongress must find a way to appease every special interest and every \ncommodity association. Here are some other examples of hand-outs that \nspecial interests win in this year's farm bill: $150 million to \nestablish a ``Citrus Research Trust Fund'' as well as a ``Wool Apparel \nManufacture Trust Fund''; $25 million to study the health benefits of \nlima beans and peas; $1.4 million to study commercial mushroom growing; \n$1.3 million to study the DNA sequencing of Christmas trees; $25 \nmillion to teach school children how to grow food in backyard gardens; \n$10 million for eliminating ``feral swine''; $200 million for the \nMarket Access Program, which subsidizes overseas advertising campaigns \nfor large corporations, like handing out samples of Tennessee whiskey \nin India or subsidizing a sampling tour of mint candies in the U.K.\n  This is how we pass behemoth farm bills the Capitol Hill-rule of \n``dispersed costs and concentrated benefits.''\n  Take for example the protectionist provision concerning catfish \ninspections that was added in conference to the 2008 Farm Bill. It \nforces USDA to create a special catfish inspection office that will \ncost taxpayers $15 million a year. GAO has said it is duplicative and \nwasteful of FDA seafood inspection services. But it helps prop up \ndomestic catfish farmers in southern States from having to compete with \nAsian catfish imports. I had an amendment to repeal this office but was \ndenied the courtesy of a vote despite it having 15 cosponsors and \noverwhelming support in the Senate. My statement on this matter is in \nthe Record of last week when I attempted to call up my amendment and \nmake it pending.\n  I also sought a vote on another amendment that I introduced with \nSenator Toomey concerning the repeal of something known as ``permanent \nfarm law.'' Because of permanent farm law, it's not an option for my \ncolleagues or I who want to put our feet down and say enough is enough \nto reckless farm bills. Permanent farm law is essentially old farm \nbills from 1938 and 1949 that are still on the books that automatically \nkick-in if we fail to renew the farm bill or pass a temporary \nextension.\n  Reverting to permanent farm law requires USDA to implement economic \nSoviet-style ``command and control'' policies that require farmers to \nachieve ``parity prices'' rooted in 1914 which bear no resemblance to \ntoday's market. Nobody wants permanent farm law because it would \nseverely disrupt planting decisions for farmers and, according to USDA, \nwill cost taxpayers up to $50 billion in subsidies and increase food \nprices by $20 billion. Yet these Depression-era farm bills work as a \n``deadman's switch'' to pressure Congress into passing modern farm \nbills. This almost happened last year when the Senate passed a farm \nbill and the House did not. Americans may remember we faced a ``dairy \ncliff'' in December when milk would double to $7 per gallon of milk. \nWithin one week of the pressure from national media coverage over the \n``dairy cliff,'' Congress rushed through a business-as-usual extension \nof the 2008 farm bill that was absent of any reform.\n  There's no reason to keep a 1938 farm law on the books except to \nforce Congress into passing farm bills by holding consumers hostage. My \namendment would have repealed this permanent farm law to prevent this \nbudgetary gamesmanship from repeating. But again, the Senate's farm \nbill managers refused to allow us a vote on this amendment as well.\n  At the end of the day, this farm bill will be hailed by its \nsupporters as reform-minded. But let me assure the American public, it \nis anything but. It was managed under a closed-amendment process and \nwill prove to be just as wasteful and costly as any farm bill we have \nseen to date.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this \nbill.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise today to speak on amendment No. \n1169, a bipartisan amendment that Senator Carper and I offered to the \nfarm bill to fix bureaucratic hurdles that impact farmers' access to \nseeds. Like so many of the amendments that were offered to this farm \nbill, our amendment unfortunately was not considered despite broad, \nbipartisan support and a strong need for the legislation.\n  Legislation is needed to ensure that American farmers continue to \nhave sufficient quantities of seeds each planting season. Every year, \nseed is produced in South America in the winter and is delivered just-\nin-time for spring planting in the United States. Due to the historic \ndrought in 2012, it is estimated that 20 percent of U.S. corn seed will \nbe brought in from South America for planting in 2013.\n  All seeds are regulated by the Department of Agriculture, USDA. All \nimported seed must be accompanied by the appropriate forms required by \nCustoms and Border Protection, CBP and USDA, allowing the U.S. \nGovernment to electronically track the shipments. In addition to \nproviding information on the seed and the U.S. destination, if seed is \nstill in a research and development phase, it is imported under a \nstrict permitting program administered by USDA's Animal and Plant \nHealth Inspection Service, APHIS. As part of its oversight role, USDA \nalso frequently samples and tests incoming seed shipments.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA requires a Notice of \nArrival,\n\n[[Page S4048]]\n\nNOA for all pesticides that enter the United States. Recently and \nwithout warning, EPA began requiring the same NOA form used for \nimported chemical pesticides on seed import shipments. These \nduplicative and unnecessary paperwork requirements imposed by EPA \nthreaten to disrupt vital seed shipments.\n  The NOA is designed for imports of commercial pesticides not seeds, \nand EPA procedures are antiquated. The form cannot be processed \nelectronically. It must be physically presented to and signed by EPA \nand then returned to the importer who then gives it to CBP so the \nshipment can enter. Some 2,000 to 3,000 shipments of counter-\nseasonally-produced commercial seed arrive 24 hours a day, 7 days a \nweek during the critical period from January to April, but EPA only \noperates during regular business hours. This volume can quickly \noverwhelm the NOA process. A delay of even a day can result in delayed \ndeliveries, delayed plantings, and reduced yield for farmers.\n  EPA has never issued any rule or guidance suggesting that seeds \ncontaining a pesticide require an NOA to enter the country. However, \nEPA officials have been enforcing this requirement for commercial seeds \ncontaining a pesticide. No seeds should be subjected to these \nadditional paperwork requirements.\n  Our amendment to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide \nAct, FIFRA would clarify the roles of EPA and USDA and ensure that \nunnecessary paperwork does not disrupt an adequate supply of seeds. \nThis language would clarify that the NOA required for the importation \nof conventional pesticides is not required for imports of treated seed. \nAll seeds would continue to be regulated by USDA under existing \nstatutes and would remain subject to all applicable USDA and CBP entry \nrequirements. EPA's authority to regulate the pesticides themselves \nwould not be affected.\n  This bipartisan legislation was adopted by voice vote as an amendment \nto the House Agriculture Committee farm bill and is supported by the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation, American Seed Trade Association, \nNational Farmers Union, Agricultural Retailers Association, National \nCorn Growers Association, and National Council of Farmer Cooperatives.\n  Senator Carper and I worked with Senator Boxer to make changes to our \namendment to address concerns about the scope of the amendment. We are \nhopeful that when the farm bill is considered in conference, our \namendment is adopted.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Senate \nfarm bill, S. 954, which would make significant reforms to federal \nagriculture programs and important investments in nutrition, \nconservation, and rural development. In addition to providing a safe \nand healthful food supply, America's farmers sustain our rural \ncommunities, protect the environment, and preserve the open space that \nis a vital part of our heritage.\n  This 5-year reauthorization bill demonstrates much-needed fiscal \nresponsibility by eliminating wasteful direct payments, which over the \nyears have provided financial benefits to hundreds of wealthy \nindividuals not involved in farming. Overall, the bill would cut \nspending by $24 billion, which is a step in the right direction.\n  The farm bill contains some significant help for family farms in \nMaine and throughout the country. It contains a provision I authored \nwith Senator Gillibrand that would reform the way the USDA sets dairy \nprices, reforms that are supported by Maine's dairy farmers. The \nprovision would require the USDA to begin the hearing process to \nrestructure the milk pricing system and would direct the Secretary of \nAgriculture to release the Department's recommendations to Congress.\n  S. 954 would maintain fruit and vegetable research programs, which \nare critical for Maine's potato and wild blueberry growers. In \naddition, the bill includes several local and organic food initiatives \nthat would benefit Maine's agriculture community.\n  The bill would also continue vital programs to address hunger and \nnutrition promotion while strengthening the integrity and \naccountability of federal nutrition programs. I was pleased to see the \nadoption of commonsense reforms and the rejection of an amendment that \nwould have made harmful changes to the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program safety net.\n  Given the significant budget pressures, the bill would appropriately \nimprove the effectiveness of conservation and rural energy initiatives. \nS. 954 demonstrates a continuing commitment to voluntary working lands \nprograms that help improve stewardship practices with technical \nassistance and cost-share programs for working agricultural and private \nforest lands, including in Maine.\n  There are, however, some disappointments. In an arbitrary decision by \nthe USDA, the fresh white potato is the only fresh vegetable or fruit \nto be specifically excluded from the Special Supplemental Nutrition \nProgram for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC. I filed an amendment \nthat would allow for the purchase of nutritious and affordable fresh \nwhite potatoes in WIC, which is cosponsored by a group of bipartisan \ncolleagues, including Senators Mark Udall, Risch, King, Crapo, Bennet, \nJohanns, Schumer, Cantwell, and Baldwin. The modification I proposed is \nstrongly endorsed by Maine's potato industry and supported by sound \nnutritional science, and I am disappointed I was denied a vote on it. I \nwill continue to press for this reform as the Senate and House \nnegotiate a final farm bill.\n  An amendment I cosponsored with Senator Leahy that would eliminate a \npayment limit for organic farmers under the Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program, also did not receive a vote. It is also regrettable \nthat the amendment to reform the sugar program by Senator Shaheen, \nwhich I cosponsored and which was endorsed by a broad coalition of \nconsumer, business, and environmental groups, failed to pass. According \nto CBO, these reforms would save $82 million over the next 10 years.\n  The leadership of the Senate Agriculture Committee deserves credit \nfor putting together a bipartisan farm bill during this time of \npartisanship. This bill is a welcome change from the previous \nreauthorization, which was loaded with wasteful spending and subsidies. \nI continue, however, to have concerns that the cost of this farm bill \nremains too high and that more should be done to reform agribusiness \nprograms to help address our skyrocketing deficit. This is an area I \nhope Congress will continue to work on moving forward.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, despite its name, farm bill policies \ntouch the lives of all Americans, not just those who work in the \nagricultural sector. In addition to reauthorizing farm programs, this \nlegislation deals with domestic and international food aid, \nconservation and the environment, trade, rural development, renewable \nenergy, forestry, and financial markets, among other issues. This \nyear's reauthorization presented an opportunity to enact significant \nreforms in these critical areas. While some progress was made, I \nbelieve the bill falls short of its potential and, ultimately, I cannot \nsupport it.\n  The farm bill took an important step toward reform by ending the \nlongstanding practice of giving direct payments to farmers of certain \ncommodity crops, regardless of whether a farmer experienced losses or \neven planted a crop. It also places caps on the amount of farm payments \nan individual can receive, expands crop insurance opportunities for \nspecialty and organic crops, establishes conservation compliance as a \nrequirement for receiving premium insurance subsidies, and invests in \nrural broadband.\n  In spite of these successes, however, the farm bill does not do \nenough for Rhode Island families.\n  Of greatest concern to me, it includes a $4.5 billion cut over 10 \nyears to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP also \nknown as food stamps. These cuts could lead to a reduction in food \nstamp benefits for an estimated 500,000 households across the country, \nincluding possibly 20,000 households in Rhode Island. SNAP is our \nNation's most important anti-hunger program. In this challenging \neconomic climate, which has affected low-income individuals more \nharshly than anyone, and from which Rhode Island is recovering very \nslowly, it is wrong to cut critical food-assistance funding.\n  I am also discouraged that this legislation provides no funds for \nfisheries\n\n[[Page S4049]]\n\ndisasters, including those declared in 2012. Like our farmers, \nfishermen feed this nation. Americans enjoyed an average of 15 pounds \nof fish and shellfish per person in 2011, making us second in total \nseafood consumption in the world. Accordingly, fishing is also a major \neconomic cornerstone of our coastal communities. In 2011, fisheries \nsupported over 1.2 million jobs in the United States.\n  Despite adhering to strict catch limits, many fishermen and historic \nfishing communities are suffering dramatic declines in stocks. In 2012, \nCommerce Secretary Bryson and Acting Secretary Blank issued fisheries \ndisaster declarations ranging from Alaska to Samoa, and from \nMississippi up to my home State of Rhode Island. Despite being included \nin the Senate version, emergency funding for many of these fisheries \nwas left out of final version of the Sandy disaster relief bill \nultimately signed into law.\n  Farm bill programs provide billions of dollars in subsidies and \ntechnical assistance to farmers every year. In comparison, fishermen \nhave little access to similar kinds of federal subsidies. Several \namendments have been filed that attempt to correct this inequity, \nincluding the creation of a pilot program for Farm Service Agency \noperating loans and crop insurance for shellfish growers. We are a long \nway, however, from adequately supporting and protecting the role of \nfisheries in our food supply chain. Fishermen remain second-class \ncitizens when it comes to federal support.\n  Finally, American agriculture springs from the richness of our land \nand natural resources, and the farm bill has long supported programs to \nconserve and protect those resources. As the harmful effects of climate \nchange become more prevalent, our agricultural policy should reflect \nthe threat posed to farming and food production by these changes. In \nthis farm bill, ``climate change'' and ``extreme weather'' are hardly \neven mentioned. Congress can start by opening the Regional Conservation \nPartnership Program to climate change adaptation and mitigation \nprojects.\n  The farm bill is important and wide-ranging legislation. \nUnfortunately, the bill before the Senate leaves out essential \nprotections for low-income Americans, hard-hit fisheries, and precious \nnatural resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today in opposition to \namendment No. 991, filed by my colleague, the junior Senator from South \nDakota.\n  This amendment would eliminate $2 billion from SNAP by limiting the \nfunds available for cost-effective nutrition education programs.\n  While I appreciate and share my colleague's deep commitment to \ndeficit reduction, this amendment would do so at the expense of those \nwho can least afford it.\n  It is a shortsighted amendment pennywise and pound foolish.\n  A $2 billion cut to this program would chip away at vital programs \nthat combat obesity, a growing epidemic that weighs on our health care \nsystem and our economy. Estimates of the medical cost of adult obesity \nin the United States range from $147 billion to nearly $210 billion per \nyear, according to the Trust for America's Health.\n  Cutting this program may save money in the short term, but it would \ncripple ongoing efforts to deliver innovative and effective nutrition \neducation to the most vulnerable populations in our country.\n  And these education programs are working, Madam President.\n  According to a study published in the Journal of Nutrition Education \nand Behavior, USDA's SNAP nutrition education programs contributed to a \n17 percent increase in the number of California adults who ate at least \nfive servings of fruits and vegetables each day.\n  The study showed that the greatest improvements in daily fruit and \nvegetable consumption were seen in populations with the greatest need.\n  There was a 91 percent increase among the poorest segment of the \npopulation, those with less than $15,000 in annual income, who consumed \nfive or more serving of fruits and vegetables per day; a 77 percent \nimprovement in the African American population, and a 43 percent \nimprovement in the Latino population.\n  The staggering cost of obesity will continue to increase until we \ntake significant action to improve our health and diet.\n  That's not to say that there's no room for reform; there certainly \nis.\n  That is why Congress passed the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act 3 years \nago, a bill that made significant reforms to SNAP nutrition education \nprograms.\n  Most notably, the law changed how the program is funded to make it \nmore equitable. The formula now reflects the actual number of SNAP \nbeneficiaries in each State.\n  Some would have us believe that the amendment, which mandates an \nacross-the-board $5 cap per recipient, is fiscally responsible. I don't \nthink that is the case. I believe this is simply an attempt to \nredistribute SNAP funding to States that have shown no interest in \nreducing obesity among SNAP beneficiaries.\n  Under the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010, funding for the SNAP \nEducation Program is allotted based on two factors: a State's \nhistorical contributions to healthy eating and lifestyle programs, and \nthe number of SNAP participants in the State.\n  The amendment offered by my colleague from South Dakota undoes that \nformula, instead allocating funds solely on a per-recipient basis.\n  The Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act formula was the product of a \ncompromise.\n  The old formula, which allowed the Federal Government to match all \nState contributions to programs that encourage healthy eating and \nlifestyles for SNAP recipients, was not affordable.\n  By eliminating the unlimited match provision and replacing it with a \nblock grant, the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act was able to save \ntaxpayers more than $1 billion over 10 years.\n  In exchange for this reduction, a new formula was created. Under the \nnew provision, States that committed hundreds of millions of their own \ndollars to reduce obesity, like California and Michigan, received \nmarginally higher obesity education funding from USDA.\n  And States that had not dedicated their own resources to combating \nobesity received a relatively smaller share of the funding.\n  Allowing the changes from 2010, which are just now being implemented, \nto take effect is the best way to effectively reform this program.\n  This amendment would devastate a program that helps SNAP-eligible \nchildren and families learn to stretch their food budgets, reduce \nhunger, make improvements to their diets and reduce obesity.\n  I urge my colleagues to let USDA implement the thoughtful \ncomprehensive reforms from 2010.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs \nAct of 2013 contains many important provisions for my State of Michigan \nand for our Nation's farmers and that is why I am voting in support. \nThe Senate passed a farm bill in 2012, but the House took no action. \nThis was unfortunate, as that farm bill as well as the one before us \nnow contain important reforms to agricultural programs. Reforms that \nwill better help farmers manage their risk and better protect the \nenvironment.\n  CBO estimates that the Senate introduced bill would reduce direct \nspending by $18 billion over a 10-year period. The bulk of these \nsavings come from the elimination of direct payments to growers and \nrestructuring of conservation programs. While achieving this budgetary \nsavings, the bill provides important funding for agricultural \nproducers. I am pleased that this farm bill provides funding for \nspecialty crops. My home State is second only to California in the \nnumber of crops grown and is second to none in production of 18 \ndifferent commodities including tart cherries, cucumbers, blueberries, \ndry black and red beans and cranberries. The bill before us provides \nmandatory funding for the Specialty Crop Research Initiative, continues \nfunding for specialty crop block grants and consolidates efforts to \nfight invasive pests.\n  The bill also includes important conservation provisions to reduce \nerosion, improve wildlife habitat, and protect water quality, including \nthat of the Great Lakes. Compliance with conservation measures is \nrequired for lands receiving Federal assistance. Every year, about 600 \nmillion tons of topsoil erode from agricultural lands in the Great \nLakes region. This soil erosion also includes fertilizer and other\n\n[[Page S4050]]\n\nchemicals, polluting waterways and contributing to harmful algal \nblooms, a growing problem in the Great Lakes. The conservation \nrequirements in the bill would help prevent this from occurring, as \nwell as protecting the soil quality and productivity of the farmland.\n  I am also pleased the bill includes the Regional Conservation \nPartnership Program, which would support locally-led conservation \nprojects in priority watersheds such as the Great Lakes. The program \nwould allow a broad range of issues to be addressed including sediment \nreduction, water quality improvements, and habitat conservation. \nBecause the Great Lakes region already has a regional plan in place, \nour region should be able to effectively compete for the $110 million \nin annual funding that would be provided for this program. We have made \nsome solid progress in cleaning up our Great Lakes and other waters in \nMichigan, but there is still much to be done. The conservation funding \nprovided in the farm bill would help to protect and restore the Great \nLakes as well as Michigan's inland waterways.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, sometimes Congress passes legislation \nthat directly creates jobs. More often, we approach job creation \nindirectly, with legislation that lays the groundwork for a more \nproductive and dynamic private sector. An excellent example of this is \nthis new farm bill.\n  The chairwoman, Senator Stabenow, and the ranking member, Senator \nCochran, deserve congratulations and our sincere gratitude for all of \ntheir efforts and their success in bringing this bill through the \nAgriculture Committee and to the Senate floor. And because this bill \nreflects so much of the work done in the last Congress, I also want to \nrecognize the many contributions of Senator Roberts.\n  As a senior member and former chairman of the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, this is the eighth farm bill I \nhave worked on since coming to Congress in 1975. I chaired the \ncommittee during passage of the 2002 and 2008 bills. From that \nexperience, I can tell my colleagues the new farm bill--the Agriculture \nReform, Food and Jobs Act of 2013--is good for Iowa and our entire \nNation.\n  It is a difficult enough process to craft a farm bill without the \nextra hardship of having to take spending reductions out of the budget \nbaseline. These budget cuts are very difficult because there are \ncompelling needs respecting food, agriculture, and rural America. This \nmeasure embodies genuine sacrifices and serious deficit reduction. It \nexceeds the farm bill deficit reduction in the budget resolution we \npassed here in the Senate.\n  This bill reflects a bipartisan balance among numerous competing \ndemands. It was broadly supported in the committee and I hope it will \nbe broadly supported by the full Senate. Again, I commend the \nleadership of our committee for striking that balance and building \nsupport for this legislation.\n  Overall net farm income has been strong in our Nation in recent \nyears, and that has given a boost to rural economies. But this strong \nincome has not been enjoyed by all producers of all commodities, or in \nall regions of the country. For example, many farmers and ranchers are \nstill struggling to survive the devastating impact of drought and other \nnatural disasters.\n  This bill wisely continues programs that offer some income protection \nand stability in the face of the inevitable natural disasters and \nswings in farm production levels and commodity prices. At the same \ntime, this bill continues and builds upon important reforms in recent \nfarm bills, for example, by strengthening and tightening payment \nlimitations.\n  A landmark reform in this bill is eliminating what are called the \ndirect commodity payments. From their inception, I did not believe the \ndirect payments were sound or responsible policy. They were inadequate \nwhen farm prices and incomes fell. Yet when prices and incomes rose, \nthe payments continued anyway, which was unjustified, and even \nembarrassing.\n  And so I support replacing the direct payments with the revenue \nprotection program in this bill focused on protecting farmers against \nlosses of revenue, taking into account both prices and yields. The new \nrevenue program is an evolution of the Average Crop Revenue Election--\nACRE--program that I was pleased we included in the 2008 farm bill. \nThis bill also continues a strong crop insurance program, and in fact \nit makes it even more beneficial to farmers. That is certainly of \nsubstantial economic value to Iowa farmers.\n  In the conservation title, I commend Senator Stabenow, Senator \nCochran, and Senator Roberts for important improvements in the \nprograms, and for continuing the Conservation Stewardship Program and \nother critical initiatives with substantial funding levels. I do very \nmuch regret that conservation funding is cut from the budget baseline \nlevels, but I commend and thank the leaders of our committee for \nlimiting those conservation budget cuts.\n  I especially want to express my strong congratulations for the \nmomentous agreement that was reached between the farm community and the \nconservation community to reinstate minimum conservation requirements \nin order for a farmer to receive Federal crop insurance subsidies. This \nis a very important policy reform. I very strongly urge my colleagues \nto support this agreement on making basic conservation an integral part \nof crop insurance.\n  I am pleased this bill continues to provide fresh fruits and \nvegetables to school children across the country. That is an initiative \nI started and expanded as chairman. I regret, however, that this \nlegislation reduces funding for nutrition assistance to low-income \nAmericans. I commend the chairwoman and ranking member for limiting \nthese reductions. I intend to try to mitigate cuts to antihunger \nprograms as the legislative process moves forward.\n  In the several farm and rural energy programs in the bill, I am very \npleased with the substantial level of mandatory funding dedicated to \ncontinue these effective and beneficial initiatives.\n  So, again, I thank the chairwoman and the ranking member for their \ngood work and pledge my support to them in moving this bill through the \nSenate and to conference with the House--once the House passes its \nbill, we hope--and then to the President.\n  This new farm bill is vitally important to our Nation and especially \nto productivity, vitality and jobs in our Nation's food and agriculture \nsector. It is far too important to be delayed any longer.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, today I will vote to pass a bipartisan \nmeasure to reauthorize the many important programs and reforms included \nin this year's farm bill. Chairman Stabenow and Senator Cochran are to \nbe commended for the good work they and other Agriculture Committee \nmembers put into developing this legislation.\n  This bill is the most sweeping reform of agriculture programs in \nrecent memory. Gone are outdated direct payments that are made \nregardless of profitability of the farm. Instead, we strengthen the \ncrop insurance program, a vital safety net for our producers, while \nmaking commonsense reforms. The amendment I offered with Senator Coburn \nreducing premium support for the wealthiest farmers is a part of these \nreforms. So is the move to require conservation compliance from farmers \nwho benefit from subsidized crop insurance. I hope these will be \nretained in a final conference version of the bill.\n  The energy title includes mandatory funding for programs to expand \nbio-based manufacturing, advanced biofuels, and renewable energy. These \nprograms help companies in Illinois like Archer Daniels Midland and \nPatriot Renewable Fuels process and manufacture products in rural \nAmerica. There are many examples in Illinois of new markets being \ndeveloped and new jobs being created in rural areas because of the \ngrowth in bio-based industries.\n  The bill also includes mandatory spending, reauthorizes, and expands \nseveral programs in the research title. A new Foundation for Food and \nAgriculture Research will leverage public dollars to generate private \ninvestment in ag research. These investments are important to Illinois \nproducers and major research institutions like the University of \nIllinois, Southern Illinois University, the Peoria Agriculture Lab, and \nseveral other universities and labs across Illinois.\n  Finally, the bill ensures that programs are in place to help our \nrural communities grow and thrive and it reauthorizes food assistance \nprograms for\n\n[[Page S4051]]\n\nthose most in need, at home and abroad. And it does all this while \nsaving roughly $24 billion compared to pre-sequestration budget levels.\n  As the Senate and House work through conference, I urge my colleagues \nto protect access to SNAP for the over 23 million households that \ndepend on the program. It is my great hope that when a final version of \nthe 2013 farm bill is considered in the Senate, I will be able to fully \nsupport a bill that protects this important nutrition program.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, across Vermont's food system, businesses \nare starting, expanding, and creating good jobs. Ever more local food \nis available in stores, restaurants, and institutions throughout the \nState and in greater supply, for more months of the year. Important \nprograms are reaching more food insecure Vermonters with fresh, healthy \nfood. Thanks to the Senate farm bill we will continue to see these \nimprovements in Vermont and across the country\n  Nationwide agriculture supports 16 million jobs. In Vermont our farms \nand private forestlands play a large role in our economy and our \nState's cultural and historical identity. Iconic images of Vermont's \nfarms and forests bring millions of visitors to the State each year, \nsupporting our local communities.\n  The 2013 farm bill that the Senate passed today will continue to \nsupport our farmers and rural communities, while also reforming \nagricultural programs to save taxpayers billions of dollars. I am \nencouraged that the Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie \nStabenow and our ranking member Thad Cochran have been able to bring \nthe Senate together to pass a bipartisan farm bill. A farm bill that \nsaves more than $23 billion. A bill that includes many compromises. \nThis bill provides an important framework to help farmers and ranchers \nin all regions of the country manage their risks more effectively, \nespecially our country's dairy farmers, who strongly support the dairy \nprovisions in the Senate-passed farm bill.\n  I must also thank the chairwoman for her assistance with my gigabit \nbroadband pilot amendment. This small pilot effort is an important \naddition to the bill and the broadband program and will help to ensure \nthat the taxpayer dollars we are investing in networks will not become \nobsolete within the next few years. Gigabit Internet is spreading to \ncities across the country, and this pilot will allow USDA to test out \ninvestment in gigabit networks in rural areas on a pilot basis. The \nnext generation gigabit networks will transform everything from the \nreliability of the electrical grid, to education and healthcare in \nrural America. We cannot leave rural America behind in the dust while \nthe rest of the country moves into this next stage of the digital era.\n  I urge the U.S. House of Representatives to follow suit by bringing a \nfarm bill up for debate as soon as possible. Time already is running \nshort for us to bring Senate and House bills to a conference committee \nto work out the vast differences and arrive at a compromise farm bill \nthat can be signed into law prior to the Sept. 30 expiration of the \ncurrent bill. Farmers face enough uncertainty in their work and do not \nneed Congress to compound the variables with which they must contend by \nonce again delaying final action on a farm bill. Our farmers and the \nAmerican people deserve a new farm bill and a balanced bill like the \none we have passed in the Senate today, a bill which supports our \nnutrition, conservation, rural development, and farm programs. Our \nfarmers cannot afford to be kept in limbo any longer by congressional \ngridlock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all postcloture time \nis expired. The question occurs on amendment No. 998, offered by the \nSenator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, this amendment is very simple. It sets up \na pilot program for real ultra-high-speed Internet in rural areas. We \nare going to have this in urban areas. All we are saying is let rural \nareas--and every single Senator represents a rural area somewhere in \ntheir State--allow rural areas to compete with urban areas for jobs, \nfor education, for medical care.\n  The ultra-high-speed Internet service pilot is narrow in scope, \ncarefully drafted. I know it is supported by the distinguished chair \nand distinguished ranking member. It has the potential of bringing, as \nI said earlier, the innovation of Silicon Valley to the Upper Valley in \nVermont and rural areas across the country.\n  It is almost what we had to argue about rural electricity back before \nI was born--whether rural areas would be the same as urban areas. This \nmakes it possible.\n  I urge its passage.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the Leahy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Leahy \namendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was not able to vote on final \npassage of the farm bill today due to an urgent personal matter, but I \nwant the record to reflect my strong support for the Agriculture \nReform, Food and Jobs Act. Last year I voted in favor of the farm bill \nand would have once again supported this bipartisan legislation. S. 954 \ngives Virginia's farmers the certainty they need, supports the \neconomies of our rural communities and also improves current farm \nprograms. I am proud that the bill contains two of my priorities: \nensuring farmers in the Chesapeake Bay watershed get a fair share of \nconservation funding and reforming broadband financing programs to \nprovide greater accountability and transparency. I would like to thank \nthe chairwoman and ranking member for their tireless efforts, and wish \nI could have been there to cast my vote for this important, bipartisan \nlegislation.\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I was unable to return \nto Washington, DC, prior to the votes this evening due to unavoidable \ntravels delays that were beyond my control and was therefore unable to \ncast a vote for rollcall votes No. 144 and 145, Leahy amendment No. 998 \nand final passage of the farm bill, S. 954. Had I been present, I would \nhave voted ``yea'' on each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n5 minutes. Following my remarks, Senator Sessions will have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Under the leadership of Chairman Stabenow and Ranking \nMember Cochran, the Senate has again passed a bipartisan deficit-\nreducing bill that will help our farms, our families, our economy, and \nour environment.\n  The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 is a good start to \ncultivating a new era of prosperity in our country and reinvesting in \nrural America. That is because this bill benefits all Americans, \nespecially in my home State of Ohio.\n  One in seven jobs in Ohio, in places such as Custar and Defiance, is \nrelated to food and agriculture. To keep our economy growing, the farm \nbill must remain a priority here in Congress. We have shown the Senate \ncan do its part.\n  To people who are uncertain about our ability to work across the \naisle, I say look at this farm bill. To people who are concerned about \nspending in Washington, I say look at this farm bill. To people who are \ndisheartened about our ability to help low-income families make ends \nmeet, I say look at this farm bill.\n  This bill saves more than $24 billion, and it maintains important \ninvestments in conservation, nutrition, renewable energy, and rural \ndevelopment. Farmers across Ohio and across the country tell us they \nwant a leaner, more efficient, and market-oriented farm safety net. \nTaxpayers deserve that too.\n  By eliminating direct payments, linking crop insurance to \nconservation compliance, and by further reforming our risk management \nprograms, the Senate has taken that first step.\n  Every farmer knows the importance of building on last season's work. \nLast year, Senators Thune, Durbin, Lugar--the predecessor--the \nPresiding Officer, and I proposed the Aggregate Risk and Revenue \nManagement Program, streamlining the farmer safety net, making it more \nmarket-oriented. The Agricultural Risk Coverage Program included in \nthis bill gives farmers the tools they need to mitigate risks, ensuring \nthat payments happen only when farmers need them most. The program \nrelies on current data and, as a result, is more responsive to farmers' \nneeds and more responsive to taxpayers.\n  It also includes a provision to help Ohio farmers and producers sell \ntheir products directly to consumers. It will make a world of \ndifference to families and schools that want to eat locally grown food. \nI appreciate the efforts, interest, and support of Senator Cochran in \nthose efforts.\n  However, this bill does not include my food and agriculture market \ndevelopment amendment, cosponsored by 14 of my colleagues, to provide \nneeded funding to several important programs that support the \ndevelopment of a stronger, more sustainable food system. We will work \non that in the House.\n  By aligning our agricultural, health, and economic policies in ways \nthat ensure farmers get a fair price for their product, all Americans \ncan have access to affordable, healthy food, while contributing to \nstrong communities and thriving local economies.\n  The farm bill affects every American every day. It is a deficit \nreduction bill. It is a jobs bill, conservation bill, rural development \nbill, and it is bipartisan.\n  I commend again Senator Stabenow and Senator Cochran for their work \nin crafting this bill, and their joint effort to work across party \nlines is to be commended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senate for passing \nthis very important farm bill, the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs \nAct of 2013.\n  I especially thank my colleagues Debbie Stabenow and Pat Roberts and \ntheir staff members for the hard work they devoted to this effort. \nTheir bill, when it was begun, passed the Senate last year. Their \nlegislation became the starting point for our work this year on the \nbill.\n  The chairwoman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Stabenow, and \nher staff director, Chris Adamo, have been outstanding leaders in this \neffort. I would at this opportunity thank them and all of the members \nof their staff for their hard work in developing a strategy and \ndeveloping language of a bill that could enjoy such broad support.\n  Members of our committee staff and my personal office staff have \nworked very hard too in this effort. I would like to thank them for \ntheir contributions. I appreciate their hard work. They include my \nstaff director, T. A. Hawks, Nona McCoy, Kevin Batteh, Darrell Dixon, \nAdam Telle, Daniel Ulmer, Ben Mosely, Taylor Nicholas, Julian Baer, \nAndrew Vlasaty, Chris Gallegos, Steven Wall, Keith Coble, Anne Hazlett, \nJames Glueck, and Sarah Margaret Hewes. The staff members have done an \noutstanding job, and\n\n[[Page S4053]]\n\nI am very pleased they have been members of our team. For all of them \nand especially for the Senators and the support we have received today, \nwe appreciate the support very much.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/10/senate-section/article/S4053-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FORTY-EIGHTH ANNIVERSARY OF GRISWOLD V. CONNECTICUT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 48 years ago on June 5, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt made a landmark ruling in Griswold v. Connecticut, which \nlegalized birth control for married couples in all 50 States and paved \nthe way for women and men to have legal access to contraception.\n  The Justices' decision not only recognized birth control as a right \nprotected under our Constitution, but empowered women and families to \nmake decisions in the best interest of their health and well-being.\n  In fact, access to birth control has had such a dramatic impact on \nwomen and families in this country that the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention named it one of the top 10 public health achievements of \nthe past century, along with vaccinations and adding fluoride to water.\n  Family planning and contraceptive services give women and couples the \nability to determine timing of births and family size.\n  Research shows that having smaller families and spacing out births \nimprove the health of children and women.\n  Access to contraception also improves the economic and social well-\nbeing of women.\n  Contraception allows young women to postpone pregnancy until they \nfinish school, secure a good job, and are as ready as any parent can be \nto start a family.\n  The benefits of contraception help not only women, but their \nchildren.\n  When parents have prepared themselves financially and mentally to \nlove and support a child, the child reaps all the benefits.\n  While the Supreme Court's 1965 ruling on Griswold v. Connecticut \npaved the way for legalizing contraception, the Federal Government has \nplayed a key role in expanding access to family planning services.\n  In 1970, under President Nixon, title X was created and remains the \nonly dedicated source of Federal funding for family planning services \nin the U.S.\n  Title X provides critical family planning and preventive health care \nto 5.2 million low-income and uninsured women and men across the \ncountry.\n  Title X services prevent nearly 1 million unintended pregnancies each \nyear, almost half of which would otherwise end in abortion.\n  In 1972, 2 years after the creation of title X, Medicaid funding for \nfamily planning was authorized.\n  Last year, a key provision of the health care reform law took effect \nthat builds on the legacy of Griswold v. Connecticut.\n  New health insurance plans will now cover a range of preventive \nhealth services, including contraception services, at no cost.\n  The annual cost of birth control pills can range from $160 to $600. \nFor many women, that expense has been a barrier to accessing basic \nhealth care.\n  Over the last 48 years, we have made tremendous progress ensuring \nwomen have access to quality health care and are free to make decisions \nabout their own health.\n  As we remember Griswold v. Connecticut, we must remember those who \nfought to ensure access to contraception. We must protect personal \nfreedoms and defend our Nation from efforts to undermine access to \nbasic health care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/10/senate-section/article/S4053-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              AWARD OF ABILENE TROPHY TO ST. LOUIS REGION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the communities of \nSt. Louis and Southwestern Illinois region for winning the Air Mobility \nCommand Community Support--Award also known as the Abilene Trophy--for \ntheir support of Scott Air Force Base in 2012.\n  The Abilene Trophy is presented annually to a civilian community \nrecognized for providing outstanding support to a nearby US Air Force \nAir Mobility Command base. The award has been presented every year \nsince 1998 and highlights the role our communities play in support of \nour service men and women and their families.\n  Scott Air Force Base in St. Clair County, IL, is home to the 375th \nAir Mobility Wing, the Air Force Reserve Command's 932nd Airlift Wing, \nand the Illinois Air National Guard's 126th Air Refueling Wing. Scott \nAir Force Base also headquarters major military organizations such as \nUSTRANSCOM, the Air Force Global Logistics Support Center, and the Air \nMobility Command. Winning the prestigious Abilene Trophy is \nparticularly meaningful, given the multiple missions supported there.\n  The nomination package for the Abilene Trophy cited over 270 examples \nof how the surrounding communities have supported military personnel at \nthe base, including in-kind donations such as $500,000 worth of \ndocumented material aid through the H.E.R.O.E.S. Care program. \nPartnerships were built that could help servicemembers and their \nfamilies find appropriate resources. Servicemembers and their families \nwere recognized by major league sports teams such as the Cardinals and \nthe Rams and by community schools and businesses. Countless other \nexamples of generosity, support and gratitude from the community have \nprovided financial, physical, and emotional support throughout the \nyear.\n  We owe a great debt of gratitude to the men and women who have \nsacrificed their lives or go to work every day to protect our country. \nI am proud to support those who have done so much for our Nation and am \njust as proud of those communities that do the same.\n  Congratulations to the Southwestern Illinois and St. Louis regions on \nwinning the Abilene Trophy. Tomorrow's awards ceremony reminds us of \nyour commitment to our servicemembers at Scott Air Force Base and to \nour military families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/10/senate-section/article/S4053-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4053-S4054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               SRI LANKA\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise to encourage our Department of \nState to review its current policies regarding the country of Sri \nLanka, and seek further engagement with its leadership so as to assist \nthem as they continue their progress toward complete reconciliation and \nreconstruction after 30 years of the civil war against the Tamil Tiger \nterrorists.\n  As you know, four years ago Sri Lanka defeated the Tamil rebels, and \nis currently recovering from the economic, political, and social \nupheaval caused by this destructive civil war. Peace has brought \nhistoric post-conflict recovery, and I find that Sri Lanka has brought \nthe dividends of peace in an inclusive manner, in particular to those \nin the north and the east of the country from where suicide bombers and \nother terrorist attacks were once launched.\n  It is my understanding that, since the war ended, those two areas \nhave seen an economic growth of 22%, compared to an average of 7.5% in \nthe rest of the country. It is also my understanding that Sri Lanka has \nremoved half a million anti-personnel mines, resettled 300,000 \ninternally displaced people and re-established vital social services in \nthe areas of health and education. It is making progress in other areas \nof reconciliation in accordance with its legislative and budgetary \nprocedures, and is expected to conduct elections in the north in \nSeptember--an important step towards political reconciliation. Such \nprocesses take time, as we have learned from our own Civil War.\n  It seems to me that Sri Lanka is developing into a key economy, both \nin its own right and as a gateway to India. It is my understanding that \nU.S. private investment there totals billions in long term Sri Lankan \nbonds. Such investments there, however, are not as visible as the \nairports and harbors financed by China and other governments. \nRegardless, it is my understanding that at this time, Sri Lanka \ncontinues to present a unique window of investment opportunities for \nU.S. companies.\n  In addition, Sri Lanka's geo-strategic location and deep-water ports \ncould be vital to the long term financial and national security \ninterests of the U.S. Some 50% of all container traffic and 70% of the \nworld's energy supplies pass within sight of the Sri Lankan coast.\n\n[[Page S4054]]\n\n  Understandably, U.S. policies towards Sri Lanka have focused on \naccountability for what happened during the last phases of the civil \nwar as well as on steps toward reconciliation efforts that seek \ninclusion of former terrorist enemies into the democratic process. \nWhile these aspects are very important and deserving of support, I \nbelieve there is the opportunity to engage in a wider approach at the \nsame time that takes into account economic and geostrategic \nconsiderations. Maybe a wider approach would have a positive influence \noverall.\n  I have expressed these points recently in correspondence to Secretary \nKerry, urging him to undertake at the Department of State a review of \nour current policies towards Sri Lanka to ensure that we not only \nencourage continued reconciliation that includes political transparency \nespecially in the upcoming election in the north but also recognize Sri \nLanka's potential to be a strong financial and national security ally \nin the future.\n  Secretary Kerry has replied agreeing with me that promising economic \ngrowth is occurring in Sri Lanka after years of terrorist insurgency, \nand that this country can play a significant geopolitical role in U.S. \nstrategic security interests in South Asia and the Indian Ocean. The \nState Department, however, points out that Sri Lanka still needs to \nachieve ``meaningful reconciliation between the Sinhala majority and \nTamil and Muslim minorities.''\n  I take the State Department at its word, and believe the upcoming \nSeptember 7 Provincial Council elections in the north can be a \nmeaningful act of reconciliation between the Sinhala majority and Tamil \nMuslim minorities. And if they are deemed to be conducted in a free and \nfair manner, I will renew my request to Secretary Kerry to re-access \nour current policies towards Sri Lanka.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/10/senate-section/article/S4054-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO ROBERT MARTIN, TUSKEGEE AIRMAN\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize \nthe remarkable service of Robert Martin, who has spent his life \novercoming racial barriers and giving back to his country through \nextraordinary military and public service.\n  Born and raised in Dubuque, IA, Mr. Martin, in his youth and \nthroughout his life, demonstrated an exceptional commitment to \nacademics, athletics, and community service. He participated in Boy \nScouts despite threats and backlash from fellow scouts' parents. He was \nalso ultimately inducted into the Dubuque Senior High School Athletic \nHall of Fame. He graduated from Iowa State University earning a degree \nin electrical engineering and obtained a pilot's license.\n  Mr. Martin, while still in college, applied to join the U.S. Army Air \nCorps and was accepted after he was drafted into service. He began his \nmilitary career in Fort Dodge, but was transferred to Tuskegee, AL, to \ntrain in the Army's Black pilot program, where he received the rank of \ncommissioned second lieutenant and specialized in operating the AT-6 \nTexan and the P-40 War Hawk. He then, in 1944, became an active fighter \npilot in Italy, conducting over 60 long-range combat missions as part \nof the 100th Fighter Squadron. His squadron defended B-17 Flying \nFortresses from German assaults. On March 3, 1945, he was shot down by \nground fire in Yugoslavia. He parachuted from his burning plane and \nsuccessfully avoided German capture with the help of Yugoslavian \npartisans. Upon his recovery, he returned to the U.S. and was honorably \ndischarged.\n  After being discharged, Mr. Martin continued to serve in the Army Air \nCorps Reserves, rising to the rank of captain. Following his military \ncareer, he maintained a commitment to public service, serving as an \nengineer for Cook County, IL. He was also a leader in Tuskegee Airmen, \nInc., an organization whose members travel the country as educators and \nhistorians.\n  Mr. Martin was awarded a number of accolades for his service, \nincluding the Distinguished Flying Cross, a Purple Heart, an Air Medal \nwith six Oak Leaf Clusters, and, in 2007, the Congressional Gold Medal. \nMoreover, he was inducted into the Iowa Aviation Hall of Fame and \npresented the George Washington Carver Medal from Simpson College, \nwhich recognizes individuals who have served as an inspiration to \nothers; demonstrated leadership and conviction; advanced the fields of \nscience, education, the arts, or religion; and dedicated themselves to \naddressing humanitarian issues. Mr. Martin's record exemplifies the \nextraordinary military service African Americans performed and the \ndedication that they displayed for their country in spite of the \nprejudice they experienced.\n  Robert Martin is a remarkable citizen, truly deserving of his many \ndecorations and my gratitude. I wish him and his family all the best \nand thank him and all the Tuskegee Airmen for their steadfast service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/10/senate-section/article/S4054-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4054-S4055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CONSULTATION REQUEST\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter \ndated June 10, 2013, to the minority leader be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 2013.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am requesting that I be consulted \n     before the Senate enters into any unanimous consent \n     agreements or time limitations regarding H.R. 180, National \n     Blue Alert Act of 2013.\n       I support the goals of this legislation and believe \n     suspects who seriously injure or kill federal, state or local \n     law enforcement officers in the line of duty should be \n     apprehended as quickly as possible. However, I believe the \n     responsibility to address this issue, as it relates to state \n     and local law enforcement officers, lies with the states and \n     local communities that these brave law enforcement officers \n     serve. Furthermore, while I do not believe this issue is the \n     responsibility of the federal government; if Congress does \n     act, we can and must do so in a fiscally responsible manner. \n     My concerns are included in, but not limited to, those \n     outlined in this letter.\n       While this bill is well-intentioned, it will likely cost \n     the American people several million dollars over 5 years \n     without corresponding offsets. I recognize this bill no \n     longer contains the authorization included in prior versions \n     of this legislation; however, establishing a new program \n     which requires the Department of Justice (DOJ) to carry out \n     additional responsibilities, even if implemented by existing \n     staff, is not free of future costs. In examining last year's \n     National Blue Alert Act of 2012 (H.R. 365), the Congressional \n     Budget Office (CBO) estimated the DOJ would incur an \n     additional $5 million over 5 years solely in administrative \n     costs to operate the Blue Alert system. As this legislation \n     made no changes from the 2012 bill, it is safe to assume \n     those costs will recur.\n       It is irresponsible for Congress to jeopardize the future \n     standard of living of our children by borrowing from future \n     generations. The U.S. national debt is now over $16.7 \n     trillion. That means over $53,000 in debt for each man, woman \n     and child in the United States. A year ago, the national debt \n     was $15.7 trillion. Despite pledges to control spending, \n     Washington adds billions to the national debt every single \n     day. In just one year, our national debt has grown by $1 \n     trillion or 6.4%.\n       In addition to these fiscal concerns, there are several \n     problems specific to this legislation. First, there is no \n     need to establish a national Blue Alert system because many \n     states have already developed their own Blue Alert programs \n     for the same purposes outlined in this bill, including alerts \n     issued for the injury or death of federal, as well as state \n     and local law enforcement officers. In 2008, Florida and \n     Texas were the first states to establish these programs. \n     Fourteen additional states soon followed--Oklahoma, Maryland, \n     Georgia, Delaware, California, Virginia, Mississippi, \n     Tennessee, Utah, Colorado, South Carolina, Washington, \n     Kentucky, and Ohio. This year, in July and October, \n     respectively, Indiana and Connecticut will begin their Blue \n     Alert systems. Several state legislatures currently have \n     legislation pending that would establish a Blue Alert system, \n     including Minnesota, Illinois and Alabama.\n       Furthermore, there is no data to support the success of any \n     of the existing state Blue Alert programs. Oklahoma \n     established its Blue Alert system in 2009, but it is not yet \n     fully functional. The last five states to establish an alert \n     system did so just last year. As a result, not only have \n     states already established their own programs, but from the \n     limited use of the existing systems, there is no clear \n     evidence of a substantial need for a Blue Alert system, or of \n     the consistent, successful apprehension of suspects as a \n     direct result of a Blue Alert. If anything, we should wait \n     for these programs to produce results that can be examined \n     and determine whether this type of system is useful before \n     instituting a federal one-size-fits-all program.\n       Second, while the bill's supporters likely envision \n     pursuing suspects who have injured or killed a law \n     enforcement officer in a routine traffic stop or while \n     fleeing a crime scene, for example, the bill's definition of \n     ``law enforcement officer'' is much broader.\n\n[[Page S4055]]\n\n     The bill incorporates the definition in Section 1204 of the \n     Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, which \n     includes ``an individual involved in crime and juvenile \n     delinquency control or reduction, or enforcement of the \n     criminal laws (including juvenile delinquency), including, \n     but not limited to, police, corrections, probation, parole, \n     and judicial officers.'' As a result, a Blue Alert could be \n     issued for a state court bailiff, a state parole officer, or \n     an officer within a state's juvenile corrections facility, if \n     injured in the line of duty.\n       Finally, I do not believe the federal government has the \n     authority under the Constitution to provide federal funds to \n     coordinate the tracking of state and local fugitives or to \n     establish national protocols to apprehend suspects accused of \n     injuring or killing state and local law enforcement officers. \n     Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution enumerates the \n     limited powers of Congress, and nowhere are we tasked with \n     funding or becoming involved with state and local criminal \n     issues.\n       There is no question those suspected of injuring or killing \n     a state or local law enforcement officer in the line of duty \n     should be aggressively pursued and prosecuted. However, I \n     believe this issue is the responsibility of the states and \n     not the federal government. Despite these Constitutional \n     limitations, if Congress does act in this area, like most \n     American individuals and companies must do with their own \n     resources, we should evaluate current programs, determine any \n     needs that may exist, and prioritize those needs for funding \n     by cutting from the federal budget programs fraught with \n     waste, fraud, abuse, and duplication.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Tom A. Coburn, M.D.,\n     United States Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/10/senate-section/article/S4055-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER GEORGE KOVATCH\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Homeland Security Appropriations \nSubcommittee will soon bid farewell to our congressional fellow, Coast \nGuard CDR. George Kovatch, who has served the Committee on \nAppropriations over the past 3 years. Unfortunately, Commander Kovatch \nis retiring, so not only is his departure a loss for the Committee on \nAppropriations, but it is also a loss for the Coast Guard.\n  Commander Kovatch has been detailed to the committee from the U.S. \nCoast Guard since 2010 and is a key member of our professional staff. \nCommander Kovatch performed admirably in his role on the Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations Subcommittee. He did everything we asked of \nhim, with pinpoint accuracy, and always beat the deadlines given to \nhim. I would also add that he served the committee during interesting \ntimes, perhaps more interesting than he imagined when he accepted the \njob. He was here for the Deepwater Horizon oilspill, the Times Square \nbombing attempt, the air cargo printer scare, Hurricanes Isaac and \nSandy, and the Boston marathon bombing.\n  The Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee has greatly \nbenefited from the experience Commander Kovatch gained as a Coast Guard \nofficer, in particular his insights into the operations of a complex \nmilitary organization that is combined with a large domestic agency. He \nhas superb analytical skills that have been critical in our review of a \n$39 billion budget request and in developing complex spreadsheets that \nsynthesize funding issues into easily understood documents we have used \nin hearings, closed briefings, in full committee, and on the floor. He \nmade critical recommendations that were adopted to improve key \ncomponents within the Department of Homeland Security, most notably \ncarefully overseeing integrity efforts following the rapid hiring of \nagents and officers at Customs and Border Protection as well as \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement to ensure that all agents, but \nespecially new hires, receive comprehensive training in ethics and \npublic integrity. His unqualified professionalism, perception, superb \nanalytic focus and technical skills, combined with a keen sense of \nhumor, a cool head, and a modesty rarely seen on Capitol Hill, have \nhelped keep the momentum for these bills moving forward. His high \nstandards of professionalism and thoroughness are beyond reproach, and \nhis contributions have been highly valued.\n  Through all of this, George maintained the decorum and \nprofessionalism that we have all come to expect from our military \nofficer corps, and he has represented the Coast Guard with the highest \nintegrity and competence. Commander Kovatch has served me, this \nsubcommittee, and the Senate well. We are sorry to see him leave and \nwill miss him as our colleague but are glad to count him as a friend. \nEach of us on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee wish \nGeorge all the best as he moves forward in the next phase of his \ncareer, where we anticipate seeing great things of him in the coming \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/10/senate-section/article/S4055-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          HAM RADIO IN ALASKA\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, the American Radio Relay League is \nthe national association for amateur radio, connecting ham radio \noperators around the world. Each year, the league sponsors a 24-hour \nField Day in June. The weekend of June 22 to 23 was chosen for 2013.\n  Ham radio has a variety of uses from private recreation, to \nroundtable discussions, self-training to emergency correspondence. \nThroughout its history, amateur radio has been a tool for inventors and \nhobbyists to share experiences and spread ideas. Notable enthusiasts \ninclude the late Walter Cronkite, ``CBS Evening News'' anchor, and \nNobel Prize-winning physicist Dr. Joseph H. Taylor. In the past, just \nby signing on one could converse with a foreign dignitary or even \nbounce radio waves off the Moon or aurora borealis to speak with \ncosmonauts aboard the International Space Station.\n  In Alaska, there are 16 ham radio clubs. These clubs provide a vital \ncommunication link that may otherwise not be available. This link \nincludes checkpoint updates for the Yukon Quest and Iditarod sled dog \nraces, support for local organizations such as the Boy Scouts, and \ncritical forecast information to and from the National Weather Service.\n  In 2011, a superstorm in the Bering Sea crippled communities along \nthe west coast of Alaska. Ham radio operators took up the task of \nproviding real time data to local, State, and Federal weather services, \nas well as to emergency responders, on the condition of residents. As \nham radio can operate independent of AC power or internet connection, \nit is well-suited to communities in rural Alaska.\n  Indeed, ham radio operators have been there throughout our Nation's \ntimes of need: the 1964 Good Friday earthquake in Alaska and more \nrecently Hurricane Katrina in the lower 48. These operators are deeply \ncommitted to public service, and they work tireless unpaid hours to \nmaintain the flow of information.\n  As Alaska's Field Day approaches, let us remember the vital role ham \nradio operators have played in education, science, survival, \nentertainment, and relationship-building in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/10/senate-section/article/S4055-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4055-S4056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL F. ADAMS\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Dr. \nMichael F. Adams, president of my alma mater, the University of \nGeorgia, which is the first State-chartered university in America. Dr. \nAdams is stepping down as president on June 30, 2013, after 16 very \nsuccessful years leading Georgia's flagship university.\n  Dr. Adams was named president of UGA on June 11, 1997, and \nimmediately focused on making the university one of America's best. \nUnder his leadership, student quality has risen dramatically, research \nproduction has increased significantly, and UGA is serving the people \nof Georgia and our Nation in new and innovative ways. As a result, U.S. \nNews & World Report has ranked it as one of America's top 20 public \nresearch universities in 8 of the past 10 years.\n  The UGA campus has been transformed during Dr. Adams' presidency, \nwith more than $1.2 billion in new construction, renovation, and \ninfrastructure undertaken. He created the UGA Real Estate Foundation as \na funding mechanism for much needed campus projects. His dedication to \nmaking UGA's campus one of the most breathtaking in the country is \napparent. When approaching Sanford Stadium from the west end, two of \nthe capital projects that Dr. Adams has undertaken are visible. Not \nonly are the Richard B. Russell Special Collections Libraries and the \nexpansion of the Tate Center a testament to the growth of the \nuniversity's physical campus, but\n\n[[Page S4056]]\n\nthey also show the president's commitment to ensuring that UGA's \nstudents have access to state-of-the-art facilitates. It is ``a place \nof the quality to which we aspire should look the part,'' as he has \nsaid.\n  Dr. Adams has also overseen the construction of the Paul D. Coverdell \nCenter for Biomedical and Health Sciences, a new Lamar Dodd School of \nArt, an expansion of the Georgia Museum of Art, and the first new \nresidence halls on campus in more than 30 years, the East Campus \nVillage.\n  There has been an expansion of the infrastructure and physical \nfootprint under Dr. Adams, and he has also directed an increase in \ngrowth and diversity of the academic program. Five new colleges or \nschools have been established during his tenure: the School of Public \nand International Affairs, the College of Environment and Design, the \nCollege of Public Health, the Eugene P. Odum School of Ecology, and the \nCollege of Engineering. Additionally, the UGA Health Sciences campus on \nthe former campus of the U.S. Navy Supply Corps School houses the \nCollege of Public Health, as well as the Georgia Regents University-\nUniversity of Georgia Medical Partnership, granting medical degrees in \nAthens for the first time.\n  Understanding, appreciating, and sharing the passion with which \nGeorgians cheer for the ``Dawgs,'' Dr. Adams has also made sure that \nUGA athletics continue the tradition of fielding the most gifted and \ndominant teams and athletes in the country. UGA athletes have won 27 \nnational championships, 58 Southeastern Conference titles, and 125 \nnational individual titles while Dr. Adams has been president. He also \nunderstands that the balance between academics and athletics is not a \nzero-sum game but that each plays a unique role in defining the \nidentity of the university.\n  Dr. Adams has been an outstanding leader of this institution. During \nhis tenure, he has personally or on behalf of the university received \nmore than 50 awards in higher education, including the Knight \nFoundation Award for Presidential Leadership and the James T. Rodgers \nAward, the highest honor bestowed by the Southern Association of \nColleges and Schools.\n  I would like to thank and recognize University of Georgia president \nMichael F. Adams for his extraordinary service to the University of \nGeorgia and our great State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/10/senate-section/article/S4056-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMEMBERING HENRY T. ``HANK'' WILFONG, JR.\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU.

A bill to establish requirements with respect to bisphenol \nA; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, scientific studies continue to show \ncause for concern about the chemical Bisphenol-A, BPA, especially the \neffects on babies and young children. Endocrine disrupting chemicals \nalter the function of the body's hormonal system. BPA is a synthetic \nestrogen, which means that it mimics this hormone when in the body. \nWhile studies continue to examine the exact effects this endocrine \ndisrupting chemical has on humans, consumers deserve more information. \nThey have the right to know if it is in the food products they purchase \nfor their families.\n  The BPA in Food Packaging Right to Know Act requires that food \npackaging that uses BPA include a clear label informing consumers. The \nlabel would read, ``This food packaging contains BPA, an endocrine-\ndisrupting chemical.'' This basic message would allow individuals to \nmake informed decisions about the products they purchase.\n  BPA is most commonly found in food products, such as the lining of \ncans. Parents are busy enough caring for their children and juggling \nwhat feels like a hundred things at the same time. Having factual \ninformation about whether the food they are buying at the grocery store \ncontains BPA, a potentially harmful chemical, shouldn't be one more \nthing they have to go to great lengths to figure out.\n  This legislation also directs the Department of Health and Human \nServices, HHS, to do a safety assessment of food containers containing \nBPA to determine if there is reasonable certainty that no harm will \ncome from long-term low dose exposure to BPA as well as high dose \nexposure.\n  This safety standard would also be used to evaluate proposed uses of \nalternatives to BPA. There is no use in replacing BPA in products if \nwhat we are replacing it with is just as bad or worse for human health.\n  The President's Cancer Panel focused on reducing the environmental \ncancer risk in its 2008- 2009 Annual Report. BPA is just one of many \nchemicals\n\n[[Page S4060]]\n\nthat pose a potential environmental cancer risk, with links to various \ncancers and also potentially affecting how well cancer treatments work. \nThis panel, appointed by former President George W. Bush, decided that \neven though studies are ongoing, they had enough information to state \nthat ``the true burden of environmentally induced cancer has been \ngrossly underestimated.''\n  I agree with this finding and strongly believe that as scientific \nstudies continue to seek definitive answers to the role of chemical \nexposure in adversely affecting human health, the very least that \nconsumers deserve is the right to know what chemicals, such as BPA, are \nin the products they are purchasing. The panel specifically mentions \nconcern that even though studies continue to link BPA with a variety of \ndiseases, it still remains in products.\n  I am particularly concerned about the negative health effects to \nchildren who are exposed to chemicals both while they are developing in \nthe womb and in the first few years of their lives. Children are \nparticularly susceptible to toxins while their bodies are developing at \nsuch a rapid pace. A recent study by researchers at the University of \nCalifornia, Berkley, stated that fetuses and pregnant women may be \nparticularly susceptible to BPA exposure. The study found that exposure \nto BPA may have an effect on thyroid function, and suggests continued \nstudies to confirm these findings.\n  An article published in Health Affairs in 2011 estimated that the \nannual cost of diseases that can be attributed to negative \nenvironmental exposures was more than $76 billion per year in 2008. The \nincidence of endocrine system-related diseases continues to rise, and \nanimal studies have shown adverse health effects in connection with \nexposure to BPA.\n  A recent study by researchers at the Columbia Center for Children's \nEnvironmental Health examined a link between BPA exposure and an \nincreased risk for asthma in young children. They found that there was \nan elevated risk associated with BPA exposure and more research is \nneeded to determine specific links.\n  BPA is one of the most pervasive chemicals in modern life. This \nchemical is used in thousands of consumer products and the most common \nexposure is through the lining of food packaging- like cans of green \nbeans and ready-made soups. As with so many other chemicals in consumer \nproducts, BPA has been added to our products without knowing if it is \nsafe or not.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the BPA in Food \nPackaging Right to Know Act to stand up for the right of consumers to \nmake informed choices about the food products they buy for their \nfamilies. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this \nimportant issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Cruz):\n  S. 1125. A bill to require the Secretary of State to submit to \nCongress reports on water sharing with Mexico; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1125\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to aid and support pediatric involvement in reading \nand education; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce with my colleague, Senator \nGrassley, the Prescribe-a-Book Act. I thank Senators Stabenow, Cowan, \nand Blumenthal for joining us as original cosponsors of this bipartisan \nbill.\n  Literacy skills are the foundation for success in school and in life. \nDeveloping and building these skills begins at home, with parents as \nthe first teachers.\n  Our legislation would create a federal pediatric early literacy grant \ninitiative based on the long-standing, successful Reach Out and Read \nprogram. The program would award grants on a competitive basis to high-\nquality non-profit entities to train doctors and nurses to discuss with \nparents the importance of reading aloud to their children and to give \nbooks to children at pediatric check-ups from six months to five years \nof age, with a priority for children from low-income families. It \nbuilds on the relationship between parents and medical providers and \nhelps families and communities encourage early literacy skills so \nchildren enter school prepared for success in reading.\n  The pediatric literacy model implemented by Reach Out and Read has \nconsistently demonstrated effectiveness in increasing family engagement \nand boosting children's reading proficiency. Research published in \npeer-reviewed, scientific journals has found that parents who have \nparticipated in the program are significantly more likely to read to \ntheir children and include more children's books in their home, and \nthat children served by the program show an increase of 4-8 points on \nvocabulary tests. I have seen up-close the positive impact of this \nprogram on children and their families when visiting a number of Rhode \nIsland's Reach Out and Read sites.\n  The Prescribe a Book Act would leverage federal dollars to expand \npediatric literacy initiatives so that more young children reap the \ndevelopmental benefits of having books at home and being read to by \ntheir parents. Federal grant funding for Reach Out and Read through the \nDepartment of Education helped build a successful public-private \npartnership that has been matched by tens of millions of dollars from \nthe private sector and state governments. The Prescribe a Book Act \nwould establish a formal authorization for activities modeled on this \ntype of successful partnership.\n  I urge our colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the Prescribe a Book \nAct, and to work to include its provisions in the upcoming \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. \n        Whitehouse):\n  S. 1127. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 regarding school libraries, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce with my colleagues \nSenators Cochran, Murray, and Whitehouse, the Strengthening Kids' \nInterest in Learning and Libraries Act.\n  Since 1965, more than 60 education and library studies have produced \nclear evidence that school libraries staffed by qualified librarians \nhave a positive impact on student academic achievement. Knowing how to \nfind and use information are essential skills for college and careers. \nA good school library, staffed by a trained school librarian, is where \nstudents develop and hone these skills.\n  Our bipartisan legislation would reauthorize and strengthen the \nImproving Literacy through School Libraries program of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act, the only federal\n\n[[Page S4061]]\n\ninitiative explicitly dedicated to supporting and enhancing our \nnation's school libraries. The key improvements to the program include \nensuring that elementary, middle, and high school students are served; \nexpanding professional development to include digital literacy \ninstruction and reading and writing instruction across all grade \nlevels; focusing on coordination and shared planning time between \nteachers and librarians; awarding grants for a period of three years; \nand ensuring that books and materials are appropriate for and gain the \ninterest of students with special learning needs, including English \nlearners.\n  The SKILLS Act would also strengthen Title I by asking state and \nschool district plans to address the development of effective school \nlibrary programs to help students gain digital literacy skills, master \nthe knowledge and skills in the challenging academic content standards \nadopted by the state, and graduate from high school ready for college \nand careers. Additionally, the legislation would broaden the focus of \ntraining, professional development, and recruitment activities under \nTitle II to include school librarians.\n  Absent a clear federal investment, the libraries in many of our high \npoverty schools will languish with outdated materials and technology, \nand in turn, students would be cut off from a vital information hub \nthat connects them to the tools they need to develop critical thinking \nand research skills necessary for success. This is a true equity issue, \nwhich is why I will continue to fight to sustain our federal investment \nin this area and why renewing and strengthening the school library \nprogram is of critical importance.\n  I urge our colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the bipartisan \nStrengthening Kids' Interest in Learning and Libraries Act, and to work \ntogether to ensure that it becomes a part of the upcoming \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/10/senate-section/article/S4061-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 164--DESIGNATING OCTOBER 30, 2013, AS A NATIONAL DAY \n           OF REMEMBRANCE FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM WORKERS\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Brown, Ms. \nCantwell, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. McConnell, and Mr. Udall of New Mexico) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n                              S.

and accountability and \n     promotes democratic processes across the continent of Africa;\n       Whereas the African Union departed from the OAU's abiding \n     doctrine of nonintervention in the internal affairs of member \n     states in favor of a new policy establishing the right of the \n     AU to intervene in a member state under grave circumstances, \n     including with respect to war crimes, genocide, and crimes \n     against humanity;\n       Whereas the African Union continues to build more robust \n     African regional institutions in order to address the myriad \n     challenges facing the continent, and has established an \n     African peace and security architecture, the New Partnership \n     for Africa's Development, a strategic framework for regional \n     socioeconomic development, the Comprehensive Africa \n     Agriculture Development Program, and the African Peer Review \n     Mechanism, which seeks to help advance good governance, among \n     other institutions;\n       Whereas the African Union has contributed to regional peace \n     and security by mobilizing peacekeeping or intervention \n     forces to protect civilians or support political mediation \n     missions and peace-building processes in Burundi, Comoros, \n     Sudan, Somalia, and Mali;\n       Whereas efforts to end conflicts on the continent of \n     Africa, which continue to destabilize states, undermine \n     democracy, stifle economic growth and investment, and rob \n     young Africans of the opportunity for an education and a \n     better life, are a key United States objective;\n       Whereas it is critical to the interests of the United \n     States that the African Union be capable of effectively \n     addressing current conflicts and preventing future ones, \n     advancing economic growth and broad-based and sustainable \n     economic development, and consolidating democracy and good \n     governance;\n       Whereas the United States Government demonstrated its \n     strong commitment to working closely with the AU by \n     establishing a Mission to the African Union in 2006;\n       Whereas, on August 3, 2010, the United States and the \n     African Union signed a $5,800,000 multi-year assistance \n     agreement to achieve common policy objectives;\n       Whereas, on June 14, 2012, President Barack Obama announced \n     a United States Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa, which \n     calls on the United States to deepen its partnership with \n     African countries and regional organizations by supporting \n     efforts to advance accountable, democratic governance and \n     adherence to human rights norms and the rule of law, \n     particularly by supporting the African Union African Charter \n     on Democracy, Elections, and Governance and other \n     multilateral standards;\n       Whereas key goals also supported by the African Union \n     include fostering peace and security, spurring economic \n     growth, trade, and investment, and promoting opportunity and \n     development;\n       Whereas, on February 1, 2013, a Memorandum of Understanding \n     was signed between the United States and the African Union to \n     cement cooperation on peace and security, democracy and \n     governance, economic growth, trade, and investment, and \n     promotion of opportunity and development;\n       Whereas the African Union serves as a preeminent dialogue \n     and policy-making forum for leaders in Africa seeking to \n     advance a wide range of regional political, security, social, \n     and economic objectives, including sub-regional integration, \n     and is a key interlocutor for and representative of the \n     people of Africa in international political and policy \n     forums, including the United Nations; and\n       Whereas close relations between the United States and the \n     African Union mutually benefit the people of the United \n     States and Africa and the political, security, economic, and \n     cultural relations that link them: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) extends warm congratulations to the former member \n     states of the Organization of African Unity on the 50th year \n     anniversary of its founding, in particular its original 32 \n     member states;\n       (2) commends member states of the African Union for their \n     strong and determined joint efforts to promote democratic \n     societies, sustainable development, and sound economic \n     practices, and peace, security, and stability on the \n     continent;\n       (3) urges the President to continue to strongly support \n     efforts to advance and strengthen United States-African Union \n     cooperation, including through United States programs to help \n     build the capacities of the African Union;\n       (4) encourages the President to expedite and expand United \n     States efforts to achieve the goals and objectives of his \n     United States Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa; and\n       (5) emphasizes the rule of law, good governance, respect \n     for human rights, open markets, and broad-based and \n     sustainable economic growth and development as key pillars \n     for long-term stability and security in Africa and United \n     States engagement with the continent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/10/senate-section/article/S4062-2",

RESOLUTION 167--REAFFIRMING THE STRONG SUPPORT OF THE UNITED \n  STATES FOR THE PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF TERRITORIAL, SOVEREIGNTY, AND \n      JURISDICTIONAL DISPUTES IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC MARITIME DOMAINS\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. Rubio, and Mr. Cardin) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 167\n\n       Whereas the maritime domain of the Asia-Pacific region \n     includes critical sea lines of communication and commerce \n     between the Pacific and Indian oceans;\n       Whereas the United States has a national interest in \n     freedom of navigation and overflight in the Asia-Pacific \n     maritime domains, as provided for by universally recognized \n     principles of international law;\n       Whereas the United States has a national interest in the \n     maintenance of peace and stability, open access by all to \n     maritime domains, respect for universally recognized \n     principles of international law, prosperity and economic \n     growth, and unimpeded lawful commerce;\n       Whereas the United States has a clear interest in \n     encouraging and supporting the nations of the region to work \n     collaboratively and diplomatically to resolve disputes \n     without coercion, without intimidation, without threats, and \n     without the use of force;\n       Whereas the South China Sea contains great natural \n     resources, and their stewardship and responsible use offers \n     immense potential benefit for generations to come;\n       Whereas, in recent years, there have been numerous \n     dangerous and destabilizing incidents in this region, \n     including Chinese vessels cutting the seismic survey cables \n     of a Vietnamese oil exploration ship in May 2011; Chinese \n     vessels barricading the entrance to the Scarborough Reef \n     lagoon in April 2012; China issuing an official map that \n     newly defines the contested ``nine-dash line'' as China's \n     national border; and, since May 8, 2013, Chinese naval and \n     marine surveillance ships maintaining a regular presence in \n     waters around the Second Thomas Shoal, located approximately \n     105 nautical miles northwest of the Philippine island of \n     Palawan;\n       Whereas the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \n     has promoted multilateral talks on disputed areas without \n     settling the issue of sovereignty, and in 2002 joined with \n     China in signing a Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in \n     the South China Sea that committed all parties to those \n     territorial disputes to ``reaffirm their respect for and \n     commitment to the freedom of navigation in and over flight \n     above the South China Sea as provided for by the universally \n     recognized principles of international law'' and to ``resolve \n     their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful \n     means, without resorting to the threat or use of force'';\n       Whereas Japan and Taiwan reached an agreement on April 10, \n     2013, to jointly share and administer the fishing resources \n     in their overlapping claimed exclusive economic zones in the \n     East China Sea, an important breakthrough after 17 years of \n     negotiations and a model for other such agreements;\n       Whereas other incidences of the joint administrations of \n     resources in disputed waters in the South China Sea have de-\n     escalated tensions and promoted economic development, such as \n     Malaysia and Brunei's 2009 agreement to partner on exploring \n     offshore Brunei waters, with drilling in offshore oil and gas \n     fields off Brunei beginning in 2011;\n\n[[Page S4063]]\n\n     and Thailand and Vietnam's agreement to jointly develop areas \n     of the Gulf of Thailand for gas exports, despite ongoing \n     territorial disputes;\n       Whereas the Government of the Republic of the Philippines \n     states that it ``has exhausted almost all political and \n     diplomatic avenues for a peaceful negotiated settlement of \n     its maritime dispute with China'' and in his statement of \n     January 23, 2013, Republic of Philippines Secretary of \n     Foreign Affairs Del Rosario stated that therefore ``the \n     Philippines has taken the step of bringing China before the \n     Arbitral Tribunal under Article 287 and Annex VII of the 1982 \n     Convention on the Law of the Sea in order to achieve a \n     peaceful and durable solution to the dispute'';\n       Whereas, in January 2013, a Chinese naval ship allegedly \n     fixed its weapons-targeting radar on Japanese vessels in the \n     vicinity of the Senkaku islands, and, on April 23, 2013, \n     eight Chinese marine surveillance ships entered the 12-\n     nautical-mile territorial zone off the Senkaku Islands, \n     further escalating regional tensions;\n       Whereas, on May 8, 2013, the Chinese Communist Party's main \n     newspaper, The People's Daily, published an article by \n     several Chinese scholars questioning Japan's sovereignty over \n     Okinawa, where key United States military installations are \n     located which contribute to preserving security and stability \n     in the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has recently taken other unilateral steps, including \n     declaring the Senkaku Islands a ``core interest'', \n     ``improperly drawing'' baselines around the Senkaku Islands \n     in September 2102, which the 2013 Annual Report to Congress \n     on Military and Security Developments Involving the People's \n     Republic of China found to be ``inconsistent with \n     international law'', and maintaining a continuous military \n     and paramilitary presence around the Senkaku Islands;\n       Whereas, although the United States does not take a \n     position on the ultimate sovereignty of the Senkaku Islands, \n     the United States Government acknowledges that they are under \n     the administration of Japan and opposes any unilateral \n     actions that would seek to undermine such administration, \n     affirms that the unilateral actions of a third party will not \n     affect the United States' acknowledgment of the \n     administration of Japan over the Senkaku Islands, remains \n     committed under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security \n     to respond to any armed attack in the territories under the \n     administration of Japan, and has urged all parties to take \n     steps to prevent incidents and manage disagreements through \n     peaceful means;\n       Whereas, on August 3, 2012, a Department of State \n     spokesperson expressed concern over ``China's upgrading of \n     the administrative level of Sansha City and the establishment \n     of a new military garrison there,'' encouraged ASEAN and \n     China ``to make meaningful progress toward finalizing a \n     comprehensive Code of Conduct,'' and called upon claimants to \n     ``explore every diplomatic or other peaceful avenue for \n     resolution, including the use of arbitration or other \n     international legal mechanisms as needed'';\n       Whereas the United States recognizes the importance of \n     strong, cohesive, and integrated regional institutions, \n     including the East Asia Summit (EAS), ASEAN, and the Asia-\n     Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, as foundation for \n     effective regional frameworks to promote peace and security \n     and economic growth, including in the maritime domain, and to \n     ensure that the Asia-Pacific community develops rules-based \n     regional norms which discourage coercion and the use of \n     force;\n       Whereas the United States welcomes the development of a \n     peaceful and prosperous China, the government of which \n     respects international norms, international laws, \n     international institutions, and international rules; enhances \n     security and peace; and seeks to advance a ``new model'' of \n     relations between the United States and China; and\n       Whereas ASEAN plays an important role, in partnership with \n     others in the regional and international community, in \n     addressing maritime security issues in the Asia-Pacific \n     region and into the Indian Ocean, including open access to \n     the maritime domain of Asia: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the use of coercion, threats, or force by \n     naval, maritime security, or fishing vessels and military or \n     civilian aircraft in the South China Sea and the East China \n     Sea to assert disputed maritime or territorial claims or \n     alter the status quo;\n       (2) strongly urges that all parties to maritime and \n     territorial disputes in the region exercise self-restraint in \n     the conduct of activities that would undermine stability or \n     complicate or escalate disputes, including refraining from \n     inhabiting presently uninhabited islands, reefs, shoals, and \n     other features and handle their differences in a constructive \n     manner;\n       (3) reaffirms the strong support of the United States for \n     the member states of ASEAN and the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China as they seek to develop a code of conduct \n     of parties in the South China Sea, and urges all countries to \n     substantively support ASEAN in its efforts in this regard;\n       (4) supports collaborative diplomatic processes by all \n     claimants in the South China Sea for resolving outstanding \n     maritime or territorial disputes, in a manner that maintains \n     peace and security, adheres to international law, and \n     protects unimpeded lawful commerce as well as freedom of \n     navigation and overflight, and including through \n     international arbitration, allowing parties to peacefully \n     settle claims and disputes using universally recognized \n     principles of international law;\n       (5) encourages the deepening of efforts by the United \n     States Government to develop partnerships with other \n     countries in the region for maritime domain awareness and \n     capacity building; and\n       (6) supports the continuation of operations by the United \n     States Armed Forces in the Western Pacific, including in \n     partnership with the armed forces of other countries in the \n     region, in support of freedom of navigation, the maintenance \n     of peace and stability, and respect for universally \n     recognized principles of international law, including the \n     peaceful resolution of issues of sovereignty and unimpeded \n     lawful commerce.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url":

Mr. President, we are looking at now and considering an \nimmigration bill. S. 744 is before us. This is a two-volume set \nconsisting of over 1,000 pages, and unfortunately it doesn't do what \nits sponsors say it does. It doesn't provide the security and other \nimportant items we want in an immigration reform bill, and therefore it \ncannot be passed in its present form and should not be passed in that \nform. It is just that simple.\n  This is a big, important issue. When we pass immigration reform, we \ndo not need to be back in the situation that occurred in 1986 when they \npassed immigration reform and promised to do enforcement in the future. \nWe gave the amnesty immediately, and the promises of enforcement never \noccurred. This is not a little matter. It has resulted in 11 million \npeople now being in our country illegally. This is a result directly of \nthe failure of the 1986 bill to carry out its enforcement promises, a \ndirect result of Presidents and Congress not insisting that happen.\n  So there is a general consensus even among the Gang of 8 that \nCongress and the President can't be trusted, and we need to have \nlegislation that somehow mandates that to happen because we have to \nhave--in their minds--the amnesty first. That is just the way it has to \nbe, and once that is given, well, we will promise to take care of it in \nthe future.\n  I have been discussing the two aspects of immigration that cause us \nto have the illegal immigrants. The first part is obvious--it is people \nwho cross the border illegally. At any number of our borders and ports, \nthey come in illegally, and that is a big part of our problem--\nactually, though, only 60 percent. Forty percent of the problem is the \npeople coming into our country legally on a visa. The others just come \nillegally. They have no right to enter the country; they just enter. \nThese have a right to enter the country. They come in on a visa and \nthey just don't go home. They just stay. And history tells them nothing \never happens. Nobody knows they didn't return home. Nobody clocks them \nout when they go home. Nobody knows they are here, and they just stay.\n  The President of the United States, through the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, has directed its ICE agents--Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement officers who are all over and around our country, although \nsmall in number, about 5,000--to basically not execute any deportation \nproceedings against anybody--almost none. They have to be convicted of \na big felony, a serious crime, and only then do they initiate \ndeportation.\n  We also have cities that are failing to support the Federal \nGovernment in any way. When they catch somebody for a crime in their \ncity and discover they are illegally in the country, they won't notify \nthe Federal Government they are there so they can come and pick them up \nand carry out the deportation that is required. This is the kind of sad \nstate we are in, and it certainly is a sad state indeed.\n  So the American people, by a 4-to-1 margin in a poll of just a few \ndays ago, said: We are prepared to be generous to people who entered \nthe country illegally and haven't gotten into trouble. We will be \ncompassionate to them. But we want to see the enforcement occur. By a \n4-to-1 margin, that poll showed that the American people said the \nenforcement should come first before we grant the legality--before we \ngive the amnesty. Now, isn't that good common sense?\n  As I go through the second part of my concern about this process, you \nwill see the ineffectiveness and unwillingness of the Federal \nGovernment to fulfill its role of ensuring that our sovereignty is \ndefended through the elimination of illegal immigration. And we can do \nthat. We can do it, but we are not doing it.\n  So the first part, dealing with the border, as I mentioned today, \nthey softened the current law.\n  Current law is you have to have 100 percent operational control at \nthe border. Under the standards they utilize there, this bill says 90 \npercent of border patrol encounters and otherwise reduces the \nenforceability and the enforcement standards of making sure our border \nis lawful.\n  I would just say, first and foremost, each one of these matters are \nexceedingly complex and must be done properly. As we talked about \nearlier, the crafting of legislation necessary to ensure that our \nborder is lawful requires a lot of work and a lot of different \nstrategies and capabilities for our men and women who are out there at \nrisk enforcing that law. That is the fundamental reason we should have \nlegislation that goes step by step. We should have a piece of \nlegislation that has been worked on very hard involving Immigration and \nBorder Patrol officers. That legislation should be brought forth and we \nwould pass it to fix the border.\n  Then, the second part, as I am talking about today, the entry-exit \nvisa situation where people enter the country lawfully according to a \nvisa but don't return to their home country, that has its own unique \nand complex systems that need to be dealt with, and that needs to be \ndone independently and separately. We need a separate and independent \nanalysis of how to deal with the workplace to ensure that people who \ncome into the country illegally don't get jobs in the future. We have \nto end this.\n  So I am taking the bill at its word. They want to give legal status \nto everybody who is here. So what do we do to try to ensure this \ndoesn't happen again in the future? We are not saying go out and try to \nfind everybody who is in the country illegally and capture and deport \nthem. That is not a practical solution at this point in our history. We \ndo need to figure out how to compassionately deal with those \nindividuals, but we don't need to be where we can't enforce the law in \nthe future so we have another amnesty upon us,\n\n[[Page S4065]]\n\nanother situation with millions of people here illegally because we \nfailed to do our duty.\n  The way we do the entry-exit visa has been determined by Congress for \na number of years. It is to use a biometric entry-exit visa system. So \nwe take fingerprints of everybody who comes to the country. They are \nclocked in when they enter the United States, and that fingerprint \nidentifies them as the person who has the visa. Then, when they leave, \nthey are supposed to clock out and use their fingerprint--which is the \nbest biometric proven system. You put maybe just two fingers on the \nreader as you go onto the airplane to fly out of the country and it \nreads it and sees if you are a terrorist or you are a criminal fleeing \nprosecution for a crime you may have committed in the United States. It \nis as simple and easy as can be, but for one reason or another this has \nbeen blocked.\n  The history of the biometric exit system is so instructive for us \nbecause it tells us how the Presidential and congressional authorities \nof America have failed to carry out what ought to be a universally \naccepted bipartisan plan to make our entry-exit visa system work right \nand reduce that 40 percent of illegal immigrants in our country who \ncome by visa.\n  In 1996, Congress first adopted a requirement for an entry-exit \nsystem to track those who were entering and leaving the United States \nin the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. The \nfirst time we passed it was in 1996. In 2000, Congress passed another \nlaw requiring the entry-exit system be electronic and to be implemented \nat all air, sea, and land ports of entry. That was 2000, 13 years ago.\n  Again in 2000, when amending the visa waiver program, Congress \nrequired a ``fully automated entry and exit control system'' to record \nentry and departure information for all aliens participating in the \nprogram. Congress also required that passports be machine readable.\n  After 9/11, a time of national introspection and study, Congress once \nagain demanded the implementation of an entry-exit system through the \npassage of the PATRIOT Act. The intent of Congress was made clear at \nthat time:\n\n       In light of the terrorist attacks perpetrated against the \n     United States on September 11, 2001, it is the sense of \n     Congress that the Attorney General, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of State, should fully implement the integrated \n     entry and exit data system for airports, seaports, and land \n     border ports of entry with all deliberate speed as \n     expeditiously as practical.\n\n  Congress demanded that the entry-exit system be biometric and based \non tamper-resistant machine readable documents. A biometric system \nrequires that an immigration document match the individual presenting \nthe document. In other words, there is a biometric capability to make \nsure the person who presents a document is the person named in the \ndocument. There are a variety of ways to make a document biometric, but \nthe most common is to use digital fingerprints which can easily be run \nthrough computer data bases to match records on file. This is done \nevery day.\n  According to the Department of Homeland Security's own Web site:\n\n       Unlike names and dates of birth which can be changed, \n     biometrics are unique and virtually impossible to forge. \n     Collecting biometrics helps the U.S. government prevent \n     people from using fraudulent documents to enter the country \n     illegally. Collecting biometrics also helps protect your \n     identity in the event your travel documents are lost or \n     stolen.\n\n  That is on the Web site today of Homeland Security, and it is \nabsolutely correct.\n  In 2002, Congress reiterated the demand for a biometric entry-exit \nsystem at all ports of entry, requiring Homeland Security issue aliens \n``only machine readable tamper-resistant visas and other travel and \nentry documents that use biometric identifiers.''\n  That was what we passed in 2002. It also required that the government \ninstall biometric readers and scanners ``at all ports of entry in the \nUnited States.''\n  Also, in 2002, the Department of Homeland Security initiated the US-\nVISIT system, which has great potential, and it has done some good \nthings, but it hasn't been completed. That system was to develop this \nentire process. Two years later, US-VISIT was collecting biometric data \non all aliens entering the United States. In 2004, Congress again \ndemanded a biometric entry-exit system through the passage of the \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. In that act, \nCongress said:\n\n       Congress finds that completing a biometric entry and exit \n     data system as expeditiously as possible is an essential \n     investment in the effort to protect the United States by \n     preventing the entry of terrorists.\n\n  It goes on:\n\n       The Secretary of Homeland Security shall develop a plan to \n     accelerate the full implementation of an automated biometric \n     entry and exit data system.\n\n  In 2007, now the 9/11 Commission comes back together again. They had \nissued a report with a whole lot of recommendations. They met to see \nhow many of their recommendations had been adopted. They reiterated the \nneed for an exit visa system and demanded that the exits apply to all \nforeign nationals entering under the visa waiver program and added a \nbiometric component. That was in 2007 when that was passed.\n  Congress is crystal clear and consistent that this is what we expect \nto be done. Has it been done? No. It has not yet been done. What about \nthis new immigration bill that has 1,000 pages in it and we are told is \nthe toughest in history? We are told--Senator Schumer said ``tough as \nnails.'' Does it require it? Will it ensure that it finally gets done? \nNo. Not only that, it alters the law. It says it doesn't have to be \ndone. It eliminates biometrics, and it eliminates land entry and exit \nsystems. So you do not have an exit visa system at anything but the \nairports under their plan, and it is not biometric. It actually weakens \ndramatically repeated law enactments of the Congress, so it is not \nstronger on the visa program, where 40 percent of the overstays come \nfrom. Forty percent of the people entering the country illegally come \nfrom visa overstays. It doesn't fix that. It weakens that law. I don't \nsee how my colleagues can come here and brag about this when, plain as \nday, that is what their bill does. I do not think the bill should be \nconsidered in this form.\n  The struggle continues. Get this. Last week the House, still \nfrustrated about this matter--Representative Barletta of Pennsylvania \ngot an amendment passed to prohibit funding for Department of Homeland \nSecurity parties and receptions until the biometric entry-exit system \nwas fully implemented as the 2004 law required.\n  What do we draw from this? We draw several things. One of them is \nthat the American people already get it. They don't trust Congress to \ndo anything they say. We pass laws and we go home and we say we fixed \nthe biometric bill, and it never happens. We passed six different laws \nrequiring it, and it doesn't happen. Then they say they are passing the \ntoughest bill that has ever been written about entry-exit visas and we \nare going to fix this problem and we recognize that 40 percent of the \npeople come through that way, and is it fixed? No. It undermines \ncurrent law. Current law is not being enforced, I acknowledge. They \njust surrender--give in.\n  This can be done. First of all, we need to go back. I think the \nfrustration of the American people with what is happening in this \nCongress is well-earned. They have a right to be unhappy. A recent \npoll, a poll not too long ago, showed this. It asked people: Are you \nmore frustrated or angry with people who enter the country illegally or \nthe government officials who have allowed it to happen? And 88 percent \nsaid they were mad at Congress and the government. The American people \nare not mad at people who want to come to the country illegally. They \nare frustrated and angry that their elected representatives, who year \nafter year, decade after decade, promised to fix this system, blithely \ngo about their business and never do it. They say one thing and they do \nanother. It is not right.\n  They say: You know, it just cannot be done. It is too hard. It is too \nexpensive. It slows down entry-exits. People just don't want to do \nthis, and that is why we just never got around to it.\n  We just discovered a report that never got any publicity, but I \ndidn't realize what was in it, that was published in 2011. It went to \nthe Appropriations Committee. They are not the immigration committee. \nIt sat around; nobody paid much attention to it.\n\n[[Page S4066]]\n\n  In 2009 the Department of Homeland Security conducted a pilot program \nat the Detroit and Atlanta airports to deal with what would happen if \nwe had an entry-exit biometric visa system at those two airports. They \nfound that a biometric exit system--we have the entry, remember--was \nnot only feasible but fast, accurate, and did not slow passengers as \nthey boarded the departing flights.\n  During 1 month of heavy international travel time, June and July, the \nbiometric exit system in Detroit processed 9,448 aliens and identified \n44 from the watch list and 60 suspected overstays--out of less than \n10,000 people. This is a terrorist watch list and a criminal watch \nlist. Some of these were arrested for violation of Federal law and had \nwarrants out for their arrest on nonterrorist charges. Some of them \nshowed up on watch lists, and 60 of them were suspected overstays. What \nabout Atlanta? They processed 20,296 aliens subject to US-VISIT and \nidentified 131 on the watch list and 90 overstays.\n  Since 9/11, at least 36 individuals who have overstayed their visas \nhave been convicted of terrorism-related charges. Thirty-six since the \n9/11 attacks have been arrested for terrorism charges. They were visa \noverstays, including Amine el-Khalifi, who attempted to bomb the \nCapitol last year; the Christmas Day bomb plot; and a near getaway by \nthe would-be Times Square bomber, Faisal Shahzad, who had already \nboarded a flight leaving the United States when he was arrested just \nbefore he could take off.\n  We are once again reminded that border security is an essential \nelement of national security, and exit control is part of that rubric. \nTamerlan Tsarneav, the Boston bomber--alleged--remained invisible to \nthe immigration system, having exited the country for a 6-month stay in \nRussia because today's biographic exit data was insufficient to \nidentify him as leaving the country--in this case, a misspelling or he \nused a different spelling and he was not picked up on the list, whereas \nif we had used his fingerprints, he would have been identified \nbiometrically instantly.\n  While S. 744 requires the use of software to correct misspellings, it \nmay not work for the millions of other names the software does not pick \nup. It will not pick up the fact that there is an arrest warrant for \nmurder out for him--let's say in Indianapolis--when he is getting on a \nplane in Boston, but it should get picked up if they use the entry-exit \nvisa. The individual would then successfully have fled the United \nStates and may be able to get away completely with a serious crime. The \nonly way to verify a person is who they claim to be really is through a \nbiometric identifier.\n  During the committee markup, I offered an amendment to require the \nimplementation of the biometric exit system as required by current law \nas part of the trigger to allow the Secretary to grant green cards to \nthose given amnesty. In other words, if she did not have that fixed and \nin place as current law required it, the amnesty in 10 years, the green \ncard, would not be issued.\n  A biometric air-sea exit solution is available right now, as it was \nin 2009. It requires no infrastructure changes to airports and can be \ndeployed immediately. Neither the TSA nor airlines need to be directly \ninvolved in this.\n  Also, in 2005, the biometric exit for vehicles and pedestrians at \nland ports was tested and found to be workable. To implement that \nsolution today would require less than was required during the 2005 \ntesting. We simply use the biometric data already in the system as well \nas the tamper-resistant card and expansion of the current Trusted \nTraveler Program in entry lanes to the exit lanes. If we do the entry, \nwe need to do the exit lanes.\n  Nevertheless, my amendment failed 12 to 6. So I guess Senator Schumer \nand the leaders of the Gang of 8 didn't give a path to the Republican \nmembers who might have voted for my bill. They had to stick together. \nSenator Schumer claimed such a system would cost $25 billion to \nimplement. Well, somebody had used that figure, and I had only then \ndiscovered this 2011 report of the exit system in Atlanta and Detroit--\nthis report right here. We just found out there was actually documented \nevidence that it doesn't cost anything like that much.\n  However, when we aggregate the 2008 U.S. visa impact analysis data \nand industry data, the greatest total cost for the first year of \ntechnology implementation at air and seaports would be approximately \n$172 million to $855 million, depending on collection and the units \nchosen. The most expensive units do not require an attendant to even be \nthere. Instead, there would be a monitoring attendant who can supervise \na number of mobile kiosks all at once.\n  In addition, in 2008, an air, sea, and biometric exit project \nregulatory impact analysis also noted that the air, sea, and biometric \nsystem was less costly than a biographic exit system for several \nreasons: improved detection of aliens overstaying visa, 300 ICE agents \nhave to do overstays now, and cost avoidance resulting from improved \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement efficiency; in 2007 cost removal \nper visa violator was $18,375 per individual; improved efficiency and \nprocessing of entry-exit data; and improved national security \nenvironment. Today the cost is significantly lower because the latest \ntechnology requires less manpower to operate and support the process. \nSo in an exit system, when a traveler comes through the airport, before \nthey board the plane, they go to a spot and for a few seconds--\naccording to this report there is negligible slowing down--they put \ntheir finger on it, it reads their fingerprint, and says, yes, indeed, \nthis person who entered the country has permission to leave. It then \nruns a check of terrorist and crime data to see if there is a warrant \nfor the person's arrest, and then moves right on to the plane. The \nreport found it took less than 2 seconds for a fingerprint capture. \nThat is amazing.\n  Of course, a lot of people don't know, but many police departments \nprovide police officers in their automobiles fingerprint reading data. \nSo they arrest somebody for DUI, they have them put their finger on the \nmachine, and bingo, it comes up they are wanted for rape. That is how \nfugitives are apprehended today. We do far less hunting them down by \nname. We wait for them to get picked up with some sort of check or \nother arrest. Mobile units do that.\n  These systems are now deployed internationally in nine countries and \n20 international airports, including Australia, and process over 700 \nmillion passengers per month. This can be done, and I am amazed and \nfrustrated it has not happened.\n  When Secretary Ridge was Homeland Security Secretary, we talked about \nthis. My experience in law enforcement was that the fingerprint had to \nbe the data because it is the fingerprint the police officers and the \nFBI use when they arrest somebody for a crime, and many people flee. \nMany of the people who flee like to leave the country.\n  The last thing he said when he left office: I have one bit of advice \nfor my successors, and that is use the fingerprint. After much effort \nand much debate and much conflict, he had distilled that down to that \nsimple decision. Frankly, we are almost there, and we should complete.\n  So in the committee markup, an amendment sponsored by Senator Hatch \nwas adopted that requires yet another pilot program limited to the 10 \nbusiest airports within 2 years, and the FAA designated 30 core \nairports over 6 years. The amendment, which does not serve as a trigger \nto amnesty or anything else, fails to require biometric exit at the \nland ports, which makes the system unenforceable and almost unusable \nbecause a person can fly in and they can exit from a land port. We need \nto record that or we won't know whether they ever left the country.\n  As Senator Grassley said at the time in the committee: In 1996, we \npassed an entry-exit system, and it is not law. So what I see before us \nis a fig leaf that leaves us to believe we are doing more than the bill \nrequires, but because the bill does a lot less than what we decided in \n1996 we needed to do, I think this amendment should be defeated. But it \nwasn't; it passed.\n  Finally, we were told that all of the triggers would have to be fully \nimplemented. If they are not fully implemented, there will be no green \ncards issued. This is one of the Gang of 8 selling and talking about \nthe bill. It had to be fully implemented--all the triggers--or there \nwould be no green card.\n  So let's take a look at what the bill actually says about that. The \nbill says\n\n[[Page S4067]]\n\nafter 10 years, the Secretary may adjust the status of those illegal \nimmigrants who receive amnesty to lawful, permanent resident or green \ncard status. So the Secretary can adjust the people who came here \nillegally from their temporary legal status to permanent resident of \nthe United States, or green card, and then be on a guaranteed pathway \nin 3 years to full citizenship. But that is supposed to only be done \nwhen? The Secretary certifies to Congress that her border security \nstrategy is substantially deployed, substantially operational, and that \nher fencing plans are implemented and substantially completed. These \nterms are undefined, leaving these determinations to the sole \ndiscretion of the Secretary, and she said we don't need anymore \nfencing. She gets to decide about fencing.\n  What is she required to do? Her fencing plan has to be initiated and \napproved, or her plan has to be implemented. But the plan doesn't have \nto call for a single foot of fencing.\n  Also, the green card status can be given when she has implemented the \nnew--this is important--employment verification system required under \nthe bill, which is for new employees, not current employees. They do an \nE-Verify system to check on something like that, and it is not \nmandatory for all employers until 5 years after the regulations are \npublished. So the employment effort is not effective for at least 5 \nyears after the amnesty has been provided, and it could take even \nlonger for it to become fully effective.\n  The real deadline for implementation of the employment, the E-Verify \nsuccessor system they would like to develop, may be as long as 10 \nyears. That is less than what the 2007 bill called for, the bill that \nfailed. In 2007 E-Verify was required for all new hires 18 months after \nthe enactment of the bill and for all current employees 3 years after \nthe enactment of the bill. So their plan for the E-Verify system is far \nweaker than the plan in 2007, and it suggests that by putting it off \nand not having current employees have to have it used for them that \nthey are not very serious about it.\n  Also, she is using an electronic but not biometric system exit system \nat air and sea but not land ports of entry. So another requirement for \na trigger is that there must be an end use and an electronic, not \nbiometric, exit system for air and seaports but not land. Experts have \ntold us if we don't do land, we never know when anybody has left the \ncountry.\n\n  Unfortunately, as are most seemingly tough provisions in this bill, \nit is followed by an exception that swallows the rule. The bill allows \nthe Secretary to grant green cards to those given amnesty without \nsatisfying these triggers if litigation or an act of God has prevented \none of the so-called triggers from being implemented, or implementation \nhas been held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, or the Court has \nsimply granted certiorari in a case challenging its constitutionality; \nand ten years have elapsed since the date of enactment. There are so \nmany loopholes in it, and so she can certify she has a plan. She can \ncertify that with expanding the system electronically but not \nbiometrically, in airports and seaports but not land ports, we end up \nwith what would appear to be a big improvement over current law, but it \nis not. Current law requires biometric in land, sea, and air. So this \nreduces that.\n  The bill undermines the ability to deport people who are in the \ncountry illegally. There are a whole lot of examples I could give at \nthis point, and I won't--not tonight, to the Chair's relief.\n  So, as in 1986, amnesty comes first. It will occur. The deportations \nwill stop, and it happens now. But the enforcement that is promised \nwill not happen in any effective way. That is clear. If we read the \nbill, we see there is not a real sense that anybody who knows anything \nabout enforcement was there in the room drafting the bill, driving the \nlegislation, to close loopholes and make this system enforceable in the \nfuture and end its brokenness today, end the illegality today, and put \nus on a path we can be proud of for our future. The bill does not fix \nillegality that dominates so much of our current system. It surrenders \nto illegality and does not stand up and fix it. This is not what the \ngood people of this country want for their future: another long period \nof illegal immigration and another inevitable amnesty.\n  We can fix the border. We can do that. We can fix our visa system. It \nis not that hard. We know how to do it now. We can fix and dramatically \nincrease the ability of employers to ensure they hire only legal \nworkers and not hire illegal workers, leaving Americans unemployed at \nrecord rates. We can establish a strong interior enforcement system, \none that has integrity and fairness. This bill is not close to that \ngoal. Even though we could do it, it fails to move us where we need to \ngo to put this system on a sound path. It should not become law.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/10/senate-section/article/S4067-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
