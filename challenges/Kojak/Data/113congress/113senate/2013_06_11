Today we welcome back Rabbi Moshe Feller, \ndirector at Upper Midwest Merkos-Lubavitch House in St. Paul, MN, who \nwill lead the Senate in prayer.\n  The guest Rabbi offered the following prayer:\n  By the grace of God, Almighty God, I invoke Your blessing today on \nthis august body, the U.S. Senate. In their divinely inspired wisdom, \nthe Founding Fathers of our blessed country, the United States of \nAmerica, established a policy of separation of church and state. \nHowever, it was never their intention to separate our country from You, \nsovereign ruler of all mankind. Hence, both legislative bodies of our \nblessed country begin their sessions invoking Your divine presence and \nguidance in their legislation. Hence, in our Pledge of Allegiance we \ndeclare ``one Nation under God,'' on our currency is printed ``In God \nWe Trust,'' and on the walls of this very Senate hall in which we \ninvoke Your blessing is engraved in bold letters ``In God We Trust.''\n  Grant, Almighty God, that the Senators realize that in legislating \njust laws they are fulfilling one of the seven commandments which You \nissued to Noah and his family after the great flood as related in the \nbook of Genesis and its sacred commentaries--the command that every \nsociety govern by just laws.\n  Almighty God, I beseech You today to bless the Senate in the merit of \none of the spiritual giants of our time and our Nation, the Lubavitcher \nRebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson of saintly blessed memory, who \npassed away 19 years ago today. The Rebbe labored with great love, \ndedication, and self-sacrifice to make all mankind aware of Your sacred \npresence.\n  May his memory be for a blessing and his merit be for a shield for \nour government and our Nation, which he always referred to as ``a \nnation of kindness.''

Mr. President, at any given time in our Nation's \nhistory, lawmakers have been faced with many pressing challenges. Some, \nby their very nature, demand immediate action. Others simply build over \ntime, so forcing action on them usually involves some combination of \nboth foresight and persuasion.\n  The great challenge of our own day, in my view, is figuring out how \nto reform government programs that are growing so big so fast that, \nunless we act, they will eventually consume the entire Federal budget. \nThis is an issue I have devoted a lot of time and energy to over the \nlast few years and that I had hoped the two parties could resolve in a \nway that would win the support of the public and the markets. As it \nturned out, the President wasn't as interested in that kind of an \nagreement as I was, so last year I reluctantly concluded we wouldn't be \nable to do anything significant about entitlements anytime soon. \nWithout Presidential leadership, something such as that is just simply \nimpossible. Hopefully, the\n\n[[Page S4070]]\n\nPresident will have a change of heart at some point on the most \nimportant issue of our time.\n  None of this means we can't try to do something about any of the \nother big issues we face, and that includes immigration. There may be \nsome who think our current immigration system is working, but I haven't \nmet them. I haven't met anybody who thinks the current immigration \nsystem is working. And as an elected leader in my party, it is my view \nthat at least we need to try to improve the situation that, as far as I \ncan tell, very few people believe is working well either for our own \ncitizens or for those around the world who aspire to become Americans.\n  Everyone knows the current system is broken. Our borders are not \nsecure. Those who come legally often stay illegally, and we don't know \nwho or where they are. Our immigration laws last changed almost three \ndecades ago, and they failed to take into account the needs of our \nrapidly changing economy. So what we are doing today is initiating a \ndebate.\n  We are all grateful for the hard work of the so-called Gang of 8, but \ntoday's vote isn't a final judgment on their product as much as it is a \nrecognition of the problem--a national problem--one that needs debate.\n  The Gang of 8 has done its work. Now it is time for the Gang of 100 \nto do its work--for the entire Senate to have its say on the issue and \nsee if we can improve the status quo.\n  At the risk of stating the obvious, the bill has serious flaws. I \nwill vote to debate it and for the opportunity to amend it, but in the \ndays ahead there will need to be major changes to this bill if it is \ngoing to become law. These include, but are not limited to, the areas \nof border security, government benefits, and taxes.\n  I am going to need more than an assurance from Secretary Napolitano, \nfor instance, that the border is secure to feel comfortable about the \nsituation down on the border. Too often, recently, we have been \nreminded that as government grows, it becomes less responsible to the \nAmerican people and fails to perform basic functions either through \nincompetence--incompetence--or willful disregard of the wishes of \nCongress. Our continued failure to secure major portions of the border \nnot only makes true immigration reform far more difficult, it presents \nan urgent threat to our national security.\n  Some have criticized this bill for its cost to taxpayers, and that is \na fair critique. Those who are here illegally shouldn't have their \nunlawful status rewarded--rewarded--with benefits and tax credits. So \nthe bill has some serious flaws, and we need to be serious about trying \nto fix them. The goal should be to make the status quo better, not \nworse, and that is what the next few weeks are about. They are about \ngiving the entire Senate, indeed the entire country, an opportunity to \nweigh in on this important debate to make their voices heard and to try \nto improve our immigration policy. What that means, of course, \nobviously, is an open amendment process.\n  Let me be clear. Doing nothing about the problem we all acknowledge \nisn't a solution. Doing nothing about the problem is not a solution, it \nis an avoidance strategy. The longer we wait to have this debate, as \ndifficult as it is, the harder it will be to solve the problem.\n  We tried to do something 6 years ago and didn't succeed. We may not \nsucceed this time either, but attempting to solve tough problems in a \nserious and deliberate manner is precisely what the Senate at its best \nshould be doing, and that is what we are going to try to do in this \ndebate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/11/senate-section/article/S4070-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UPHOLDING COMMITMENTS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it has now been 138 days since the \nSenate reached an agreement on the issue of whether we would violate \nthe rules to change the rules--138 days since we reached an agreement. \nIn that agreement, the Senate adopted two rules changes and two \nstanding orders, and the majority leader made an unequivocal \ncommitment, not contingent on his judgment of what was good behavior, \nbut the matter was settled for this Congress. In fact, 2 years before \nthat, he said it was settled for the next two Congresses.\n  So let's take a look at exactly what the majority leader's pledge \nwas. This was back in 2011 when the majority leader said:\n\n       I agree that the proper way to change Senate rules is \n     through the procedures established in those rules--\n\n  In those rules--\n\n     and I will oppose any effort in this Congress or the next--\n\n  The Congress we are in now--\n\n     to change the Senate's rules other than through the regular \n     order.\n\n  So the commitment on January 27, 2011, was not just for that Congress \nbut for the next one as well.\n  Then 2 years later, on January 24 of this year, I said in a colloquy \nwith the majority leader:\n\n       I would confirm with the majority leader that the Senate \n     would not consider other resolutions--\n\n  We had passed a couple of resolutions, a couple of rules changes, and \na couple of standing orders--\n\n     relating to any standing order or rules this Congress--\n\n  That is the Congress we are in right now--\n\n     unless they went through the regular order process?\n\n  The majority leader said:\n\n       That is correct. Any other resolutions related to Senate \n     procedure would be subject to a regular order process, \n     including consideration by the Rules Committee.\n\n  Now, the regular order for changing rules is that the Parliamentarian \nwould rule that it would take 67 votes to do that. But after these \ncommitments were made both in January of 2011 and in January of this \nyear, the majority leader has consistently repeated: In spite of what I \nsaid in January of each of the last 2 years, if Members are not on \ntheir best behavior, presumably, I will do this anyway.\n  So I mentioned to the majority leader publicly--privately for a long \ntime and then publicly over the last few weeks--that I intend to ask \nhim the question every day: Does he intend to keep his word?\n  That is critical around here. It is important for all Senators to \nkeep their word, but it is particularly important for the majority \nleader, who has the opportunity to be, shall I say, more important than \nthe rest of us because he gets to set the agenda and he gets to \ndetermine what the Senate will debate. He has the right of first \nrecognition and, as he repeatedly reminds me in these colloquies, he \nwill always have the last word. So I think the currency of the realm in \nthe Senate is one's word.\n  So those are my observations today and will be my observations \ntomorrow until we get this established because I think the atmosphere \nin which the Senate operates, with this threat of a nuclear option \nholding over it, is not conducive to the kind of collegial environment \nwe need in processing nominations and in processing legislation. We \nexpect the majority leader to keep his word.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is important that everyone keeps their \nword.\n  I am pleased the Republican leader acknowledged that the immigration \nsystem is broken and needs fixing, and we will have a full and open \ndebate on this over the next 3 weeks. That is very good. I am very glad \nto hear the Republican leader will vote to help us move forward on this \nlegislation.\n  For 15 years, James Courtney fought for this country as a Member of \nthe U.S. Army. He did that for a decade and a half.\n\n  For most of those 15 years, James' wife Sharon was at home in Las \nVegas fighting being deported. She has lived in America since she was a \nyoung teenager. She speaks fluent English. She has three sons with her \nhusband James, and he has been her husband for 13 years.\n  She has supported James through three tours of duty in Iraq where he \nwas wounded significantly, suffered brain injury, and because of his \nwounds had to retire medically from the military. But because she is in \nthe United States without the proper paperwork, she has lived with the \nfear that she, on any given day, would be deported back to Mexico and \nher family would be torn apart.\n\n[[Page S4071]]\n\n  Servicemembers and veterans of the U.S. military--and their family \nmembers who support them--deserve a better life than worry and fear.\n  In March, just a few weeks ago, James and Sharon came to Washington. \nThey came with hundreds of other immigrants who are concerned about \nbeing deported. They are concerned about immigration reform. They know \nthe system is broken and needs to be fixed. This is what James said:\n\n       I did what my country asked me to do. Now I'm asking my \n     country to keep us together for the sake of humanity and \n     freedom.\n\n  James spoke about keeping his three American children together with \nthe mother of those three children, his wife.\n  When I heard James and Sharon's story, I was recommitted to doing \nsomething to help them. And I did. Not only is Sharon a wonderful \nmother and wife, she is also caretaker to her disabled husband. Her \nfamily needs her.\n  Last month, James and Sharon learned that immigration officials have \ndeferred her status, her deportation. She is no longer in immediate \ndanger of being separated from her family.\n  See, Mr. President, she was a DREAMer, and that is who President \nObama stepped forward to help. In effect, what this did is it allowed \nher to stay and care for her husband and three children. Her children \nare 16, 11, and 8 years of age.\n  While I was happy to help James and Sharon, it is unfortunate that \nthey needed any help in the first place. When our servicemembers are \nfighting overseas, they should be focused on the difficult and \ndangerous job they face--not worried about their family members back \nhome.\n  Think about that. If she had been deported while he was overseas, \nwhat would the three boys do? Dad is overseas. They are Americans. They \nwere born here.\n  No veteran of the U.S. military should have to fight to keep his \nwife, the caretaker of his children, by his side. Her story is \ncompelling. Their story is compelling. But there are millions of \nstories just like it--stories of mothers and fathers terrified of being \ntorn away from their U.S. citizen children; stories of young men and \nwomen fearful of being deported from the only country they know, they \nhave ever called home; stories of families forced to live in the \nshadows despite coming to America in search of a brighter future.\n  There are 11 million reasons to pass commonsense immigration reform \nthat mends our broken system--11 million stories of fear of being \ndeported, fear of heartbreak, fear of suffering, and actual suffering \nthey have facing them every day worrying about if they can go to the \nstore, do they have to stay home. They certainly cannot travel. But for \nthis fine young woman, that has been taken away because of President \nObama.\n  These stories should motivate Congress to act. The bipartisan \nproposal before this body takes important steps to strengthen border \nsecurity. It is remarkable what we already have there. We have drones, \n700 miles of fencing. We have sensors. We have fixed-wing aircraft \nflying around with helicopters. We have 21,000 Border Patrol agents. \nBut if there are ways people believe we could do better on security \nthat is important, that is not just some reason to try to kill this \nlegislation, let's take a look at it.\n  I spoke this morning with the chairman of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Senator Carper. He has some ideas. He \nis preparing amendments. I like Senator Carper always. He is very \nthoughtful, and I am sure he will do something that he believes would \nimprove the situation on the border. He has gone, as a member of that \ncommittee and chairman of that committee, all over the southern part of \nthis country looking at what is happening on the border.\n  So the bipartisan proposal before the Senate takes important steps to \nstrengthen border security. It also makes crucial improvements to our \nbroken immigration system so families like James and Sharon's are never \nsubject to this kind of anguish again.\n  While this legislation is not an instant fix for families, it does \nprovide a pathway to earned citizenship. It does not put them at the \nfront of the line. It puts them at the back of the line. They have to \nstay out of trouble. They have to work, pay taxes, and focus on \nlearning English. That is what it is about.\n  Passing meaningful immigration reform will be good for our national \nsecurity, it will be good for the economy, it will be good for James \nand Sharon Courtney and millions of families just like them.\n  James is a veteran who sacrificed his time and his health to keep \nthis Nation safe from harm. He is now disabled. We can at least thank \nhim by keeping his family safe--and together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/11/senate-section/article/S4071-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n               Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, today, June 11, marks a public holiday in \nthe State of Hawaii, King Kamehameha Day, celebrated since 1872. We \nhold a statewide festival and mark the day with lei draping ceremonies, \nparades, hula competitions, and other festivities. It is a day to honor \nKamehameha the Great, who unified the Kingdom of Hawaii, and to \ncelebrate the rich culture and traditions of the Hawaiian people.\n  I chose this day to come to the Senate floor to talk about an issue \nof great importance to me and to the great State of Hawaii: Native \nHawaiian government reorganization. It was a top priority of my \nimmediate predecessors in this body, Senators Inouye and Akaka. For \nmore than three decades, they worked together in the Congress to \nadvance priorities important to Hawaii and to the Nation.\n  They made history at almost every step of their careers--securing \ndozens of firsts in the House and in the Senate. But for the indigenous \npeople of the United States, Senators Inouye and Akaka will be forever \nremembered for their work as members and then chairs of the Senate \nCommittee on Indian Affairs, and for their advocacy on behalf of \nAmerican Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians.\n  I want to acknowledge their legacy and to thank Senator Akaka for the \nrole he continues to play in our great State and in the Native Hawaiian \ncommunity in particular. Here is the reason I have chosen to carry \nforward this fight on behalf of Native Hawaiians: Simply stated, it is \nright to seek justice.\n  Native Hawaiians are the only federally recognized native people \nwithout a government-to-government relationship with the United States, \nand they deserve access to the prevailing Federal policy of self-\ndetermination. Opponents have argued that Native Hawaiians are not \n``Indians,'' as if the word applies to native people of a certain \nracial or ethnic heritage or is limited to indigenous people from one \npart of the United States but not another. This is misguided.\n  Our Constitution makes it clear. Our Founding Fathers understood that \nit was the tribal nations' sovereign authority that distinguished them \nfrom others. It was the fact that tribes were native groups with \ndistinct governments that predated our own that justified special \ntreatment in the Constitution and under Federal law.\n  In what is now the United States, European contact with native groups \nbegan in the 15th and 16th centuries on the east coast, and the 16th \nand 17th\n\n[[Page S4072]]\n\ncenturies on the west coast; while in Alaska and Hawaii, European \ncontact was delayed until the 18th century. Throughout the centuries, a \nmyriad of factors influenced how various native groups were treated.\n  The historical timeframe when policies and programs were applied to \nnative groups may have been different, but what was consistent \nthroughout were the Federal policies and actions intended to strip \nNative Americans of their languages, weaken traditional leadership and \nfamily structures, divide land bases, prohibit religious and cultural \npractices, and break communal bonds. These policies were as harmful and \nunjust to Native Hawaiians as they were to Alaska Natives and American \nIndians.\n  There was a thriving society that greeted Capt. James Cook when he \nlanded on the shores of Hawaii in 1778. Prior to their first contact \nwith Europeans, Native Hawaiians had a population of at least 300,000. \nThey were a highly organized, self-sufficient society, and they had \ntheir own rules, laws, language, and culture.\n  In his journals Captain Cook referred to the indigenous people of \nHawaii as ``Indians'' because it was the established English term in \nthe 18th century to describe native groups--regardless of their race, \nethnicity, or their governmental structure. But just like many Native \nAmericans and Alaska Natives on the continent, the name ``Native \nHawaiians,'' chosen in their own language, was ``Kanaka Maoli,'' ``The \nPeople.''\n  From 1826 until 1893, the United States recognized the independence \nof the Hawaiian Government as a distinct political entity. We extended \nfull and complete diplomatic recognition and entered into five treaties \nand conventions with the Hawaiian Monarchs to govern commerce and \nnavigation. These treaties are clear evidence that Native Hawaiians \nwere considered a separate and distinct nation more than a century \nafter contact.\n  But on January 17, 1893, the legitimate government of the Native \nHawaiian people was removed forcibly by agents and Armed Forces of the \nUnited States. The illegality of this action has been acknowledged in \ncontemporary as well as modern times by both the executive and \nlegislative branches of our Federal Government.\n  An investigation called for by President Cleveland produced a report \nby former Congressman James Blount. The report's findings were \nunambiguous: U.S. diplomatic and military representatives had abused \ntheir authority and were responsible for the change in the government. \nAs a result of these findings, the U.S. Minister to Hawaii was recalled \nfrom his diplomatic post, and the military commander of the U.S. Armed \nForces stationed in Hawaii was disciplined and forced to resign his \ncommission.\n  In a message to Congress in December 1893, President Cleveland \ndescribed the events that brought down the Hawaiian Government as an \n``act of war, committed with the participation of a diplomatic \nrepresentative of the United States and without authority of \nCongress.'' He acknowledged that ``by such acts, the government of a \npeaceful and friendly people was overthrown.'' President Cleveland \nconcluded that ``a substantial wrong has thus been done which a due \nregard for our national character--as well as the rights of the injured \npeople--requires we should endeavor to repair,'' and he called for the \nrestoration of the Hawaiian Monarchy.\n  The provisional government refused to relinquish power and in July of \n1894 declared itself to be the Republic of Hawaii. The provisional \ngovernment advocated annexation of Hawaii to the United States and \nbegan to lobby the Congress to pass a treaty of annexation.\n  Hawaii's Monarch at the time, Queen Liliuokalani, presented a \npetition to the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and \na formal statement of protest to the Secretary of State. The petition, \nsigned by more than 21,000 Hawaiian men and women, represented more \nthan half of the Hawaiian census population and was compiled in just 3 \nweeks. It also included the signatures of approximately 20,000 non-\nHawaiians who supported the return of the islands to self-governed \nrule. The ``Petition Against Annexation'' was a powerful tool in the \ndefeat of the annexation treaty.\n  In the next year, proponents of annexation introduced the Newlands \nJoint Resolution, a measure requiring only a simple majority. The \nannexation of Hawaii passed with the much reduced threshold of votes \nand was signed into law by President McKinley in July of 1898.\n  For almost two centuries after the founding of our Nation, Federal \npolicies of removal, relocation assimilation, and termination decimated \nNative communities and worsened the economic conditions for American \nIndians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians. The policy of banning \nnative language used in the schools was adopted by the Territory of \nHawaii. Native children were punished for speaking Hawaiian, just as \nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives were punished for using their own \nlanguages in school.\n  The policy of allotting parcels of land to individual Indians began \nin 1887 as a way to break up the reservations and communal lifestyles. \nIn 1906, it was expanded to Alaska Natives and in 1921 applied to \nNative Hawaiians. In an attempt to reverse the damage done by these \npolicies since the 1920s, Congress has established special Native \nHawaiian programs in education, employment, health care, and housing. \nCongress has extended to Native Hawaiians many of the same rights and \nprivileges accorded to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n  The Congress has consistently recognized Native Hawaiians as Native \npeoples of the United States on whose behalf it may exercise its power \nunder the Constitution. In 1993, the Congress passed and President \nClinton signed legislation known as the apology resolution, a formal \napology by the Congress. This legislation recognizes that the overthrow \nof the Hawaiian government resulted in the suppression of the inherent \nsovereignty of the Native Hawaiian people and the deprivation of the \nrights of Native Hawaiians to self-determination.\n  It has been 20 years since the passage of the apology resolution. But \nthe Federal Government has not yet acted to provide a process for \nreorganizing a Native Hawaiian governing entity. This inaction puts \nNative Hawaiians at a unique disadvantage. Of the three major groups of \nNative Americans in the United States: American Indians, Alaska Natives \nand Native Hawaiians, only Native Hawaiians currently lack the benefits \nof democratic self-government.\n  An extensive congressional legislative and oversight record created \nover the last two decades and dozens of congressional findings \ndelineated in Federal statutes establish these facts: Indigenous \nHawaiians, such as tribes on the continental United States, formed a \nNative community with their own government and this political entity \nexisted before the founding of the United States and Native Hawaiians \nshare historical and current bonds with their community. Similar to \ntribes in the continental United States, Native Hawaiians have certain \nland set aside for their benefit pursuant to acts of Congress, \nincluding 200,000 acres of Hawaiian Homes Commission Act land and share \nan interest in the income generated by 1.2 million acres of public \ntrust lands under the Hawaii Admission Act.\n  Although the Congress has passed more than 150 statutes to try to \naddress some of the negative effects of earlier Federal actions, data \nreveal persistent health, education, and income disparities. Native \nHawaiians experience disproportionately high rates of unemployment and \nincarceration, and Native Hawaiian children are overrepresented in the \njuvenile justice system. Hawaiian families rank last in the Nation in \naverage annual pay and face high rates of homelessness.\n  Separate is not equal. That is why I urge the Federal Government to \ntreat Native Hawaiians fairly. It is long past time for the Native \nHawaiian people to regain their right to self-governance. Two years \nago, the State of Hawaii passed a historic measure to explicitly \nacknowledge that Native Hawaiians are the only indigenous, aboriginal, \nmaoli population of Hawaii, and to establish a Native Hawaiian \nEnrollment Commission. My good friend and the former Governor of Hawaii \nJohn Waihee was appointed as chairman and is leading the effort to \nregister Native Hawaiians. This landmark effort is\n\n[[Page S4073]]\n\nwidely supported by the State of Hawaii, our congressional delegation, \nand our citizens.\n  I wish to acknowledge the commission, commend its vital work, and \nurge Native Hawaiians to take advantage of this opportunity to help \nreorganize a representational government. The actions and commitments \nof the State of Hawaii and the Enrollment Commission are crucial. But \nin order to reach our goal, we must all work together. That is why \ntoday, on King Kamehameha Day, I call upon all of us to join in the \nfight for justice for Native Hawaiians.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 12:30 p.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the \nproponents and opponents, with the Senator from Alabama Mr. Sessions \ncontrolling up to 1 hour.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield to Senator Cornyn such time as he would \nconsume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this afternoon we will have an important \nvote, some might say even historic vote, on the motion to proceed to \nthe immigration reform bill. I was here in 2007, the last time that \nsubject was on the floor of the Senate. It proved to be a divisive and \ntough issue that we could not get through.\n  But I think if there is one thing that I sense, in terms of my \nconstituents in Texas and sort of the impression I get generally \nspeaking, it is that the American people believe that the status quo on \nimmigration is unacceptable. Some of our colleagues have actually \ncalled the status quo de facto amnesty because essentially there is \nlawlessness in our broken immigration system. What we need to do is \nrestore law and order and predictability and make sure our immigration \nsystem works in the best interests of the United States. That is true \nin a number of ways that are included in the underlying bill as it was \nvoted out of the Judiciary Committee.\n  So I will vote yes on the motion to proceed because I think it is \nimportant we take up this debate. The majority leader has indicated we \nare going to be debating this and offering amendments over the next 3 \nweeks. I think that is a good period of time for the American people to \nunderstand what is in the bill and to listen to pro and con debates and \nto make up their mind how they want their elected representatives to \nproceed.\n  Yesterday I talked a little bit about an amendment I will offer to \nthe underlying bill which would ensure that the Federal Government \nfinally makes good on its promise--its perennial promise, but it is an \nunkept promise--to secure America's borders. This will not be any \nsurprise to the Presiding Officer or my colleagues that coming from a \nState such as Texas, with a 1,200-mile common border with Mexico, this \nis a subject near and dear to my heart and that of my constituents. It \nis something we need to get right.\n  The Democratic majority leader, in an interview with the press, \ncalled my amendment a poison pill. But I thought that was unusual and \neven curious because we had not shared the language of the amendment \nwith him or anyone else at the time he gave it that characterization. \nBut I believe the opposite is, in fact, true. If we do not guarantee \nresults on border security, if we do not guarantee to the American \npeople that we actually are going to get serious about stopping the \nflow of people illegally crossing our southwestern border or the \nnorthern border, for that matter, I think we guarantee the failure of \nbipartisan immigration reform.\n\n  That is the real poison pill, failing to solve the problem and \nguarantee the results that the American people deserve and I think \ndemand when it comes to dealing with our broken immigration system. If, \nin fact, by defeating sensible border security measures which guarantee \nimplementation of border security, if by denying that, bipartisan \nimmigration fails. Then the opponents of these sensible border security \nmeasures will have no one to blame but themselves, and that will prove \nto be the true poison pill.\n  For more than 25 years the American people have been told by \nWashington that it is actually serious about securing our borders. Of \ncourse, this became more urgent after 9/11 when we finally realized \nthat although we were removed from places such as the Middle East, \nEurope, and Asia, we were not insulated by virtue of our proximity or a \nlack of proximity to these places. So we learned we are not safe in \nAmerica just by ourselves; that we are vulnerable to attacks.\n  So this has given greater urgency to the importance of securing our \nborders and making sure we have a lawful immigration system that \nactually will work in the interests of the American people. We have \nalso heard since 1986, when Ronald Reagan signed the first amnesty for \n3 million people, it was premised on a promise of enforcement, and this \nwould never ever happen again. The American people justifiably feel \nthat the rug was pulled out from under them on that one when Congress \nand others undermined the enforcement measures that would made sure any \nfuture amnesties would no longer be required.\n  It is understandable and I believe justified for the American people \nto be skeptical about Congress when it makes promises without any means \nto implement guaranteed results. Back in 1996, Congress and President \nClinton authorized a nationwide biometric entry-exit system to reduce \nvisa overstays. Why is this important? Forty percent of illegal \nimmigration occurs when people enter the country legally as tourists, \nstudents or otherwise, and they simply overstay their visa because we \nhave not yet, in the 17 years since President Clinton and Congress \nauthorized, indeed demanded an entry-exit system--it still has not been \nimplemented.\n  In other words, the Federal Government has always said the right \nthings when it comes to reassuring the American people, but it has \nnever been able to translate those promises into results that are \nactually implemented. No wonder the American people are profoundly \nskeptical. Do not take my word for it. As of 2011, the Department of \nHomeland Security had achieved operational control of less than 45 \npercent of the United States-Mexico border. That is according to a GAO \nreport; 45 percent of the southwestern border with Mexico is \noperationally secure, in the opinion of the GAO. More recently, radar \nsurveillance by a new technology called VADAR was reported in the Los \nAngeles Times to have been successful in showing situational awareness \nalong the border where it was tested but that, in fact, the Border \nPatrol detained less than half of the people crossing the border.\n  That seems to be consistent with this idea of 45 percent operational \ncontrol, where less than half of the people crossing were actually \ndetained. A recent Council on Foreign Relations report showed similar \nsecurity results--or failures I should say. Members of the Gang of 8, \nwho I think have done the country a public service by bringing this \nmatter to us, believe our goal should be 100 percent situational \nawareness of the southern border and a 90-percent apprehension rate of \nillegal border crossers.\n  This may surprise my colleagues, but I actually agree with those \nmetrics and those standards: 100 percent situational awareness, 90 \npercent apprehension rate. Members of the Gang of 8 who brought us this \nlegislation also believe we should implement a national E-Verify system \nso employers do not have to play police, and they can get a card they \ncan swipe through a reader which will verify that a person who applies \nto work at their workplace is legally qualified to work in the United \nStates.\n  I think absolutely that is good requirement. I agree with the Gang of \n8's proposal. So I wonder why it is, why can they not take yes for an \nanswer? If we agree on the standards they set, why can we not agree on \nsensible measures that will guarantee the implementation and the \nsuccess of accomplishing the very goals they themselves have set?\n  The difference is simply that my amendment would require national E-\nVerify and a 90-percent apprehension rate and full situational \nawareness along the border, a biometric entry-exit system before \nimmigrants transition from the registered provisional immigrant \nstatus--we will hear a lot about RPI--to legal permanent residency. \nThis is the leverage Congress\n\n[[Page S4074]]\n\nand the American people have that will demand implementation of these \nsecurity measures at the border and elsewhere.\n  Meanwhile, while my results amendment would guarantee implementation \nof these provisions that have been long promised but never delivered by \nCongress, the Gang of 8 bill would authorize permanent legalization \nregardless of whether our borders are ultimately secured, according to \ntheir own standards. In fact, their bill requires only substantial \ncompletion of a plan whose contents we haven't even seen yet. This is \nsomething that is supposed to be proposed by the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, but we don't know what that plan is going to be. There is no \nlever. There is no means of forcing the Department to actually \nimplement it and to achieve the goal the Gang of 8 themselves have set.\n  My amendment contains a real border security trigger, while the Gang \nof 8 bill promises success but has absolutely no means to compel it. My \namendment demands results, while the Gang of 8 bill is satisfied with \njust more promises, promises that historically have never been kept.\n  I want to reiterate: We agree on a number of things. We agree on the \nobjectives for border security. We agree on the importance of worksite \nverification of the legal status of people who apply to work. That is \nan important part of immigration reform.\n  We agree on 100-percent situational awareness for our southwestern \nborder, and we agree that the Department of Homeland Security should \napprehend at least 90 percent of the people attempting to illegally \ncross the border. We agree on all of these realistic goals. The \ndifference, once again, is that my amendment guarantees results, while \nthe Gang of 8 proposal does not.\n  I will ask my colleagues who have done, as I said earlier, good work \nbringing this proposal to the floor why is it if we agree on the goals \nthat you would disagree on the means to enforce those goals? It makes \nno sense to me. We don't disagree about as much as I think some people \nmight suggest.\n  Another reason why I think this is not a poison pill is this is \ndoable. The Gang of 8 said it is doable. I agree it is doable, but we \nneed the leverage to compel the bureaucracy, Congress and everybody \nelse, to actually make sure the American people aren't fooled again and \nthe results that are part of the basic bargain contained in this bill \nare actually delivered.\n  Let me note a couple of other issues that I think need to be fixed in \nthe underlying bill. Where the Gang of 8 would actually make it harder \nto prevent visa overstays by changing existing law, laws that have been \non the books since 1986, my amendment has a border security trigger \nthat will require a fully operational biometric entry-exit program at \nall seaports and airports.\n  Where the Gang of 8 bill would allow some criminals with violent \nhistories to attain immediate legal status, my amendment would prohibit \nsuch criminals from gaining the benefits of RPI status or earn \ncitizenship. Why should we reward people who demonstrated their \ninability or unwillingness to comply with our criminal laws? Why should \nwe reward them with a pathway or a possibility of earning American \ncitizenship? These people ought to be disqualified. The hard-working \notherwise honest people who want to come here and seek a better life \nshould be granted the benefits of this bill while excluding violent \ncriminals.\n  Where the Gang of 8 bill would prevent law enforcement from sharing \ninformation, my amendment would give law enforcement access to critical \nintelligence about threats to national security and public safety.\n  One of the great failures of the 1986 immigration bill was that law \nenforcement was banned from gaining access to information in the \napplications of people who applied for amnesty that was clearly \nfraudulent, that would have reflected organized criminal activity and \nthat would have rooted it out. Unfortunately, this current bill, \nunderlying bill, contains the same prohibitions against information \nsharing that were contained in the 1986 bill, which unfortunately \nresulted in massive fraud and criminality. We need to stop that and \nlearn from the mistakes of the 1986 bill and not repeat that again. \nAdopting my amendment would address that.\n  Finally, where the Gang of 8 would do absolutely nothing to bolster \ninfrastructure and personnel at land ports of entry along the southern \nborder, my amendment would make sure resources are available to \nsignificantly reduce wait times, improve the infrastructure, and \nincrease the personnel at our land ports of entry.\n  This is important because this personnel and this infrastructure \nserve the dual purpose. No. 1, it makes sure legitimate trade in \ncommerce crosses our borders. Why is that important? Six million jobs \nin America depend on lawful cross-border trade. These people are dual \nuse. What I mean by that is they are also available to make sure \nillegal crossing doesn't occur and that drug dealers can't move bulk \ndrugs and other contraband across, and that human traffickers are \nstopped trying to exploit our land ports of entry.\n  One of the underlying premises of this approach is we need to \nseparate the legal and the beneficial from the illegal and the harmful. \nWhen we do that, we can let our law enforcement personnel focus on the \nillegal and the harmful, while allowing those who are complying with \nour laws and are engaging in beneficial commerce with America. This \ncreates jobs here in America and greater prosperity, and law \nenforcement won't have to spend or waste its time focusing on them so \nmuch.\n  I don't know how any objective observer could look at my amendment \nand call it a poison pill. I think it is a mistake, again, because at \nthe time the majority leader called it that, we hadn't even released \nthe legislative language. I hope he and others will look at it \ncarefully and work with us, because I think there is actually a path \nforward to bipartisan immigration reform that will secure our borders, \neliminate the criminality in our system, and provide a legal means for \nAmerica to be true to its values. It will look to its own economic \nself-interest in providing a pathway for legal immigration from the \nbest and brightest, whom we ought to welcome with open arms.\n  I don't know how any objective observer could look at my amendment \nand call it a poison pill, especially because it embraces so many of \nthe metrics included in the underlying Gang of 8 bill. All my amendment \ndoes is to guarantee results, rather than be satisfied with more \npromises that will never be kept.\n  This is the bottom line. Americans are tired of hearing endless \nborder security promises without seeing any realistic mechanism for \nguaranteeing results. My amendment would guarantee such a mechanism, \nand it would guarantee the results Washington has long promised but \nnever delivered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the bill that will \nsoon be before us, a bill to allow us a once-in-a-generation \nopportunity to tackle the complex challenges facing us in comprehensive \nimmigration reform.\n  Immigrants have always played a central role in America's history, in \nour economy, in our culture, in our success as a Nation. Their \nimportance cannot be overstated, but the system that makes it possible \nfor immigrants to come here and contribute to that role is clearly in \nneed of fundamental repair. America's immigration system today is badly \nout of sync with our values, and I believe it is up to us in the \ncurrent Congress to fix it.\n  The earnest work of the group of eight Senators, the so-called Gang \nof 8, has given us, in my view, a once-in-a-generation opportunity that \nwe must embrace. We cannot squander this moment and allow partisan \npolitics, fearmongering, and mischaracterization of the underlying bill \nto get in the way of what we must accomplish in order to mend the rich \nfabric of our country and create a predictable pathway for legal \nimmigration going forward.\n  I rise today to reflect on this historic opportunity to pass a \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill that will make our country \nstronger, safer, and more vibrant for generations to come.\n  The legislation soon to be before this Chamber has earned such strong \nsupport in large part because it started as a bipartisan effort with \nSenators from\n\n[[Page S4075]]\n\nboth sides of the aisle and different regions of the country drawing \nupon their own years of experience to produce a first draft. It \nconfronted a wide array of problems with our badly broken current \nimmigration system. It wasn't perfect, but it was a strong start, and I \nam extraordinarily grateful to the group of these eight Senators who \nput so much time and effort into laying that groundwork.\n  In the Judiciary Committee, Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member \nGrassley then led a markup, probably the first in my nearly 3 years \nhere as a Senator, a full, robust, and historically open markup that \nachieved its goal of making the bill that comes before us stronger. \nThey led an open and transparent process. They posted every proposed \namendment online before the markup began so that each one could be \nthoughtfully considered by Senators, their staffs, and outside groups \nconcerned about the bill.\n  The markup lasted 5 full days across 3 weeks, during which each \nSenator was permitted an unlimited opportunity to speak and offer \namendments. This is the regular order of which so many more seasoned \nSenators speak with fondness, something more characteristic of the \nSenate's past than its present.\n  It led ultimately in the Judiciary Committee to 37 hours of markup \ndebate. A great many of the amendments offered were accepted, \nDemocratic amendments and Republican amendments. More than 300 \namendments were filed. More than 200 amendments, if you consider first \nand second degree, were taken up, considered, and disposed of. More \nthan 100 were offered by Democrats and Republicans. Ultimately, 136 of \nthese amendments were adopted, all but 3 on a bipartisan basis. The \nbill was, as you know, ultimately reported out of committee with a \nhealthy bipartisan vote of 13 to 5.\n  I am a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I too like all of my \ncolleagues proposed amendments, studied my colleagues' amendments, \ndebated those amendments, and ultimately I voted for this bill. I am \nproud of what the committee has accomplished.\n  I am proud that the bill is coming before us today, and it is \nstronger than the original bill, exactly because of the hard work done \nby the Judiciary Committee and the great leadership of our chairman, \nSenator Patrick Leahy of Vermont. It is stronger on border security. It \nis stronger when it comes to efficiency and using taxpayer dollars \nwell, and it is stronger when it comes to fundamental fairness.\n  First, on border security, even the first draft of this bill offered \nby the bipartisan Gang of 8 contained historic levels of investment in \nimproving border security. The bill's provisions to require control \nover the southern border and to mandate employment verification \nnationwide were already groundbreaking before the markup in the \nJudiciary Committee began.\n  Still, amendments were adopted in committee that strengthened these \nmeasures even further. Despite the protestations of some that this was \na partisan or a lopsided markup, let me briefly detail some that were \nadopted that I think strengthened this provision of the bill.\n  Senator Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the ranking member, offered an \namendment that expands the bill's border security goals and metrics to \ncover the entire southern border, so that all border communities will \nbenefit from the enhanced security investments made by the bill, not \njust those that are considered high risk.\n  Senator Hatch, Republican from Utah, offered an amendment that will \nmandate biometric exit processing at airports, beginning at the 10 \nlargest international airports in the United States and soon thereafter \n20 additional airports.\n  The committee also adopted amendments to strengthen background \nrequirements in the bill.\n  An amendment by Senator Flake of Arizona required those in RPI status \nto undergo additional security screenings when they apply to renew \ntheir status.\n  An amendment offered by Senator Graham requires additional national \nsecurity screening for applicants from countries or regions that pose a \nnational security threat to the United States or that harbor groups \ndeemed to pose a national security threat.\n  Some in this Chamber have claimed this bill does not do enough to \nstrengthen the security of our borders. That is simply and clearly not \nthe case. This bill will make our country safer, and I believe it will \nmake our country stronger.\n  In terms of efficiency, something we talk about a great deal in the \nbudget climate today, the amendments considered during markup also \nresulted in substantive changes to the efficiency of our immigration \nsystem and to the implementation of the changes demanded by this bill. \nAlready the bill as drafted makes important steps to clear the long \nbacklogs of immigrants waiting for green cards who already have been \napproved by the Department of Homeland Security. Removing the \nsenseless, current, per-country caps is one part of the solution I am \nproud to see in this bill.\n  One of my adopted amendments will streamline, for example, discovery \nprocedures in immigration court to cut down on the needless cost of \nresponding to each and every discovery request currently done through \nthe less efficient Freedom of Information Act rather than a discovery \nprocess more typical in court proceedings.\n  Senator Grassley offered amendments that required audits of the \ncomprehensive immigration reform trust fund established by the bill and \nof all entities that receive grants under this bill. These amendments \nwill ensure the significant cost of enhanced border security is spent \nefficiently and appropriately.\n  Senators Leahy and Cornyn offered an amendment that gives the \nDepartment of Homeland Security flexibility with respect to the fence \nstrategy fund to leverage the best technology at our disposal to \nachieve that task. The amendment also requires consultation with \nrelevant stakeholders and respect for State and local laws in the \nimplementation of fencing projects.\n  Democrats and Republicans, coming together, working together, made \nthis bill stronger. We did it in the Judiciary Committee, and we can do \nit here on the floor of the Senate.\n  Last, America's immigration system should reflect America's \nfundamental values, and right now, in my view, it clearly does not.\n  This bill does make our immigration detention and court systems \nfairer and more humane, but it does not fix all of the unfairness in \nour current system. Indeed, there are some painful sacrifices we have \nhad to make in this bill, especially when it comes to families being \nunited, families with their siblings, or the recognition of mixed-\nstatus LGBT families in our country who receive no Federal protection \nunder this bill. But the Judiciary Committee did make progress in \nmaking the bill fairer on some fronts.\n  An amendment from Senator Blumenthal will allow DREAMers serving in \nthe U.S. military to apply for citizenship on the same terms as those \nunder current law.\n  The committee also adopted an amendment that I cosponsored with \nSenator Lee to ensure individuals are notified when their name receives \na nonconfirmation determination or further action notice in the E-\nVerify system--a protection for vital privacy concerns.\n  Two of Senator Franken's amendments will make the E-Verify system \nfairer for small businesses by ensuring they won't be penalized \nexcessively for innocent noncompliance. They will also provide \nincentives to keep the error rate as low as possible.\n  What we have now before us is a bill that has been thoroughly vetted, \nsubstantially amended, and supported by the broadest coalition ever \nbefore seen in comprehensive immigration reform efforts.\n  This bill strengthens border security.\n  This bill creates a path to legal status and strikes the right \nbalance to encourage those here who are undocumented to come out of the \nshadows, comply with law, pay a fine, pay taxes, and become full \nparticipants in our national society and restore the primacy of the \nrule of law.\n  This bill makes advancements in worker protection. Through enhanced \nemployment verification, we strike at one of the most pervasive \nproblems for American labor: the widespread hiring of undocumented \nlabor at substandard wages and working conditions.\n  This bill will have immediate and significant benefits for our \neconomy. We should always remember that immigration has been and will \ncontinue\n\n[[Page S4076]]\n\nto be a real boom, a lifeblood to our Nation's economy along all points \nof the labor spectrum. In addition to bringing millions out of the \nshadows and welcoming them as full participants in our society and \neconomy, this bill will go a long way toward fixing our current \nbackward-looking policies toward high-skilled immigrants who want to \nremain in the United States after receiving their advanced education.\n  In conclusion, I am proud of what this bill means for our country and \nwhat it has shown about our ability in the Senate to work together to \nadvance meaningful changes to improve our Nation. There are no perfect \nlaws, but considering just how broken our immigration system is now, it \nis unquestionably a giant leap forward. I am confident that if we can \ncontinue to work together on the floor here as we did in the Judiciary \nCommittee, we will be able to find more common ground and continue to \nstrengthen this bill in the upcoming weeks. We can make the most of \nthis historic opportunity and finally build a modern immigration system \nthat reflects America's values and makes our country strong.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that time during the quorum \ncall be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have before us a 1,000-page bill that \nis extremely difficult to read and to understand. We are being asked to \nvote on it, and Majority Leader Reid indicated that he wants a list of \namendments, and presumably no more would be agreed to, and he is going \nto pick and choose which ones he would approve by the end of this week. \nI believe that is very premature. I do not believe that is the way we \nshould be proceeding. We have to have the time to sufficiently analyze \nall the complexities that are here.\n  I have to say to my gang members who produced this bill, this tome, \nthat you spent months working on it with special interest groups and \nlawyers and the Obama administration's staff, and you produced a bill, \nand now we have to rush it through the Senate, and I don't think that \nis the right thing to do.\n  Let me read from one of the sections in the bill. And I hope my \ncolleagues know that if they begin to read the bill, they will know how \nhard it is. This is not an easy bill to read. You have to study it, and \nyou have to have lawyers reading it, and you have to find out what the \nexceptions are and what the limitations are and what the additions are. \nThe lawyers who wrote it know. The Gang of 8 doesn't know, I assure \nyou. They don't know all the details that are in this legislation. It \nis not possible for them to do so. The people who are writing it--the \nspecial interest groups, union groups, business groups, ag business \ngroups, meat packers group, LaRaza, immigration lawyers association--\nall of them were working on it. They know what the impacts are.\n  But how about this section right here from the guest worker section. \nThis is subparagraph (B), Numerical Limitation. This apparently has to \ndo with the number of people who would be admitted: Subject to \nsubparagraph (D), the number of registered positions that may be \napproved by the Secretary for a year after the fourth year referred to \nin paragraph (1)(A)(iv) shall be the equal of--get this--subparagraph \n(i), the number of such registered positions available under this \nparagraph for the proceeding year, and, subparagraph (ii), the product \nof subparagraph (I), the number of such registered positions available \nunder this paragraph for the preceding year, multiplied by subparagraph \n(II), the index for the current year calculated under subparagraph (C).\n  Do you think that is easy to understand? But it has meaning, and what \nit basically means is that this bill is going to allow more workers to \ncome into this country than we have ever allowed before at a time when \nunemployment is extraordinarily high, our ability to reduce \nunemployment is down, wages are down, and our workers are falling below \nthe inflation rate in their wages for years.\n  How about the second paragraph? Now, I am just reading this. So we \nare going to rush this through? Really?\n  Subparagraph (C), Index: The index calculated under this subparagraph \nfor a current year equals the sum of subparagraph (i), one-fifth of a \nfraction, subparagraph (I), the numerator of which is the number of \nregistered positions that registered employers apply to have approved \nunder subsection (e)(1) for the preceding year minus the number of \nregistered positions approved under subsection (e) for the preceding \nyear and, subparagraph (II), the denominator of which is the number of \nregistered positions approved under subsection (e) for the preceding \nyear.\n  I am sure we all got that. I am sure we know exactly what that means.\n  And it goes on: Subparagraph (iii), three-tenths of a fraction, \nsubparagraph (I), the numerator of which is the number of unemployed \nU.S. workers for the preceding year minus the number of unemployed U.S. \nworkers for the current year and, subparagraph (II), the denominator of \nwhich is the number of unemployed U.S. workers for the preceding year.\n  And then it goes on: Subparagraph (iv), three-tenths of a fraction.\n  It goes on.\n  Somebody knows what that means because you had special interests in \ncharge of writing this big monstrosity. They were there. They wanted \ntheir deal.\n  I would say to my colleagues and to those in the Gang of 8--and I \nknow they want to do the right thing and have worked hard, but they got \noff on the wrong track.\n  The papers reported for weeks: Well, the unions are here and the \nchamber of commerce is here and the ag workers and ag industry people \nare here, and they want more workers for this, and this one is \ndemanding more workers for that. And our Senators are over here somehow \nletting them all hammer it out, and that is how this writing comes up. \nIt came from them. The Senators didn't write this.\n  They knew exactly what they were doing. They were putting in numbers \nto get certain workers that businesses wanted so they can have more \nemployees and they can keep wages down. That is what the scheme was--\nmore workers, less competition for labor, loose labor market, fewer pay \nraises, less overtime, fewer benefits because the employer has options.\n  Remember, these are guest workers. These are not people on a \ncitizenship path. They are not here to form corporations and hire \nmillions of people and cure cancer. These are workers who come in and \nwork for existing corporations. I would emphasize that some thought \nneeds to be given to that. We haven't talked about that yet. We are \ngoing to talk about it.\n  This large of an increase in immigration into our country has real \nimpact, and a lot of the numbers and a lot of the data that is out \nthere has not been challenged, and the data indicates that we are \nalready at a point where the flow of immigrant labor into America is \ndepressing wages, and it is a big factor in the cause of workers' wages \ntoday being 8 percent, in real terms, below what they were in 1999. \nWages haven't been going up. Democrats used to talk about it. They used \nto hammer President Bush on it all the time. Now that Barack Obama has \nbeen in office for 5 years, you don't hear them talking about it \nanymore. Well, Senator Sanders talked about it on the floor last week. \nI give him credit for that. Of course, he is an Independent. But I \nhaven't heard my Democratic colleagues continue to repeat the fact that \nsteadily we are seeing a decline in wage rates in America, making it \nharder for middle-class Americans to get by--and what about even \nfinding a job?\n  So it is not a small matter. We are going to have to talk about this. \nWe don't need to rush this through. It seems quite clear--crystal \nclear--to me that the Gang of 8 never discussed this. They certainly \ndidn't call Professor Borjas at Harvard. Dr. Borjas is the leading \nexpert on immigration and labor and the impact of it in America. He has \nwritten books on it. I believe his study says that a 40-percent fall in\n\n[[Page S4077]]\n\nwages for American citizens is attributable to the current flow of \nimmigrant labor into America. It pulls down wages. It is free market. \nIf you bring more cotton into America, the price of cotton falls. If \nyou bring in more labor, the price of labor falls. That is the way the \nmarket forces work. He said this is a factor right now. But we need to \nunderstand that if 15 million people are legalized virtually \nimmediately and the guest worker program appears to double the number \nof people who will come in and the immigrant flow, permanent immigrant \nflow of people who want to become citizens will increase 50 percent, \nthen we will have one of the largest increases in flow of labor to \nAmerica we have ever seen, and we cannot get jobs with decent pay for \nAmerican workers right now.\n\n  That is real out there. People are worried about their families. They \nare worried about their children's ability to get a job. They are \nworried about their grandchildren's ability to get a job. They are \nabout to graduate from high school. They don't have a college degree. \nMaybe they don't plan to go to college. They are willing to work. Jobs \nare not that plentiful. Did you see the article, in Philadelphia, I \nbelieve it was, that they said they had job openings to try to help \npeople who have had a criminal conviction in their background. They \nexpected 1,000 people and 3,000 showed up. They had to cancel it and \nreset the whole deal because they interviewed people who said you \ncannot find a job in Philadelphia.\n  In New York, one of the boroughs of New York, there was a very \ninteresting article just 2 weeks ago about job openings for elevator \nmechanics. People waited 5 days--they took tents out--to stay in line \nto try to get those jobs. The number of people waiting in line was 20 \ntimes the number of jobs that were out there or more. So we are going \nto reward people who entered the country illegally? We have to \nunderstand in this bill right here, if the bill is passed, the people \nwho have come here--many are in the shadows and that is correct and \nthat is a sad thing and it is a difficult thing--but those individuals \nalso will be able to go apply for the elevator mechanic job. They will \nalso be able to compete for employment in Philadelphia, where right now \nthey might not be so able to contribute. It raises real questions.\n  I wish to mention this. This is from this Saturday from the \nWashington Post. You heard that there are good job numbers, right? The \njob numbers were not so great it appears to me: 175,000 jobs were \ncreated last month, according to the Washington Post, based on new \ngovernment data that was released Friday. The Labor Department said \nunemployment went up from 7.5 to 7.6, so the unemployment rate went up, \neven though the number of jobs was 175,000 created. What I wish to \npoint out is this fact that is in the report:\n\n       The bulk of the gains in May were in the service industry, \n     which added 57,000 jobs. Still, about half of those were \n     temporary positions--\n\n  Those were temporary, not real jobs. I continue--\n\n     suggesting that businesses remained uncertain of consumer \n     demand.\n       Missing from the picture were production jobs in industries \n     such as construction and manufacturing.\n\n  Those were not the kind of jobs being created.\n\n       Meanwhile, manufacturing shed 8,000 workers.\n\n  American manufacturers reduced employment last month and those are \nthe better jobs with the retirement pay and with health benefits that \ncome with a good manufacturing company. We are creating more and more \ncompetition for lower wage jobs. The article goes on to say this in \naddition:\n\n       Some economists have raised concerns about the types of \n     jobs being created. Sectors such as retail, restaurants, bars \n     have been adding plenty of jobs, but those positions tend to \n     pay low wages. Friday's report showed workers' average hourly \n     earnings rose only a penny in May, to $23.89. For the entire \n     year, wages have risen 2 percent.\n\n  Again, that is below the inflation rate. Again, we continue to have \nthis situation in which wages trail inflation, which means the average \nAmerican is having a hard time getting by and many of these jobs are \npart-time, not permanent. They are the kind of jobs a lot of people \nwould look to advance from, whether working in a restaurant or \nsomething such as that. They will be looking to move forward. The kind \nof manufacturing jobs we would like to see more of are not there.\n  I mentioned the work visas in this process. Despite a huge increase \nin the numbers of those who are going to be legalized and put on a path \nto permanent residence and citizenship, we have a large number of \npeople in this total number. For example, under the bill, it is widely \nconceded that we would legalize 11 million people. They would be put on \na path to legal permanent residence and into citizenship, 11 million, \nall of whom entered the country illegally and are here in violation of \nthe law.\n  What is not mentioned is that there is another 4.5 million who are \nin--they call it a backlogged status. They are basically chain \nmigration members, family members who want to come, but under our \ncurrent law we have a cap, a limit on how many family members are \nallowed to enter each year. As a result, the backlog, they call it, has \nmoved up to 4.5 million. So now we have people say this. They have been \nsaying we should not give the 11 million here illegally advantage over \npeople waiting in line. That was a problem for the Gang of 8. I can see \nthem sitting around, dealing with that. How can we give somebody here, \nwaiting in line patiently and lawfully, status behind that of someone \nwho has been here working in the country with false documents, \nillegally? That wouldn't be right.\n  How did they solve that? As Washington does, they legalize them too. \nYou say 4.5 million are waiting? They just let them come in too. We \nwill be initially processing 15 million people. Then what about the \nannual future flow? Now it is the most generous flow in the world. We \nadmit a little over 1 million people a year under our legal flow into \nthe country. What about that? In light of all this accelerated \nadmissions and legal status, should we reduce the number of people who \nare coming here each year lawfully now for a while? Oh, no, that is \nincreased--50 percent, according to the Los Angeles Times. It could be \nmore. I will accept that number. So instead of 1 million a year, that \nis 1.5 million. Over 10 years, that is 15 million. That results in 30 \nmillion people in 10 years being given lawful permanent status in \nAmerica.\n  Already that is 10 percent of the entire population of America, and \noverwhelmingly this group is low skilled. Over half of the people here \nillegally do not have a high school diploma from their own home country \nand they are not able to take the better jobs. They will be competing \nfor the lower wage jobs in America. If they are legalized, legal \nimmigrants who entered the country a few years ago, they are going to \nfind--maybe they were legalized in 1986, maybe they have come legally \nsince, but that immigrant population is going to find their wages \npulled down by this large amount of flow of labor into the country. I \ndo not think there is any doubt about that. We will go more into detail \nabout that as we go forward, but we are talking about 30 million being \ngiven legal status on a path to permanent legal residence and \ncitizenship over the next 10 years.\n\n  They will be given that status. We have not discussed that.\n  I asked Senator Schumer at the committee twice: How many will be \nadmitted under your bill? He refused to answer. I am not sure they know \nbecause these numbers are not all the numbers. There is an additional \ngroup of people who will come under the chain migration theory, the \nfamily-based connection and other special provisions in here that have \nno caps, no limits on how many would come. He refused to answer. The \nsponsors who are producing legislation for us today will not say how \nmany people they expect to enter into our country if their bill passes. \nWhy not? You don't know or you will not say? Either one is an \nindictment of this monstrosity and that is why it cannot pass.\n  Even Senator Rubio is now saying he can't vote for the bill unless it \nis improved. He was in the Gang of 8. This is legislation that is \nflawed legislation, fatally flawed, and it should not become law--it \njust should not. They said a lot of good things about what they expect \nthe bill to do. If it did those things, we would be more interested in \nit. We would have a framework for a bill that could actually do some \ngood. I would say that for sure.\n\n[[Page S4078]]\n\n  As we go forward, we need to ascertain with absolute clarity what the \nbest economic data shows about how many people this country can absorb \nin a reasonable way and be able to provide a decent place for them to \nwork without pulling down the wages of an already-stressed American \nworkforce. We need to talk about that. So far as I can tell, that was \nnever discussed in the groups. What was discussed pretty much in the \ngroups, it seemed to me, was businesses demanding more workers, La Raza \ndemanding more people and basically open borders and they were the ones \nwriting the legislation, in large part. There were some union \nobjections to some of this. It needs to be listened to.\n  Republicans say that is a union objection. If they make a good \nobjection, so be it. I think they made some points but went along with \nthis in a way that is not effective.\n  We have to talk about the economic impact of it and we will. We need \nto ascertain the second aspect: The 30 million people I just mentioned, \nthose 30 million are people who come permanently. They are on a path \nnever to return to their country. They have a legal status that allows \nthem to get legal permanent residence and then get citizenship.\n  Normally, as I say, we do 1 million a year, which would be 10 million \nover 10 years. This will increase it to 15 million over 10 years, and \nthat does not count the 11 million, plus the 4.5 million who will be \ngiven legal status. It is pretty clear to me it is indisputable that we \nwill have 30 million people put on the path to citizenship in the \nUnited States of America, and I ask my colleague, if they have a \ndifferent number, they should share it with us. Maybe in these bills, \nsubparagraphs, numerators and denominators and fractions and all, they \nhave a different number. I would like to hear it. We think we figured \nit out. The Los Angeles Times agrees. The only analysis I have seen \nagrees with it, as best we can do in the time since the bill was \nintroduced.\n  Then we have the worker programs. That is what I was reading about \nearlier. Let me mention those programs. These are programs that have \ngenerally been referred to as the guest worker programs. We believe, \nand I think data shows, that the bill doubles the number of guest \nworkers who would be allowed into the country. Every year we bring in a \ncertain number of people. Some work in agriculture, some work in \nlandscaping, some work in others things. In a time of high \nunemployment, with Americans doing landscaping, Americans are working \nin meatpacking plants and doing farm work. But temporary, seasonal jobs \nare often hard to fill and guest workers can do that. I am not opposed \nto a guest worker program. But at this point in history, should it be \ndouble the number on top of the 30 million I just mentioned? This is an \nannual flow on top of that.\n\n  For example, it adds four times more guest workers than the 2007 bill \nthat the American people and Congress rejected. There are four times \nthe number of guest workers in that bill at a time when 20 million more \nAmericans are on food stamps than in 2007. Teenage unemployment is 54 \npercent higher and median household income is 8 percent lower than in \n2007?\n  Are we so desperate now we have to bring in twice as many guest \nworkers? Where are they going to find work? Are we going to disappoint \nthem? What if they cannot find work? Will they be able to say: Well, I \nwill work for minimum wage?\n  What happens to the young American who is 20 and would like to do \nsome work? Perhaps he has a child and is trying to learn a skill and \nget started as a carpenter, bricklayer, or equipment operator. Will \nthat make his ability to find a job harder?\n  What if a young guy had a drug offense? I used to be a Federal \nprosecutor. Just because somebody was arrested and prosecuted for \ndrugs, we don't want to make it so they can never get work again. Who \nis going to take care of them?\n  We know this: We know if people don't have a job, the government has \ntransfer payments, such as food stamps, Medicaid, housing allowances, \nand other benefits. So now does the taxpayer have to pay for even more \npeople who are subsidized by the government because they honestly \ncannot find a job?\n  My colleagues need to focus on this, and there has been almost no \nserious discussion about it other than what we hear from certain \nsqueaky wheels and special interests.\n  How many of our colleagues know the difference between the H-1B visa, \nthe H-1B-B1 visa, the H-2A visa, the H-2B visa, and the H-4 visa? How \nmany will come in under each one of them? What standards will they use? \nDo we actually have to make sure we have advertised and offered the job \nto an American first before using this visa?\n  Those are just the H visas. What about the W-1 visa, the W-2 visa, \nand the W-3 visa? There is also the E-3 visa, the E-4 visa, and the E-5 \nvisa. Let's not forget the X visa and the Y visa. It goes on and on. \nThat is how we have a doubling of the number of people coming in under \nthe guest worker program.\n  Our sponsors have spent 4 months bringing this up. Clearly, they \nshould have spent much more time because the bill is fatally flawed. \nThe only thing that clearly works in the bill--the only thing that is \nguaranteed to work--is the amnesty. Once this bill has passed, it is \nguaranteed that people who are here illegally will be given legal \nstatus. They will then be placed on a path to legal permanent residence \nand then citizenship. That is what is guaranteed. All we have, as in \n1986, is a promise that we will have enforcement in the future.\n  A lot of us have been around here for several years, and we know that \nis not going to work. This promise is just that, a promise. We don't \nhave the backing to make it sure. Senator Cornyn has an idea that he \nthinks will strengthen that, and I know it will strengthen it.\n  Well, I appreciate the opportunity to share these thoughts. Senator \nCruz is now in the Judiciary Committee dealing with some other \nimportant issues of which I am glad that able lawyer is there. He will \nbe speaking about this later.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 17 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Senator Cornyn indicated that the bill fails with \nregard to enforcement and enforcement at the border. I could not agree \nmore. In 2007, Senator Cornyn spent a lot of time working on this bill. \nHe proposed an amendment then that would have improved the border \nenforcement, and he is an expert at that. He is a Senator from Texas. \nHe has wrestled with this over the years, and we should absolutely \nlisten to him.\n  We also know this: The people who are out there enforcing the law \nevery day are telling us the system is not working. They tell us \nchanges and improvements need to be effected, and they are concerned \nthis bill doesn't do it.\n  On June 10, the Rockingham County Sheriff's Office in North Carolina \nissued a press release stating that more than 75 North Carolina \nsheriffs warned Congress that the Senate immigration bill would \nendanger public safety.\n  Well, that is a pretty serious matter. They say this:\n\n       In a short time, over seventy-five Sheriffs from across \n     North Carolina, serving counties both big and small across \n     this great state, have signed the attached letter opposing \n     the current Senate immigration plan.\n       Our first responsibility and highest duty as Sheriffs is to \n     provide for the safety of the citizens residing in the \n     communities we serve. Unfortunately, this flawed bill which \n     was produced by the ``Gang of Eight'' puts the public safety \n     of citizens across the U.S. at risk and hampers the ability \n     of law enforcement officers to do their job.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       This Senate Bill should be opposed by lawmakers and \n     instead, Congress should work with law enforcement on reforms \n     that we already have, and were willing to propose, that will \n     enhance public safety.\n\n  Kenneth Palinkas, American Federation of Government Employees Union \npresident and affiliated with the AFL-CIO, wrote this letter:\n\n       There has been much public concern over the fact that the \n     legalization occurs prior to any border enforcement. Indeed, \n     from what I understand, every amendment offered in committee \n     which made legalization contingent on first achieving border \n     security was defeated. History tells us that future promises \n     will not be kept and that our border agents will be left high \n     and dry by the executive branch as they have so many times \n     before, regardless of who writes the plan.\n\n\n[[Page S4079]]\n\n\n  This is the head of a Federal employees union who represents law \nenforcement officers--I think the biggest one. He goes on to say:\n\n       But even if you completely rewrote your proposals to \n     resolve the many border security concerns and changed the \n     ordering to delay legalization, the legislation would still \n     fail and would still endanger the public because of the \n     fatally flawed interior enforcement components.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       If passed, S. 744 would lead to the rubber stamping of \n     millions of applications for both amnesty and future \n     admissions.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Why should the Senate pass a bill that makes it even more \n     difficult for the USCIS officers--\n\n  They are the citizenship and immigration officers--\n\n     to identify, remove, and keep out public safety threats.\n\n  Maybe those people are criminals in their own countries. What does a \nperson do if they are about to go to jail in another country in the \nworld? Well, if they can flee the country and get to the United States, \nthat is not a bad thing. Over the last decade, we are seeing more \ncriminals who are a part of the mix of the very fine and decent people \nwho come to the country because they are perhaps, in effect, fleeing \nprosecution in their own country.\n  What about the ICE officers, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nCouncil? They wrote a letter with Pennsylvania and North Carolina \nsheriffs, as well as sheriffs nationwide, on May 29, and they say this:\n\n       Congress can and must take decisive steps to limit the \n     discretion of political appointees and empower ICE and CBP to \n     perform their respective missions and enforce laws enacted by \n     Congress.\n\n  This is a bold statement. These people work for the President of the \nUnited States--or at least as part of the administration. Two years ago \nICE officers voted no confidence in their supervisor, John Morton, \nbecause they said he spends more time dealing with pro-amnesty groups \nand directing them not to enforce the law than doing his duty. They \nhave actually sued Secretary Napolitano and Mr. Morton for blocking \nthem from executing plain congressional mandates. They believe they \nhave no other obligation than to enforce this. They have to do it, but \nthey have been told not to do it.\n  They say:\n\n       Rather than limiting the power of those political \n     appointees within the DHS, S. 744 provides them with nearly \n     unlimited discretion, which will serve only to further \n     cripple the law enforcement missions of these agencies.\n\n  I have talked to these officers. They asked to be a participant with \nthe Gang of 8 in writing this legislation, and they were refused. They \nasked repeatedly. They warned that this was not going to work. They \nnever wanted to hear from the people who enforced the law every day. \nThey wanted to hear from the amnesty crowd, and that is who they met \nwith. They wanted to hear from the big business guys who want more \ncheap labor, and that is who wrote the bill. They didn't listen to the \npeople who deal with this and put their lives on the line.\n  This letter continues:\n\n       While business groups, activists, and other special \n     interests were closely involved in drafting S. 744, law \n     enforcement personnel were excluded from those meetings. \n     Immigration officers, state, and local law enforcement \n     working directly with the nation's broken immigration system \n     were prohibited from providing input. As a result, the \n     legislation before us may have many satisfactory components \n     for powerful lobbying groups and other special interests, but \n     on the subjects of public safety, border security, and \n     interior enforcement, this legislation fails. It is a \n     dramatic step in the wrong direction.\n\n  That is a pretty resounding condemnation, and I think that is \nfundamentally correct because I met with them. I asked that group of \npeople to meet with them, and they would not do it.\n  Participants on the recent calls that discussed this bill and how to \npromote it include the heads at Goldman Sachs, the Business Roundtable, \nEvercore, Silver Lake, Centerbridge Partners, the U.S. Chamber of \nCongress, as well as the head of Washington trade groups representing \nbanking industries, such as, the Financial Services Roundtable. They \nall had input into it and were involved. I guess they made \ncontributions to it.\n  On June 10, Thomas Hodgson, sheriff of Bristol County--from \nMassachusetts--said:\n\n       I have grave concerns about illegal criminals being \n     eligible for citizenship and gang members being permitted to \n     qualify for RPI status, registered provision immigrant, legal \n     status once they renounce their affiliation. Most troubling, \n     however, is the fact that we do not have adequate systems \n     in place such as biometrics to verify identification for \n     people entering or leaving the United States. Announcing \n     that biometrics will be available at our 30 busiest \n     airports serves only to limit illegal entry at those \n     locations, diverting illegal entry to those locations \n     without the superior technology.\n\n  The sheriff said:\n\n       I ask you to make it known to your senators and \n     representative that they vote no on passage of S. 744 until a \n     comprehensive security plan is in place.\n\n  Peter Nunez, former U.S. attorney in San Diego, a great U.S. attorney \nwhom I had the honor to serve with, said this:\n\n       But of greatest concern is the so-called ``trigger'' that \n     we are told will delay the path to citizenship until the \n     border is secure.\n\n  That is what they are saying. We have this thing in place, and until \nwe guarantee the border is secure, the legalization doesn't happen. We \nhave demonstrated already that is absolutely ineffective.\n  Mr. Nunez goes on to say:\n\n       This is an illusion meant to fool the public into believing \n     that amnesty will only take place after the border is secure. \n     Nothing could be further from the truth. Because on Day One, \n     every one of the 11 million illegal aliens will be eligible \n     for a temporary document allowing them to stay and work in \n     the U.S., their two most important goals.\n\n  He was a U.S. attorney on the California border and he worked with \nthese issues and understands them. He had the responsibility of \nprosecuting cases by the thousands--probably hundreds of thousands, \nfrankly. Former U.S. Attorney Nunez is a very wise and experienced \nperson.\n  Pinal County Sheriff's Office, Florence, AZ, Sheriff Babeu said to \nsecure the border first or we will repeat history. Quote:\n\n       Pinal County Sheriff Babeu has announced his opposition to \n     the proposed immigration reform offered by the so-called \n     ``Gang of Eight.'' Officially titled the ``Border Security, \n     Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of \n     2013.''\n\n  Sheriff Babeu said:\n\n       We must secure the border first, prior to any discussion of \n     green cards and a path to citizenship offered to nearly 20 \n     million illegals and their families. This plan gives \n     everything to President Obama up front, while border security \n     is promised once again on the back end. We are about to \n     repeat history, when in 1986 President Reagan gave amnesty to \n     2 million illegals. Now, the stakes are far higher, yet it \n     seems we haven't learned our lesson. The failure to secure \n     the border after the Reagan amnesty got us to where we are \n     today with 11 million to 20 million illegals in our Country. \n     . . . this plan will repeat history.\n\n  I think he is exactly right about that.\n  Chris Crane, the head of the ICE union, is outspoken about this. He \nhas testified before the House. He has had press conferences here in \nwhich I participated with him. He has warned this will make America \nless secure, not more secure. He warns it makes the ability of the ICE \nagents to enforce the law, already handicapped, even more problematic. \nHe says the bill gives to the Secretary essentially more discretion to \nviolate the law than the Secretary has today. In fact, the orders and \ndirectives and policies they are giving to the ICE officers about how \nto do their job are currently in direct violation of the law. This bill \nratifies that by explicitly giving statutory authority to the Secretary \nto make all kinds of waivers for other matters. That is not the way to \ngive confidence to America.\n  Mr. President, I don't know what our time is. I see no one else on \nthe floor. I don't want to take anybody else's time, but if I yielded \nthe floor, I guess their time would run against them anyway.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  Our law enforcement officers are frustrated. We have three major law \nenforcement groups, including Border Patrol, which was given \nconsiderable funding after the failure of the 2006 and 2007 \ncomprehensive immigration bill, and they have enhanced their efforts as \na result of that, but we still are not where we need to be at the \nborder. Indeed, since the announcement of this\n\n[[Page S4080]]\n\npossible amnesty, illegal entries have increased significantly on our \nborders. The number of people arrested is considerably higher this year \nthan last year, and 55,000 of the 90,000 people--90,000 who have been \narrested this year since January--were not from Mexico; this was \nprimarily on the Mexican border--but from other countries. Some of the \ncountries have a history of terrorism. Senator Cornyn has talked about \nthat previously. We have a surge of it happening, and they are \nconcerned about it, about protecting their officers.\n  Customs and the citizenship and immigration officers are the people \nwho will process the amnesty claims and the requests to be treated as \nlawful residents that will occur after this bill passes. They are the \npeople who deal with those who make application to come to the United \nStates, and they are the people who process the pathway to citizenship \nfor everybody. They have explicitly voted in opposition to this \nlegislation. They say it does not work. I just read a quote from the \nhead of their union. The ICE officers who deal with all of the interior \nenforcement--they apprehend people who have been convicted of crimes \nand are in State and local jails who are noncitizens or who are \nillegally here and they are supposed to deport them--have been \nconsistently out front pointing out how they have been restricted in \ntheir ability to do their job, and that if this bill passes and the \nvast majority of those here illegally are legalized, they are not in \nthe future going to be placed in a position where they can do their \njob. They are not going to be placed in a position where they can \neffectively manage the interior enforcement in America. They say the \nbill will make us less secure, not more secure. How wrong a direction \ncould that be?\n  So those are the things we have to get a grip on here. That is why \nthe legislation cannot become law, and I don't think--it won't become \nlaw as it is written today. That is the truth. One way or the other, it \nwill not become law, because it is fatally flawed.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to share these remarks as we \nbegin the discussion on one of the great issues of our time: \nimmigration. It has to be done right. The American people are rightly, \nas are these law officers, concerned that we are about to do another \n1986, that we are going to give immediate lawful status to millions of \npeople who came here illegally on the promise we will enforce the law \nin the future. But when we read the bill we can see that won't happen, \nand we will be sending another message worldwide that the United States \nis such that if one can get into our country illegally and hold on for \nlong enough, that person too will be a beneficiary of the third major \namnesty that occurs.\n  So that is where we are.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I am happy to be on the floor today as we \nget ready to proceed to the immigration bill and start to debate it. I \nwish to lay out a couple of points as we move forward on this debate \nwhich I fully anticipate we will do. We need to do so as a country, \nactually for many of the reasons my colleague from Alabama raised, \nbecause of these problems we face with regard to our immigration \nsystem.\n  Let's take a step back and analyze the issue a little while for the \npeople who are tuning in for the first time or maybe people are \nvisiting Washington and are perhaps listening to us talk about it, to \nprovide a fundamental understanding of what we are addressing. Let's \nbegin by saying the obvious, which is that all Americans understand \nimmigration because it is their story, whether it is you, your parents, \ngrandparents, great-grandparents, or great-great-grandparents. One of \nthe defining characteristics of the United States of America is that it \nis literally a collection of people from all over the world or \ndescendants of people from all over the world who have come here in \nsearch of a better life.\n  I think it is important to understand why that distinguishes us from \nthe rest of the world and the attitudes of the rest of the world \nthroughout history. If we look at the countries that have been \norganized throughout human history, the nation states, all of these \ncountries have largely been organized because these people had a common \nethnicity or a common race or they came from the same tribe or the same \nfamily clan or what-have-you. The United States is very different. The \nUnited States was actually founded on the notion that we are going to \ncreate a country that believes fundamentally in the God-given right of \nevery single human being to go as far as their talent and work will \ntake them. People such as myself who have been born and raised here our \nentire lives, sometimes we take that for granted, but we need to \nunderstand that throughout history it is a rarity. In fact, throughout \nhistory, what people have been told by their leaders is: You can only \ngo so far in life because that is what your parents did, that is where \nyour parents come from, so that is all you are allowed to do. But we \nwere different, and thank God we were.\n  What we said is, We don't care how poor you were the day you were \nborn; it doesn't matter to us that your parents weren't well connected \nand well heeled; we don't even care that you are from another country. \nIf a person wants to work hard and build a better life for him or \nherself, we want that person. That has been the history of the United \nStates: a collection of go-getters from all over the world who have \ncome here and built this extraordinary country and, as a result, the \ninfluence this country has had not just on human history but even to \nmodern day is unbelievable culturally and economically, in terms of \nensuring peace, especially in the aftermath of World War II. All of it \nis the result of this particular reality about who we are as a people \nand as a Nation. We have always had immigration, and we will always \nneed immigration, to keep the nature and the essence of who we are as a \npeople.\n  But times change and the immigration system has to change with those \ntimes. In essence, the immigration system we had 100 years ago, 150 \nyears ago--people forget this: What was the immigration system of the \nUnited States? Not so long ago, this was the immigration system in the \nUnited States: If you got here, you were allowed to stay. If you made \nthat dangerous voyage across the Atlantic, if you found your way to \nthis country, if you were processed through Ellis Island or somewhere \nelse, you were allowed to stay. We can't do that anymore. We have to \nhave a controlled immigration system, especially in the 21st century, \nto measure who is coming here, who they are, and why they are here. \nThat is the way it has to work now in the 21st century. We understand \nthat.\n  Adding to that, by the way, is the reality that the 21st century is \nso different from the 20th. We are actively engaged in global \ncompetition. It wasn't so long ago, such as when my parents came in \n1956, the United States was still a national economy. The people we \ntraded with and sold with and competed against lived in this country, \nprobably in one's own State or in one's own community. No more. Today \nwe are actively involved in global competition for business, for \nclients, and for talent, so we have to understand our immigration \nsystem has to reflect these changes. The way people immigrate and who \nimmigrates here now has to reflect the 21st century reality, which is \nreason No. 1 why this country needs immigration reform.\n\n  All the attention is being paid to illegal immigration, and, look, \nthat is a serious problem. I am going to talk about that in a moment. \nBut issue No. 1, the fundamental reason we have to do immigration \nreform, is because we do not have a 21st-century immigration system. \nOur immigration system today is largely built on the idea that if you \nhave a relative living here, it is easier for you to come than if you \nhave a special skill or talent that you are offering to the country to \ncontribute.\n  We do not have a merit-based system, we have a family-based system. I \nsay that as someone whose family came on a family-based system. My \nparents came here because my mom's sister\n\n[[Page S4081]]\n\nclaimed her in 1956. But the country is so different, the world is so \ndifferent--so different from 2006, not to mention 1956--and our \nimmigration system has to reflect that.\n  The problem is we have a broken legal immigration system. It does not \nreflect the realities of the 21st century. The result is that even if \nwe did not have a single illegal immigrant in the United States, we \nshould be on the floor of the Senate debating immigration reform \nbecause we must modernize our legal immigration system. That, as much \nas anything else, is the reason my colleagues should be excited about \nthe opportunity to have this debate, because we have to modernize our \nlegal immigration system so it is a benefit to our country.\n  I give this anecdote because I think it is appropriate: We are in the \nNBA finals--which, by the way, the Miami Heat won game 2 in a \nresounding fashion, and we are very happy about that. We will see what \nhappens tonight. But imagine for a second if there was now the hottest \nbasketball player in the county, who played at some college in the \nUnited States--6 feet 10 inches, never misses a shot, just an \nunbelievable player. Do you think in your wildest dreams we would ever \nlet that person go play in Italy or Spain or some other country? There \nis no way in the world we are going to allow the best basketball player \nin the world--no matter where they were born, no matter where they came \nfrom, no matter their immigration status--there is no way in the world \nwe are going to let a future NBA star leave the United States and go \nplay basketball in some other country, in a European league or the \nGreek league or whatever. They are going to stay here.\n  So my question to you is, If that is how we approach sports--which is \nimportant, I guess, but it is a game--shouldn't that be the way we \napproach our economy? Should we be deporting the best graduates at some \nof our universities--world-class physicists and scientists and people \nin technology and engineering and math? Yet that is the way \nfunctionally our immigration system works right now. I am not making \nthis up. We have heard the testimony. We have heard the people who come \ninto our offices. There is not a Member in this body who has not had a \nmeeting in their office, or their staff has not, with someone from the \ntech community who will come to you and say: We are going to college \ncampuses, we are making job offers to the best and brightest, and we \ncannot keep them here--not because they do not want to stay here, not \nbecause they are not qualified, not because we do not have a job \nopening, but because we cannot get them a green card or a legal status. \nSo they are learning at our universities, at the expense of the \nAmerican taxpayer, and then they are leaving the United States to \ncompete against us.\n  That makes no sense, nor does, by the way, the system of getting \nworkers for agriculture, which I would argue in many respects is \nskilled labor. If you do not believe me, go watch some of these people \nin the fields as they work, doing the work they do.\n  But American agriculture, you talk about energy security. If you want \nto cripple a country, cripple their food security, cripple their \nagricultural security. Agriculture is an important industry in most of \nthe States of the country and certainly for the United States of \nAmerica. That industry depends on a workforce, and there is a demand \nfor labor in that workforce. The fact is, and has been for over 100 \nyears, that the only way to fully fill all the jobs available in \nagriculture is through seasonal and temporary labor from abroad. There \nis a real demand for that labor, and there is a real supply of people \nwho want to do that labor. Supply and demand will always meet. But \nbecause we do not have a functional legal immigration system that \nallows the supply of foreign workers to meet the demand of domestic \njobs in agriculture, supply and demand are meeting, but they are \nmeeting in a chaotic and broken way. That needs to be reformed, as well \nas a bunch of other aspects.\n  The immigration system is very bureaucratic and complicated. In fact, \nour broken legal immigration system is one of the leading contributors \nto illegal immigration. Over 40 percent of the people in this country \nillegally today came legally. They did not jump a fence. They did not \nsneak in. They came on some sort of temporary visa and they overstayed \nit. One of the leading reasons they overstay is they think it is too \ncostly, too time-consuming, and too bureaucratic to come back again \nlegally in the future.\n  So I guess my point is, even if we did not have a single illegal \nimmigrant in the United States, we need to do immigration reform \nbecause we must modernize our legal immigration system, and it must \nreflect the 21st century.\n  The second point I will make to you is our immigration laws are only \nas good as our ability to enforce them. We do not have enforcement \nmechanisms that work. All the attention is paid to the border, and it \nshould be, because the border is not just an immigration issue, it is a \nnational security issue. That means the same routes that are used to \nsmuggle in immigrants can be used to smuggle in weapons and terrorists \nand other things--and drugs.\n  So we must secure the border. That is not easy to do because there is \nno such thing as one border. The border is broken up into about nine \ndifferent sectors. Some are doing much better than they ever have; \nothers are not doing very well at all. We must secure the border of the \nUnited States for national security reasons as well as immigration \nreasons. I know it is hard to do it, and I know there have been efforts \nin the past that have failed, but I am telling you that I refuse to \naccept the idea that the most powerful country on Earth, the Nation \nthat put a man on the Moon, is incapable of securing its own borders.\n  Our sovereignty is at stake in terms of border security. Border \nsecurity is not an anti-immigration or anti-immigrant measure, it is an \nimportant national security measure. But it is also an important \ndefense of our sovereignty. We must protect our borders.\n\n  Likewise, we have to understand that even if we protect our borders, \nthe magnet that is bringing people to the United States is employment. \nSo we have to create a system, which we are capable of doing in the \n21st century, we must create a system that allows employers to verify \nthat the person they are hiring is legally here; hence, all this talk \nof E-Verify. Last but not least, because 40 percent of the people who \nare here illegally entered legally, we have to have a system that \ntracks when visitors enter and when they leave.\n  My colleagues will tell you that is already required by law, and it \nis. The problem is that the way it is required right now will never \nwork. That is why this bill deals with that. We have to have a system \nso when you are visiting the United States on a temporary visa--as a \ntourist, on business, whatever it may be--we track you. You log in when \nyou come in and you log in when you leave.\n  Every hotel in America knows when their guests come in and when they \nleave. Every hotel in America knows that. Multiple businesses track \npeople when they come in and when they leave. We do this every single \nday as a matter of routine in our lives. The Federal Government should \nbe able to do that, and it must do that. This bill requires that they \ndo that, and it creates a real incentive to do that, and I will talk \nabout that in a moment. But, basically, the incentive is that the green \ncard process, for those who are here illegally in this country--that \ndoes not start until that system is fully in place. By the way, it also \ndoes not start until E-Verify is fully in place. These are significant \nsecurity measures we must undertake.\n  When you hear people say: Well, the bill weakens the status quo and \nthe law, the problem is that the status quo is not working. There is a \nreason we have 11 million people here illegally, and it is because the \nstatus quo--the current law--there is a flaw in it. There is a flaw in \nE-Verify. The flaw in E-Verify is that you basically show up at your \nemployer and you show them a Social Security card. It may not be your \nSocial Security card, but that is all you have to show them. It is \nhappening all the time. People are either falsifying the document or \nborrowing someone else's, and they are using someone else's legal \ndocumentation to find a job.\n  We have to create a new E-Verify, one that allows us to verify that \nthe person holding that card is actually that person; otherwise, \narguing in\n\n[[Page S4082]]\n\nfavor of the status quo is arguing in favor of continuing the fraud. We \nhave to stop that from happening. So we have to have security elements \nas part of this bill--border security, E-Verify, and entry-exit \ntracking.\n  The last issue--and it is the one that gets all the attention--is \nwhat to do with the people who are here illegally now. Let me begin by \nsaying to you that I do not know anyone who is happy about the fact \nthat we have approximately 10.5 million to 11 million human beings \nliving in the United States illegally. I would also remind you that \nevery one of their stories is different. I would caution people not to \nlump them all into one basket because they are all very different. Some \ncame legally and overstayed, others entered illegally and have been \nhere ever since. Some came in as very young children and did not even \nknow they were illegal until they tried to go to college. The point is \nthere is real diversity in that group of people.\n  So we have three options. Option No. 1 is we can ignore it, leave it \nthe way it is, pretend it is not there. I think if this bill fails, or \nefforts like it fail, that is exactly what will happen. For those who \noppose amnesty, I would tell you that is de facto amnesty. De facto \namnesty is having 11 million people living among you illegally. The \nonly consequence to it is they do not have documentation. Obviously, \nthey are working somewhere because they are providing for their \nfamilies. They do not qualify for any Federal benefits. They are all \naround us, everywhere you look, whether you know it or not. They are \nhere. Most have been here for longer than a decade. We can ignore it, \nbut if we do, if we leave it in place, if we do nothing--if we do \nnothing--if this bill fails and we do nothing, that is de facto \namnesty.\n  The second option is we can make life miserable for them. We can \nbasically put E-Verify in place, continue to secure the borders, and \nmake life so tough on people that they will just leave on their own.\n  I do not think that is a practical approach. I do not think it works. \nI do not think most Americans would tolerate what we would have to do \nin order for that to happen. I do not think most Americans would \ntolerate the humanitarian costs of approaching it that way. At the end \nof the day, I still think many will not leave anyway. They will figure \nout a way to survive and endure. I do not think that is a practical \napproach. If someone else thinks it is a practical approach, I would \nencourage them to come to the floor and convince me otherwise, come \nhere and explain to us why we should try to do that. I have not heard \nanyone make that argument. I am not saying anyone is, which proves my \npoint.\n  What is the third option? The third option is to deal with it, to \ndeal with it in a way that is reasonable and compassionate, but also in \na way that is responsible and good for the country. That is what we \nhave endeavored to do as part of this bill.\n  So let's be clear what this bill does. First and foremost, this bill \nsays to people who are here illegally: Come forward. We have a process \nfor you that you are going to have to undergo if you want to be in this \ncountry legally. Here is the process: No. 1, you are going to have to \nundergo a background check. They are going to have to fingerprint you. \nYou are going to have to undergo a background check for national \nsecurity and for crimes. If you have committed serious crimes, you are \nnot going to qualify for this legalization.\n  You are going to have to pay an application fee. You are going to \nhave to pay a fine because that is a consequence of having violated our \nimmigration laws.\n  When I hear the word ``amnesty'' used, it reminds me that amnesty \nmeans the forgiveness of something. We have seen amnesties all the \ntime. I was recently in the great State of Hawaii. We had a great visit \nthere, a personal visit. They have a box called an amnesty box. It \nallows you, when you get off the airplane, if you have any banned \nagriculture--plants, fruits, or whatever--to put it in the bucket, no \nquestions asked. That is amnesty. Amnesty is turn it in and nothing \nwill happen to you, no price to pay. That is not what this bill does.\n  This bill says: Come forward, and you are going to have to undergo a \nbackground check for national security, a background check for crimes. \nYou are going to have to pay a fine. You are going to have to pay an \napplication fee. You are going to have to get gainfully employed and \nstart paying taxes. You are not going to qualify for any Federal \nbenefits--no ObamaCare, no food stamps, no welfare, nothing. That is \nall you are going to be able to have for 10 years, which leads me to my \nsecond point about the legalization.\n\n  There is this notion out there that this is permanent legalization, \nthat once you get this you are legal forever. Not true. This is like \nall other nonimmigrant visas. This is renewable. Under the program we \nenvision in this bill, every 6 years you are going to have to come \nforward and reapply. Every 6 years you are going to have to come \nforward and undergo all the same things again--another fine, another \napplication fee, another background check. In fact, when you go renew \nit the first time, you are going to have to prove you have been \ngainfully employed and paying taxes for the previous 6 years.\n  The legalization that people are going to be able to get, the so-\ncalled RPI--registered provisional immigrant--the key word there is \n``provisional.'' It is not permanent. There are people who are going to \nqualify for RPI at the beginning who, when it comes time to renew, are \nnot going to qualify because they were not gainfully employed and \npaying taxes, because they committed a crime, or because they cannot \npay the fine. That is going to happen. We do not think it will be \nprevalent, but it will happen. It is not permanent; it is provisional.\n  The third aspect of it is that once you have been in RPI for 10 full \nyears--after you have been in RPI for 10 full years, which means the \nfirst 6 years, and then you reapplied and qualified, and you have been \nin it another 4 years--then here is the only thing that happens: The \nonly thing that happens is that you are now qualified to, you are \neligible to, apply for a green card. It does not mean on the 10-year \nanniversary of getting RPI you show up at some office and say: I am \nhere. Give me my green card. That is not true. You have to apply for \nit. You have to undergo the same green card process, with all the same \nchecks and balances.\n  I have filed an amendment to improve it even further. I am saying \nwhen you apply for that green card, after the 10-year period and more \nhas expired, you are going to have to prove that you are proficient in \nEnglish because I think assimilation is important. I think assimilating \ninto American society is important. I think learning English is not \njust important for assimilation, it is important for economic success. \nYou cannot flourish in our economy, you cannot flourish in our country \nif you are not proficient in English. We are going to require that at \nthe green card stage.\n  Now, what is the debate here going to be about over the next few \nweeks? Well, a couple things are going to have to happen.\n  First, like any other bill, there are some technical changes that are \ngoing to have to be made, and those will be made. I think there will be \nimprovements to the bill on other issues, such as what I have just \ntalked about, this amendment I have making English proficiency required \nat the green card stage.\n  Then I think we are going to move on and have a debate about the cost \nof this bill and ensuring that we truly tighten this. But look, the \nAmerican people are very generous and open, especially to a process \nsuch as this, but they want to make sure it is not costing the American \ntaxpayer. So we are going to have to make sure people are not \nqualifying for these Federal benefits. We have to make sure people who \nhave violated our immigration law, one of the consequences of that is \nthat they are not a burden on the American taxpayer.\n  If we talk to many of these immigrant groups and the immigrations \nthemselves, they will tell us that is not a problem. That is not what \nwe are here for. Good. Because you are not going to qualify for those \nthings. We are going to make that even clearer in some of the \namendments Senator Hatch and others are working on.\n  Then I think we have to get to the final point; that is, the security \nelement of this bill. I personally believe that more than half of my \ncolleagues\n\n[[Page S4083]]\n\non the Republican side, maybe a little more, maybe a little less, want \nto vote for an immigration bill. They want to modernize our legal \nimmigration system, they want to improve our enforcement mechanisms, \nand they want to deal with the 11 million people who are here \nillegally.\n  But they are only willing to do that if they can go back to their \nfolks at home and say: We took steps in this bill to make sure this \nwill never happen again; we did not repeat the mistakes of the past; \nthis is not going to happen again. That is going to be the key to this \nbill passing. I think we can do that. That is in our principles, by the \nway. The guiding principles before this bill was unveiled talked about \nborder security. One of the ways I think we can improve that is by not \nleaving the border and fence plan to chance.\n  Let's not leave it to the Department of Homeland Security. One of the \nobjections we have heard from opponents of the bill is we do not trust \nHomeland Security to come up with a plan that works. Fine. Then let's \nput it in the bill. Let's put the specific plan in the bill, the number \nof fences, the amount of technology. Let's mandate it in the bill so we \nare not leaving it to guesswork, so when we vote for this bill, we are \nvoting for a specific security plan.\n  I have heard people say we think the E-Verify portion should be \nimproved. Let's fix it now. Let's put it in the bill. We think the \nentry-exit tracking system can be improved. Let's put it in the bill, \nso that when we vote for this bill, we are also voting for a plan. That \nis important. That is not unreasonable. I want Members to think about \nthis for a second. The immigrant who is illegally here comes forward. \nThey get legalized through this pretty difficult process. They are now \nhere legally. They have qualified because they have met these \nconditions. They are now here legally. They are working. They are \npaying taxes. They are not in the shadows anymore.\n  But before we can move to a green card, which is permanent residency, \nall we are asking for is that we ensure that this never happens again. \nThat is not an unreasonable request. Not only do I not think that is an \nunreasonable request, I think that is a very responsible request, \nbecause none of us wants to be here 5 years from now or 10 years from \nnow saying: Boy, they truly messed up in 2013; we have to do this all \nover again. None of us wants to be here 5 years from now facing 5 \nmillion illegal immigrants more, another wave of illegal immigration. \nWe can get that right. We can get it right in this bill.\n  If that happens, I believe this legislation will pass in a historic \nway out of this Chamber. It strengthens the chances it can pass in the \nHouse and be signed by the President. That is the opportunity we have \nto get something such as this right.\n  I could go on and talk to you about the economic benefits of legal \nimmigration reform and what that will mean for our economy. We will \nhave plenty of time to have that conversation. Trust me when I tell \nyou, I think we will work on it to convince you, it will be a net \npositive for America to have a legal immigration system that works.\n  That is why this debate is so important. I think we can do something \nthat is good for the country and responsible and once and for all solve \nthis problem so we do not have to continue to deal with it, so it does \nnot continue to hold us back, so we, a nation of immigrants, built on a \nheritage of legal immigration, can have a legal immigration system that \nworks, that we can be proud of, that helps our country, that takes this \nissue off the table, that gets rid of de facto amnesty, that protects \nour sovereignty and our borders and the security of our people. That is \nwhat we have a chance to do.\n  To the opponents of the legislation, I would say, look, I respect \nyour views very much. I do. I think you raise very valid concerns, \nwhich we have attempted to address in this bill and which we will \ncontinue to address in this bill. I am not one of those take-it-or-\nleave-it-people with regard to legislation. I always think that no \nmatter what idea I have, the more people who are exposed to it, the \nmore input I get, the more suggestions I get, the better we can make \nit.\n  Ultimately, that is what I am interested in being a part of. I am not \ninterested in being part of passing a bill as a talking point or a \nmessaging point, nor am I interested in the political calculations of \nthis issue. What I am personally interested in is solving a problem \nthat is hurting America. That is how I will close. That is why I am \npassionate. The reason I am passionate about this issue is because this \nthing is hurting America. The fact that we have 11 million people \nleaving here, we do not know who they are, we do not know where they \nare, they are not paying taxes, they are not incorporated into our \neconomy, that is hurting America. It is bad for them, but it is very \nbad for our country. The fact that we cannot enforce our immigration \nlaws because the systems we have in place do not work, that is bad for \nAmerica. The fact that we have a legal immigration system that hurts \nour economy and hurts our future, that is bad for America.\n  What we have today on immigration in America is bad. It does not work \nfor anyone, unless you are a human trafficker or someone who is \nbenefiting at the expense of cheap illegal labor. Who else is being \nhelped by the status quo? Who else likes what we have right now? The \nanswer is nobody. Leaving this in place is not an alternative. It is \nnot an option. This is a problem that is hurting our country. The only \nway I know how to solve a problem is to get involved in trying to solve \nit. That is why I came here. I did not come to the Senate to sign on to \na bunch of letters and give a speech once a week on the floor. I came \nhere because I believe, I know, I know with all my heart, that what we \nhave is a unique, exceptional, and special place. But to keep it that \nway requires us to take seriously, not just our constitutional charge \nbut take seriously the opportunity we have to solve historic problems \nin a historic way. I think this bill done right gives us the \nopportunity to do that. I look forward to the opportunity to be part of \nit. I hope my colleagues who are openminded about it will remain \nopenminded as we work to improve this product and give the American \npeople something that helps our country, solves our problem, and makes \nus all proud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp.) The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to deliver a floor speech on immigration reform in Spanish \nand that the Spanish and English versions be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, the Senate has begun a historic debate on \ncomprehensive immigration reform. We have had and will continue to have \nhours of debate on this issue. I think it is appropriate that I spend a \nfew minutes explaining the bill in Spanish, a language that has been \nspoken in this country since Spanish missionaries founded St. \nAugustine, FL in 1565. Spanish is also spoken by almost 40 million \nAmericans who have a lot at stake in the outcome of this debate.\n  First, I want to applaud my colleagues in the ``Gang of 8,'' who have \nworked tirelessly to come up with a bipartisan comprehensive bill. This \nissue deserves an open and fair debate on the floor. It has been over \n25 years since we passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill. The \nnext few days and weeks will not be easy; they will be a test for the \nSenate, and whether this body can debate, offer amendments, compromise, \nand ultimately come together on an issue that will move our country \nforward.\n  This debate is about Isabel Castillo.\n  This young woman from Harrisonburg, VA was brought to the United \nStates by her parents at the very young age of 6. Her parents performed \nhard labor in order to support their family by picking apples and \nworking in a poultry plant. All they wanted, like all parents do, was a \nbetter life for their children. Isabel did everything right--she \ngraduated from high school and went on to attend college, where she \ngraduated magna cum laude. She did not qualify for financial aid, due \nto her immigration status, and worked for a year to save money for \ncollege. After she graduated from college she was unable to legally \nfind a job. Instead of giving up, this young woman organized the \nHarrisonburg Dream Act chapter to raise awareness about her situation \nin order to help other students.\n\n[[Page S4084]]\n\n  This is one example of many as to why we need to pass an immigration \nbill. For students and families, such as Isabel's, this is about their \nfuture.\n  The last time Congress passed a comprehensive immigration bill was in \n1986. Many of the concerns I hear from Virginians involve issues that \nthe last immigration reform bill did not address--lack of sufficient \nborder security measures and a way to address the large number of \nundocumented immigrants in our country. The last immigration reform \nbill also did not include spouses and children of legalized \nimmigrants--which created a strong incentive for many to enter or \nremain in the country illegally.\n  This time around, things are different. I have been very impressed by \nthe open process we have had in the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       212 amendments were considered in the Committee;\n       30 Republican amendments were accepted; and\n       12 full committee hearings on immigration and border \n     security were held before markup.\n\n  I understand that some doubt remains as to whether or not this bill \nwill fix our broken immigration system. While not perfect--I can \nconfidently stand here today and say this bill will do more for border \nsecurity, more to improve our current backlog, more to strengthen our \nemployment verification system, and more to put measures in place to \ndeal with the future flow of immigrants--compared to any other \nimmigration bill in history.\n  This bill will first and foremost create a path to earned \ncitizenship, not amnesty. Undocumented individuals will have to meet \nseveral stringent requirements such as, paying fees and fines, passing \nnational security and criminal background checks, paying their taxes \nand learning English.\n  And before anyone can come out of the shadows, this bill requires a \nborder security strategy and border fencing strategy within 6 months of \nenactment.\n  I am proud that this bill includes strong provisions to protect \nstudents who only know this country as their home, DREAMERS, as well as \nagricultural workers, who perform some of the most difficult labor--\nthese individuals will have an accelerated path if they meet certain \nconditions.\n  In order for the U.S. to be the most talented country in the world, \nwe must fix the current flaws in our immigration system. Our \nimmigration system does not meet the demands of businesses that wish to \nattract and retain highly qualified immigrants.\n  It is not about just addressing the short-term needs of the STEM \nworkforce but about investing in the future of our children. In order \nto ensure we remain globally competitive, we must increase our \ninvestments in education. This bill does just that by establishing a \nSTEM education initiative--funded through fees collected from employers \nof foreign STEM workers.\n  According to the Council on Foreign Relations ``60 percent of U.S. \nemployers are having difficulties finding qualified workers to fill \nvacancies at their companies.''\n  This bill also creates a fair path for individuals who want to come \ninto this country and start businesses, create jobs, and invest in the \neconomy.\n\n       In Virginia, Asian-owned businesses had sales and receipts \n     of more than $13 billion and employed more than 92,000 \n     people.\n       Virginia's foreign students contribute more than $405 \n     million to the State's economy in tuition, fees, and living \n     expenses every year.\n\n  Immigrants' contributions in the high-tech sector are striking, with \none study finding that immigrants started 25 percent of all engineering \nand technology companies founded in the United States between 1995 and \n2005.\n  Through this bill individuals who earn a master's or other \npostgraduate degree in STEM fields from American universities can apply \nfor legal permanent resident status. This bill also changes our current \nvisa system from one based on arbitrary numbers to one that is market \nbased and understands the needs of U.S. employers.\n  The Federal Government currently spends nearly $18 billion on \nimmigration enforcement every year, more than the combined budgets of \nall other Federal law enforcement agencies:\n\n       U.S. Border Patrol apprehension of foreign nationals \n     between ports of entry fell to a 40-year low of 327,577 in \n     FY2011; and\n       Removals grew from 30,000 in 1990 to more than 391,000 in \n     FY2011.\n\n  This bill goes even further by allocating up to $6.5 billion \nadditional for border security. It requires a biometric exit system to \nbe in place at the 10 largest international airports in the United \nStates within 2 years, and 20 additional airports within 6 years.\n  It is not just about spending more money at the border, but about \nbeing strategic in how and where we spend our resources.\n  One of the key issues that we must address is to hold employers \naccountable and ensure that we have an effective employment \nverification system in place.\n  As of May more than 400,000 employers registered for e-verify. This \nbill will mandate that all employers use a verification system that \nensures all employees are legally authorized to work in the United \nStates, and fine companies that employ undocumented immigrants.\n  The State Department is currently processing visas for Filipino \nsiblings of U.S. citizens who submitted their visa applications 24 \nyears ago. I ask my colleagues to imagine if you had to wait over 24 \nyears to see your family members.\n  This bill provides sufficient visas to erase the current backlog of \nfamily and employment-based visa applicants in the next 7 years, \nstarting in 2015.\n  Lastly, and probably one of the most essential pieces of this bill, \nis how we deal with future flow of immigrants wanting to come to this \ncountry. This bill creates a future immigration framework that is \npremised on a merit-based points system. The bill establishes a new \nnon-immigrant agricultural worker visa, and sets forth provisions \nrelating to the integration of new immigrants; and includes provisions \nto deal with the present and future workforce needs of the American \nagriculture industry, while protecting workers from being displaced or \notherwise adversely affected by foreign workers.\n  In closing, I welcome this debate. English settlers who landed at \nJamestown, VA in 1607 helped begin our Nation's great history as an \nimmigrant Nation. And Virginian Thomas Jefferson, as he wrote the \nDeclaration of Independence, expressed his clear understanding that \nimmigration was a positive force for our Nation.\n  Today, Virginia has the ninth-largest immigrant population in the \ncountry, with over 903,000 foreign-born residents. Immigrants \ncontribute greatly to the richness of our Commonwealth.\n  I hope that we will start a new chapter and send a strong message to \nthe world that we are a country of laws but also of fairness and \nequality.\n  Let's not repeat the mistakes of the past but let's also remember \nthat the perfect should not be the enemy of the good. Finding a perfect \nsolution should not stand in the way of progress.\n  Let's show this country and the world that this is not a Republican \nbill and it is not a Democratic bill but it is a strong bipartisan \nbill. It is time that we pass comprehensive immigration reform. Thank \nyou.\n  Mr. KAINE. El senado ha comenzado un debate historico sobre una \nreforma migratoria comprensiva. Hemos tenido y continuaremos a tener \nhoras para debatir este asunto. Creo que es apropiado que tome unos \npocos minutos para explicar la legislacion en espanol, un lenguaje que \nha sido hablado en este pais desde que misioneros espanoles fundaron a \nSan Agustin, FL en mil-quinientos-sesenta-y-cinco. El espanol tambien \nes hablado por casi cuarenta millones de Americanos con mucho invertido \nen el resultado de este debate.\n  Primeramente, quiero felicitar a mis colegas en el ``Grupo de los \nOcho,'' quienes han trabajado incansablemente para ofrecer legislacion \nbipartidista. Este asunto merece un debate abierto y razonable en el \nsenado. Han pasado mas de veinte-y-cinco anos desde la ultima vez que \npasamos una reforma migratoria comprensiva. Los proximos dias y semanas \nno seran faciles; seran una prueba para el senado, en como esta camara \npuede debatir, ofrecer enmiendas, negociar, y al final unirse en un \nasunto que movera nuestro pais adelante.\n  Este debate es sobre Isabel Castillo.\n  Esta joven de Harrisonburg, VA fue traida a los estados unidos por \nsus padres a la edad de seis. Sus padres\n\n[[Page S4085]]\n\ntrabajaban a mano de obra muy dificil cosechando manzanas y trabajando \nen una factoria avicola para poder mantener a la familia. Lo unico que \nquerian, como todos los padres quieren, era una vida mejor para sus \nhijos. Isabel hiso todo lo correcto--se graduo de la escuela secundaria \ny siguio adelante asistiendo la universidad, donde se graduo magna cum \nlaude. Ella no califico para la asistencia universitaria federal por \nrazon de su estatus migratorio y trabajo por un ano, para ahorrar \ndinero para la universidad. Despues de que se graduo del colegio, no \npudo conseguir un trabajo legal. Enves de rendirse, esta mujer joven \norganizo el capitulo de Harrisonburg Sonadores para crecer el \nconocimiento de su situacion en orden de poder ayudar a otros \nestudiantes.\n  Este es uno de muchos ejemplos por cual tenemos que pasar una reforma \nmigratoria. Para estudiantes y familias, tal como la de Isabel, esto se \ntrata de sus futuros.\n  La ultima vez que el congreso paso una reforma migratoria comprensiva \nfue en mil-novecientos-ochenta-y-seis. Muchas de las preocupaciones que \nescucho de Virginianos incluyen asuntos que la ultima reforma \nmigratoria no resolvio--la falta de suficiente medidas de seguridad \npara la frontera y una manera de resolver el gran numero de inmigrantes \nindocumentados en nuestro pais. La ultima reforma migratoria tampoco \nincluyo esposos y esposas e hijos e hijas de inmigrantes legalizados--\ncual creo un incentivo fuerte para muchos en entrar o pertenecer en el \npais ilegalmente.\n  Esta vez, las cosas son diferentes. Estoy muy impresionado por el \nproceso abierto que hemos tenido en el comite judicial del senado:\n\n       Doscientos-doce enmiendas fueron consideradas en el comite\n       Treinta enmiendas republicanas fueron aceptadas; y\n       Doce audiencias publicas sobre inmigracion y seguridad \n     fronteriza fueron realizadas antes de que el comite judicial \n     votara sobre la legislacion\n\n  Entiendo que permanecen algunas dudas si esta legislacion arreglara \nnuestro sistema de inmigracion. Aunque no es perfecto--puedo pararme \naqui hoy y decirles que esta legislacion hara mas para la seguridad \nfronteriza, mas para mejorar nuestra lista de visas pendientes, mas \npara fortalecer nuestro sistema de verificacion de empleo, y mas para \nestablecer medidas para afrontar los inmigrantes que vendran en el \nfuturo--comparado a cualquier otra legislacion migratoria en nuestra \nhistoria.\n  Esta legislacion primeramente crea un camino a la ciudadania \nmerecida, no amnestia. Individuos indocumentados tendran que satisfacer \nvarios requisitos rigurosos tal como, pagando multas, pasando \nverificacion de antecedentes, pagando impuestos y aprendiendo ingles.\n  Y antes de que cualquier persona pueda aplicar, esta legislacion \nrequiere una estrategia de seguridad fronteriza y estrategia de \nprevencion en la frontera dentro de 6 meses de ser promulgada.\n  Estoy orgulloso de que esta legislacion incluye provisiones fuertes \npara proteger estudiantes que solamente conocen este pais como su \nhogar, Sonadores, y tambien trabajadores en agricultura, quienes \ntrabajan en unas de las manos de obra mas dificiles--esta gente tendra \nun camino acelerado si satisfacen ciertos requisitos.\n  Para que los estados unidos sea el pais mas talentoso en el mundo, \ntenemos que arreglar las fallas que existen hoy en dia en nuestro \nsistema de inmigracion. Nuestro sistema no satisface las demandas de \nnegocios que desean atraer y retener inmigrantes sumamente calificados.\n  No se trata de simplemente afrontando las necesidades de corto plazo \nrequeridas por los trabajadores en las mas reas de ciencia, tecnologia, \ningenieria, y matematicas, sino sobre invirtiendo en el futuro de \nnuestros hijos. Para asegurar de que sigamos competitivos globalmente, \ntenemos que aumentar nuestras inversiones en la educacion. Esta \nlegislacion hace tal meta estableciendo una iniciativa--fundado por \npagos colectados de empleadores que emplean trabajadores extranjeros en \nestas areas.\n  Segun el Consejo de Relaciones Exteriores, ``sesenta por ciento de \nempleadores tienes dificultades encontrando trabajadores calificados \npara llenar vacancias en sus empresas.''\n  Esta legislacion tambien crea un camino justo para individuos que \nquieren venir a este pais y empezar negocios, crear trabajos, e \ninvertir en la economia.\n\n       En Virginia, los negocios aduenados por gente asiatica \n     tuvieron ventas y recibos de mas de trece-mil-millones de \n     dolares y emplearon a mas de noventa-y-dos-mil personas.\n       Estudiantes extranjeros contribuyeron mas de cuatro-\n     cientos-cinco millones de donlares cada ano a la economia de \n     Virginia a traves de sus matriculas, pagos, y gastos de \n     mantenimiento durante el ano academico.\n\n  Las contribuciones de los inmigrantes en el sector de alta tecnologia \nson grandes, con un estudio encontrando que inmigrantes comenzaron \nveinte-y-cinco por ciento de todas las empresas de ingenieria y \ntecnologia fundadas en los estados unidos entre mil-novecientos-\nnoventa-y-cinco y dos-mil-cinco.\n  A traves de esta legislacion, individuos que logran una maestria u \notra matriculada avanzada in las areas de ciencia, tecnologia, \ningenieria, y matematicas de universidades estadounidenses pueden \naplicar para residencia permanente. Esta legislacion tambien cambia \nnuestro sistema de visas que existe hoy en dia de uno basado en numeros \narbitrarios a uno basado en el mercado y las necesidades de empleadores \nestadounidenses.\n  El Gobierno Federal ahora gasta casi diez-y-ocho-mil-millones de \ndolares en esfuerzo de inmigracion cada ano, mas que los presupuestos \ncombinados de todas las otras agencias de ejecucion legal.\n\n       Aprensiones de la Patrulla Fronteriza Estadounidense de \n     extranjeros dentro los puertos de entrada redujo por mas de \n     trescientos-veinte-y-siete-mil en al ano fiscal dos-mil-once, \n     un nivel no visto en cuarenta anos.\n       Remociones crecieron de treinta-mil en mil-novecientos-\n     noventa a mas de trecientos-noventa mil en el ano fiscal dos-\n     mil-once.\n\n  Esta legislacion va mas lejos asignando hasta seis-y-medio mil-\nmillones de dolares adicionales para seguridad fronteriza. Y requiere \nla creacion de un sistema biometrico en diez de los aeropuertos \ninternacionales mas grandes en los estados unidos dentro de 2 anos, y \nveinte aeropuertos adicionales dentro de 6 anos.\n  No se trata de simplemente gastar mas dinero en la frontera, se trata \nde ser estrategico en como y donde gastamos nuestros recursos.\n  Unos de los asuntos centrales que tenemos que resolver es que \nempleadores sean responsables y asegurar que tengamos un sistema de \nverificacion de empleo efectivo.\n  Desde Mayo, mas de cuatro-cientos-mil empleadores se han registrado \npara e-verify. Esta legislacion requiere que todos los empleadores usen \nun sistema de verificacion que asegure que todos los empleados sean \nlegalmente autorizados para trabajar en los estados unidos, y multara \nempresas que emplean a los inmigrantes indocumentados.\n  El Departamento de Estado ahora en dia esta procesando unas visas \npara hermanos Filipinos de ciudadanos estadounidenses quienes \nsometieron sus aplicaciones de visa hace veinte y cuatro anos. Les pido \na mis colegas que se imaginen si usted tuviera que esperar mas de \nveinte-y-cuatro anos para ver a miembros de su familia.\n  Esta legislacion proporciona suficiente visas para borrar el atraso \nde visas de familia y empleo en los proximos siete anos, empezando en \nel dos-mil-quince.\n  Ultimamente, y probablemente unas de las partes mas esenciales de \nesta legislacion, es como afrontamos los inmigrantes que quieren venir \na este pais en el futuro. Esta legislacion crea una estructura para los \ninmigrantes del futuro que es basada en un sistema de puntos de merito. \nLa legislacion establece una nueva visa temporal para los trabajadores \nagricultores, y crea provisiones correspondientes a la integracion de \nnuevos inmigrantes; y incluye provisiones para resolver las necesidades \ndel presente y el futuro correspondiente a la industria de agricultura \nestadounidense, mientras protegiendo trabajadores de ser desplazados o \nafectados negativamente por trabajadores extranjeros.\n\n[[Page S4086]]\n\n  En concluson, doy la bienvenida a este debate. Colonos ingleses \nquienes aterrizaron en Jamestown, VA en mil-seis-cientos-siete ayudaron \nempezar la gran historia de nuestra nacion como una nacion de \ninmigrantes. Y el Virginiano Thomas Jefferson, mientras que escribia la \nDeclaracion de Independencia, expreso su entendimiento claro que \ninmigracion era una fuerza positiva para nuestra nacion.\n  Hoy, Virginia tiene la novena poblacion de inmigrantes mas grande en \nel pais, con mas de novecientos-tres-mil residentes que nacieron afuera \nde los estados unidos. Inmigrantes contribuyen una gran riqueza a \nnuestro estado.\n  Espero que podamos empezar un nuevo capitulo y que mandemos un \nmensaje fuerte al mundo y la nacion que somos un pais de leyes pero \ntambien de justicia e igualdad.\n  No hay que repetir los errores del pasado pero debemos tambien \nrecordar que la perfeccion no debe ser el enemigo de lo bueno. \nEncontrando una solucion perfecta no deberia de bloquear el progreso.\n  Vamos a demonstrar a este pais y al mundo que esta legislacion no es \nRepublicana y no es Democrata, es fuertemente bipartidista. Es tiempo \nque aprobemos una reforma migratoria comprensiva. Gracias.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill we will begin debating later \ntoday and for the rest of the month.\n  I thank my colleagues for voting yes on the motion to proceed, which \nwill let us debate this very important bill which is critical to the \nfuture of our security, our economy, and our society. This overwhelming \nvote--a majority of both parties--starts this bill off on the right \nfoot.\n  First, I will begin by saying that this has been the most open and \ntransparent process we have seen in the past few years. Unlike most \nbills where only 1 or 2 Senators draft them, this bill was drafted by \n10 of us here in the Senate.\n  I thank each of the four Republicans and four Democrats in the Gang \nof 8--my seven colleagues in the gang--for their great work. The \nagricultural program in the bill was drafted by Senators Feinstein and \nHatch. We then held a number of hearings where we debated, considered, \nvoted on, and adopted scores of amendments during the Judiciary \nCommittee markup under the able leadership of Chairman Leahy. Many of \nthose amendments were bipartisan or were amendments offered solely by \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle. These amendments \ndramatically improve the bill. Our bill is better and stronger today \nthan it was when we introduced it.\n  Before the bill was marked up, this bill had been vetted by the eight \nof us. Eighteen of us here in the Senate have already had the chance to \nmake our mark on this bill and consider all of the ways in which it \nshould be changed. Now we are here on the floor, where all of my \ncolleagues will have the chance to further improve the bill and discuss \nthe changes they feel need to be made. We readily admit this bill is \nnot perfect and can always be improved. It is undergirded by one \nthought about the present situation and one about the future that we \nhope to change. In the present situation, our country--amazingly and \ncounterproductively--turns away hundreds of thousands of people who \nwill create jobs and improve our economy, and at the same time we let \nmillions cross the border and take jobs away from American workers. The \nsystem is backward and the status quo is unacceptable.\n  Our bill is based on one simple principle: that the American people \nwill accept and embrace commonsense solutions to future legal \nimmigration and to the 11 million now living here in the shadows if--\nand only if--they are convinced there will not be future waves of \nillegal immigration.\n  Our bill does three basic things. First, it ensures that we will \nnever again have a wave of future illegal immigration. Second, it fixes \nour completely dysfunctional legal immigration system to make us the \nmost competitive Nation in the world for both this century and the \nnext. Third, it contains a tough but realistic path for making sure \nthat the people currently here illegally are held accountable for what \nthey did, but it also allows them to join American society on our terms \nin a fair and honorable way rather than by the current amnesty-by-\ninaction we see today.\n  I wish to make it extremely clear that, first and foremost, we are \ncommitted to ending the waves of illegal immigration we have seen in \nthe last 30 years. We will accomplish this goal by building a very \nsturdy three-legged\n\n[[Page S4087]]\n\nstool of border security, employment verification, and entry-exit. I \nwill now explain what our bill does in each of these areas to prevent \nfuture waves of illegal immigration.\n  Make no mistake, our borders will be secured as a result of this \nbill. We appropriate $6.5 billion up front in this bill to bolster our \nsecurity efforts, and that is in addition to the annual appropriations \nmade for each year of border security.\n  Before any legalization can even begin, the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity is required to come up with a plan on how to deploy $4.5 \nbillion of those resources to acquire new infrastructure, technology, \nand personnel that will enable the border patrol to catch 9 out of 10 \nillegal immigrants who attempt to cross our border. Only after this \nplan is presented to Congress and deployment of the resources has \ncommenced may the legalization program begin to adjust undocumented \nindividuals to registered provisional immigrant status--what we call \nRPI status. All of the resources in the plan must then be deployed on \nthe ground and working before anyone in RPI status can ever be granted \na green card and gain citizenship.\n  After 5 years, if the Border Patrol is not catching 9 out of every 10 \nillegal immigrants who attempt to cross the border, a commission with \nborder State Governors and elected officials will be empowered to make \nrecommendations on how best to spend an additional $2 billion that this \nbill has already preappropriated in order to achieve this 90-percent \neffectiveness rate.\n  With minimal resources and with many fewer resources, we are more \neffective at the border. The effectiveness rate has gone up from 68 \npercent to 82 percent. Imagine what will happen with the resources we \nprovide in this bill, all of which is paid for by provisions in the \nbill, both fees for those who wish legal workers to come to work for \nthem and fines for those who have crossed the border illegally. DHS \nwill implement the recommendations of the commission after they have \nbeen presented to the Secretary.\n  Think of this: Crossing the border without permission from the \ngovernment is a crime. When we catch someone crossing the border and \nprosecute and deport them, we are solving the crime and punishing the \ncriminal. Our bill will deploy the resources needed to catch, \nprosecute, and deport 90 percent of the people who cross the border \nillegally. Ninety percent of all border-crossing cases will be \nsuccessfully closed. How does that closure rate compare to other \nviolations of our laws? According to FBI statistics, each year we \nsuccessfully catch, prosecute, and detain wrongdoers in less than 50 \npercent of the cases where a violent crime has been committed and in \nless than 20 percent of the cases where a property crime has been \ncommitted. Think about the much higher standard our bill is creating \nfor border security--90 percent. Everyone knows 90 percent is an A \ngrade, and our bill will achieve an A-rated border.\n\n  For days and weeks now I have heard Senators who would oppose any \nimmigration bill. They say our bill does not secure the border, as if \nthe $6.5 billion does not count. If anyone has a better idea, tell us. \nBut to say this will not improve border security--some may disagree on \nwhether it is the best way to do it or some may disagree on whether it \ndoes enough, but don't say it won't do anything to secure the border. \nHistory shows that of course it will. The eight of us believe it will \ndo it well and do it strongly. It will do it far better than anything \nthat has ever been envisioned.\n  Now let's take a look at what we can purchase for this money.\n  We are going to be building $1 billion worth of border fence. Our \nbill requires that it be built before anyone can get a green card. Our \nbill originally had $500 million more allocated for fencing, and the \nfencing money was actually decreased by the senior Senator from Texas, \nwho thought we were building too much border fence in our bill.\n  Second, we will be purchasing sensors, fixed towers, radar, and \ndrones that will cover the entire southern border. When this technology \nis deployed, we will finally be able to see every single person \ncrossing our border, and we will know where to send our 21,000 Border \nPatrol agents to go catch people.\n  I visited the border with Senators McCain, Flake, and Bennet. It is \nhuge. We cannot station enough people on the border. There are no roads \non large parts of it. But with the drones, we can see every single \nperson who crosses the border day or night, and we can follow their \npath, so they can be apprehended when they are 10, 20, 25 miles inland. \nIt is a huge improvement. Simple math tells us we have more than one \nBorder Patrol agent for every city block of the southern border. \nImagine how low crime would be if we had a police officer on every \nblock. Imagine, once we deploy this technology, how effective it will \nbe.\n  For those who say the American people do not trust the government to \nget the job done, I say let's look at the facts. Providing additional \nresources to DHS for border security has an incredibly proven track \nrecord of success. In 2010 Congress passed an emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill for border security. I worked on that with my \ncolleague from Arizona, Senator McCain. It was $600 million. In 2009, \naccording to the GAO, the national effective rate for the entire \nsouthern border was 72 percent. In 2011, a year after this was \ndeployed, it went up to 82 percent.\n  Again, saying this will not improve border security at all or saying \nthere is no security at the border is not fair, and it is not right. I \nurge my colleagues not to say it. Again, some may disagree with how or \ndisagree with how much, but there is a heck of a lot of border security \nin this bill.\n  Most of the resources in the supplemental budget went to the Tucson \nborder sector. In 2009 the effectiveness rate at the Tucson border \nsector was 71 percent. In 2011 it went up to 87 percent. Given that a \nmere $600 million supplemental appropriation was able to increase \nborder security effectiveness from 72 percent to 82 percent, it is \nreasonable to assert that spending over 10 times that money on border \nsecurity in the form of a $6.5 billion supplemental appropriation for \npersonnel, infrastructure and technology will allow us to apprehend 9 \nout of every 10 people who try to cross the southern border illegally.\n  Second, visa overstays will be identified and apprehended when this \nbill passes. An estimated 40 percent of the 11 million people in \nunauthorized status are individuals who entered the United States \nlegally but overstayed their visas. When a foreign national enters the \ncountry, he or she is fingerprinted and his or her passport or visa is \nelectronically scanned against our data security databases. Amazingly, \nwhen this individual exits the country, no such scan occurs, leading to \nuncertain information as to who overstayed their visas. Forty percent \nof those who cross illegally do not cross the border; rather, they \noverstay their visas.\n  For individuals who enter the United States by air or sea, we will \nrequire those individuals to swipe their machine-readable passport visa \non an electric scanner at the gate immediately before exiting the \nUnited States. To prevent identity theft when the person swipes their \nvisa or passport, their picture comes up on a screen at the gate. The \ngate agent who is given the passport has to match the picture on the \nscreen with the person giving their passport. The exit information will \nbe given to all of the Department of Homeland Security components to \ngenerate an accurate overstay list of people who entered the United \nStates by air or sea. Persons on this list will be apprehended, \ndetained, and deported by ICE.\n  Persons entering the United States from the northern border will also \nbe identified as exiting the country via the northern border when they \nare granted entry into Canada, and that is because the United States \nand Canada are willing to share entry information such that each \ncountry will be providing the other country with de facto exit \ninformation.\n  There is criticism leveled by opponents of immigration reform that \nthe exit system must be biometric in order to prevent visa overstays \nand that using passport or visa pictures instead of fingerprints will \nnot work. Although this criticism is not justified because we will be \nusing picture-matching to prevent identity theft, our bill phases in \nbiometric exit capabilities at our largest airports. During the first 2 \nyears of enactment the bill will require the taking of biometrics for \npeople\n\n[[Page S4088]]\n\nleaving the United States through the 10 largest international \nairports. It will go to 20 more in 6 years. If it works better than the \nphoto-match system, we will phase in the print system nationwide. We \nbelieve the photo system is just as effective and much, much cheaper. \nWhy do we need to spend billions more to achieve the same result?\n  In any case, the key to our bill is that we will ensure, soon after \npassage--even as this biometric exit system is being deployed--we will \nbe able to detect, detain, and deport individuals who enter the United \nStates legally from Canada by airport or seaport and then overstay \ntheir visas.\n  We also make the completion of this entry-exit system a trigger for \nthe path to citizenship. The path to citizenship cannot happen unless \nthis entry-exit system is deployed.\n  Third, even if a small number of people are able to cross the border \nillegally or overstay their visa--neither system will be perfect--they \nwill still not be able to find work legally in the United States due to \nour bill's mandatory employment verification system. Even if someone is \nable to get here illegally or overstays their visa, their main goal for \nbeing here--working--will be impossible after the bill is passed.\n  That is why we have illegal immigration. The people who cross our \nborders are very poor people. Most of them are living in poverty and \nthey want a job. They want some money. If they can send $10 a week home \nto their wife, father or children, they will cross the border to do it. \nBut if they can't get jobs, they are not going to come.\n  We have 11 million people here today, and we do not have a problem \nwhereby these folks are besieging us with terrorist acts. They are \nsimply here working and feeding their families.\n  If we eliminate the jobs magnet, we will eliminate illegal \nimmigration. Under this bill, every employer seeking to hire a worker \nmust determine, using our employment verification system, whether that \nprospective employee is here legally and can work. If the prospective \nemployee is either a noncitizen with work authorization, a U.S. citizen \nwith a passport or a resident of a State that agrees to share a \ndriver's license with DHS--and all 50 States now have driver's \nlicenses--then the prospective employee will have to produce that form \nof identification to their employer that matches the photo pulled up on \nthe E-Verify database in order to work legally. This will eliminate the \nidentity theft problem that plagues the current E-Verify system.\n  If the prospective employee is a U.S. citizen who does not have a \npassport or is not from a State that shares driver's licenses with DHS, \nthen that individual--it is a very small number--will have to answer \nquestions about their identity, generated randomly from their Social \nSecurity number, in order to prevent identity theft. Credit card \ncompanies have used this system to huge and positive effect.\n  Employers who do not use E-Verify or who hire illegal workers will be \ngiven severe penalties and be jailed for repeated violations. I know \nmany on the other side have wanted to make E-Verify mandatory and \npermanent. We have heard that for years. Now, all of a sudden when we \ndo it, it is not good enough.\n  Fourth, this bill also fundamentally alters the cost-benefit analysis \nfor coming to the United States illegally by creating a new W visa \nworker program to encourage people to come here legally. Because of the \nbill's significantly enhanced border security, entry-exit, and \nemployment verification, any person intending to come to the United \nStates illegally will have to take great safety risks, at great \npersonal and financial costs to come here. Once they are here, they \nwill find there are no jobs available to support themselves.\n  Alternatively, they can choose to come legally and work as part of \nour W visa work program that is created for individuals to work in jobs \nwhere employers cannot find American workers but only if they can't \nfind them. Up to 200,000 visas a year will be made available for this \npurpose. We start with a program that can grow as our economy grows and \ncreates more jobs and is flexibly related to the rate of unemployment.\n  In addition, a new agricultural program will be set up to replace the \npreviously illegal flow of agricultural workers. Given that the Census \nBureau and the Pew Hispanic Center have estimated the illegal flow in \npast years to be around 400,000 people per year, there should be enough \nvisas to meet any demand for additional workers that might exist.\n  If more legal workers are needed, the newly formed Bureau of \nImmigration and Labor Market Research can provide additional visas to \npermit more workers to enter in occupations they find have shortages of \nworkers.\n  Given these new programs, it would no longer make any sense for \nintending illegal immigrants to spend tens of thousands of dollars and \nrisk their lives to come here illegally. Illegal immigration will be a \nthing of the past.\n  Fifth, the bill will protect American workers in four ways: Because \nof the new employment verification system Americans will no longer have \nto compete for jobs with unauthorized workers who can easily be \nexploited. I say to so many of my colleagues who are worried about \nthis, I ride my bicycle around Brooklyn early in the morning. I see on \nvarious street corners congregating young men, mainly, and some guy on \na truck comes over and says: I will give you $15 to work on roofing on \na few houses I am building. I guarantee he doesn't say he will pay them \n$2 above minimum wage and give them an hour off for lunch. Those \nillegal immigrants are driving down the wage base, particularly in \nlower skilled places. That will end.\n  Second, in the bill's legal worker programs, Americans must be \nrecruited first before any foreign worker will be hired.\n  In addition, all foreign workers will be required to be paid the same \nwage as an American would be paid for that job, meaning that a foreign \nworker will never be hired to undercut an American worker's wage.\n  All foreign workers will be given portability to change employers if \nthey don't like their current employment situation. This means \nemployers will no longer choose foreign workers over American workers \nbecause they have more control over those workers.\n  Finally, this is also a very fair bill--and we have, of course--I \ndon't go into it here for lack of time--an H-1B system and a system \nthat says if you are a foreigner who studies in an American college and \ngets an M.A. or Ph.D. in STEM--science, technology, engineering, and \nmath--you will get a green card. These are the very people who in the \npast have created new companies and created tens of thousands, hundreds \nof thousands of new jobs in America. Now, if they want to come to \nAmerica after they study here or stay in America, we send them away and \nthey go to Canada and Australia. That would not happen anymore under \nthis bill.\n\n  Finally, it is a very fair bill for legal immigration and resolving \nthe status of the people who are here. We create a system, as I \nmentioned, that allows America to attract and retain the best and \nbrightest minds from around the world in science, math, finance, \ntechnology, the arts, and more, fundamental to maintaining America's \npreeminence in a an increasingly competitive global marketplace. We \nalso provided a JOLT--J-O-L-T--to our travel industry by making it \neasier for foreign nationals to come to the United States and spend \ntheir lucrative vacation dollars here instead of somewhere else.\n  Of great importance, and perhaps the dividing line between some in \nthis Chamber and the rest of us, we give the 11 million people here a \nchance to come out of the shadows and earn a path to citizenship after \nspending 10 years on probation, working, keeping their nose clean, \nlearning English and civics, and paying their taxes. It is a tough path \nto citizenship, but it is a fair path, and it is a path we make sure \nwill happen, providing the specific metrics in our border security \nprovisions are met.\n  Our bill requires all of these important enforcement resources I have \ndescribed to be put in place before we give the individuals a path to \ncitizenship. We in the Group of 8 agree that is fair to ask. The \nFederal Government should have to put the resources in place that we \npromised, as necessary, to get the job done. That is entirely within \nour control and we will live up to our work. But by the same token, we \nwill not leave these 11 million people in immigration limbo forever. It \nmakes no sense to have people living here permanently who have not \ninvested in America. This is the huge mistake Europe has made. We see \nthe ill effects every day on the news of what happens in European \ncountries that have not\n\n[[Page S4089]]\n\nintegrated their immigrant populations. Those populations become \naffected by a sense of alienation, a lack of opportunity, a lack of \nupward mobility. That is not America. Here we give people the chance to \nbe all they can be through their hard work. We want people here to be \nserving on juries, serving in the military, and saying to people that \nthey are just as American as anybody else.\n  In my city--the city in which I was raised and in which I live--there \nis that beautiful lady in the harbor with that bright torch. That has \nbeen America, and that lady has said through the centuries: If you come \nhere and work hard, stay clear of the law, no matter who you are and \nwhat your economic level is, we welcome you. We want you to become an \nAmerican.\n  We are not going to take that away. That would be just as dramatic a \nchange in this country we love so much as tearing up the Bill of \nRights. It has been part and parcel, warp and woof, of America.\n  To those who suggest having some secondary status, to those who say \nlet's put into the bill an excuse so someone 3 years from now can say \nno one can become a citizen, we say: No. We have some basic principles \nwe will not compromise and that is at the top of the list.\n  In conclusion, I wish to send this message loudly and clearly to all \nwho might be listening today. We are interested in compromises that \nwill make this bill even stronger and more secure. Our group does not \nclaim to have a monopoly on wisdom. We will hear out any of our \ncolleagues from either side of the aisle who have good-faith \nsuggestions on how to improve this bill.\n  I have heard some say we should not consider any further changes to \nthe bill and dare the other side to vote against it. I reject that \napproach. We are not interested in scoring a political victory to help \none party; we are interested in passing a law that changes the awful \nstatus quo, solves the problem, and makes America an even greater and \nbetter place. Just because the process has been, to date, so \nencouraging does not mean we can take anything for granted. So we \nwelcome constructive input from our colleagues and we want to work with \nthem. But the one thing none of us will do is condition the path to \ncitizenship on factors that may not ever happen in order to appear \ntough.\n  We are committed to border security. We are committed to ending \nillegal immigration. But we are equally committed to allowing people \nthe right to earn their way to become an American citizen if they work \nhard, play by the rules, learn English, and avoid criminality.\n  Just as I believe to my core that border security should not be a \nbargaining chip, I also believe to my core that leaving people in \nimmigration limbo, uninvested in America and its successes, is also \nsomething we should not do just to pass a bill. I commit in good faith \nto every one of my colleagues in this Chamber who wants to work with me \nto improve the bill that I am open to any ideas. But for those of my \ncolleagues who will not support this legislation, I simply ask the \nquestion: How would you solve this problem? The answers are not simple. \nThat is why it has taken us months to get to where we are today.\n\n  This bill represents our best chance for a broad bipartisan \ncompromise on a complex issue that we have had for decades.\n  I hope all of us take this opportunity very seriously. I hope we all \ndo what we can to show the American people that their lawmakers do \nstill have the ability to solve difficult problems that affect every \none of our daily lives.\n  With that, I ask that my colleagues will agree to work with us in \ngood faith to improve this bill and to give a resounding vote--from \nboth sides of the aisle--of support for this bill when it comes to \nfinal passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I very much want commonsense immigration \nreform to pass. This bill is going to pass the Senate. But, as written, \nthis bill will not pass the House. As written, this bill will not pass \ninto law. And if this bill did become law, it would not solve the \nproblem--indeed, it would make the problem of illegal immigration that \nwe have today worse rather than better.\n  If you likewise want to see commonsense immigration reform pass, then \nyou have reason to be both optimistic and pessimistic. You have reason \nfor optimism because there is widespread bipartisan agreement on many \naspects of immigration.\n  Outside of Washington, DC, there is widespread bipartisan agreement \nthat, No. 1, our current immigration system is broken, it is not \nworking; No. 2, that we have to get serious about securing the borders, \nabout doing everything we can to stop illegal immigration--that in a \npost-9/11 world it does not make any sense that we do not know who is \ncoming into this country; we do not know their history; we do not know \ntheir background--and, No. 3, that we need to improve and streamline \nlegal immigration, that we need to remain a Nation that does not just \nwelcome but that celebrates legal immigration.\n  On those basic principles there is widespread bipartisan agreement. \nIf this body were to focus on those areas of bipartisan agreement, that \nis how we would get an immigration bill passed into law--not just by \none Chamber of Congress but actually passed into law.\n  The reason, however, for pessimism is that to date the conduct of the \nWhite House and the Senate Democrats, who have been driving this \nprocess, suggests they are more interested in finding a partisan issue \nto campaign on in 2014 and 2016 than in actually passing a bill to fix \nour broken immigration system.\n  Of all of the issues swirling about this bill, the path to \ncitizenship for those who are here illegally is the single most \ndivisive issue; and that is the issue on which the Obama White House \nand the Senate Democrats insist. By insisting on that division, I \nbelieve they, by design, destine this bill to be voted down. I think if \nwe do not end up fixing our immigration system, that would be a very \nunfortunate outcome.\n  I would note in the Judiciary Committee we spent considerable time \nconsidering amendments to this bill. At the outset of the markup, I \nobserved that I hoped it would be a real markup, that the majority had \nthe votes, if they wanted, to reject every substantive amendment, but I \nvery much hoped they would not, that they would be willing to work with \nthe members of the committee to improve the bill to make it fix the \nproblem.\n  Sadly, at the end of the markup, I was forced to observe it had \nplayed out exactly as I feared it might at the beginning; namely, that \nthe majority of Democrats on the committee voted down just about every \nsingle major substantive amendment that was presented, one after the \nother after the other. What they repeatedly said was there had been a \ndeal that was cut--a deal that was cut with the union bosses, with the \ninterest groups--and that deal could not be changed. Well, if that is \nthe case, that deal is not going to get passed into law.\n  In my view, this legislation has two major problems. The first is it \ndoes not fix the problem. In 1986, Congress passed major immigration \nreform--the last time we addressed and successfully passed immigration \nreform--and that bill had two major components: No. 1, it granted \namnesty, explicit, full-out amnesty for some 3 million people who were \nthen here illegally. The American people were told: This amnesty will \nbe in exchange for securing the borders. In 1986 Congress told the \nAmerican people: We are granting amnesty, but in exchange we will fix \nthe problem so illegal immigration will go away as a problem. Once \nthese 3 million get amnesty, there will be no more.\n  Now, sadly, we are here some 30 years later and instead of 3 million \nthere are roughly 11 million people here illegally. Because what \nhappened in 1986 is the amnesty happened and the borders never got \nsecured. If this bill were to pass into law, in 10, 20, 30 years we \nwould be back here talking about another 10, 20, 30 million people here \nillegally. Because, like the 1986 bill, this bill will not fix the \nproblem, and, indeed, it will exacerbate it.\n  This bill is enormously complicated. Indeed, this bill, as currently \nwritten, is 1,076 pages--1,076 pages. It is longer than the Dodd-Frank \nbill, which was 848 pages. It is roughly half the size of ObamaCare, \nwhich was over 2,000 pages. In these 1,076 pages, there are, right now, \nover 1,000 waivers given to the\n\n[[Page S4090]]\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security and other members of the executive \nbranch to waive law enforcement provisions, to waive border security, \nto give to the executive more standardless, unreviewable discretion. \nThat, unfortunately, would only serve to exacerbate the problem.\n  Illegal immigration is an enormous problem. It is an enormous problem \nin my home State of Texas, where I have spent real time down on the \nborder visiting with ranchers, with farmers, with people living on the \nborder, who every week have people coming illegally across their \nproperty, who no longer lock their doors at home because they have \ndiscovered if they lock their doors, they just get broken into. So it \nis simpler not to lock the doors rather than deal with the damage of \nthe locks being broken or the doors kicked in.\n\n  If you look at the numbers, in fiscal year 2012, the Border Patrol \nreported 463 deaths, 549 assaults, and 1,312 rescues.\n  Let me point out, this current system is the opposite of humane. This \ncurrent system ends up having vulnerable people coming here seeking \nfreedom, entrusting themselves to coyotes, to drug cartels, to \ntraffickers, and being left--sometimes women and children--to die in \nthe desert, being left sometimes subject to sexual assault, to \nexploitation, to trafficking.\n  The U.S. Department of State estimates that 14,000 to 17,000 people \nare trafficked into the United States every single year. And when it \ncomes to the drug cartels and their role in facilitating illegal \nimmigration, the volume is staggering. Between 2006 and 2013, there \nwere 9.28 million pounds of marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, and \nheroin seized in Texas alone. To put that in perspective, the space \nshuttle weighs about 4.5 million pounds, which means there was twice as \nmuch--two space shuttles' worth--of illegal-drugs-seized traffic across \nthe border.\n  But the second major failing of this bill: It is not likely to pass. \nThere are not 218 votes in the House of Representatives to pass a \npathway to citizenship. My friends on the Democratic side of the aisle \nknow that, but I think they have made a political judgment that they \nwant to campaign on this issue rather than rolling up their sleeves and \nsaying: How do we actually get a bill that can pass into law? That is \nwhat I hope this body does.\n  In the course of the markup, I worked very hard to try to improve \nthis bill because I want to see a bill that fixes the problem passed \ninto law. Specifically, I offered five amendments to fix the bill, to \nfix the problem. Those amendments were all voted down, with every \nDemocrat on the committee voting against them.\n  On the floor of the Senate, I hope to offer the same amendments. If \nthey are voted down again, and this body passes that bill, I very much \nhope the House of Representatives will look to these amendments as \nproviding a pathway to fixing this bill, to actually addressing the \nproblem.\n  The first amendment I offered was an amendment to actually secure the \nborders. The amendment I offered, unlike the current bill, which \nrequires the Secretary of Homeland Security to prepare a plan--and the \ntrigger is, when the Secretary prepares a plan, that triggers the \nlegalization provisions of this bill. Well, a plan to plan is, by \ndesign, toothless. Instead, the amendment I offered would have tripled \nthe size of the U.S. Border Patrol to put manpower on the ground, boots \non the ground, to solve the problem. It would have increased fourfold \nthe helicopters and fixed-wing assets and technology on the ground to \nsolve the problem. It would have put in place a biometric entry-exit \nsystem because 40 percent of the illegal immigration we have comes from \nvisa overstays.\n  Unfortunately, every single Democrat on the committee voted against \nthat amendment.\n  I offered two amendments to improve and substantially increase legal \nimmigration. On this point, let me pause for a second to note there is \nno more enthusiastic advocate of legal immigration in the Senate than I \nam. I am the son of an immigrant. I am the son of one who had been \nimprisoned and tortured in Cuba, who came to this country with nothing, \nseeking freedom, and we need to welcome and celebrate legal immigrants. \nSo I offered two amendments focusing on improving legal immigration so \nwe can continue to welcome those from all around the world coming here \nseeking freedom.\n  First, I offered an amendment concerning temporary high-skilled \nworker H-1B visas. H-1B high-skilled worker visas are overwhelmingly \nprogrowth. The economic data indicates that for every 100 H-1B high-\nskilled workers who come into this country, 183 jobs are created for \nU.S. citizens. The amendment I offered would take the current cap of H-\n1B visas, which is at 65,000, and increase it fivefold to 325,000. The \ncurrent bill, the Gang of 8 bill, goes up to 110,000. That is a step in \nthe right direction, but it does not go nearly far enough. There is far \nmore demand than that.\n  Right now, every year, we educate tens of thousands of foreign \nstudents at our universities. They get graduate degrees in mathematics, \nin engineering, in computer science. They get Ph.D.s, and then we send \nthem back to their countries, where they start businesses there, they \ncreate businesses there, they create jobs there, and they compete \nagainst us. It makes absolutely no sense. I think we need to expand \ndramatically high-skilled workers, and my amendment would increase it \nfivefold.\n  Every single Democrat on the committee voted against it.\n  I would note that the proponents of the bill often find themselves in \nSilicon Valley telling our friends in the high-tech industry how they \nare champions for helping get more programmers, engineers, computer \nscientists into this country. Yet I note again every single Democrat on \nthe Judiciary Committee voted against increasing H-1B high-skilled \nworkers. We need to increase that cap.\n  The second amendment I offered that would increase legal immigration \nwould double the overall cap on legal immigration from 675,000--the \ncurrent statutory cap--to 1.35 million per year so we can have a legal \nsystem that has employment-based immigration. When people have jobs, \nthey can meet areas of need, whether in agriculture or elsewhere. And \nthey can also come for family unification.\n  I am sorry to say many of my friends on the left side of the aisle--\nwho often describe themselves as advocates of the Hispanic community, \nadvocates of immigrants--every Democrat on the Judiciary Committee \nvoted in party line against increasing legal immigration and against \ndoubling the caps of legal immigration.\n  Finally, I introduced two other amendments that were both directed at \nrespecting and maintaining the rule of law. One amendment simply \neliminated the pathway to citizenship. What it provided is those people \nwho are here illegally shall not be eligible for citizenship.\n  It is important to note that under the existing bill, if my amendment \nhad been adopted, those who are here illegally would be eligible for \nwhat is called RPI status, a legal status, and, indeed, in time would \nbe eligible for legal permanent residency.\n  So the underlying bill gives legal status to the 11 million people \nwho are here illegally. The amendment I introduced simply said there \nneeds to be a consequence for having violated the law. It is unfair, in \nmy opinion, to the millions of legal immigrants who followed the \nrules--who stayed in line, who stayed in their home country years or \ndecades--to reward those who broke the law with a path to citizenship. \nI believe it is also critical to passing this bill to remove the path \nto citizenship, and yet every single Democrat on the committee voted \nparty line against this amendment.\n  The final amendment I introduced was an amendment that provided that \nthose who are here illegally shall not be eligible for State, local, or \nFederal means-tested welfare payments. This is an interesting issue \nbecause the advocates of the Gang of 8 bill frequently go on television \nand tell the American people: None of those granted amnesty in their \nbill will be given welfare. I have seen that. That is a central talking \npoint.\n  If that talking point were true, this should have been a very easy \namendment to adopt. Yet every single Democrat on the committee voted \nagainst this amendment. One of the reasons is, although the Gang of 8 \nbill for a period exempts those here illegally from Federal welfare, \nroughly $300 billion a year is spent in State welfare, and those\n\n[[Page S4091]]\n\ngiven amnesty under this bill would be eligible for a great portion of \nthat State welfare immediately, means-tested welfare.\n  In my view we should welcome people from across the world, but the \npeople we should be welcoming are those who are coming here to seek the \nAmerican dream, to work hard. I believe that is the vast majority of \nimmigrants who are coming here for a better life. We should not be \nputting into place systems where the hard-working American taxpayers \nare being taxed to provide welfare for those who are here illegally. I \nthink that respects the rule of law to say we will welcome you here if \nyou are working to provide for your family.\n  Each of those amendments was rejected. Often my friends on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle would say something like: I may agree with \nthis particular amendment, but there was a deal cut. I may agree, but \nthe union bosses, the special interests, the people in the closed-door \nrooms who negotiated this deal, we agreed on a level and we cannot \nincrease it. It may be good to increase high-skilled workers to \n325,000, but we cut a deal with the union bosses and we cannot change \nit.\n  That is not how legislation should be drafted. We should be fixing \nthe problem. We should be making our economy stronger. Right now, in my \nopinion, this bill is headed for failure. There should be no drama. \nThere should be no confusion.\n  Let's be clear. This bill, I am convinced, is going to pass the \nSenate. In fact, I think it is going to pass the Senate with a \nsubstantial margin. In all likelihood, near the end of this process \nthere will be an amendment or two directed at border security that the \nAmerican people will be told: OK, this finally puts teeth into the \nborder security provisions.\n  I hope those representations prove true.\n  Regardless of what happens on that, I believe the votes are already \nprecooked that this bill is going to pass the Senate. Absent major \nrevisions, absent revisions along the lines of the amendments I \nintroduced in committee and intend to introduce on the floor again, \nthis bill will crash and burn in the House. It is designed to do so. So \nhow do we save it? If we actually want to fix the problem, not have a \npolitical game but fix the problem, the answer is the American people. \nThe American people have to speak. If you want to see the border \nsecured, pick up the phone and let your elected Representative know. \nLet Senators know, let Members of the House know. Speak out online, \nspeak out publicly. When the American people speak out and speak out \nloudly, their voices are heard.\n  If you want legal immigration improved so that we welcome high-\nskilled workers, we welcome those seeking the American dream, speak \nout. If you want to respect the rule of law and not grant amnesty \nwithout securing the borders, speak out and speak out loud. Let me say, \nwhat needs to happen to change this dynamic is the key stakeholders \nneed to decide that failure is not an option. The high-tech community, \nthe business community, farmers and agricultural leaders need to decide \nthat they are not willing to have this entire bill held hostage to a \nprovision providing a pathway to citizenship that is certain to fail \nand designed to fail.\n  I want to speak finally to the Hispanic advocacy groups, to the many \nwho passionately pour their hearts into trying to improve the \nconditions of those in this country, including the 11 million who are \nhere illegally. I believe the current path this bill is on is a path \nthat is, by design, going to yield it to being voted down. I think that \nis why the Obama White House is insisting on a pathway to citizenship.\n  I would note in 2007 then-Senator Obama stood on the floor of this \nSenate and played a key role in killing immigration reform then for the \nsame reasons, for partisan reasons. Indeed, I would suggest a moment of \nclarity came in the Judiciary Committee markup when a senior Democrat, \nwho is one of the sponsors of this bill, said: If there is no path to \ncitizenship, there can be no reform.\n  I think that sentence summed it up. I certainly thank that senior \nDemocrat for his candor because he made clear there was one \noverwhelming partisan objective, which is a path to citizenship. In his \njudgment, if that partisan objective could not be accomplished 100 \npercent, he was willing to do nothing, zero, to improve the border. He \nwas willing to do nothing, zero, to improve legal immigration--nothing, \nzero, to expand high-tech immigration; nothing, zero, to improve \nfarmers and agricultural workers; and most telling, nothing, zero, to \nimprove the condition of the 11 million people currently here illegally \nbecause, based on the Obama White House position that with no path to \ncitizenship we will take our marbles and go home, we will crater this \nentire bill. That outcome means those 11 million remain in the shadows, \nhave no legal status. Whereas, if the proponents of this bill actually \ndemonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the \ntime, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground, \nthat would fix the problem and also allow for those 11 million people \nwho are here illegally a legal status with citizenship off the table.\n  I believe that is the compromise that can pass. But, at least right \nnow, the partisan advocates of this bill are not willing to accept \nthat. The only thing that can change that is if the American people \nspeak out. The only thing that can change that is if the stakeholders \nmake clear to the Obama White House, to the Senate Democrats, failure \nis not an option; that if this fails, because as a political matter you \ninsisted on a path to citizenship and threw everything else overboard, \nthat failure would be unacceptable.\n  I very much hope we work together in a bipartisan manner to fix this \nproblem in a way that secures the border, in a way that respects the \nrule of law, and in a way that improves legal immigration so we remain \na nation that welcomes and celebrates legal immigrants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I have a more robust statement that I \nintend to make later. But since I understand the time is truncated, I \nwill wait for that because I am not going to equivocate on something \nthat I feel passionately about and something that I have worked on a \nlong time as part of the Gang of 8 to achieve. So, hopefully, I will \nget to that later today.\n  I did want to take advantage of the time that is available to just \ncreate a certain context having just heard from my colleague from \nTexas. I am glad he acknowledges this bill will pass the Senate. I \nbelieve the bill will pass the Senate because the American people are \ntired of a broken immigration system that neither meets our values, \npreserves our security, or promotes our economy. That is what is \ndriving the American people in poll after poll and saying it is time to \nfix our broken system.\n  Now, I have heard the comments about this bill will pass the Senate, \nbut it will not pass the House. Well, having served in the House, I am \nnot quite sure anybody can make that determination. Part of it will be \nwhat leadership wants to achieve in the House and what it does not seek \nto achieve.\n  I would not negotiate against myself, against a process in the House \nwhich I am unaware of at this moment of exactly how they are going to \npursue it. So why would I seek to diminish the Senate's prerogative to \nsend what they think is the appropriate reform on immigration to the \nHouse for their consideration. I would not want to do that. That is \nwhat conferences are all about.\n  So if the House has a different view as to how we reform our broken \nimmigration system, has a different view as to how we ensure the \nnational security of the United States, has a different view as to how \nwe promote the economic interests that immigration reform does promote, \nhas a different view as to how we ensure that workers' wages are not \nsuppressed by having an underclass of millions of people who are \nexploited and therefore bringing down the wages of all other American \nworkers, fine. Let them express their view and then we can come \ntogether in a conference and negotiate what hopefully can be a final \nversion to be sent to the President.\n  I find it ironic that my colleague from Texas consistently refers to \nSenate Democrats insisting on a pathway to citizenship. I assume he \ntakes the mantle of the Republican Party and says all Republicans \nbelieve there should be no pathway to citizenship. That, obviously, is \nrejected by the four\n\n[[Page S4092]]\n\ncolleagues who worked with me for months: Senator McCain, Senator \nGraham, Senator Flake, and Senator Rubio, who believe a pathway to \ncitizenship is an important ingredient toward achieving the \ncomprehensive reform we all want, as well as others who have expressed \nsupport for that concept.\n  I know it may be popular with some of my colleagues to invoke \nPresident Obama's name as some type of red herring in this process. The \nbottom line is the bill we are debating, or I hope we will be debating \nafter the motion to proceed shortly, is about finding the fixes to our \nbroken immigration system that was devised by four Democrats and four \nRepublicans and has since been supported by more. So it is not about \nPresident Obama. It is about getting the Senate to function and to \nsolve one of the critical issues facing this country.\n  I heard the suggestion that only Senate Democrats got amendments they \nwanted and they opposed amendments of Republicans in the Judiciary \nCommittee. My understanding is that there were 136 amendments adopted \nin the Judiciary Committee, of which all but three were bipartisan \namendments or Republican-sponsored amendments. So I respect that the \nSenator had amendments and maybe his view did not prevail, but it is \nnot true that there was not a bipartisan process that led to 136 \namendments to the original proposition of the Gang of 8 put forward in \norder to be able to move forward. As a matter of fact, I think some of \nthose who have opposed and still oppose comprehensive immigration \nreform--I know there are some that if 10 angels came swearing from \nabove that this would be the right policy for America, they would say, \nno, you are wrong to the 10 angels.\n  I get it. I understand where they are, but the process held in the \nJudiciary Committee was about as open, transparent, and fair as you \ncould have. That is why there are 136 changes to our proposal by virtue \nof the Judiciary Committee.\n  Finally, this reference to union bosses. I don't know any union \nbosses who were in any room. As a matter of fact, part of the \ncompromise is that labor didn't get everything it wanted, neither did \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce. But they both agreed, and they were \nstanding behind us when we announced this legislation, in saying this \nis good for America.\n  Big business, the AFL-CIO, United Farm Workers with the big agro \ngrowers in this country, the most progressive pro-immigrant groups with \nGrover Norquist and the Americans for Tax Reform, all say this \nlegislation is what is important and necessary for America.\n  Everybody is entitled to their opinion, but you are not entitled to \nyour own facts. I expect, during the course of this debate, to make \nsure that at least when we are debating, we are debating the same \nfacts.\n  This legislation is good for our country. It will reform our broken \nimmigration system. It will let me know who is here to pursue the \nAmerican dream versus who might be here to do it harm. It will create \neconomic opportunity for all Americans. It will add more taxpayers to \nthe rolls of this country so there can be true, shared burden at the \nend of the day. It will create greater enterprise, as is exhibited by \nthe high-tech companies, of which so many have been created by \nimmigrants in this country.\n  I look forward to a fuller opportunity to present all of the reasons \nwhy this legislation, including tough border security provisions, more \nthan ever before, more money spent than ever before--that this, in \nfact, will be spent in an intelligent way and in a way that ultimately, \ncumulatively, creates for border security more money than we are \nspending in domestic law enforcement as a whole.\n  I look forward to that opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to talk about four claims this \nbill makes, these four claims that are on the chart, to disprove those \nclaims under certain circumstances.\n  Before I do that, everybody who has spoken so far has said we have to \npass a bill. I don't disagree with that but not just any bill. A bill \nthat secures the border is very necessary. The status quo is not \njustifiable. We have to realize the reality of the fact that we can't \ngather 11 or 12 million people to deport, and if we did that, we would \nhurt the economy. That is the reality.\n  To get around that, we have to get a bill that gets through the \nSenate, the House of Representatives, and that the President approves.\n  My main goal throughout these next 2 or 3 weeks is to develop a bill \nthat accomplishes that but to stress that a lot of things that have \nbeen said by the authors of this legislation are not accurate. I will \ntake a few minutes to discuss how the authors have tried to sell the \nimmigration bill and what I see as false advertising.\n  Legislators are in the business of selling ideas. With this bill, the \nAmerican people are being sold a product. They are being asked to \naccept legalization and, in exchange, they would be assured through \nthis legislation that the laws are going to be enforced.\n  Normally consumers are able to read the labels of things they are \nabout to purchase. They would have to read about 1,175 pages of this \nbill to know what it truly says. Even a quick read of the bill would \nleave many shaking their heads in confusion.\n  You have heard the phrase, ``The devil is in the details.'' At first \nthe proposal that the bipartisan group put forward sounded very \nreasonable, but we need to examine the fine print and take a closer \nlook at what the bill does.\n  As I noted yesterday, I thought the framework; that is, when they \nstarted working on it, held hope. I realized the assurances the Gang of \n8 made didn't translate when the bill language emerged.\n  They professed that the border would be secured and that people would \nearn their legal status. However, the bill, as drafted, is legalization \nfirst, enforcement later, if at all.\n  I would like to dive into the details and give a little reality check \nto those who expect this bill to do exactly as the authors promise. \nWhat do the proponents of this bill say the legislation will do?\n  The first thing on my chart is, ``People will have to pay a penalty'' \nto obtain legal status.\n  The bill lays out the application procedure. On page 972, a penalty \nis imposed on those who apply for registered provisional immigration \nstatus. It says that those who apply must pay $1,000 to the Department \nof Homeland Security. It waives the penalty for anyone under 21 years. \nYet on the next page it allows the applicant to pay the penalty in \ninstallments. The bill says:\n\n       The Secretary shall establish a process for collecting \n     payments . . . that permit the penalty to be paid in periodic \n     installments that shall be completed before the alien may be \n     granted an extension of status.\n\n  In effect, this says the applicant has 6 years to pay the $1,000. \nThat is how long it takes to get RPI status. In addition to the \npenalty, applicants would pay a processing fee, a level set by the \nSecretary.\n  The bill says the Secretary has the discretion to waive the \nprocessing fee for any classes of individuals that she chooses and may \nlimit the maximum fee paid by a family.\n  The fact is, the bill doesn't actually require everyone to pay a \npenalty. In view of the waiver, it doesn't require anyone to pay it \nwhen they apply for legal status. In fact, they may never have to pay a \npenalty.\n  Let's go to No. 2 on the chart. ``People will have to pay back \ntaxes'' to receive legal status. In reality, members of the Gang of 8 \nstated over and over that their bill would require undocumented \nindividuals to pay back taxes prior to being granted legal status. \nHowever, the bill before us fails to make good on the promise. \nProponents of the bill point to a provision in the bill that prohibits \npeople from filing for legal status ``unless the applicant has \nsatisfied any applicable Federal tax liability.''\n\n  It sounds good, right? As always, the devil is in the details. There \nare two important weaknesses with how the bill defines ``applicable \nFederal tax liability.''\n  First, the bill limits the definition to exclude employer taxes, \nSocial Security taxes, Medicare taxes. Think of that exclusion.\n  Second, the bill does not require the payment of all back taxes \nlegally owed. What it requires is a payment of taxes assessed by the \nInternal Revenue Service. Think of the IRS assessing. In\n\n[[Page S4093]]\n\norder to assess a tax, the IRS first must have information on which to \nbase this assessment. Our tax system is largely a voluntary system on \nself-reporting. It also relies on certain third-party reporting, such \nas wages reported by the employer; that is, the W-2 form.\n  If someone has been working unlawfully in the country and working off \nthe books, it is likely that neither an individual return or third-\nparty return will exist. Thus, no assessment will exist and no taxes \nwill be paid.\n  Similarly, it is very unlikely that an assessment will exist for \nthose who have worked under false Social Security numbers and never \npaid a tax. A legal obligation exists to pay taxes on all income from \nwhatever sources derived. Nothing in this bill provides a requirement \nor a mechanism to accomplish this prior to granting legal status.\n  One of the gang members in January said this:\n\n       Shouldn't citizens pay back taxes? We can trace their \n     employment back. It doesn't take a genius.\n\n  While it may seem common sense, the other side of the aisle is going \nto argue that establishing the requirement to pay back taxes owed, \nrather than assessed, is unworkable and costly. They will also claim \nthat imposing additional tax barriers on this population could prevent \nundocumented workers and their families from coming forward.\n  The sales pitch has been clear. To get legal status, one has to pay \nback taxes. Let me provide a reality check. The bill doesn't make good \non the promises made.\n  Third, they say people will have to learn English. In reality, the \nbill as drafted is supposed to ensure that new Americans speak a common \nlanguage. Learning English is a way new residents assimilate. This is \nan issue that is very important. Immigrants before us made a concerted \neffort to learn English. The proponents are claiming the bill fulfills \nthis wish.\n  However, the bill does not require people here unlawfully to learn \nEnglish before receiving legal status or even a green card. Under \nsection 2101, a person with RPI status who applies for a green card \nonly has to pursue a course of study to achieve an understanding of \nEnglish and knowledge and understanding of civics.\n  If the people who gain legal access ever apply for citizenship--and \nsome doubt this will happen to a majority of the undocumented \npopulation--they would have to pass an English proficiency exam as \nrequired under current law. Yes, after 13 years one would have to pass \nan exam, but the bill does very little to ensure that those who come \nout of the shadows will cherish or use an English language. The reality \nis that English isn't as much of a priority for the proponents of the \nbill as much as they claim it is.\n  Fourth and last, they say, ``People won't get public benefits'' when \nthey choose to apply for legal status. The reality is Americans are \nvery compassionate and generous. Many people can understand providing \nsome legal status to people here illegally. One major sticking point, \nfor those who question a legalization program, is the fact that \nlawbreakers could become eligible for public benefits and taxpayer \nsubsidies.\n  The authors of the bill understood this, thank God. In an attempt to \nshow that those who receive RPI status would not receive taxpayers' \nbenefits, they included a provision that prohibited the population from \nreceiving certain benefits. There are two major problems with the bill \non this point.\n  First, those who receive RPI status will be immediately eligible for \nState and local welfare benefits. For instance, many States offer cash, \nmedical, and food assistance through State-only programs to lawfully \npresent citizens.\n  Second, the bill contains a welfare waiver loophole that could allow \nthose with RPI status to receive Federal welfare dollars. The Obama \nadministration has pushed the envelope by waiving welfare laws. If this \nloophole isn't closed, they could waive existing laws and allow funds \nprovided under the welfare block grant, known as Temporary Assistance \nto Needy Families, to be provided to noncitizens.\n  Senator Hatch had an amendment during committee markup that would \nprohibit U.S. Department of HHS from waiving certain requirements of \nthe TANF Program. His amendment would also prohibit any Federal agency \nfrom waiving restriction on eligibility of immigrants for public \nbenefits.\n  The reality check for the American people is that there are loopholes \nand the potential for public benefits to go to those who are legalized \nunder the bill.\n  Again, the devil is in the details. I hope this reality check will \nencourage proponents of the bill to fix these problems before the bill \nis passed in the Senate.\n  The American people deserve truth in advertising. We can't maintain \nthe status quo on immigration. A bill should pass, but the bill that \npasses should actually do what the authors say it will do. I have tried \nto point out some of the promises that may not be kept.\n  Authorized waivers in this bill--and I have used that word a few \ntimes--delegate to the Secretary to actually take action contrary to \nwhat is claimed by the authors and, hence, can undercut the intentions \nof the authors. We should legislate then and not delegate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the motion to proceed to S. 744.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

STATEMENT OF CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The passage of this Act recognizes that the primary \n     tenets of its success depend on securing the sovereignty of \n     the United States of America and establishing a coherent and \n     just system for integrating those who seek to join American \n     society.\n       (2) We have a right, and duty, to maintain and secure our \n     borders, and to keep our country safe and prosperous. As a \n     Nation founded, built and sustained by immigrants we also \n     have a responsibility to harness the power of that tradition \n     in a balanced way that secures a more prosperous future for \n     America.\n       (3) We have always welcomed newcomers to the United States \n     and will continue to do so. But in order to qualify for the \n     honor and privilege of eventual citizenship, our laws must be \n     followed. The world depends on America to be strong--\n     economically, militarily and ethically. The establishment of \n     a stable, just, and efficient immigration system only \n     supports those goals. As a Nation, we have the right and \n     responsibility to make our borders safe, to establish clear \n     and just rules for seeking citizenship, to control the flow \n     of legal immigration, and to eliminate illegal immigration, \n     which in some cases has become a threat to our national \n     security.\n       (4) All parts of this Act are premised on the right and \n     need of the United States to achieve these goals, and to \n     protect its borders and maintain its sovereignty.\n\n[[Page S4096]]\n\n     SEC. 3.

HUMAN TRAFFICKING REPORTING.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Human \n     Trafficking Reporting Act of 2013''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Human trafficking is a form of modern-day slavery.\n       (2) According to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of \n     2000 ``severe forms of trafficking in persons'' means--\n       (A) sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is \n     induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person \n     induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age; \n     or\n       (B) the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, \n     or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the \n     use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of \n     subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, \n     or slavery.\n       (3) There is an acute need for better data collection of \n     incidents of human trafficking across the United States in \n     order to effectively combat severe forms of trafficking in \n     persons.\n       (4) The State Department's 2012 Trafficking in Persons \n     report found that--\n       (A) the United States is a ``source, transit and \n     destination country for men, women, and children, subjected \n     to forced labor, debt bondage, domestic servitude and sex \n     trafficking,''; and\n       (B) the United States needs to ``improve data collection on \n     human trafficking cases at the federal, state and local \n     levels''.\n       (5) The International Organization for Migration has \n     reported that in order to effectively combat human \n     trafficking there must be reliable and standardized data, \n     however, the following barriers for data collection exist:\n       (A) The illicit and underground nature of human \n     trafficking.\n       (B) The reluctance of victims to share information with \n     authorities.\n       (C) Insufficient human trafficking data collection and \n     research efforts by governments worldwide.\n       (6) A 2009 report to the Department of Health and Human \n     Services entitled Human Trafficking Into and Within the \n     United States: A Review of the Literature found that ``the \n     data and methodologies for estimating the prevalence of human \n     trafficking globally and nationally are not well developed, \n     and therefore estimates have varied widely and changed \n     significantly over time''.\n       (7) The Federal Bureau of Investigation compiles national \n     crime statistics through the Uniform Crime Reporting Program.\n       (8) Under current law, State and local governments \n     receiving Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance grants are \n     required to share data on part 1 violent crimes with the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation for inclusion in the Uniform \n     Crime Reporting Program.\n       (9) The addition of severe forms of trafficking in persons \n     to the definition of part 1 violent crimes will ensure that \n     statistics on this heinous crime will be compiled and \n     available through the Federal Bureau of Investigation's \n     Uniform Crime Report.\n       (c) Human Trafficking To Be Included in Part 1 Violent \n     Crimes for Purposes of Byrne Grants.--Section 505 of the \n     Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. \n     3755) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(i) Part 1 Violent Crimes To Include Human Trafficking.--\n     For purposes of this section, the term `part 1 violent \n     crimes' shall include severe forms of trafficking in persons, \n     as defined in section 103(8) of the Trafficking Victims \n     Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7102(8)).''.\n\n     SEC. 1120.

INTERNATIONAL PARTICIPATION IN THE PERFORMING \n                   ARTS.\n\n       Section 214(c)(6)(D) (8 U.S.C. 1184(c)(6)(D)) is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence, by inserting ``(i)'' before \n     ``Any person'';\n       (2) in the second sentence--\n       (A) by striking ``Once'' and inserting ``Except as provided \n     in clause (ii), once''; and\n       (B) by striking ``Attorney General shall'' and inserting \n     ``Secretary of Homeland Security shall'';\n       (3) in the third sentence, by striking ``The Attorney \n     General'' and inserting ``The Secretary''; and\n       (4) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(ii) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall adjudicate \n     each petition for an alien with extraordinary ability in the \n     arts (as described in section 101(a)(15)(O)(i)), an alien \n     accompanying such an alien (as described in clauses (ii) and \n     (iii) of section 101(a)(15)(O)), or an alien described in \n     section 101(a)(15)(P) (other than an alien described in \n     paragraph (4)(A) (relating to athletes)) not later than 14 \n     days after--\n       ``(I) the date on which the petitioner submits the petition \n     with a written advisory opinion, letter of no objection, or \n     request for a waiver; or\n       ``(II) the date on which the 15-day period described in \n     clause (i) has expired, if the petitioner has had an \n     appropriate opportunity to supply rebuttal evidence.\n       ``(iii) If a petition described in clause (ii) is not \n     adjudicated before the end of the 14-day period described in \n     clause (ii) and the petitioner is an arts organization \n     described in paragraph (3), (5), or (6) of section 501(c) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from tax under \n     section 501(a) of such Code for the taxable year preceding \n     the calendar year in which the petition is submitted, or an \n     individual or entity petitioning primarily on behalf of such \n     an organization, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall \n     provide the petitioner with the premium processing services \n     referred to in section 286(u), without a fee.''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I note that amendment is on behalf of \nSenator Hatch and myself.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask through the Chair if the Senator from \nVermont would yield for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will yield for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 953\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, July 1 is less than 3 weeks away, and unless \nCongress acts, the interest rate on need-based student loans will \ndouble from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent, making college more expensive \nfor more than 7 million students across the Nation. Therefore, I ask \nunanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the majority \nleader, following consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 74, S. 953, the \nStudent Loan Affordability Act; that the bill be read a third time, the \nSenate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, and the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I \nappreciate the intent of my colleague and that he wants to try to solve \nthis problem. As he knows, several of us have another proposal. What I \nsuggest is that we compromise on the President's proposal. It is a \ncombination, it is a hybrid, and the President is trying to address \nthis matter.\n  Rather than us having dueling unanimous consent requests and playing \nthe political game, I propose that we need to solve the problem. I \nwould be happy to work with the Senator to try to bring the President's \nproposal to the Senate, which does fix this permanently. It fixes it \nfor all of the loans, not just 40 percent of the loans, and it gives \npeople certainty.\n  If my colleague hasn't yet seen the CBO's accounting today, it shows \nthat there are no savings in this; rather, there is a cost. No matter \nwhose program it is, there is a cost, and this is on accurate \naccounting. This should give us all pause to try to fix this for the \nlong term.\n  I object to the Senator's unanimous consent but would offer a \nunanimous consent for the President's proposal or work with my \ncolleague to try to get us to a point where we can solve this problem \nfor those who are in the student loan program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I certainly respect my colleague's words \nabout working together. I think we have to work together. I also \nrespect the fact that he has made a proposal and the President has made \na proposal. In my mind, both proposals fall very short on several \nissues. First, they use a baseline rate of the 10-year T-bill, which we \nhave not generally used before for setting student loan interest rates. \nThere is no cap on either proposal. One of the advantages the \nPresident's proposal has, I will admit, is income-based repayment. So I \nhave serious reservations about both proposals.\n  I think the issue that faces us now is when we talk about trying to \ncreate a long-term solution, it is not just about structuring interest \nrates, it is also about refinancing loans that exist today and those \nthat may come due in the future. Student loan debt is one of the \ngreatest hindrances to young people today and ultimately to our economy \nin terms of buying homes and doing the things we expect college \ngraduates could do before they turn 30--things that are going to be put \non hold because they are paying off huge debts.\n  The other thing we have to do is look at the structure of costs for \ncolleges and the extraordinary growth in college costs.\n  So rather than simply saying we fix the problem by going to a higher \nmarket rate, which, by the way, will cost all borrowers, particularly \nlow- and middle-income borrowers, significantly more money--that is not \nfixing the problem. In many cases, it is creating a new set of \nproblems. It will saddle present students with higher interest payments \nand higher loans. In the long run, it will not deal with this crushing \ndebt that already exists for those people who have been borrowing.\n  I recognize that we have to work together. My concern is one of \ncalendar. We have less than 3 weeks. There is no doubt that we are \ngoing to be on the floor with this very important historic immigration \nbill for all of those 3 weeks. I don't think we will have the time to \nfashion a balanced approach for all of these different issues, bring it \nto the floor, and have the kind of vigorous debate that is very \nimportant.\n  So I clearly recognize that we need long-term solutions, but what we \ndon't need to do is double interest rates on students. It is going to \nimmediately impact families across this Nation.\n  Again, the Senator has been very forthright but also thoughtful in \nterms of making a proposal. We disagree, but he has come to the floor \nwith a long-term solution. I believe we have to work toward a long-term \nsolution. My sense is that it will not be done in 3 weeks. It cannot \npossibly even get to the floor. Even if we came to a meeting of the \nminds, there is always a possibility that one or two of our colleagues \nwill say: I have a different approach, and therefore we won't have the \nprocedural means to reach the floor.\n  So I am actually asking simply to let us have the time to work \nthoughtfully on a bipartisan basis to craft not a solution to a rate \nissue but a comprehensive approach to the issues that burden every \nfamily in this country, which include, how do I afford college? What do \nthe colleges do to make it more affordable? What do we do to make loans \nbe more consistent with market rates but with protections for \nborrowers?\n  On a final point, I was in law school and had the benefit of Federal \nassistance. In 1981 market-based rates under the Republican proposal \nwould have reached about 17 percent. With the cost of college now, I \ncannot imagine borrowing that kind of money at a 17-percent fixed-\ninterest rate. Students would be financially flattened before they got \ntheir degree.\n  Again, I appreciate the objection. The objection has been made, and I \nthank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I believe I still have the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask if the Senator would mind yielding \nto me before I go to my next meeting. I will only take 3 or 4 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator for that \npurpose without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. We are going to borrow $1.6 trillion over the next 10 \nyears to fund student loans. The differential between what that costs \nthe Treasury\n\n[[Page S4197]]\n\nand what somebody pays--we are going to have subsidies in this no \nmatter what. The question is, How much are the subsidies? We are \ntalking about subsidized student loans, but all of these end up with a \ncap of 8.25 percent when the student loans are consolidated, which all \nof them are. We can have an income-based repayment plan, but there is \nstill a cap when a student ultimately gets through school.\n  The whole purpose behind this is to get some long-term plan so we can \ncontrol the cost. If, in fact, we have 3.4 percent and the rates go to \nthat, that means the average American taxpayer is subsidizing at 14 \npercent of that cost.\n  I agree with the Senator that we, in fact, need to fix the cost \ndrivers in a collegiate education, but one of the cost drivers is us. \nSenator Alexander and Senator Harkin have major bills on both of those. \nI agree that we are not going to get that debate done. I do think we \ncan come to a compromise between what we have proposed and what the \nPresident proposed and what the Senator from Rhode Island is proposing \nthat will solve the long-term problem. A 2-year extension doesn't do us \nany good, and it only does 40 percent. The cost the Senator outlined is \na subscription to Netflix at $14 a month. That is the cost differential \nbetween my colleague's bill and what we are proposing. Somewhere in \nbetween there has to be a compromise.\n  My colleague from Rhode Island has my commitment that I will work \nwith him to do that. If we--myself, Senator Alexander, Senator Burr, \nthe Senator from Rhode Island, and those on the Democratic side--can \nforge something out in the next 3 weeks, we are more than happy to do \nit.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments from the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma. As far as the legislation that has been passed by the \nHouse Republicans, we know that for the 4 years of borrowing at the \nmaximum loan amounts, for students entering college in 2018 and 2019, \nit would be $5,650 more. Whatever subsidy we are giving, those families \nare going to see $5,650 more in costs to their student loans. I am told \nthe Senate Republican version would increase costs, versus current \nrates, by $6,700.\n  So talking about the subsidies we are giving and not giving disguises \nthe fact that if we don't act by July 1, we are going to see students \nover the next several years increasing their debt, not decreasing it \nand not even holding it constant.\n  The other remarkable thing is that we score things based on budget \nCBO scoring. I am also informed that based upon the cost of borrowing, \nthe Federal Government and their lending--they are making billions of \ndollars a year now on student loans. It is a profit center for the \nFederal Government. And, indeed, in looking at the 10-year projections \nfor the bill that I believe was submitted by my Republican colleagues, \nthere is a projected $15.6 billion in additional savings or income to \nthe Federal Government.\n  We are in this irony where students are now going to be contributing \nbillions of dollars to deficit reduction, weapons platforms, and other \nprograms, but the reality they are going to see is that this mountain \nof debt they have today is much higher. Too many of them will not be \nable to climb it, and too many others won't even begin the trip. It \nwill result in an economy that is underperforming and potential \nstudents who don't go to college, and therefore their income will be a \nfraction of what it would be, and in the long run our economy will \nsuffer grievously. Again, these are extraordinarily complicated, \nchallenging, interrelated, and difficult issues.\n  I would like to believe we could get this done in 3 weeks. With the \n100 Senators who are with us, the possibility of getting anything done \nin 3 weeks is virtually nil.\n  I thank the chairman from Vermont, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on amendment No. 1183, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the distinguished senior Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, be \na cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will speak on this amendment at greater \nlength just before the vote. It makes a small but important improvement \nin the processing of visas that are required by foreign performing \nartists before performing in American orchestras and other arts \norganizations. It has to be processed in a timely way.\n\n  We have had instances where orchestras, for example, in this country \nhave had the privilege of having a visiting artist, maybe the best in \ntheir field--violinist, pianist, or whatever else--but the process of \ngetting a visa is slowed up. Yet they plan performances on a certain \ndate. This measure was included in the comprehensive immigration bills \nof 2006 and 2007 but not enacted. This would not give an automatic visa \nto these artists but simply says their application, instead of being in \nthe bottom of the pile, would be considered in a timely fashion.\n  On another matter, as we get into this debate, I have defended the \nFirst Amendment, American's right to speak. I have done it even when \npeople have said things about me that I wish they didn't. But I also \nhave a right as a Senator to comment on such speech. I saw a couple of \npaid political advertisements today in Politico, one that personally \nattacks Senator Rubio and the other directly attacks the Senators who \ndrafted the legislative proposal before us, four Republicans and four \nDemocrats. The attacks are so far off the mark. They have a right to \nmake the attacks, and certainly the publication has the right to print \nthem. I would suggest that something this far out of line, this \ncompletely unfair type of attack, doesn't do anything to help the \npublic debate we are having.\n  We had a debate with the 18 members of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nand had before us some 300 amendments, passed 141, including second-\ndegree amendments, and we did it in a respectful way. Both Republican \nand Democratic amendments came up. In some areas we had major \ndisagreements among the members, but we did it respectfully and did not \nimpugn the motives of people on either side. I would say this kind of \npersonal insult, this level of discourse, is not conducive to real \ndebate. It helps neither side. It helps neither side.\n  I don't think this is a time for name-calling. Let's work together. \nWe know the immigration system we now have in this country is not \nadequate for the needs of the country or the people in this country. So \nlet's stop the name calling. Let's stop the false accusations. I say \nthis in defense of Senator Rubio, as well as all members of the Gang of \n8, the four Republicans and four Democrats named in these ads. Let's \nwork together to have a better debate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1195\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside to call up amendment No. 1195.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for himself, and Mr. \n     Blunt, proposes an amendment numbered 1195.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the granting of registered provisional immigrant \n  status until the Secretary has maintained effective control of the \n                         borders for 6 months)\n\n       On page 855, strike line 24 and all that follows through \n     page 856, line 9, and insert the following:\n       (1) Processing of applications for registered provisional \n     immigrant status.--Not earlier than the date upon which the \n     Secretary has submitted to Congress a certification that the \n     Secretary has maintained effective control of the Southern \n     border for a period of not less 6 months, the Secretary\n\n[[Page S4198]]\n\n     may commence processing applications for registered \n     provisional immigrant status pursuant to section 245B of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act, as added by section 2101 of \n     this Act.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this amendment is the first of many that \nwill improve the bill and do what the American people expect us to do.\n  The American people are being asked to accept a legalization program \nand, in exchange for that--and that is a very compassionate approach--\nwe would be assured and the American people would be assured that the \nlaws were going to be enforced. But as we read the details of the bill, \nit is clear the approach taken is to legalize first and enforce later.\n  My amendment would fundamentally change that. The amendment now \npending would require the Secretary to certify to Congress that the \nSecretary has maintained effective control over the entire southern \nborder for 6 months before proceeding and processing applications for \nregistered provisional immigration status. It is a commonsense \napproach: Border security first. Legalize second.\n  To summarize, the bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, \nwithin 6 months that a bill is signed into law, to submit a \n``comprehensive southern border security strategy'' as well as another \nplan called the ``southern border fencing strategy.''\n  After those so-called plans are submitted to Congress, the Secretary \ncan start processing applications to legalize the 12 million people who \nare in the United States. The result is that those who are undocumented \nwould become legal after a mere plan is submitted--not even considering \nif the plan will work.\n  There are two major flaws. The first is, Why do we need legislation \nto have the Secretary submit a border security strategy? Isn't that \nalready the Secretary's responsibility? Do we really need to pass a law \nto tell her to do her job? We shouldn't have to.\n  This is a reminder of what comes up in my town meetings in the State \nof Iowa. I have had 73 of those in the 99 counties already. When I \nstart, somebody will ask me about immigration. So I try to give them an \nupdate on where we are on the immigration legislation and what I \nbelieve about it. But invariably, without a doubt, somebody, before I \nstart to explain, says, We don't need any more legislation. All we have \nto do is enforce what is already on the books and we wouldn't have a \nproblem. So that gets kind of back to the point: Why do we need more \nplans? Isn't it the Secretary's responsibility already to enforce the \nlaw?\n  Second, the bill would start legalization even if the Secretary's \nstrategies are flawed and inadequate. What if this Secretary isn't \ncommitted to fencing? What if this Secretary believes the border is \nmore secure than ever? Well, in fact, Secretary Napolitano told the \ncommittee she thought our borders were secure. That ought to concern \nall of us, and for sure we couldn't sell that proposition to some of \nthe people who come to my town meetings in Iowa.\n  RPI status is more than probation. RPI status is legalization. Once a \nperson gets RPI, they get the freedom to live in the United States. \nThey can travel, work, and benefit from everything our country offers. \nRPI status is de facto permanent legalization. We all know it will \nnever be taken away. Given the history of these types of programs, we \nknow it will never end.\n  My amendment improves the trigger and fulfills the wishes of the \nAmerican people: Secure the borders. My amendment ensures the border is \nsecured before one person gets legal status under this act.\n  If we pass the bill as is, there will be no pressure on this \nadministration or any future administration to secure the borders. \nThere will be no push by the legalization advocates to get that job \ndone. We need to work together to secure the border first, including \nMembers of Congress, members of the administration, business leaders, \nunion leaders, and advocates for all kinds of immigration people. We \nneed to be in the same boat to push for secure borders. But if we have \nlegalization before we know the border is secure, then we break up and \nbalkanize the advocates for immigration reform and the promise that \ngoes with it of border security. So we need to secure the border for \nseveral reasons so we are not back in the same position 20 years from \nnow. We need to protect U.S. sovereignty. We need to protect homeland \nsecurity and improve national security.\n\n  There are a variety of threats to our border. There are potential \nterrorists and transnational criminals. Foreign nationals use the \nporous border to import threatening goods such as weapons of mass \ndestruction, illegal drugs, contraband, counterfeit products, and other \nproducts meant to harm Americans or hurt our economy.\n  Under my amendment the Secretary would have to prove that we have \n``effective control''--and I have not changed that definition of \n``effective control;'' it is as defined in the bill--and to do it for \nat least 6 months before applications for RPI status are processed.\n  I agree with at least one of the authors of this bill. If this border \nsecurity title is not improved, this bill does not stand a chance of \nmaking it all the way to the President of the United States.\n  My amendment is this very necessary first step of fixing this issue.\n  People do not trust the government will get this right or that this \nadministration is dedicated to securing the border. We do not need a \nnew bill to do that. All we need to do is prove to the American people \nthat we are sincere and we will secure the border. That is what is \npromised by the authors. I do not doubt their good intentions. But when \nyou have a plan submitted, and that is the basis for legalization, it \nseems to me we ought to have proof that the border is secure. So let's \nwait until the border is secure and then legalize.\n  I thank the chairman for the courtesy of offering this first \namendment. Also, the chairman was not here when I spoke yesterday, but \nI said that he promised an open and transparent process in committee, \nand we had that transparent, open process, and I thank the chairman for \ndoing that and seeing that it was done. I hope that process can \ncontinue on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I appreciate the words of my friend of \ndecades, the Senator from Iowa. He and I worked very closely to have an \nopen and transparent process. Whether we agreed or disagreed on an \nissue, we tried to move it on. After all, it worked better that way \nbecause of the 18 members of the committee, we were the two who had to \nspend the most time during it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. All the time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. All the time. I appreciate working with him. We were able \nto pretty well decide when matters would come up and make sure that \nboth Republicans and Democrats had a chance to bring up all their \namendments, and we adopted 136 or so amendments, including second-\ndegree amendments, and all but one or two of them were bipartisan \nvotes. I appreciate what he said and I enjoyed working with him on \nthat.\n  I will have more to say at another time about his amendment. But I \njust note for the past several days Senators have been discussing the \nimmigration bill, and I am glad the Senate has now turned to actually \nconsider it. We have had a lot of talk about getting to it, including, \nof course, the time spent in the Judiciary Committee.\n  I intend to file a handful of amendments to the bill today, and I \nwould encourage others to do the same so we can get to work without \nfurther delay.\n  The bipartisan immigration bill is a measure the Senate should come \ntogether on to pass. We should send to the House the best bill we can, \nand I think the large majority of Senators want to do that.\n  We should do what is right, what is fair, and what is just. The House \nhas to consider comprehensive immigration reform legislation without \nany further delay.\n  This year one of the most important bills we enacted into law was the \nViolence Against Women Reauthorization Act. From the outset I worked \nwith my Republican colleague Senator Crapo to develop that legislation \nin a bipartisan way. We called in Senators from both sides of the \naisle. We had cosponsors from both parties. We took suggestions and \namendments from both Democrats and Republicans. Then we built a \nmajority of Senators in support.\n  I worked very hard to keep that as a bipartisan issue when, frankly, \nwe had\n\n[[Page S4199]]\n\nsome on both sides of the aisle who wanted to make it a partisan issue.\n  Last year we were able to have our bill considered. It passed the \nSenate with 68 votes--obviously, a bipartisan majority. \nParenthetically, I would note that yesterday we passed the farm bill \nwith fewer votes than that, but the New York Times described that farm \nbill, and rightly so, as having ``overwhelming bipartisan support.''\n  In fact, last fall, when the House of Representatives would not take \nup our VAWA legislation--the violence against women legislation--we \nredoubled our efforts during the lameduck session. We had many meetings \nin my office between Republicans and Democrats to find where we could \ngo. We then reintroduced our bill with some modifications at the \nbeginning of this year.\n  I sought to make it our first legislative priority of the new \nCongress. With the strong support and leadership of the majority leader \nSenator Reid, the Senate turned to it, we considered it, and we passed \nit as one of our very first legislative matters in February. We \nactually passed it with an even stronger bipartisan majority this year \nthan last, although many of those who now oppose immigration reform \ncontinued voting against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. \nBut we passed a strong, principled, bipartisan bill.\n  I had people urge me to abandon my efforts in the Violence Against \nWomen Act to protect all victims. I was glad to see they were proven \nwrong. I was told repeatedly that the House of Representatives would \nnever consider, let alone pass, our bill that provided fairness for gay \nand lesbian victims and that we would never be able to provide \nmeaningful protections for Native American women being brutalized by \nnon-Indians on reservations.\n  But I said from my own experience early as a prosecutor and since as \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee: A victim is a victim is a victim. \nWhen I would go to crime scenes, I never heard a police officer, who \nwould see a victim of violence against women, say: Wait a minute. \nBefore we can get involved, is this victim gay or straight? Is this \nvictim Native American? They said a victim is a victim is a victim, and \nlet us see what we can do to protect not only this person but others.\n\n  In spite of all the dire predictions and political naysayers, our \nbipartisan group of Senators stuck to our principles. The Senate stood \nfirm. We did the right thing.\n  What happened then? How were we able to enact this bill into law?\n  The American people spoke up. They supported our bill. They demanded \naction. There were some Republican Members of the House, such as Tom \nCole of Oklahoma, who knew the right thing to do and were willing to \nsay they wanted to do it. Then more and more House Republicans came \naround to our view.\n  The House, to its credit, changed its stance and considered our bill. \nThey passed it with no changes whatsoever--exactly as it came out of \nthe Senate--and it is now law.\n  I was proud to stand with President Obama on March 7 in an emotional \nceremony in which he thanked legislators from both sides of the aisle \nfor protecting all victims of domestic violence and human trafficking.\n  Relevant to the pending immigration bill, there was one piece of the \noriginal Leahy-Crapo VAWA bill that was requested by law enforcement to \nhelp immigrant victims of violence. We sought to increase U visas for \nabused immigrant women so they could be protected and help law \nenforcement go after their abusers.\n  So often immigrant women are afraid to go and report their abusers \nbecause they think they themselves may be deported. In fact, we have \nhad evidence and testimony that people are being abused. If they are \nimmigrants, they are told: If you report what I am doing to you, I will \nget you deported.\n  That provision had a technical budget affect that last year the House \nused as an excuse not to consider our bill.\n  I promised at the beginning of this year that I would continue \nfighting to enact that measure. We would take it out of the VAWA bill \nto avoid the technicality of having it blocked by the House, but I \nnever forgot that. I never forgot my promise to those immigrant women. \nI am happy to report that these important U visas are now part of \ncomprehensive immigration reform legislation before us.\n  I tell this history because some have argued the Senate immigration \nreform bill has to be undermined from what we brought out of committee. \nWe have to do that to conform to demands intended to appease some in \nthe House Republican majority. I disagree. I disagree. Just as we did \nnot back off on VAWA, I say: Do not do it now. Let's consider not a \npartisan reason, but let's consider America. The Senate should pass the \nbest bill for the economy, for our families, and for our Nation. We \nshould do what we think is right.\n  The House of Representatives is clearly in a different place than \nthose who support the Senate bill. Just last Thursday House Republicans \nvoted to end President Obama's administrative program to help DREAMers, \nthe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, until such time as \nwe can pass the DREAM Act.\n  The DREAM Act is in our Senate immigration reform bill. It recognizes \nthat young people here without fault of their own, who are in school or \nin the military, and in good standing should not be deported because \nthey are undocumented. They are Americans. They should be part of this \nNation's future.\n  Senator Durbin--I am so proud of him for this--has been right to \nfight for them, as he has for years. He is a national voice for those \nwho want the DREAM Act to pass. Senator Durbin has insisted on the \nDREAM Act being included in our legislation, and President Obama was \nright today to highlight the achievements and contributions these young \npeople make to our country and will continue to make if the bill \nbecomes law.\n  Should we now abandon them? Should we say let's just strike those \nmeasures from the Senate bill because Representative King of Iowa and \nother House Republicans do not like them? Of course not. The Senate is \na separate body--100 people to represent over 300 million Americans--\nand we should be the conscience of our Nation. That means the Senate \nshould do what is right if we are to reflect the conscience of the \nNation.\n  I am inspired by the young DREAMers I have met over the last several \nyears and by the courageous testimony of Juan Antonio Vargas and Gaby \nPacheco during our hearings this year.\n  Our bill should include the DREAM Act, just as we should protect and \ninclude the fair but tough pathway to citizenship included in the bill \nreported by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  These provisions are the core of our bill. Let's not start \nnegotiating against ourselves. Let's not start backing off what we came \ntogether to pass. The vote by the Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives to prevent DREAMers from being able to stay in the \nUnited States is not the example that the Senate should follow, \nespecially if we really want to be the conscience of the Nation.\n  A few days ago the New York Times had a lead editorial that \naccurately describes where we are. It cautions against making bad \nmodifications to the bill. It urges bipartisanship and courage and that \nwe stand up to bad politics and bad policy. I hope the Senate will heed \nthis call.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this past Sunday's editorial \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 8, 2013]\n\n                         Immigration Headwinds\n\n                        (By the Editorial Board)\n\n       The bipartisan immigration bill that passed the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee last month is now being sent to meet its \n     fate on the Senate floor. While its chances of passage there \n     look promising, there remains much uncertainty about how \n     much--and how badly--the bill will be changed in the coming \n     three weeks of debate.\n       The bill is imperfect as it is, adding too many layers of \n     border enforcement and too many obstacles on its overlong \n     path to citizenship. But at least it has a path, one that \n     gives 11 million people a reasonable chance to get on the \n     right side of the law. Democratic leaders and the bipartisan \n     coalition that brought the bill this far need to stand firm \n     to protect its carefully drawn compromises and to ensure that \n     its irreplaceable core--the citizenship path--survives.\n       We know how opponents view the bill--as an irredeemable \n     ``amnesty'' measure--and\n\n[[Page S4200]]\n\n     some of the ways they will try to kill it. Senator Jeff \n     Sessions, a Republican of Alabama, began the barrage early, \n     with a long floor speech on Friday full of dire warnings and \n     outright falsehoods. For instance, he accused the Obama \n     administration of failing to enforce existing immigration \n     laws, saying that ``virtually no one is being deported,'' \n     which would no doubt surprise a million-and-a-half deportees. \n     He complained that the bill didn't do enough at the border, \n     even though it lavishes billions of dollars on border drones \n     and troops on top of decades' worth of existing \n     militarization. As The Times reported on Friday, defense \n     contractors are slavering over immigration reform as the best \n     thing for their bottom lines since Iraq.\n       Mr. Sessions may be outnumbered, but he does have allies. \n     Senator John Cornyn of Texas last week proposed a toxic \n     amendment that would have required drastic and unachievable \n     new border-security benchmarks to be met before a single \n     person could be legalized. That would essentially kill \n     reform, which, to be successful, depends on bringing millions \n     of people into the legal immigration system, not on shutting \n     them out from it indefinitely. Mr. Cornyn's strategy is one \n     way to make the bill fail; there are many others.\n       One issue in dispute is the earned-income tax credit, one \n     of the most effective means to lift people out of poverty and \n     a perennial target for Republicans. Some Republicans are \n     insisting that people legalized under the bill should not \n     qualify for the credit. That would severely strain the \n     fragile finances of many immigrants who are going to have to \n     pay $2,000 each in penalties to get green cards and \n     citizenship. Preserving the credit for all legal immigrants \n     is crucial for fairness and keeping families out of \n     destitution.\n       As the Senate debates these and other points in this \n     crucial-but-vulnerable bill, we can only hope that \n     bipartisanship and courage will prevail and that opponents \n     and skeptics finally recognize the cost of failure.\n       Many Republicans still don't see the political recklessness \n     of killing reform that most Americans support. If the \n     Republican Party doesn't care about destroying its viability \n     with a generation of Hispanic voters, why should anyone else?\n       But there is also the danger that the bill's supporters, \n     desperate to pass something, will be too willing to yield to \n     the die-hard obstructionists and accept compromises that warp \n     the bill beyond recognition or usefulness.\n       The perils in the House are already evident, even if a \n     solid bill is approved in the Senate. The House has its own \n     bipartisan group working on a bill, but it has immigration \n     dead-enders, too. One of them, Representative Steve King of \n     Iowa, recently offered a spiteful amendment to a homeland \n     security financing bill that would effectively kill the Obama \n     administration's program that halts deportations of blameless \n     young immigrants known as Dreamers. The amendment passed, \n     sending an unsettling message about the depth of House \n     Republican resistance to reform.\n       The House battle will be fought later this summer. This \n     month, the reform leaders in the Senate will have to stand up \n     against bad politics and bad policy for a bill that could \n     change this country.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, over the past weekend, I was happy to \nhear from my neighboring State of New Hampshire that Senator Ayotte \npledged her support to this bipartisan legislation. I know how much I \nappreciated working with her and Senator Shaheen earlier this year to \nget the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Act reauthorized. Senator \nAyotte, of course, was an important leader in her caucus on that \nbipartisan bill. I hope and expect she will be on the bipartisan \nimmigration bill as well, especially since it also contains several \nprotections for victims of domestic violence and human trafficking.\n  Just this morning the President of the United States spoke to all of \nus in this country, to all of America, about the need for Congress to \npass comprehensive immigration reform. He called our commonsense \nbipartisan bill the best chance we have had in years to fix the broken \nimmigration system. He urged us to do the right thing and do it now. He \nwas joined by a cross-section of distinguished Americans, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, from DREAMers to former President Bush \nadministration officials to business leaders and law enforcement \nrepresentatives and clergy and laymen. It was interesting to see the \ncoalition that oftentimes will not stand together on an issue or be \nopposed to each other standing together in unity on this issue.\n  I know I am meeting later this week with the President along with a \nbipartisan group of Senators so we can work together to pass \ncomprehensive immigration reform. I would encourage him to keep on \nspeaking about this because there are Senators in both parties who want \nreal immigration reform.\n  Because it is an important economic issue, it is also a civil rights \nissue. It is an issue of fundamental fairness. It speaks to where we \nare as a nation. The other day when I was speaking about this bill, and \nthey referenced the fact that--something I never expected when I came \nto the Senate--I have become the President pro tempore of the Senate. \nIt means I have been here a long time.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer that day, the Acting President \npro tempore, a colleague of ours, she herself is an immigrant. She came \nto this country with her mother. She has explained that they had all of \ntheir possessions in one suitcase. Her mother was fleeing an abusive \nspouse and came to this country. Now that mother's daughter is a \nSenator.\n  I think of my wife. She was born in this country, but her parents \ncame here from Canada speaking a different language and became very \nsuccessful in their careers, helped employ a lot of people in our State \nof Vermont. My maternal grandparents came from Italy not speaking the \nlanguage, had a business, employed a lot of people, became a very \nimportant part of our country. Their children, one became the highest \ndecorated pilot in World War II, other distinguished careers, one, of \ncourse, I am closest to is my mother.\n  I remember her pride and my father's pride when they saw their son, \none generation removed, become a Senator. Well, there is going to be \nsuccess stories all over this country if we stand for true immigration \nreform, if we make it possible for people of different backgrounds and \ndifferent races, different cultures to come here and make this country \na better country. They speak of us as being the melting pot but the \nmelting pot that brings about a wonderful combination. We see that in a \nnation--not a nation of such unity of thought and religion and politics \nand appearance that becomes bland and not vibrant. Instead, we are a \ncountry of different cultures and languages and backgrounds, and we all \nbecome Americans. The sum of the whole is greater than the parts. We \nare a better country for it.\n  So if we stand together, if we stay true to our values and \nagreements, I believe we can pass legislation that will be a continuing \nrenewal of our spirit, our creativity, our vitality as a nation, which \nupholds our great traditions and compassion in humanity as a welcoming \nnation. That is what I believe the Senate should do, what I believe our \nancestors should have done, I believe generations before us that made \nthis a great country should have done, and I believe we will be a \nbetter country if we will because of the people who have become \ncitizens in this country.\n  I look forward to the day when we come together, we 100 Senators come \ntogether and pass a bill that reflects the conscience of our Nation, \nthe conscience of the Senate, a bill that will make us all proud and \nAmerica proud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, let me first recognize the incredible \nwork of the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee who \nworked through a very open, transparent, fair process that led to 130-\nsome-odd amendments being considered and voted upon, in many cases \nadopted, and almost all of them adopted, from what I understand, many \nof them bipartisan.\n  I think even those who oppose immigration reform acknowledge the \nchairman's evenhandedness and his willingness to have an open and free \ndebate. That got us to where we are today. So he has my appreciation \nand my admiration for the way in which he conducted that process that \nbrings us to today.\n  As a member of the Senate bipartisan Gang of 8, I believe we come to \nthis floor if not in complete harmony, at least on the same sheet of \nmusic with a very solid legislative process. Let me take this \nopportunity to thank our staffs who have worked extraordinarily hard to \nput all of the pieces of this bill together and make this day possible.\n  You know, Senator Schumer calls Leon Fresco his genius. I like to \nthink of my counsel, Kerri Talbot, as the conscience of the Gang of 8. \nI want to thank Kerri for her dedication, for always believing that if \nwe put our heads in the yoke and pull hard enough we could pull our \nplow all of the way to a workable compromise, and we have.\n\n[[Page S4201]]\n\n  I want to thank all of those other staffers who put in so many hours \nand who will no doubt put in many more until this bill is passed and \nput on the President's desk.\n  This bill before us is the essence of compromise. During this long \nprocess, no one in the Gang of 8 got everything they wanted. But \neveryone got a workable bill worthy of support. That is the very \ndefinition in my mind of compromise. We did what we were elected to do. \nThat is democracy in action. We may not all agree all the time, but all \nof us were elected to govern, and the hard work of compromise is the \nonly way to get things done in a democracy.\n  We all bring certain core principles to our job. Those are the things \nwe should not compromise. But there is a difference between \ncompromising your principles and compromising on issues. It is not \nabout holding out for political or ideological gain but letting your \ncore principles guide you to a compromise that benefits the Nation. We \nwere all elected. It is up to all of us to govern together.\n  So I urge my colleagues to stand with us on this comprehensive reform \npackage that is so critical to the national security of the United \nStates, to the national economy of the United States, and to preserve \nour values as a nation of immigrants. Let's come together as we have in \nthe Gang of 8 and give every American what they have been asking for, \nwhich is a way to fix our broken immigration system.\n  Now, we need to know who is here to pursue the American dream versus \nwho is here to do it harm. That is what immigration reform will do. It \nwill bring people out of the shadows, into the light, and they will \nhave to register with the government, go through a criminal background \ncheck, pay taxes, learn English, and go to the back of the line after \nall of those who are waiting under the existing system so that they \nwould be processed first. So they are not going to break into the line \nand get to the top of the line.\n  It is not only in the national security interests of the United \nStates, it is in the economic interests of the United States to harness \nthe economic power of millions of new Americans. Let's be honest with \nourselves about who these new Americans are. If you had fruit for \nbreakfast this morning, it was probably picked in the hot Sun by an \nimmigrant worker with a bent back and sunburned skin.\n  If you had chicken for dinner last night, it was probably plucked by \nthe calloused, cut-up hands of an immigrant worker. If you have someone \nin your family who is infirm and needs constant care, chances are, it \nis an immigrant worker who works the third shift to attend to their \nneeds with a warm heart and steady hand.\n  If you are wondering who is spurring American innovation, chances are \nit is an immigrant high-tech, startup entrepreneur who, according to \nthe National Venture Capital Association, has started 25 percent of \npublic U.S. companies backed by venture capital investors. In fact, as \nof 2010 nearly one-fifth, 18 percent, of all Fortune 500 companies had \nat least one founder who was an immigrant. That is who the new \nAmericans are. You know it, I know it. Immigrant workers have been \nthere every day working hard, providing services, an integral part of \nour economy in tourism and farming and the restaurant industry, in \nsmall businesses and high-tech startups. The simple fact is immigration \nreform is good for our economy.\n  We want to be sure every American who wants to work hard at any job \nhas the opportunity in America to do it first. We also do not want to \nexploit an underclass in America that would suppress all wages of \nworkers in the economy. And if, in fact, you have an underclass of \nundocumented individuals who can be exploited, and very often are very \nmuch exploited, you create a system in which you suppress the wages of \nall workers. Eliminating that is an opportunity to ensure that wages \nrise.\n  The fact is that immigration reform will increase tax revenue. As we \ncan see from this chart, as a direct result of this legislation, we \nwill increase tax revenues over 10 years by $109 billion. That is $69 \nbillion in Federal revenue and $40 billion in badly needed increases in \nrevenue to the States.\n  Our second chart shows cumulative economic gains over 10 years after \npassage of this legislation. Look at these numbers. Just look at them. \nFixing the broken immigration system would increase America's GDP, its \ngross domestic product, by $832 billion over the next 10 years.\n  It will increase wages of all Americans by $470 billion over 10 \nyears, and it will increase the number of jobs created in America by \n121,000 per year. Immigrants will start small businesses, and they will \ncreate jobs for all American workers. In fact, small businesses owned \nby immigrants employed an estimated 4.7 million people in 2007 and \ncreated more than $776 billion in revenue annually.\n  I ask my colleagues, knowing we have a broken immigration system, \nknowing millions of families are in the shadows, knowing we have to \naddress this problem now, can we, in good conscience, afford not to \npass a bill that would increase GDP over 10 years by $832 billion? \nReally, can we? Can we afford not to pass a bill that will increase \nwages of all Americans by $470 billion? Can we afford not to pass a \nbill that will create 121,000 jobs every year for the next 10 years, \n1.2 million more jobs in the next decade, because we had the wisdom and \nthe will to act?\n  Immigrants have been a silent force on this economy, working in the \nshadows. It is time to bring them into the light. It is time to harness \nthat economic power. They are working hard providing services, working \nin every industry at every level, even sacrificing their lives to serve \nin our military.\n  In wave after wave, season after season, immigrants have been the \nbackbone of the agricultural industry, willing to work the fields and \npull the crops that feed our families. That work is being done by \nimmigrant workers, and God bless them for their willingness to do it.\n  God bless men such as LCpl Jose Gutierrez, who was not even a citizen \nof the United States when he became the first American soldier to die \nin Iraq. He wore the uniform of this Nation. He was willing to do \nbattle for this Nation. He died on behalf of the country. He was not, \nalthough he aspired to be, even a citizen of the United States.\n  Let's send a message to every American to stand with us on \nimmigration reform in memory of LCpl Jose Gutierrez and every soldier \nlike him. Let's send a message that no longer will immigrant families \nbe separated from loved ones. No longer will U.S. citizens and lawful \npermanent residents be caught up in immigration raids and detained \nunlawfully in violation of their constitutional rights simply because \nof the way they look, the way they speak, or the color of their skin.\n  We have many cases of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents who \nhave been unlawfully detained in immigration raids until their \ncitizenship was established or their permanent residency was \nestablished. Who among us in this Chamber would be willing to be a \nsecond-class citizen in this country? I don't know about others, but \nright now I have nothing in my possession that says I am a U.S. \ncitizen. I am not carrying my passport. I was born in the United \nStates, but I don't carry my birth certificate. I certainly don't \nexpect to be stopped because, as some said in this Chamber in 2007, I \nam one of those people--one of those people--that I am different, that \nI am somehow not American.\n  We know the history of this Nation. History has taught us when there \nis a story of one group of people becoming a suspect class, when one \ngroup of people is blamed for all the ills of the Nation, that story \nalways has a sad ending. We cannot let that happen again in the \ngreatest country on the face of the Earth.\n  As the son of Cuban-American immigrants growing up in Union City, I \nunderstand too many families have waited too long for commonsense \nimmigration reform, too long to have the chance to raise their hands, \ntake the oath, and say they ``will support and defend the Constitution \nand laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign \nand domestic,'' and ``bear true faith and allegiance to the same.''\n  Too many have waited too long to say those words that will change \ntheir lives. They changed my mother's life and, in turn, changed mine, \ngiving me the chance to stand here today, one of 100 U.S. Senators, one \nof eight who has spent months negotiating a very tough\n\n[[Page S4202]]\n\nbut fair proposal to fix our broken immigration system.\n  I know what is at stake. We know what is at stake. We have lived it, \nand we see it every day. I believe we can finally say today there is \nsome light at the end of the long dark tunnel that has been before us.\n  This bill represents a lot of hard work. It is the essence of \ncompromise. We have come a long way in the Gang of 8, but there is \nstill a long way to go.\n  Are there legitimate amendments that can improve this bill? Of \ncourse. Are there still those who would amend this bill solely to \nundermine immigration reform? Absolutely. They may cloak their words in \nsuggesting they want to see reform, but the reality is they are dead \nset against it. Are there those who still decry this as amnesty? We \nhear it every day. We have already heard it in this debate. Some of \nthese roles are being reprised from 2007. Every day they are still \nwrong and could not be more wrong.\n  Amnesty means you did something wrong and are forgiven without having \nto make yourself right. This bill is certainly not amnesty. This bill \nsays you must make yourself right by registering with the government, \ngoing through criminal background checks, and if you are a criminal, or \nyou are found to be a criminal under that background check, you will \nget deported, as you should. It says you have to pay taxes, you have to \nlearn English, and you have to wait your turn and go to the back of the \nline.\n  Are there those who think we have not done enough to control the \nborder? Yes, there are those voices, even though we have included $6.5 \nbillion to increase technology and finish the job. We have already \nstarted to secure our borders, even though the border provisions of \nthis bill were largely written by Senators representing border States. \nThey live it with every day. They had some of the biggest input in the \nGang of 8 to say this is what we feel we need to deal with border \nsecurity--so much so, on these provisions and with these dollars, that \nthe New York Times reported on Friday that defense contractors favor \nimmigration reform because of what we have included for border \nsecurity. The facts are clear. The truth is here for all to see.\n  Let me show you our next chart.\n  Since 1986, spending on border security has increased. As you can see \nfrom this chart, immigration enforcement spending, adjusted to 2012 \ndollars, has dramatically increased over the last 26 years, over two \ndecades. Border spending has gone from $1.2 billion in 1986 to $6.2 \nbillion in the year 2002, peaking in 2009 at $20 billion annually. We \nare increasing it again in this legislation by over $6.5 billion. That \nis more than four times as much as 2002 and more than 20 times as much \nborder spending as in 1986. No one can say we have neglected border \nsecurity in this bill.\n  Here is another chart to put it in a different context. Let's put \nthis in this context. When we look at spending, as you can see from \nthis chart, we now spend more on immigration enforcement than all other \ncriminal enforcement agencies combined--all of them combined.\n\n  In 2012 we spent almost $18 billion on Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, Customs and Border Patrol, and US-VISIT, $18 billion, \ncompared to about $14 billion, $4 billion less on all other principal \nlaw enforcement agencies such as the FBI.\n  As I said, we are adding over $6.5 billion to the immigration and \nenforcement side of the ledger in this bill. That will put us in the \nposition of spending twice as much on border security as we do on all \nother law enforcement agencies in this country.\n  It is not only the money we spend but how we spend it.\n  The fact is border enforcement is at an all-time high. We are \nenacting a strategy to have 100 percent surveillance and prevent at \nleast 90 percent of all illegal border crossings across the highest \nrisk areas of our southern border, but there are still those who say it \nis not enough.\n  We are investing in new technologies to secure the borders. The \nnumber of Border Patrol agents has doubled over the past 8 years, but \nthere are still those who say not enough.\n  Let's be clear, we are making significant additional investments in \nborder security and technology to make sure at least 90 percent of all \nillegal border crossings are prevented. There are some who say: Oh, we \nhave to have 100 percent. I don't know anything the Federal Government \ndoes 100 percent. Do we catch 100 percent of all the criminals? Do we \ncollect 100 percent of all taxes? Do we do 100 percent of anything? No. \nThose who try to invoke that type of standard are simply trying to \nundermine the pathway toward citizenship.\n  Let's be clear. We are making very significant strides and this is \nvery tough in all of the border provisions. I have only mentioned a \nfew. There are a lot more.\n  On the flip side, there are those who believe we have done all we can \non border security in this legislation but have not gone far enough in \nother areas, that there are too many obstacles to citizenship and a 13-\nyear path is too long. A 13-year path--certainly not an easy road or \nanything anyone could call amnesty--is a compromise I am willing to \naccept so we can finally bring 11 million people out of the shadows and \ngive them a chance for better lives for themselves, their families, to \nearn their way here in America to fulfill their hopes, dreams, and \naspirations, as well as our hopes, dreams, and aspirations as a \ncountry.\n  The fact is, at the end of the day, when all of the political \nposturing has subsided, we have an obligation to govern. We have met, \nin this proposal, that obligation. We have come up with a good, solid, \nbipartisan product. The time has come and the moment is here. The \nopportunity is before us to make history, and I hope we don't miss that \nopportunity.\n  Let me urge my colleagues, let's not begin this debate with toxic \namendments that would test the basic values and principles of those on \none side or the other, force us all to our respective corners, no lines \nin the sand. Let's get the job done. We don't need amendments that \nwould establish manipulable border security benchmarks before we could \neven bring one person out of the shadows. This is not finding a way to \ngovern, that is about killing the bill.\n  We do not need to retreat to lines drawn in the sand on every issue \ncovered by this legislation. We can either come together, both sides, \nboth parties, and govern, as the American people want to see us do, or \nonce again blow it up and do nothing.\n  I believe we have come too far and the demands of the American people \nin poll after poll are rather clear: It is time to fix our broken \nimmigration system. Join us and make history.\n  Eleven million people live in the shadows of fear and hope they will \none day--if they do all the right things--have a chance, however \ndifficult it will be, to become American citizens. This bill would give \nthem that chance. Citizenship will not be easy, but the rules are \nclear: It will take up to 13 years to complete after background checks, \nfines, penalties, paying taxes, working, and learning English.\n\n  They want to reunite their families, and this bill will finally--\nfinally--do what we should have done long ago to keep families together \nunder a provision to allow immediate reunification of green card \nholders with their spouses and minor children. How can we in good \nconscience not support the reunification of families who have been \nseparated for far too long? For those who come to this floor and \nproclaim their commitment to family values, this is the time to show \nit.\n  This bill will clear the current backlog for those already waiting in \nline--those who have been patient and waiting in line--and put the \nadditional 11 million at the back of that line. It is a long line \nindeed. Let no one come to this floor and misrepresent this compromise \nlanguage as amnesty. It clearly isn't amnesty. This is not a free ride \nbut a pathway for undocumented individuals to earn; for those who have \nbeen here contributing to America's economy while living in constant \nfear of deportation, constant fear of exploitation, constant fear of \nwaking up in the morning and wondering if they will see their family at \nnight.\n  The bill provides a simple, fair opportunity for DREAMers. These are \nyoung people who, through no fault of their own, came to America \nbecause their parents brought them here. The only country they know is \nthat of the United States. The only flag they have ever pledged \nallegiance to is the American flag. The only national anthem\n\n[[Page S4203]]\n\nthey know is the ``Star-Spangled Banner.'' How can we not give them a \nchance, when they were brought here by their families and they want to \nbelong to the only country they have ever known?\n  Madam President, this has been a hard road to compromise, with months \nof hard work and hard negotiations. But the hard work of trying to \nachieve comprehensive immigration reform has paid off with the support \nof the broadest spectrum of groups and organizations I have seen in my \nnearly 20 years between the House and the Senate. From the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce representing business in this country, to the AFL-CIO \nrepresenting labor; from agro-growers to farm workers, from high-tech \nentrepreneurs to restaurant owners and every religious sector--the \nevangelical community is strongly supportive of this, as are Christians \nand Jews and everything in between. People on all sides of every issue \nare finding common ground to say this is the right legislation for \nAmerica.\n  We have a chance to make history, but we cannot make history without \nuniting behind a deep and abiding belief in the need to govern, the \nneed to fulfill our responsibilities to the people we represent. The \ntime has come. If we cannot come together on comprehensive immigration \nreform at a time when the American people have clearly spoken, if we \ncannot push back against the extremes that will always prevent us from \never finding the center, if we choose only to obstruct and not solve, \ndestroy and not build, then we will have lost a perfect chance not only \nto make history but to do what is right by our country.\n  This is a good bill. It is a fair compromise, a chance for us to come \ntogether and govern and do what a majority of the American people are \ndemanding we do. Last year's national election evidenced a new American \ndemographic, and the new America spoke resoundingly about who they will \nsupport and not support based on how they vote on comprehensive \nimmigration reform. Let's listen to what that new America had to say \nand do the right thing.\n  I am confident we can get this bill passed, and I hope--I sincerely \nhope--our colleagues in the House will take our lead and pass \ncomprehensive immigration reform this year. I hope they will join us in \nrealizing the time has come.\n  Si, se puede--yes, we can.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                            USA Patriot Act\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I just wanted to say a few words on an \nissue that is of deep concern to many Americans. In 2001, 2006, and in \n2011, I voted against the USA PATRIOT Act. I voted against that \nlegislation because I believed in a democratic and constitutional form \nof government we can effectively combat terrorism without sacrificing \nthe civil liberties and the constitutional protections which make us a \nfree country.\n  The President has said he welcomes a debate on this issue, and I \nagree with him. There should be a debate. And the debate should center \non whether the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is still \nrelevant. If it is, let's abide by it. If it isn't, let's not be \nhypocrites and let's acknowledge we live in a society, in a nation, \nwhere our freedoms and liberties have been severely compromised. But \nlet's not pretend the protections the Fourth Amendment guarantees exist \nwhen in fact they do not exist.\n  Here is what the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution states:\n\n       The right of the people to be secure in their persons, \n     houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and \n     seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, \n     but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or Affirmation, \n     and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the \n     persons or things to be seized.\n\n  That is the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  Now, let's talk about what we learned in the last week about the \nNational Security Agency's activities. We learned it is likely that \nvirtually every phone call made by every American is being collected \nand stored by the United States Government. The time you made that \nphone call, where you made that phone call, how long you were on the \nphone, and to whom you made that phone call is now part of the record \nof the United States Government. Every husband calling a wife, every \nbusinessman making a deal, every elected official talking to a \nconstituent, every candidate talking to a campaign manager, every \ndoctor talking to a patient, every lawyer talking to a client, every \njournalist tracking a story--all of that information and more--is now \non file with the United States Government.\n  What is even more alarming is that it is not just the government \nofficials who have access to that information. It turns out it is also \navailable to private contractors such as Booze-Allen, and I assume many \nother contractors.\n  A few weeks ago, Madam President, you will recall there was a huge \nuproar in the media, including front-page stories about the Obama \nadministration tracking the phone calls made by reporters from the \nAssociated Press. It was a big deal. Everybody was really concerned \nabout that. While not listening to the calls, they learned who the \nreporters were speaking to, how long they were speaking, and where the \nreporters were located. Well, guess what. It turns out what the Obama \nadministration was doing to the AP is nothing unusual. This appears to \nbe exactly what the government has the capability to do to every single \nAmerican.\n  Furthermore, we have also recently learned the government has the \ncapability to monitor every Web site we visit, every video we see, and \nevery item we search for online.\n  Madam President, everybody understands terrorism is a serious issue \nand the United States Government--and governments throughout the \nworld--must do everything it can to protect its people. We do not want \nanother 9/11. We do not want another bombing such as the one at the \nBoston Marathon. We do, however, want our government, our intelligence \nagencies and law enforcement authorities to be strong and effective in \ncombating terrorism. But it is my very strong opinion we can do that \nwithout living in an Orwellian world where the government and private \ncorporations know every telephone call we make, every Web site we \nvisit, every place we go.\n  Is that really the country we want to be? Let's be clear: The \ntechnology for monitoring every aspect of our daily lives will only \nincrease in years to come as that technology becomes ever more \nsophisticated.\n  Opposition to the current NSA policy is coming from across the \npolitical spectrum. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, a conservative \nRepublican from Wisconsin, and one of the authors of the original \nPATRIOT Act, said in a Thursday letter to Attorney General Eric Holder \nthat he is ``extremely troubled'' by the National Security Agency's \nseizure of the phone records of millions of Verizon customers through a \nsecret court ruling. Representative Sensenbrenner also said:\n\n       I do not believe the released FISA order is consistent with \n     the requirements of the PATRIOT Act. How could the phone \n     records of so many innocent Americans be relevant to an \n     authorized investigation as required by the act? Seizing \n     phone records of millions of innocent people is excessive and \n     un-American.\n\n  That is what Republican Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner said in a press \nrelease that accompanied his letter to the Attorney General.\n  It is clear to me the United States Congress has to take a very hard \nlook at the USA PATRIOT Act, and specifically section 215. The bottom \nline is we must be strong and effective in combating terrorism, but it \nis absolutely my view we can do that without undermining the \nconstitutional rights that make us a free country.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I want to first thank the Senator from \nSouth Dakota for his indulgence for 5 minutes or so to do this, and the \nSenator from Indiana for yielding his time to me. We got a little out \nof order on the floor, but I wanted to speak before the night was out \nabout this incredible chance we have with respect to fixing our broken \nimmigration system.\n  Over the next few weeks, the Senate has a golden opportunity to do \nsomething great, to do something that is important, to do something \nthat shows\n\n[[Page S4204]]\n\nthat Washington can actually work; that we are aligned with the \npriorities of the American people; and that we can take on hard \nchallenges and solve them. That is the opportunity before us.\n  I have to say thank you to all of my colleagues who served on this \nso-called Gang of 8 and worked not even in a bipartisan way but in a \nnonpartisan way to fix problems that afflict our economy and our \ndemocracy throughout the country in different ways.\n  I particularly want to thank Senator John McCain and Senator Schumer \nfor their leadership during good times, but particularly during the \ntough times during this negotiation. A lot of people I represent \nsometimes wonder whether Washington is just irretrievably broken, \nwhether we can actually do something in the regular order instead of \njust in the middle of the night. To them I can come to the floor \ntonight and say: Finally, we have a process of which we can be proud. \nWe have a bipartisan bill. We had a dozen hearings on this issue, with \nalmost a month between the introduction of the bill and the committee \nmarkup. We had 37 hours of consideration in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, with 300 amendments filed and 212 considered. I think 141 of \nthese amendments from our colleagues were actually approved.\n  Even some of the harshest critics of the bill have commended the open \nand transparent process, and I am grateful to Chairman Leahy for his \nwork as well as the members of the Judiciary Committee.\n  In the coming weeks, many more amendments will come before this body. \nVoices on every side of the issue will continue to have the chance to \nbe heard, which is the way democracy ought to work. At the end of the \nday, I hope we will not squander the greatest chance we have had in a \ngeneration, in 25 years, to fix our broken immigration system.\n  No one understands this better than the people of Colorado--the \npeople I represent, who even though they do not think of themselves \nthis way particularly, are one-third Democrat, one-third Republican, \nand one-third Independent. From end to end and corner to corner of our \ngreat western State, people have said to me: Michael, when are these \nguys going to fix this broken immigration system? With agriculture on \nthe west slope in northern Colorado and on the eastern plains, this has \na $40 billion impact to our State.\n  We have great high-tech in Colorado, with people inventing the future \nas we stand here today in bioscience, aerospace, engineering, and a \ngrowing startup community. Colorado's high-tech sector includes more \nthan 10,000 companies. My hope is that 5 years from now there will be \n10,000 more, and 5 years after that 10,000 more than that. We have \n150,000 workers today who produce almost $3 billion in exports each \nyear, as well as a new patent office opening soon.\n  We have a huge tourism industry. Hotels, restaurants, and the ski \nindustry struggle to find the workers they need. The ski industry alone \nbrings in 57 million visitors to the country each year, many of these \npeople traveling to Colorado year after year.\n  We have a growing Latino population. It is almost 21 percent of our \nState's population. In places such as the Denver Public Schools--a \nplace I had the privilege to work before I came to the Senate--over \nhalf our students are Latino. That is why we set out several years ago \nto have a conversation in Colorado, in the rural parts of the State, in \nthe urban parts of the State, with our high-tech community, with our \nagriculture community, saying: What needs to be done? We brought \ntogether business leaders, farmers, faith leaders, law enforcement, \nadvocates, and community leaders and we said: Washington is broken. We \ncan't wait for them to act. What can we do in Colorado?\n  We came up with seven principles for immigration reform which are now \nreflected in the legislation before us. It turns out that actually for \nonce we underestimated this place. This place was willing to approach \nthis work with the seriousness of purpose that Colorado citizens were.\n  I wish to tell one Colorado story to reflect this. Wayne Mininger, an \nonion farmer from Greeley, CO, also represents onion farmers across the \nNation as head of the National Onion Association. Growing up on his \nfather's farm in California's San Joaquin Valley and now owning his own \nfarm in Greeley, CO, he has witnessed the farmer's struggle to find \nreliable labor his entire working life. The farmers he represents have \nlong voiced their frustration with a visa system that results in \nserious delays hiring workers or not having enough labor altogether to \nharvest crops.\n  They are not interested in the politics in the Nation's Capitol. They \nare interested in running their farms and ranches. They are interested \nin knowing they have a steady supply of labor. Wayne took the trouble \nto write a letter to the Greeley Tribune about why he is supporting \nthis bill. Since he said it better than I could say it myself, I ask \nunanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the Greeley Tribune]\n\n         Colorado's Delegation Must Support Immigration Reform\n\n  (By Wayne Mininger, Executive Vice President of the National Onion \n                              Association)\n\n       Growing up in California's San Joaquin Valley, from very \n     early on I saw the critical role seasonal workers played on \n     my father's fruit, nut and vegetable farm. Due to diminishing \n     domestic worker availability, it became a constant struggle \n     to obtain sufficient immigrant seasonal help because the visa \n     process was cumbersome, complex and convoluted.\n       Later in life, I experienced seasonal labor struggles as a \n     business partner with my father in Greeley on our onion farm.\n       Now as a leader of the National Onion Association, I \n     represent onion farmers from coast to coast and border to \n     border. Through the years, I've heard countless stories about \n     how difficult it is to work within our immigration system.\n       That's why I support the immigration overhaul bill making \n     its way through Congress. It is an excellent opportunity to \n     address rural America's ability to attain a reliable, stable \n     and legal workforce.\n       This bill isn't perfect, and I don't agree with everything \n     in it. Thanks to the Group of Eight, which includes Sen. \n     Michael Bennet, D-Colo., for finally coming together in a \n     bipartisan way to craft a common-sense bill that attempts to \n     fix a broken immigration system. I encourage Colorado's other \n     representatives, including Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., and Rep. \n     Cory Gardner, R-Colo., to support it as well. Agriculture is \n     the backbone of our state and national economies; we need \n     policies that help farmers, not hinder them.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, some critics will not be surprised \npeople around here are using the same old, tired talking points in an \neffort to delay and kill this bill altogether. But the people of \nColorado know better and the people across this country know better. \nThey know that passing this bill is critical to strengthening our \ncountry's borders. It will make us safer, add to our security, aligning \nour immigration system with the needs not of a 20th century economy or \na 19th century economy but of the 21st century economy our children are \nexpecting us to build and honoring our heritage of a nation of laws and \na nation of immigrants. That is why a growing number of Americans \nsupport fixing our broken immigration system and 70 percent support a \ntough but fair pathway to citizenship. That is what is contained in \nthis bill.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the days and weeks \nahead to find ways we can even improve this bill and, at the end of the \nday, pass legislation that will make us stronger as a nation and better \nserve the next generation of Americans and the generation after that. \nSince our founding, there are a number of aspects that have made us \nspectacular as a country, but there are two that are hard to find \nanywhere else. We are a nation that subscribes to the rule of law and \nwe are a nation of immigrants. With this bill, we will assert both of \nthose principles, and I think we have a golden opportunity to come \ntogether again and say that Washington is not just about playing our \nown politics, it is about doing the people's business so we can show \nthis place can actually work together again to accomplish something \nvery important for all of America.\n  I yield the floor, probably considerably later than I should have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I also would like to thank the Senator \nfrom Colorado for his generosity with his time and for giving me the \nopportunity\n\n[[Page S4205]]\n\nto make some remarks. I have an amendment I filed which I do not think \nwe are going to get an opportunity to have pending tonight. I hope we \ncan get it pending at some point. I hope we can have a number of \namendments pending and voted on. That is, after all, what the Senate \nshould be about. Clearly, on an issue of this consequence to the \nAmerican people and for those of us who represent States from all \nacross the country, this is an issue that needs to be debated. That is \nwhy many of us voted to get on the bill today. I think we can all \nacknowledge that we have an immigration system that is broken and it \nneeds to be fixed.\n  As I come to the floor to discuss this particular amendment, I am \nreminded that each time Congress has tried to fix our immigration \nsystem, there have been promises and more promises of a more secure \nborder. Unfortunately, those promises are never upheld. The bill before \nus is well intended, but it is following the same path as past \nimmigration bills. Under this bill, it is certain that 12 million \nundocumented workers will receive legal status soon after the bill is \nenacted. However, the border security provisions are nothing more than \npromises which, again, may never be upheld.\n  When I talk to my constituents back in South Dakota, they ask a \ncouple of questions. The first one is: When will our Federal Government \nkeep its promises on border security? I think that is first and \nforemost the issue most people see when they look at the immigration \ndebate. They want to know why it is that we continue to talk about \nenforcing the law and securing the border, but we do not follow through \non the steps that are necessary to do that.\n  They also ask the second question: Why do we need more laws? Why do \nwe need more laws when we are not enforcing the laws that are currently \non the books? It is time we follow through on the promises that have \nbeen made in the past of a more secure border. The Illegal Immigration \nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 required 700 miles of \nreinforced double-layered fencing along the southern border. This goal \nwas reaffirmed when Congress passed the Secure Fence Act in 2006. To \ndate, less than 40 miles out of the 700 miles of fencing required by \nlaw has been completed. My amendment, amendment No. 1197, simply \nrequires that we implement current law prior to legalization as an \nindication that we are serious about border security. As specified by \nthis amendment, 350 miles of the fencing would be required prior to RPI \nstatus being granted. The completion of this section of the fence would \nbe a tangible demonstration that this administration is serious about \nborder security.\n  After RPI status is granted, the remaining 350 miles required by \ncurrent law would have to be constructed during the 10-year period \nbefore registered provisional immigrants can apply for green cards.\n  There are a lot of issues associated with this bill. It has a lot of \nmoving parts. There are lots of things, as this debate continues, that \nneed to be addressed and hopefully amendments that will be offered on \nthe floor can make this bill stronger and improve it as it goes through \nthe process. I say to my colleagues in the Senate that if we are \nserious about wanting to show that we get this whole issue of border \nsecurity and we are not just talking about it but actually making real \nchanges to make our border more secure, then this amendment is one way \nto show it. After all, many of us acknowledge that of the many \ncomponents and elements of this debate, first and foremost is that we \nhave to address the issue of border security.\n  It gets talked about. There is a lot of rhetoric surrounding it. \nThere is a lot of rhetoric in the Senate, as I mentioned earlier about \nthis very subject where promises and commitments have been made, \npromises and commitments that have never been fulfilled with respect to \nborder security.\n  This amendment, No. 1197, as I said, is very simple, very \nstraightforward, and only follows through on commitments that have been \nmade by Congress in the past and which I think the American people \nexpect and, frankly, have a right to expect, that we would follow \nthrough on: 350 miles of fence before RPI status is granted and another \n350 miles of fence prior to a green card being issued.\n  It is not complicated. I think in a lot of respects this issue is not \ncomplicated. It is certainly not complicated in the minds of the \nAmerican people who think first and foremost this is about border \nsecurity, about border enforcement, about a nation that is able to \ncontrol its very borders for so many reasons, many of which have been \ndiscussed and talked about and I hope will be talked about even more in \nthe days ahead.\n  I understand I do not have the opportunity to get this amendment up \nand pending to where it could be voted on this evening, but I certainly \nhope, at least as we get underway in this debate tomorrow, that those \nof us who have amendments we think would strengthen and improve this \nbill will have the opportunity to put them forward and to get them \nvoted on.\n  Amendment No. 1197 is one of those. I certainly hope tomorrow the \nmanagers of the bill will be able to allow us a pathway where we can \nget amendments voted on. I think this will improve the bill. I think it \nstrengthens the bill and it certainly follows through on a commitment \nthat has been made to the American people many times over and has not \nyet been followed through on.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, the Senate has taken an important and \nhistoric step today by adopting a motion to proceed to legislation \nreforming our broken immigration system. I look forward to moving \nthrough this debate over the next couple of days and weeks in regular \norder.\n  This bill received a thorough vetting in the Judiciary Committee over \na couple of weeks. There were more than 100 amendments adopted. I think \nmore than 300 amendments were submitted.\n  I commend Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley for offering a \nprocess which makes this Senate proud. For those who believe the Senate \ncannot work through regular order and that all sides can agree to \namendments being offered and a debate being had, I think they would be \nheartened to see this process so far. This bill will be brought to the \nfloor with agreements as well as many amendments that will be offered \nand considered. We will have thorough debates that leave us in good \nstead for this legislation.\n  This is important legislation. I hope, as we move through it, we can \nremember we need to assign motives to people who are debating either \nside of this issue. This is an issue where passions run high. We see \nthat among our constituents and across the country. Here in the Senate, \nI hope we remember we are all coming to this debate with different \nperspectives. We represent different States, but all of us want a \nbetter immigration system. If we can get through this and not question \neach other's motives throughout this process, I think we will all be \nbetter off.\n  Arizona, as everyone knows, is a State which has a large population \nof undocumented aliens. We rest on a large border with Mexico, and with \nall of the issues and problems that presents, and has over the years. \nThe sizable undocumented population helps no one. It doesn't help those \nfamilies living day to day with one family member or another out of \nstatus. It doesn't help State or local governments that bear the brunt \nof the cost, whether it is education, health care, criminal justice, or \nincarceration. These are expenses which are borne more by the States \nthan the Federal Government and it leads to a lot of frustration in \nArizona and elsewhere.\n  It doesn't help when businesses struggle to maintain a legal \nworkforce, and that is the case in Arizona. Up until recently, the \nTucson sector of the Border Patrol was the busiest sector in the Nation \nwhen it comes to illegal crossings. While there are claims that the \nborder is now safer than ever, landowners in the border region continue \nto face a reality that would suggest otherwise.\n  Let me give an example. Earlier this year, the Ladd Ranch, which is a \n14,000-\n\n[[Page S4206]]\n\nacre ranch that shares 10 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, which is \nbetween Naco, AR, and the San Pedro River, reached 14 breaches with a \ntotal of 29 trucks just over the past 12 months. This was taking place \nin the daylight.\n  Between the border and the undocumented, our current immigration \nsystem does little to ensure that our economy has the talent we need to \nensure the United States competes globally. While there are issues on \nthe border with the landholders and all of the problems that presents, \nand then there are businesses which simply cannot get access to the \ntalent they need, we have a problem that needs to be solved. In \naddition, the program is oriented toward providing adequate temporary \nor short-term workers typified by caps that do not work and redtape \nthat makes them all but unusable. The current immigration system is \nirreparably broken.\n  This legislation before us takes great strides with border security. \nI look forward to these provisions being debated and thoroughly vetted \nthroughout this process. I am sure many amendments will be offered. I \nplan to offer some of them myself to improve this process and to \nimprove the border security elements of the bill.\n  This legislation has a tough but fair process to bring the \nundocumented out of the shadows. People who come forward will be \nrequired to pay fees and fines.\n  For those who raise the term amnesty again and again, let me assure \nthem there is no amnesty in this legislation. By definition, amnesty is \nan unconditional pardon for a breach of law. This is no unconditional \npardon. Those who come forward, come out of the shadows, and those who \nare undocumented will be required, as I said, will be required to pay \nfines and fees. They will be required to work. They will be required to \nstay well above the poverty level. When it comes time to renew their \nstatus, they will be required to pay any back taxes that have accrued, \nand again show they have stayed here and maintained the status in a way \nthat would allow them to be renewed.\n  Before they are able to get a green card, 10 years into this process, \nthere will be many other things required as well. Again, they will need \nto prove they have paid taxes, and that they have not been a public \ncharge. They will need to learn English. Right now the requirement is \nthe need to learn English to become a citizen. Under this legislation, \nthis requirement has moved up to green card status. Just to get a green \ncard, they will have to be proficient in English.\n  This legislation also dramatically modernizes our legal immigration \nsystem. It ensures U.S. businesses will have access to the best and \nbrightest around the world.\n  I have been concerned about this issue for years. Years ago I \nintroduced what we called the Staple Act. I heard many times from \nbusinesses that we ought to staple a green card to the diploma of \nanyone who receives a graduate degree, particularly a Ph.D., in the so-\ncalled STEM fields. This legislation accomplishes much of that by \nsimply saying that those who are here and educated in our U.S. \nuniversities will be allowed to stay here. Those with a master's degree \nor Ph.D. in STEM fields will be allowed to stay here and help create \njobs.\n  A big percentage of the jobs created and Fortune 500 companies that \nare listed are started or created by foreigners--those who were here \nand received an education here and were allowed to stay or were born by \nfirst or second-generation immigrants. We need to make sure those who \nare going to help us build our economy are allowed to stay, and this \nlegislation does that.\n  We all know the status quo is unworkable. If someone runs a business \nin this country, they are not currently given adequate tools to \ndetermine whether those who are presenting themselves for work are here \nlegally. This legislation will make sure those tools are there.\n  I look forward to this process as well as the debate. I think this \ndebate can represent the Senate at its best where we can consider this \nlegislation, consider amendments to make sure the bill is improved, and \nthen send the bill on to the House so it can be considered there as \nwell.\n  I commend those who have been involved in this process, the so-called \nGang of 8, who have worked long and hard. Our staff worked well into \nthe night for weeks on end to make sure we have the legislation before \nus today, which has been a long, thorough, and good process. As I \nmentioned before, those who have seen the Congress--the House and \nSenate--in recent years maybe not reach its full potential, to put it \nmildly, ought to be heartened by the process on this legislation. I \nhope we can continue it. I look forward to debating this legislation \nwith my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to speak about the 2013 \nfarm bill that the Senate just passed. I want to congratulate \nChairwoman Stabenow and ranking member Cochran for their work and \nsuccess on this bill. I am proud to support this bill.\n  Last year, the Senate passed a strong bi-partisan farm bill that I \nwas also happy to support. I greatly appreciate the work that \nChairwoman Stabenow and former ranking member Roberts put into last \nyear's bill and their willingness to work with me, and my colleagues \nfrom Chesapeake Bay region States to keep the conservation programs in \nthe bill strong and effective for Maryland and other Chesapeake Bay \nStates' farmers.\n  I was pleased to see the strength of the farm bill's conservation \nprograms, namely the Regional Conservation Partnership Program \nretained, and in some respects improved, in the bill that the \nAgriculture Committee reported in May. I greatly appreciate that \nthrough floor consideration of the bill the conservation programs \nremained largely unchanged. During last year's consideration of this \nbill my Chesapeake Bay State colleagues and I, in working with Senators \nStabenow and Roberts, put a great deal of work into improving the \nRegional Conservation Partnership Program and I appreciate that all of \nour work from last year remains intact in this year's Senate farm bill.\n  I have spoken with my State's soil conservation district managers \nabout the new Regional Conservation Partnership Program that is coming \nand they are excited and ready to make sure that it works well in \nMaryland. I look forward to talking with more farmers and other \nstakeholders about the importance of this new program and will \nencourage their participation.\n  Farming in Maryland is extremely challenging. Pressure from \ndevelopers is compounded by the water quality concerns that persist in \nthe bay and its tributaries. The facts of the matter are that the bay \nis polluted and it is everyone in the watershed's responsibility to \nhelp clean it up.\n  The Chesapeake Bay is the world's largest most productive estuary. It \nis a national treasure that has an economic value over $1 trillion. I \nfirmly believe that it is in the Nation's interest to protect this \nresource. It is in the interest and purview of the Federal government \nto coordinate the efforts of the six States and the District of \nColumbia. Because protecting this national treasure is an initiative in \nthe Federal Government's interest I have made providing farmers \nfinancial resources to reduce pollution from their farms from polluting \nthe bay a priority issue of mine in each farm bill I have worked on in \nthe Senate.\n  Because water quality concerns in the bay watershed are so high, \nMaryland farms must meet extremely standards of operation to prevent \nsediment and nutrient loss.\n\n[[Page S4207]]\n\n  I am proud to have worked with the chairman and ranking member to \ndevelop the programs in this bill that maintain the traditions of \nproviding farmers with financial resources to mitigate nutrient and \nsediment loss from their farms.\n  Perhaps, what is even more important than the specific financial \nresources this bill provides farmers to implement conservation \nactivities on their farms is reestablishing the requirement that farms \nmust protect highly erodible lands and wetlands in order to qualify for \ncrop insurance premium assistance. This was an issue that I was proud \nto help champion last year and that ultimately my Republican friend, \nthe Senior Senator from Georgia, was able to win a floor vote to \nrequire any producer seeking crop insurance premium assistance to also \nmeet a basic set of conservation compliance criteria established under \nthe Sodbuster and Swampbuster programs.\n  The concept behind the conservation compliance programs is simple: \nThe expenditure of Federal taxpayer dollars in support of farming \noperations cannot support farming practices that result in drainage of \nwetlands or farming of highly erodible lands. These conservation \ncompliance requirements have long been accepted and applied to broadly \nto a variety of other longstanding farmer financial safety net \nprograms. In fact, up until the 1996 farm bill these conservation \ncompliance programs also applied to Federal crop insurance premium \nassistance programs.\n  These minimum qualifications have been a success in ensuring that \nFederal taxpayer dollars are not supporting farming practices that lead \nto costly natural resource degradation. In Maryland, however, these \npractices are common place not just because our farmers want to be good \nstewards of the bay but because the State requires farmers to manage \nfor wetland and soil loss on their farms.\n  While I am proud of my Maryland farmers for their conservation work, \nthey are punished in the marketplace for their good stewardship where \nthey compete with producers whose production costs are lower because \ntheir operations are located in States that do not require mitigating \nthe impacts of their operations on the natural environment.\n  Because the 2013 farm bill aims to move farmers out of direct payment \nprograms and into expanded Crop Insurance Premium Assistance programs, \nreestablishing conservation compliance eligibility requirements for the \nCrop Insurance Program helps level the competitive playing field for \nMaryland farmers and other State's agricultural sectors that are doing \nwhat is right to protect the environment.\n  While mine and Senator Chambliss's efforts last year were met with \nsignificant challenges last year, a series of discussions between our \nNation's leading agricultural interests groups, like the American Farm \nBureau, and our Nation's top wildlife and conservation organizations \nresulted in a mutually agreed proposal to re-link conservation \ncompliance requirements to the crop insurance premium assistance \nprogram.\n  The Federal safety the farm bill provides for both farmers growing \nour Nation's food and low income families who have difficulty putting \nfood on the table continues on in this bill but with needed reforms. I \nam proud to support this bill and congratulate the chair and ranking \nmember.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, yesterday, I voted against passage of S. \n954, the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013, which is \ncommonly known as the farm bill. With an overall cost of nearly $1 \ntrillion, this legislation is more than we can afford at a time when \nour debt of nearly $17 trillion is growing rapidly each day. While I \nsupport some of the programs in this bill that are important to Florida \nand our State's important role in America's food supply, we cannot \nallow Washington to continue spending recklessly and condemning our \nchildren and grandchildren to a diminished future.\n  Not only was I concerned about the cost of this legislation, but I am \ndisappointed that ample opportunity was not provided to Senators to \nimprove it through a more open amendment process. When the farm bill \nwas considered last year, the Senate voted on over 70 amendments to the \nbill, including my RAISE Act amendment, which would have allowed \nworkers to earn more money for a job well done without having to first \nclear it by union bosses. This open process was not the case this time \naround and prevented my colleagues and I from introducing measures to \nimprove the bill, as well as timely measures such as my proposal to \npunish Internal Revenue Service employees who violate the First \nAmendment rights of our citizens.\n  I remain committed to championing sound policy important to the \nfarmers and working families that contribute to the agriculture \nindustry's success and whose products ultimately end up at our dinner \ntables. It is why I am pursuing reforms in other areas that would \nbenefit our farmers and our Nation. For example, I continue working \ntowards national immigration reform, which would help create a guest \nworker visa program to ensure an adequate agriculture workforce. This \nreform would achieve an agricultural workers program that allows us to \nbring in both temporary and long-term laborers to provide our farms, \ndairies and other agricultural industries with the workers they need \nand in a way that also protects the dignity and safety of those \nworkers.\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, yesterday, I voted for the Agriculture \nReform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013--the farm bill--which makes \nimportant reforms, such as ending the practice of direct payment \nagricultural subsidies, and provides strong support to our local \nfarmers which will help stabilize our food policies and increase access \nto fresh produce for the next decade.\n  I especially want to acknowledge and thank Senator Cowan, with whom I \nworked closely, for his successful effort to include in this bill a \nprovision that was also advocated by former Senator Kerry to help our \nstruggling fishermen in Massachusetts. This provision extends \neligibility in the emergency disaster loan program to fishermen.\n  When our farmers are struck by disasters, they have access to low-\ninterest emergency disaster--EM--loans available through USDA's Farm \nService Agency. These loans have been used in the past by farmers, \nranchers, and aqua farmers to help recover from crop production losses. \nNow, our Nation's fishermen will also have access to this important \nloan program.\n  I am also proud to have worked with Senator Cowan on his amendment to \nauthorize the Department of Agriculture to conduct a study to propose a \nmethod for a voluntary crop insurance program for seafood harvesters. \nFisherman and farmers face the same economic hardships when there are \nsignificant drops in production. This study is an important step toward \nproviding the seafood industry with an insurance product to reduce \ntheir risk. I thank Senator Cowan and former Senator Kerry for their \nleadership on these efforts to help out fisherman who experiencing very \ndifficult economic hardships.\n  Although I am proud to support the broad policies in this \nlegislation, there are certain measures in this bill that I strongly \noppose and that I will push to modify when the bill is considered in \nconference.\n  In particular, I am deeply concerned with the changes that the farm \nbill makes to the SNAP program. I will continue working to ensure that \nassistance is available to all families who need help putting food on \nthe table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/11/senate-section/article/S4207-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4207-S4208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SAFE COMMUNITIES, SAFE SCHOOLS ACT OF 2013\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in May, thousands of law enforcement \nofficers from around the Nation came together at the National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, DC to commemorate Peace \nOfficers Memorial Day. The Congressional resolution that created this \nday of reflection dedicated it to the extraordinary law enforcement \nofficers ``who, night and day, stand guard in our midst to protect us \nthrough enforcement of our laws,'' as well as the ``Federal, State, and \nmunicipal officers who have been killed or disabled in the line of \nduty.''\n  As we commemorate Peace Officers Memorial Day, it is vital for us to \nnot only to honor the extraordinary work of our Nation's law \nenforcement professionals, but also to listen to their suggestions for \nhow we can make our Nation a safer place to live. And on one subject, \nthe overwhelming majority of\n\n[[Page S4208]]\n\nour Nation's law enforcement communities have been resolute and clear: \nCongress needs to support common sense measures, such as background \nchecks for gun sales, to help stem the gun violence that plagues our \nNation.\n  This is far from a revolutionary idea. Polls consistently show that \napproximately 90 percent of Americans support universal background \nchecks. So do major law enforcement groups such as the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, \nthe International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators, \nthe National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives, the \nNational Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, the Police \nExecutive Research Forum and the Police Foundation. These groups, each \nof them dedicated to the safety of our people, tell us that the time is \nnow to act to prevent more senseless gun violence.\n  The extension of background checks to all gun sales would go a long \nway toward making our neighborhoods safer. Today, anyone, including \nconvicted felons and the mentally ill, can walk into a gun show and \nwalk out with a deadly weapon. As Police Chief Ronald Haddad of \nDearborn, MI put it in a letter he wrote to me this past April, \n``Police see firsthand the toll that gun violence takes in our schools, \non our streets, and among our fellow officers--and we know from \nexperience that our broken gun laws are a significant part of the \nproblem.''\n  This status quo has dangerous consequences. A 2004 Department of \nJustice survey found that 80 percent of prisoners who committed crimes \nwith handguns got them through private transfers, where no background \ncheck is required. In many of these cases, a simple background check \ncould have stopped a tragedy and saved lives by keeping a weapon out of \nthe hands of someone who sought to use it for harm. As Baltimore County \nPolice Chief James Johnson put it at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee hearing earlier this year, ``The best way to stop a bad guy \nfrom getting a gun in the first place is a good background check.''\n  We should listen to the voices of those entrusted with the safety of \nour communities. We should listen to the officers who every day \nconfront well-armed criminals who legally purchase weapons to turn on \ninnocents. We should live up to the spirit of Peace Officers Memorial \nDay by passing the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013, a common \nsense piece of legislation to protect our society from more senseless \ngun violence. We owe the brave law enforcement professionals who keep \nour communities safe nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/11/senate-section/article/S4208-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WORLD WAR II VETERANS VISIT\n\n  Mr. TESTER.

This journey will no doubt bring about a lot of \nmemories. I hope it will give them a deep sense of pride as well.\n  What they achieved together almost 70 years ago was remarkable. That \nmemorial is a testament to the fact that a grateful nation will never \nforget what they did or what they sacrificed. To us, they were our \ngreatest generation.

Madam President; I rise today for a moment of bittersweet \nreflection and the celebration of a dedicated public servant who has \ncontributed greatly to the State of Maryland and our entire Nation. \nJune 21st marks the final day that Susan Sullam will be working in my \noffice as my communications director. We've traversed a 27-year journey \ntogether that started when I was first running for the House of \nRepresentatives. Over the years, with a combination of her quick \nwriting and single-minded determination, she has helped me find my \nvoice and articulate my positions during the very best and the very \nworst of times for me and our country. She has been a friend, trusted \ncounselor, and a part of my extended family.\n  As a former editor at Knight-Ridder with an interest in politics, \nSusan became one of my first and few campaign workers. She was \ninstrumental in helping me win my first election to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. And when I took office, she became my first press \nsecretary. Somehow, Susan managed to give 110 percent of herself to her \nfamily and to her job.\n  Throughout our time working together, I have had the privilege of \nwatching Susan's daughters, Jennifer and Karen, grow into remarkable, \nprofessionally accomplished young women. She instilled in her girls the \nunderstanding that you really could raise a family and have a career \nwithout shortchanging either one. I am forever grateful to them and \nSusan's husband Brian for sharing her time with me and the people of \nMaryland. I know Susan's family is looking forward to their first \ndinner without her Blackberry\n  I have always thought that Susan was born to be a journalist. Her \nmother, Mary Jane Fisher, was an admired and respected journalist and \npublicist who worked for 25 years as the Washington correspondent for \nthe National Underwriter, a publisher of insurance and financial \nservices trade publications. She was a well-known figure on Capitol \nHill, and she frequented hearings of the Ways and Means Committee, \nwhere I served.\n  During one particularly memorable Medicare hearing, I watched from \nthe dais as three generations of this wonderful family all worked the \nroom. Mary Jane was reporting for her publication; Susan was covering \nthe hearing as my press secretary; and Susan's daughter Jennifer was \nserving as an intern in the Ways and Means press office that summer, \nreporting to her boss, now-Representative Dan Maffei of New York.\n  Susan has been witness to the good and bad of politics over the \ncourse of nearly three decades. We started together at a time of great \noptimism that Congress could make decisions and enact meaningful \nlegislation. Susan worked tirelessly during the many iterations of \nhealth care reform; she was constantly and meticulous pulling together \nmaterials that would help explain how real families would benefit from \nthe passage of the legislation. This was as true in the 1990s with \nHillary Clinton, as it was just a few years ago when we finally passed \nthe Affordable Care Act. Her congressional career also encompassed my \ntime as a member of the House Ethics Committee. During this period, \nSusan was witness to the various undertakings of the committee as it \ncarried out it is authorization to investigate violations of the House \nof Code of Official Conduct by Members and staff, investigations that \nincluded the ``House Bank'' and the Speaker of the House.\n  But Susan's career was so much more. As I pushed to reshape our \nretirement system, Susan was there every step of the way with an \narticle, interview, or a cable show designed specifically to get out \nthe word to people who could benefit from the proposed legislative \nchanges.\n  Some moments we have shared together tested our Nation, as well as \nour professional relationship. We came together as a family during 9/\n11, watching our Nation as it was grievously wounded. I voted against \ngiving President George W. Bush the power to send\n\n[[Page S4209]]\n\nour troops into Iraq. While I knew it was the right decision, it was \ncertainly not an easy one at the time. She pushed hard and urged me to \ntake the strongest possible position against the war. She was my voice \nand my megaphone.\n  What makes all of Susan's accomplishments so much greater is the fact \nthat she did much of this split between Washington and Baltimore. She \nwas born and raised a Washingtonian but made Baltimore her home and the \nplace she raised her family. She was as comfortable talking about \nrestaurants on Federal Hill as Adams Morgan. When I was elected to the \nU.S. Senate, Susan was with me as I traveled throughout the State. She \nwelcomed the opportunity to expand our representation to all of \nMaryland. Together we held press conferences on the Eastern Shore, \nvisited editorial boards in western Maryland, and attended ribbon \ncuttings from Aberdeen to Fort Meade. Susan made herself familiar with \nnearly every Maryland smalltown newspaper and most of their publishers \nand could tell you about their editors without missing a beat.\n  After 27 years, I take as much pride as Susan in the fact that she \nreally has had more opportunities than anyone else to share my voice \nand my positions on issues of importance with the people of Maryland \nand the Nation. I have enjoyed working side-by-side with her and having \nher as an anchor of Team Cardin. I have learned from her, and I thank \nher for her time. Her quick words, honesty, and dedication to public \nservice will be missed by me, Myrna, and my entire staff. It is with \nheartfelt gratitude that I wish her well in this next stage of her \nlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/11/senate-section/article/S4209-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING EUGENE RUEHLMANN\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, today I wish to remember Eugene \nRuehlmann, former mayor of Cincinnati, OH, for his leadership, his \nvisions, and his dedication to his community and for his distinguished \ncareer in law and public service. Mr. Ruehlmann passed away at the age \nof 88 on June 8, 2013.\n  A native Cincinnatian, Mr. Ruehlmann's talents were recognized early \non when he was voted ``Boy Mayor of Cincinnati'' in 1942 as a teenager. \nHis public service career officially took off years later after he \nserved our Nation in the U.S. Marine Corps in World War II, earned \ndegrees from the University of Cincinnati and Harvard Law School and \nlaunched a successful law practice. Ultimately, Mr. Ruehlmann served 12 \nyears on the Cincinnati City Council beginning in 1959 and served as \nthe mayor of Cincinnati from 1967-1971.\n  Known as a ``Clean Gene'' for his principled leadership and legendary \nintegrity, Mr. Ruehlmann was instrumental in advancing Cincinnati as a \nmajor league city. His leadership included guiding the early \ntransformation of downtown Cincinnati with the development of the new \nFountain Square Plaza, Riverfront Stadium, the establishment of an NFL \nteam, the Cincinnati Bengals, and constructing Cincinnati's Convention \nCenter.\n  Following the race riots in 1967, Mr. Ruehlmann worked to heal the \ncity. He reformulated the city's Human Relations Commission, and \nfounded the Mayor's Housing Coordinating Committee and the city's \nProject Commitment.\n  He has given his time to numerous charitable and community \norganizations, such as Children's Hospital, Children's Hospital Medical \nCenter, Greater Cincinnati Foundation, the Work and Rehabilitation \nCenter, March of Dimes and the National Conference of Christians and \nJews.\n  Mr. Ruehlmann was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the University \nof Cincinnati in 2011. In 1998, he was named a Great Living \nCincinnatian by the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce for his \nlifetime of service and leadership. In 1970, the Urban League of \nCincinnati honored him with a special award for Outstanding Achievement \nin Public Service.\n  He built a successful law practice as founder of the Strauss, Troy \nand Ruehlmann law firm, as a partner with Vorys, Sater, Seymour and \nPease in Cincinnati, and as a director on the Board of the Center for \nResolution of Disputes.\n  In all these years, and with all these accomplishments, he remained a \ndevoted family man. He and his late wife, Virginia, were married for 61 \nyears and raised 8 children, 25 grandchildren and 11 great-\ngrandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I would like to honor Eugene Ruehlmann for his \ndedication to the City of Cincinnati, to his community and to his \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/11/senate-section/article/S4209-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    RECOGNIZING BOY SCOUT TROOP 414\n\n Mr. BROWN.

This organization has helped create a foundation for boys \nto realize their responsibilities as citizens. Boy Scouts learn to \nvalue leadership, discipline, equality, justice, and integrity--but, \nperhaps, the greatest lesson shared with Scouts is the importance of \nservice.\n  Good citizenship matters. It strengthens our democracy, transforms \nstrangers into neighbors, and helps move us closer to becoming a more \njust and open society.\n  Troop 414, one of the oldest troops in Ohio, remains active in the \nlocal community. From volunteering and maintaining the county \nfairgrounds to collecting items for the local food bank and organizing \nmonthly camping trips, Troop 414 provides new opportunities for boys to \ncontribute to Northeast Ohio.\n  As an Eagle Scout, I am especially proud of the Eagle Scouts in Troop \n414: Alex Coker, Bradley Cuthbert Jr., Connor Dunwoodie, Aaron \nFerguson, Stephen Ferguson, and Michael Savel.\n  With more than 30 additional active troop members under the guidance \nof Scoutmaster Darrell French, I know that the future of scouting is \nbright in Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/11/senate-section/article/S4209-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4209-S4210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       REMEMBERING MASTER SERGEANT WILLIAM SEYMOUR ``BULL'' EVANS\n\nMr. CARDIN. Madam President, today I would like to pay tribute \nto U.S. Marine Corps MSgt William Seymour ``Bull'' Evans of Cresaptown, \nMD. ``Bull'' Evans was a member of the legendary Marine Corps Raiders \nand fought valiantly in some of the most pivotal battles of the South \nPacific during World War II and the Korean war. ``Bull'' Evans remains \none of the most decorated military servicemen in western Maryland. He \namassed an impressive number of medals and awards, including the Purple \nHeart with four clusters; two Presidential citations; the Bronze Star; \nSilver Star; Navy Cross; and many others over the course of a 15-year \nmilitary career.\n  Evans' strength as a swimmer was recognized early in his youth in \nCresaptown, where he could frequently be found swimming in the Potomac \nRiver even during the winter months. When Evans was 18, he enlisted in \nthe Marine Corps, where he eventually became an expert in amphibious \nassault techniques and was selected to serve with the elite 2nd \nBattalion, First Marine Raiders. Evans was on his first furlough, in \nHonolulu, when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941. He was among \nthe first volunteers for the newly-organized Second Battalion, First \nMarine Raiders, a special operations force formed in response to the \nattack. Evans' heroic acts have made him a legend among Marines--36 \nhours of continuous action on Midway Island, a solitary advance to stop \nan assault on his unit while pinned down by the enemy on Tulagi, and \nsinglehandedly stringing barbed wire to prevent an attack on his unit's \nposition near Guadalcanal. His penchant for rapidly advancing into \nenemy territory by himself established his reputation as the ``One Man \nArmy'' and earned him the nickname ``Bull'' among his brothers in arms.\n  Following Evans' service in World War II and as the conflict grew in \nKorea, he volunteered to join the 1st Marine Division and, in spite of \ninjuries sustained in earlier campaigns, signed a waiver allowing him \nto fight.

Madam President, today I would like to pay tribute \nto U.S. Marine Corps MSgt William Seymour ``Bull'' Evans of Cresaptown, \nMD. ``Bull'' Evans was a member of the legendary Marine Corps Raiders \nand fought valiantly in some of the most pivotal battles of the South \nPacific during World War II and the Korean war. ``Bull'' Evans remains \none of the most decorated military servicemen in western Maryland. He \namassed an impressive number of medals and awards, including the Purple \nHeart with four clusters; two Presidential citations; the Bronze Star; \nSilver Star; Navy Cross; and many others over the course of a 15-year \nmilitary career.\n  Evans' strength as a swimmer was recognized early in his youth in \nCresaptown, where he could frequently be found swimming in the Potomac \nRiver even during the winter months. When Evans was 18, he enlisted in \nthe Marine Corps, where he eventually became an expert in amphibious \nassault techniques and was selected to serve with the elite 2nd \nBattalion, First Marine Raiders. Evans was on his first furlough, in \nHonolulu, when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941. He was among \nthe first volunteers for the newly-organized Second Battalion, First \nMarine Raiders, a special operations force formed in response to the \nattack. Evans' heroic acts have made him a legend among Marines--36 \nhours of continuous action on Midway Island, a solitary advance to stop \nan assault on his unit while pinned down by the enemy on Tulagi, and \nsinglehandedly stringing barbed wire to prevent an attack on his unit's \nposition near Guadalcanal. His penchant for rapidly advancing into \nenemy territory by himself established his reputation as the ``One Man \nArmy'' and earned him the nickname ``Bull'' among his brothers in arms.\n  Following Evans' service in World War II and as the conflict grew in \nKorea, he volunteered to join the 1st Marine Division and, in spite of \ninjuries sustained in earlier campaigns, signed a waiver allowing him \nto fight. After being seriously wounded by machine-gun fire and \nshrapnel, Evans returned to the battlefield to assist in\n\n[[Page S4210]]\n\ntraining South Korean troops and was later assigned to a military \npolice unit in Japan where he reunited with his wife and children.\n  ``Bull'' Evans also earned a unique distinction when, in 1952, he \nbecame the only Marine authorized to wear a beard, despite military \nregulations against it. During the Korean war, when Maj. Gen. John T. \nSelden instructed all Marines to be clean shaven, he issued an edict \nthat ``For honor and distinction, Sgt Evans will be exempt from this \norder and permission to let his beard grow is granted.''\n  After serving with distinction in two wars, MSgt ``Bull'' Evans died \nsuddenly and unexpectedly of cardiac failure in 1954. High-ranking \nofficials from both the United States and Japan, standing side-by-side \nwith thousands of Marines, attended his funeral.\n  I am pleased that because of the advocacy of local veterans, \nhistorians, and political leaders in western Maryland, the legacy of \nthis true American hero will be preserved by dedicating a portion of \nU.S. Route 220 through his hometown of Cresaptown, MD to USMC MSgt \nWilliam ``Bull'' Evans on June 29, 2013.

A bill to authorize the extension of preferential tariff \ntreatment for certain textile goods imported from Nicaragua; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto extend a critical textile and apparel trade program with Nicaragua, \ncurrently set to expire at the end of 2014 through the end of 2024.\n  This is a unique program which benefits not only Nicaraguan apparel \nfactories and U.S. apparel companies and retailers, but U.S. fabric and \nyarn mills as well.\n  Let me explain.\n  In an effort to promote trade between the United States and \nNicaragua, the 2006 Central American Free Trade Agreement, CAFTA, \nallows Nicaragua to export to the United States a limited amount of \napparel products duty free regardless of the source of the yarn or \nfabric.\n  Specifically, this Tariff Preference Level, TPL, allows Nicaragua to \nexport 100 million square meter equivalents, SMEs, of apparel made with \nfabric from non-CAFTA countries as long as the apparel is assembled in \nNicaragua.\n  In order to ensure that U.S. fabric producers could also take \nadvantage of this program, it contains a special rule for trousers.\n  It requires Nicaragua to purchase one square meter of U.S. fabric for \nevery one square meter of non-CAFTA woven trouser fabric.\n  That is, under this ``one for one'' rule, for each export of woven \ntrousers made from non-CAFTA fabric, Nicaragua agreed to export to the \nU.S. an equal amount of woven trousers made of U.S. fabric, up to a \ncertain level 50 million square meter equivalents.\n  This ``one for one'' feature has been especially successful, \nresulting in an increase in U.S. fabric exports to Nicaragua and an \nincrease in apparel production jobs in Central America.\n  In fact, since 2006, when the program went into effect, U.S. fabric \nexports to Nicaragua have nearly doubled from $57.3 million to $110.2 \nmillion.\n  Nicaragua is now the fastest growing market for U.S. fabric exports \nto the CAFTA region.\n  Nicaragua has also greatly benefited from this program.\n  I would remind my colleagues that Nicaragua, with a GDP per capita of \n$3,300, is the poorest country in Central America and the second \npoorest country in the Western Hemisphere.\n  Approximately 42.5 percent of Nicaragua's population lives below the \npoverty line.\n  It is vital that Nicaragua develop and grow new export opportunities \nto help lift its people out of poverty. And that is what this program \nhas done.\n  Since 2006, total apparel exports from Nicaragua to the U.S. have \ndoubled. The program now accounts for 25 percent of those exports.\n  Between 2005 and 2013, jobs in the apparel sector in Nicaragua have \ngrown\n\n[[Page S4215]]\n\nby 23 percent. That is, 13,236 new jobs have been created since CAFTA \nwent into effect.\n  With a program that has proven to be so successful and mutually \nbeneficial, it is appropriate for Congress to extend it and ensure that \nthese benefits continue.\n  Some of my colleagues may wonder why I am introducing legislation now \nto extend a textile and apparel trade program that will not expire \nuntil the end of 2014.\n  The simple answer is that an early renewal is critical for business \nplanning purposes.\n  U.S. companies that have taken advantage of this program are making \ndecisions now about their long-term investments and where they will \nsource apparel products.\n  Extending this program several months before its expiration date will \nhelp give U.S. companies the necessary confidence to continue to invest \nin Nicaragua and take advantage of its benefits.\n  If we wait until the last minute to extend the program, the ties that \nhave been developed between U.S. and Nicaraguan companies and the \nbenefits accrued will be put at risk.\n  Simply put, U.S. companies will not make the commitments to Nicaragua \nif there is a chance the textile and apparel trade program will lapse.\n  They will look elsewhere for new business opportunities to avoid what \nwould in essence be a new trade barrier to U.S. textile exports and \nU.S. apparel companies in Nicaragua.\n  And as U.S. apparel orders from Nicaragua decline, U.S. textile \nexports to Nicaragua will also decline. Jobs will be lost.\n  U.S. companies are looking for assurances that the U.S. is committed \nto this program after 2014 and that is why this legislation is needed \nnow.\n  It is supported by the American Apparel and Footwear Association, the \nNational Retail Federation, the Retail Industry Leaders Association, \nand the United States Association of Importers of Textile and Apparel.\n  It is a win-win trade program promoting jobs and economic growth in \nboth countries.\n  Nicaragua will be able to continue to develop a vital export industry \nand U.S. apparel companies, retailers, and textile manufacturers will \ncontinue to access a growing, thriving market in Central America.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. Cantwell, \n        Mr. Merkley, and Mr. Blumenthal):\n  S. 1137.

ONE HUNDRED PERCENT EXIT TRACKING FOR ALL UNITED \n                   STATES VISITORS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Consistent with the Illegal Immigration Reform and \n     Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, the United States will \n     continue its progress toward full biometric entry-exit \n     capture capability at land, air, and sea points of entry.\n       (2) No capability exists to fully track whether non-United \n     States persons in the United States on a temporary basis have \n     exited the country consistent with the terms of their visa, \n     whether by land, sea, or air.\n       (3) No program exists along the Southwest border to track \n     land exits from the United States into Mexico.\n       (4) Without the ability to capture the full cycle of an \n     alien's trip into and out of the United States, it is \n     possible for persons to remain in the United States \n     unlawfully for years without detection by U.S. Immigration \n     and Customs Enforcement.\n       (5) Because there is no exit tracking capability, there is \n     insufficient data for an official assessment of the number of \n     persons who have overstayed a visa and that remain in the \n     United States. Studies have estimated that as many as 40 \n     percent of all persons in the United States without lawful \n     immigration status entered the country legally and did not \n     return to their country of origin or follow the terms of \n     their entry.\n       (6) Despite a legal mandate to track alien exits, more than \n     a decade without any significant capability to do so has--\n       (A) degraded the Federal Government's ability to enforce \n     immigration laws;\n       (B) placed a greater strain on law enforcement resources; \n     and\n       (C) undermined the legal immigration process in the United \n     States.\n       (b) Requirement for Outbound Travel Document Capture at \n     Land Points of Entry.--\n       (1) Outbound travel document capture at foot crossings.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall establish a \n     mandatory exit data system for all outbound lanes at each \n     land point of entry along the Southern border that is only \n     accessible to individuals on foot or by nonmotorized means.\n       (B) Data collection requirements.--The system established \n     under subparagraph (A) shall require the collection of data \n     from machine-readable visas, passports, and other travel and \n     entry documents for all categories of aliens who are exiting \n     the United States through an outbound lane described in \n     subparagraph (A).\n       (2) Outbound travel document capture at all other land \n     points of entry.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall establish a \n     mandatory exit data system at all outbound lanes not subject \n     to paragraph (1) at each land point of entry along the \n     Southern border.\n       (B) Data collection requirements.--The system established \n     under subparagraph (A) shall require the collection of data \n     from machine-readable visas, passports, and other travel and \n     entry documents for all categories of aliens who are exiting \n     the United States through an outbound lane described in \n     subparagraph (A).\n       (3) Information required for collection.--While collecting \n     information under paragraphs (1) and (2), the Secretary shall \n     collect identity-theft resistant departure information from \n     the machine-readable visas, passports, and other travel and \n     entry documents.\n       (4) Recording of exits and correlation to entry data.--The \n     Secretary shall integrate the records collected under \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) into the interoperable data system \n     established under section 3303(b) and any other database \n     necessary to correlate an alien's entry and exit data.\n       (5) Processing of records.--Before the departure of \n     outbound aliens at each point of entry, the Secretary shall \n     provide for cross-reference capability between databases \n     designated by the Secretary under paragraph (4) to determine \n     and record whether an outbound alien has been in the United \n     States without lawful immigration status.\n       (6) Records inclusion requirements.--The Secretary shall \n     maintain readily accessible entry-exit data records for \n     immigration and other law enforcement and improve immigration \n     control and enforcement by including information necessary to \n     determine whether an outbound alien without lawful presence \n     in the United States entered the country through--\n       (A) unauthorized entry between points of entry;\n       (B) visa or other temporary authorized status;\n       (C) fraudulent travel documents;\n       (D) misrepresentation of identity; or\n       (E) any other method of entry.\n       (7) Prohibition on collecting exit records for united \n     states citizens.--\n       (A) Prohibition.--While documenting the departure of \n     outbound individuals at each point of entry along the \n     Southern border, the Secretary may not--\n       (i) process travel documents of United States citizens;\n       (ii) log, store, or transfer exit data for United States \n     citizens;\n       (iii) create, maintain, operate, access, or support any \n     database containing information collected through outbound \n     processing at a point of entry under paragraph (1) or (2) \n     that contains records identifiable to an individual United \n     States citizen.\n       (B) Exception.--The prohibition set forth in subparagraph \n     (A) does not apply to the records of an individual if an \n     officer processing travel documentation in the outbound lanes \n     at a point of entry along the Southern border--\n       (i) has a strong suspicion that the individual has engaged \n     in criminal or other prohibited activities; or\n       (ii) needs to verify an individual's identity because the \n     individual is attempting to exit the United States without \n     travel documentation.\n       (C) Verification of travel documents.--Subject to the \n     prohibition set forth in subparagraph (A), the Secretary may \n     provide for the confirmation of a United States citizen's \n     travel documentation validity in the outbound lanes at a \n     point of entry along the Southern border.\n       (c) Infrastructure Improvements at Land Points of Entry.--\n       (1) Facilitation of land exit tracking.--The Secretary may \n     improve the infrastructure at, or adjacent to, land points of \n     entry, as necessary, to implement the requirements under \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b), by--\n       (A) expanding or reconfiguring outbound road or bridge \n     lanes within a point of entry;\n       (B) improving or reconfiguring public roads or other \n     transportation infrastructure leading into, or adjacent to, \n     the outbound lanes at a point of entry if--\n       (i) there has been a demonstrated negative impact on \n     transportation in the area adjacent to a point of entry as a \n     result of projects carried out under this section; or\n\n[[Page S4223]]\n\n       (ii) the Secretary, in consultation with State, local, or \n     tribal officials responsible for transportation adjacent to a \n     point of entry, has submitted a report to the Committee on \n     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate and \n     the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \n     Representatives that projects proposed under this section \n     will have a significant negative impact on transportation \n     adjacent to a point of entry without such transportation \n     infrastructure improvements; and\n       (iii) the total of funds obligated in any year to improve \n     infrastructure outside a point of entry under subsection \n     (c)(1) shall not exceed 25 percent of the total funds \n     obligated to meet the requirements under paragraphs (1) and \n     (2) of subsection (b) in the same year;\n       (C) constructing, expanding, or improving access to \n     secondary inspection areas, where feasible;\n       (D) physical structures to accommodate inspections and \n     processing travel documents described in subsection (b)(3) \n     for outbound aliens, including booths or kiosks at exit \n     lanes;\n       (E) transfer, installation, use, and maintenance of \n     computers, software or other network infrastructure to \n     facilitate capture and processing of travel documents \n     described in subsection (b)(3) for all outbound aliens; and\n       (F) performance of outbound inspections outside of \n     secondary inspection areas at a point of entry to detect \n     suspicious activity or contraband.\n       (2) Report on infrastructure requirements to carry out 100 \n     percent land exit tracking.--Not later than 45 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall \n     submit, to the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Homeland Security of the House of Representatives, a report \n     that assesses the infrastructure needs for each point of \n     entry along the Southern border to fulfill the requirements \n     under subsection (b), including--\n       (A) a description of anticipated infrastructure needs \n     within each point of entry;\n       (B) a description of anticipated infrastructure needs \n     adjacent to each point of entry;\n       (C) an assessment of the availability of secondary \n     inspection areas at each point of entry;\n       (D) an assessment of space available at or adjacent to a \n     point of entry to perform processing of outbound aliens;\n       (E) an assessment of the infrastructure demands relative to \n     the volume of outbound crossings for each point of entry;
