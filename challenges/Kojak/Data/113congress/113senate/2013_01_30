Madam President, I rise today to honor John Kerry, our \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Massachusetts. I congratulate \nSenator Kerry on his confirmation as our Nation's next Secretary of \nState.\n  I am pleased he will continue to serve his country in this important \nrole. He will be missed by his Senate colleagues, that is for sure.\n  Senator Kerry said at his confirmation hearing that the Senate is in \nhis blood, and that is true. As he represents America's interests \naround the world, his experience as a Senator will serve him and our \ncountry well.\n  For 28 years, Senator Kerry has been a dedicated representative of \nthe people of Massachusetts in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S370]]\n\nSenator Kerry has also rendered distinguished service to his country in \nthe Navy, to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as Lieutenant Governor \nand as Senator, and to the Democratic Party and the people of this \ncountry as the 2004 Presidential nominee for the Democratic Party.\n  He is a brilliant man. He was a debater at Yale and won awards for \nhis skilled oratory over a number of years. That talent has allowed him \nto speak for freedom and justice at each stage of his career.\n  Before he graduated college, he was a vocal critic of the Vietnam \nwar. But upon graduation, Senator Kerry volunteered to serve in the \nU.S. Navy, and serve he did. Later he said he did it because ``it was \nthe right thing to do.''\n  Senator Kerry learned the value of service at home. His father was a \nForeign Service officer, and his mother was a nurse during World War \nII. He served two tours as a Navy lieutenant in the jungles and rivers \nof Vietnam. He was awarded the Silver Star for his gallantry, a Bronze \nStar for valor also, and three Purple Hearts. But even after his \nservice in the war, his opposition continued.\n\n  On April 22, 1971, Senator Kerry became the first Vietnam veteran to \ntestify before Congress about the war when he appeared before the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, which was chaired by the famous \nSenator William Fulbright--a committee he would later chair. It was a \nremarkable appearance. He was the first veteran to testify.\n  He went on to attend Boston College Law School. He worked as a \nprosecutor in Middlesex County before he was elected Lieutenant \nGovernor in 1982. Just 2 years later he was elected to the U.S. Senate. \nHe has served in the Senate for five terms. He has always been an \nunflinching advocate for veterans. He helped found the Vietnam Veterans \nfor America and has worked tirelessly to secure treatment for \nservicemembers dealing with post-traumatic stress.\n  Senator Kerry has served 6 years on the Senate Intelligence Committee \nand, remarkably, 28 years on the Foreign Relations Committee. He has \nbeen a leading advocate of doing something about global climate change.\n  Senator Kerry has convened eight major hearings and roundtables on \nclimate change and energy security since taking the gavel as chair of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, replacing Vice President Biden.\n  It was in the early 1990s that Senator Kerry's brilliant mind and \nexceptional dedication came to my attention. I had the good fortune of \nbeing chosen by Leader Mitchell to be a member of the select committee \non MIAs--missing in action--and POWs. It was very controversial at that \ntime. There was a belief by many that there were live Americans either \nin Cambodia, Laos--maybe in Vietnam. We had not done as much as people \nthought we should do about those missing in action, and it was a very \nvolatile period of time in the history of this country.\n  I saw him with patience, with wisdom, serve as chairman of that \nselect committee. As I have indicated, it was a difficult assignment, \nan important assignment, and he handled it--as he has done everything I \nhave watched him do--thoughtfully and with integrity.\n  Since coming to the Senate I have been fortunate to be invited to his \nhome for lengthy but fascinating foreign policy discussions with Senate \ncolleagues and foreign policy experts. In recent years, Senator Kerry \nwas also instrumental in securing passage of the New START treaty with \nRussia, which is helping to reduce the danger of nuclear proliferation.\n  He has served as an unofficial envoy for President Obama to \nAfghanistan, Sudan, Pakistan, and some countries probably none of us \neven know where he went. There were many times he came to me and said: \nI have to go, and he tells me where he is going, and there was nothing \nin the newspapers about where he had gone. But he is a great evaluator \nof people, and because of that, the President has trusted him and has \nsent him on all these missions. Now he will do that as Secretary of \nState.\n  He has authored numerous pieces of legislation to prevent the global \nspread of HIV/AIDS. He has also played a central role in crafting \nAmerican policy in Iraq and Afghanistan, the war on terror. I can \nremember one very difficult time when he spent days and days, \nprincipally with President Karzai, working out a difficult issue \nfollowing the elections they had there. He has been focused on the \nMiddle East peace process and Israel's security for his entire time as \na member of that committee, the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  For more than 30 years, Senator Kerry has been a powerful voice for \nhis constituents in Massachusetts as well as an engaged citizen of the \nworld. Throughout those years, John has matched his unflinching passion \nfor democratic values with forward-thinking actions to advance those \nvalues.\n  No one is better qualified than John Kerry to continue the \nexceptional work of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. While we are \nsaddened to lose his leadership in the Senate, we saw yesterday the \nsupport he has, where virtually every Senator voted to support him as \nthe next Secretary of State. I wish him well as he embarks on this next \nchallenge, and I am confident he will meet the challenge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/30/senate-section/article/S370-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, a few weeks ago, President Obama \nreportedly said America does not have a spending problem. Well, of \ncourse, we know that is not accurate. This is completely at odds with \nwhat independent experts tell us and what is perfectly apparent to \nanybody who is alert. Last week, I brought this chart behind me to the \nfloor to illustrate the point.\n  As everyone knows, we are running trillion-dollar annual deficits. \nWhat this chart shows is that the gap between government spending and \nrevenue just keeps getting wider and wider and wider. So let's take a \nlook at it.\n  The occupant of the chair is relatively new to the Senate but not new \nto the facts. The green area here represents both historic and \nprojected tax revenue. The dark blue area--as you can see, the really \nkind of flat lines out here to 2040--is the new revenue the President \nreceived at the end of the year as a result of operation of the law. \nThe tax rates sunsetted, expired at midnight on New Year's Eve. The \nCongress then wisely continued the current tax rates for 99 percent of \nAmericans, made those rates permanent so we would not have another \nevent like New Year's Eve where we came to an abrupt conclusion. Most \nimportantly, for States such as the State of the occupant of the chair \nand my own, a $5 million per person exemption on the death tax was made \npermanent and indexed to inflation.\n  The President wanted more revenue than that and continues to talk \nabout more revenue. So if we take all the revenue the President said he \nwants to get, over and above the revenue he got as a result of the law \nexpiring--that is this dark blue area--if we gave him every bit of new \ntax revenue he wanted over and above that, we would have this light \nblue area like this.\n  So we can see, colleagues, that even if the President got all the \nrevenue he wanted, it only produces this much in a pretty flat line \ngoing way out into the future.\n  So, clearly, what one can conclude from this--whether you think the \nrevenue the President got is enough or you think the President ought to \nhave as much revenue as he wants--factually, it does not solve the \nproblem. It does not solve the problem because we do not have this \nproblem because we tax too little; we have it because we spend way too \nmuch because the red area is the spending trajectory.\n  So it is perfectly obvious for anybody who is not going to ignore the \nfacts that this is not a revenue problem; this is a spending problem. \nAnd until we solve this problem, we cannot leave behind for our \nchildren and our grandchildren the kind of country our parents left \nbehind for us.\n  This, my colleagues, is the Europeanization of America. This is the \npathway to Greece and Italy and Spain, and maybe now even France as\n\n[[Page S371]]\n\nwell--perpetual high unemployment, an economy kind of in a death spiral \nthat just kind of bumps along like ours, which is now bumping along at \na 1.5-percent growth rate.\n  It is time to get serious about solving this problem. This ``red'' \nrises like a mountain over a relatively flat plain of green.\n  Now, I know there is almost an article of faith on the other side \nwith some--maybe not all--that it is a revenue problem. Clearly, it is \nnot a revenue problem. More to the point, tax revenue as a share of our \ngross domestic product is today about the same as it has been over the \nlast four decades. Spending, on the other hand, averaged just 18.5 \npercent over that same period but today stands at about 23 percent of \ngross domestic product--one of the highest spending levels since World \nWar II. It is about to get much worse, growing to nearly 40 percent of \nGDP in just a few decades--40 percent of GDP. There is simply no other \nway to solve this problem--no other way to solve the problem--than to \nget our spending under control.\n  A significant portion of the dramatic spending increase to come is \nthe result of tens of millions of baby boomers reaching retirement age. \nWe know this. Erskine Bowles, the Chairman of the Bowles-Simpson \nCommission, said it was the most predictable crisis in American \nhistory.\n  We are in a position to do something about this. We should. But that \nis only one part of the problem. It is the biggest part of the problem, \nbut it is only one part of it. We need to shine a light into every \ncorner of the budget, especially the dark corners that often evade real \nscrutiny. Programs that do not work should be scrapped, and when \nconsidering those that do, we still need to ask the question, Can it be \ndone better, faster, more efficiently?\n  We need to root out waste, which will serve as the first real test of \nthe Democrats' seriousness in this debate. I mean, why is the Federal \nGovernment funding Chinese studies on pig manure--why--and research \ninto the smoking habits of Jordanian college students and reality TV \nshows in India? Are our friends on the other side prepared to cut this \nkind of waste? Because if they are not, if they demand a 1-to-1 ratio \nbetween tax increases and pig manure cuts, then there is really no hope \nof ever putting our country back on the path to prosperity.\n  The Senate will soon begin consideration of H.R. 325. If it passes, \nwe will have a few more months to come up with the kinds of spending \nreforms necessary to secure a longer extension of the debt ceiling. \nThat extra time will give us a chance to break the Democrats' other bad \nhabit of leaving everything--literally everything--until the last \nminute. But we can only do it if we get to work now and return to what \nwe call around here the regular order. Remember, regular order is how \nthe Senate is supposed to function. Committees are supposed to be \nallowed to evaluate legislation. Amendments are supposed to be \nconsidered. The public is supposed to have a chance to scrutinize the \nproposals that are actually before us.\n  Look, I know that solving the debt challenge is not going to be easy. \nPutting our country on a sustainable fiscal and economic path is going \nto require both parties committing to serious spending reforms. But \nthis is a challenge we must overcome. By doing the hard work today, we \ncan avoid a European-style catastrophe tomorrow. By reforming the \nfunctions of government that no longer make sense in 2013, we can do \nmore than just control spending, we can encourage private sector growth \nand job creation and finally get the economy back on its feet. And by \nridding ourselves of this massive burden of debt, we can remove the \ngreatest obstacle to recovery.\n  As I said yesterday, this is ultimately a conversation about growth \nand opportunity. It is not a conversation about austerity. It is one \nthat Republicans are eager to have. For those who want to pretend our \ncountry does not have a spending problem, this is a pretense which is \nnot borne out by the facts. Now is the time to face reality. We have \nknown this for literally years. When are we going to face it? There is \nno better time than now.\n  We can take on this challenge together if both sides are ready to do \nthe necessary work to reform spending, but we need to get started \ntoday--not next week, not in April--today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/30/senate-section/article/S371-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I actually came to speak on another \nsubject, but I had the opportunity to hear the minority leader's \nremarks as I was waiting to speak. I would point out in response that \nour friends on the other side love to characterize the spending that \nhas taken place in recent years as something that was the will and \nchoice and desire of President Obama. What they fail to recall is that \nduring that period, we actually had an economic meltdown. Most \nAmericans remember that economic meltdown. States such as Rhode Island \nare still in the aftermath of that economic meltdown--an economic \nmeltdown, by the way, that occurred at the end of the last Republican \nadministration and was caused by those policies.\n  The economic meltdown was relatively global. We have very practical \nexamples of countries that went the path of spending cuts that the \nRepublicans recommend--recommended through the whole economic meltdown. \nJust take a tour of Europe and you will see where the austerity plan \nwas followed, the results have been far worse: lower GDP growth, higher \nunemployment. We are actually struggling through better in America by \nunderstanding that when the economy is collapsing, if the Federal \nGovernment withdraws even more money from it, it just collapses faster \nand you postpone the period of growth and recovery.\n\n  This business us only having a spending problem--well, you can look \nat the revenues as adequate, but it depends what you are measuring it \nagainst. If you are measuring revenues against the times when we had a \nbalanced budget, it has always averaged 20 percent. It averaged around \n20 percent of GDP. We are at 16 percent right now. This is a huge gap. \nIf we drop and try to balance the budget, which is what I think we \nwould like to achieve at 16 percent, we are going back to the social \nconditions of the early 1950s, conditions where many seniors still \nlived in poverty. I know the party on the other side likes looking \nback, but I do not think they want to look back to that. I really do \nnot think most Americans want to live in a country in which that is the \ncase.\n  So, do we have a spending problem? Yes, of course, we do. But when \nrevenues are at 16 percent of GDP and we have never balanced the budget \nin recent history at 16 percent of GDP--in recent history, it has \nalways been with revenues around 20 percent of GDP.\n  When you have these unbelievable revenue giveaways to special \ninterests--Big Oil getting these huge subsidies, hedge fund managers \npaying these favored low tax rates, tax rates lower than their \nchauffeurs and their doormen and their maids pay--the Tax Code is \nriddled with those kinds of special interest giveaways, and if we can \nbring some of that back into the equation, not only does that add \nrevenue and move us better toward the goal of a balanced budget and a \nreduced deficit but, frankly, in most of those cases, it is the right \nthing to do all on its own. It is the fair thing to do all on its own.\n  Yes, there are things that are idiotic buried away in the Federal \nbudget. I am not here to defend studies about pig manure or reality TV \nshows. But the\n\n[[Page S372]]\n\nproblem is that once you actually get into discussions on this subject \nwith the other side, it is not long until their guns turn on Medicare, \nit is not long until their guns turn on Social Security. We have seen \nit before. They tried to privatize Social Security. They thought they \nhad the power to do it, and the American people told them: Heck no. But \nthat is where the discussion goes. It may start with reality TV shows \nand pig manure, but before you know it, they have their guns trained on \nMedicare and Social Security. We need to defend programs such as those \non which families depend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/30/senate-section/article/S372-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S372-S373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. So on the subject of what we leave to our children \nand grandchildren, let me turn to the point of my remarks, which is \nthat it is time to wake up in this body to the reality of what we are \ndoing to our climate. It is time to wake up.\n  Madam President, 2012 was the warmest year in the continental United \nStates since records began being kept in 1895. It is not a unique \nsingle anomaly of a year. If you look at the first 12 years of this \ncentury, 2000 to 2012, they are all in the 14 warmest years on record. \nThis is not just about future generations, it is not just about polar \nbears and sea turtles. These trends are being felt right now in real \nplaces by real people.\n  The recent draft of the Federal Government's National Climate \nAssessment shows, at a local level, why every one of us should care \nthat carbon emissions are causing climate change.\n  Let's take a little tour. I will start in the Northeast, which \nincludes my home State of Rhode Island. In this region, which is \ndefined in the assessment as from West Virginia to Maine--that is not \nthe Northeast we usually talk about, but that is the way it is defined \nin this report--annual temperatures have increased by almost 2 degrees \nFahrenheit since records began. The entire range between high and low \nis only about 4.2 degrees, so an increase of 2 full degrees is a big \ndeal in that scale.\n  If greenhouse gas emissions remain at current levels, the projection \nis another 4.5 degrees to 10 degrees Fahrenheit of warming by the end \nof the century. That will change all of our lives in very significant \nways. Even if we do reduce emissions, the Northeast is still projected \nto experience an increase in the frequency, intensity, and duration of \nheat waves.\n  By as soon as 2050, Delaware, Maryland, and West Virginia could \nexperience twice as many days per year--that is 15 more days in some \nplaces--with temperatures over 95 degrees Fahrenheit. In western New \nYork and Massachusetts, where 95-degree days are rare, there may be an \nadditional 5 days per year over that mark. In Rhode Island, a lot of \npeople stay cool in the summer by opening the windows at night, letting \nthe cool night air fill the house, and then closing the drapes or the \nscreens or the shades in the morning. That is not going to work any \nlonger when persistent high nighttime temperatures allow no relief from \nthe heat.\n  Without significant upgrades, our region's electric grid will not be \nable to sustain the power demand as more and more air-conditioning \nbecomes necessary for people to be comfortable in the summertime. As we \nsee more hot days, we also see more bad ozone days, which still keep \npeople indoors in Rhode Island or even send them to the hospital, as \npollution from Midwest coal plants settles in on us.\n  In addition to heat, precipitation in the Northeast increased almost \none-half of an inch per decade over the last century. Extreme \nprecipitation--very heavy rain or snow--has increased 74 percent \nbetween 1958 and 2010. That is the sharpest increase in the Nation.\n  On our shores--we are a very coastal State--due to a combination of \nwarming and expanding oceans and other tectonic conditions, sea level \nhas risen about 1 foot in the Northeast since 1900.\n  That is higher than the 8-inch global average sea-level rise. Sea-\nlevel rise is actually up 10 inches at the Newport tide gauge since our \nterrible hurricane of 1938. Because of extreme precipitation and sea-\nlevel rise, more and more populated areas are at risk of flooding.\n  Let's move to the Southeast where the draft assessment predicts more \nextreme heat with the number of 95-degree or hotter days in the region \nfrom Louisiana through central Florida expected to quadruple by mid-\ncentury. If you like it hot down there, you are a lucky person because \nyou are going to get a lot more of it.\n  Southerners will likely see something much less appealing, which is \nmore ground-level ozone, better known as smog, which poses serious \nhealth risks especially to children and the elderly. But the real story \nof the Southeast is one of disastrous weather. Between 1980 and 2011, \nthe Southeast was struck by more billion-dollar disasters than any \nother part of the country. The region is particularly vulnerable to \nextreme weather, and sea-level rise makes things worse.\n  The RAND Corporation notes that 1,800 square miles of Louisiana have \nbeen lost to the sea since the 1930s. Entergy, a regional utility, \npredicts $23 billion in losses by 2030, factoring just a 6-inch \nincrease in sea level and a 3-percent increase in hurricane wind speed. \nCommunities in the Southeast need to take real steps to become more \nresilient in the changing environment. North Carolina, for instance, is \nraising highway bridges out to the Outer Banks as seas rise and storms \nworsen.\n  In the Midwest, temperatures are increasing rapidly. From 1900 to \n2010, average temperatures increased about 1 degree Fahrenheit, and the \nrate of warming tripled between 1980 and 2010. Under the assessment's \nworst-case scenarios, temperatures across the Midwest are projected to \nrise 8.5 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100. If you are a farmer, that \nmeans everything will have changed.\n  Hotter temperatures are having a far-reaching impact on the Great \nLakes. According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, scientists at NOAA's \nGreat Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory have found that the Great \nLakes are taking in more heat from the air during the summer and \nstoring it longer. The result: On average, ice on the Great Lakes is \nforming later in the winter and disappearing earlier. In fact, total \nice cover has fallen 71 percent on the Great Lakes from 1973 to 2010.\n  That is not good for the lakes, the people, and species of this \nregion. Ice cover protects the lakes from evaporation, and it protects \nthe eggs of fall-spawning fish from winter weather. Coastal areas \nunprotected by shore ice are more susceptible to erosion. Less ice \nmeans less snowmobiling or ice fishing. As anyone in Cleveland or \nBuffalo can tell you, open water fuels the dread lake-effect snows that \nwallop leeward shores. All of this can be traced, in part, to climate \nchange driven by greenhouse gases.\n  In the Great Plains, the most significant consequence of a changing \nclimate will be changes in rainfall. This is already beginning to \nhappen. Total rain is expected to increase in Wyoming, Montana, North \nDakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska, while Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas \nare projected to get less. Farming and the energy sector, including oil \nand gas exploration, will feel increased pressure and competition for \nwater supplies. Eighty percent of the population of the Great Plains \ndepends on the High Plains aquifer for drinking water. Projected \ntemperature increases, more frequent droughts, and higher rates of \nevaporation spell serious trouble for the region's water supply if \nwater isn't managed better.\n  The availability of water, and even snow, will also affect the \nSouthwest. People of the Southwest are acutely aware of how their \nhistory and their fate is tied to the availability of water. According \nto the draft assessment:\n\n       Over the past 50 years across most of the Southwest, there \n     has been less late-winter precipitation falling as snow, \n     earlier snow melt, and earlier arrival of most of the year's \n     streamflow.\n\n  These changes can ripple through the economy and the health of the \nregion.\n  In the western mountains, massive forests stand dead on the \nmountainsides, as warmer winters allow the killer bark beetle to swarm \nnorthward into higher latitudes and uphill into higher altitudes. \nOminously, the draft assessment says that the combined impact of \nincreasing wildfire, insect outbreaks, and diseases will cause:\n\n       Almost complete loss of subalpine forests . . . by the \n     2080s.\n\n\n[[Page S373]]\n\n\n  Separate studies by scientists at NASA and at the University of \nWashington predict increasing frequency of severe wildfires.\n  The Park City Foundation in Utah predicted an annual local \ntemperature increase of 6.8 degrees Fahrenheit by 2075, which would \ncause a total loss of snowpack in the Park City resort area. This would \nresult, obviously, in thousands of lost jobs, tens of millions in lost \nearnings, and hundreds of millions in lost economic output.\n  In the coastal zone of the Pacific Northwest, erosion inundation and \nocean acidity are all major threats. More than 140,000 acres of coastal \nWashington and Oregon lie within 3.3 feet of high tide. Sea-level rise \nof 4 feet or more is entirely plausible by the end of the century.\n  Ocean acidification caused a 70- to 80-percent loss of oyster larvae \nat an oyster hatchery in Oregon from 2006 to 2008. Wild oyster stocks \nin Washington State have also failed as weather patterns caused more \nacidic water to rise to the surface at the shore. This is an industry \nworth about $73 million annually.\n  For Hawaii, the rapidly changing climate presents a unique threat. \nTourism and agriculture, among Hawaii's top economic sectors, are each \ndistinctly vulnerable. Changes in precipitation, erosion, ocean \nwarming, and acidification will irreversibly alter Hawaiian ecosystems, \nhome to about one-quarter of all threatened and endangered species in \nthe United States.\n  For example, we know that warm enough water causes corals to bleach. \nBleaching is a technical term that I won't go into right now. Bleaching \ncan help coral survive short-term stresses, but in response to \npersistent ocean warming, bleaching signals the start of a long-term \ndownward spiral toward the death of the coral and the reefs, the \nincubators of the oceans.\n  Perhaps no other region of the United States is experiencing the \neffects of climate change more dramatically than Alaska. Alaska is, of \ncourse, supposed to be cold. The animals and plants have adapted to \nthat, and so have the people.\n\n  Since the 1960s, however, Alaska has been warming twice as fast as \nthe rest of the United States. Annual air temperature has already \nincreased by 3 degrees Fahrenheit. Winter temperatures are up 6 \ndegrees.\n  According to the draft assessment highlights, Alaska is seeing--and \nthis is a graph of the sea ice:\n\n       Earlier spring snow melt, reduced sea ice, widespread \n     glacier retreat, warmer permafrost, and dryer landscapes.\n\n  By mid-century, summer sea ice could disappear altogether. As in the \nGreat Lakes, less ice along the Alaska coast means more severe coastal \nerosion without the ice to buffer the shores from storms. Most of the \npermafrost in Alaska is tens of thousands of years old, but it too is \ndisappearing as the Alaska climate warms. Permafrost is a natural \nwonder whose loss threatens structures such as buildings, roads, as \nwell as plants and wildlife that have adapted to the frozen tundra. \nThawing permafrost buckles roads and air strips, causing costly \ndisruptions in transportation.\n  It appears, as we take this tour of the country, that there is only \none region that isn't yet awakening to the effects of climate change, \nand that is here, Capitol Hill. History is calling out to us to meet \nour duty, and the call is loud and clear, but we are sleepwalking. It \nis time to wake up. The public has every reason to want to grab us and \ngive us a good shake. An AP poll out in December found that 83 percent \nof Democrats, 77 percent of Independents, and 70 percent of Republicans \naccept the reality of climate change and understand that it will be a \nserious problem for our United States.\n  A recent poll conducted by Yale University and George Mason \nUniversity found that a large majority of Americans, 77 percent, say \nclimate change should be a priority for President Obama and for all of \nus in Congress. But we snooze on, listening to the lullabies of the \npolluters.\n  Carbon pollution from fossil fuels is threatening our future, and \nunless we take serious action to scale back the pollution, the \nconsequences are looking increasingly dire all across our country. It \nis time to hear the alarms, to roll up our sleeves, to get to work, and \nto do what needs to be done. It is time, indeed, to wake up.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/30/senate-section/article/S373-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S373-S377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I come to the Senate floor to join my \ncolleagues on the women's side of the Senate who will be coming to the \nfloor this morning, along with Senator Mikulski--and I thank her for \nher leadership--to talk about pay equity and the issue of equal pay for \nequal work.\n  I am proud to stand here on what is the 4-year anniversary of the \nhistoric Lilly Ledbetter legislation that we were able to pass. What an \nunbelievable moment that was, to work for what is equal treatment for \nwomen in our court system. Lilly Ledbetter went across the Nation and \ncame to Congress and communicated very well to many Americans on this \nissue that sometimes you could be discriminated against and not even \nknow it until your retirement, which was the case with her. Yet the \nlegal system failed to take any action at that point. So we passed the \nLilly Ledbetter legislation to make sure that in our court system women \ncould find out and have those remedies brought before our system and \nfight for equal pay.\n  My State of Washington has been a leader in increasing the minimum \nwage. We have a minimum wage that is indexed to inflation, and I am \nproud of that. But pay disparity continues to persist between men and \nwomen, and that is why I am here, to urge my colleagues to help close \nthis gap. We are here to advocate for the Paycheck Fairness Act because \nfull-time working women still earn 75 percent of what their male \ncounterparts earn for the same job, according to a report by the \nEconomic Opportunity Institute.\n  While the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was a step forward, we need to \npass this additional legislation to help end pay inequity and take the \nnext steps toward helping women. The Paycheck Fairness Act will help us \nmove toward closing the gap between men and women, and it does the \nfollowing things: It requires employers to provide justification other \nthan gender for paying men higher wages than for women; it protects \nemployees who share the same salary information from potential \nretaliation from their employers; and it provides victims of pay \ndiscrimination the same remedies available to victims of other kinds of \ndiscrimination, including punitive and compensatory damages.\n  This bill also helps create outreach programs for employers to help \nthem understand this issue and to help end pay disparity. I certainly \nlook forward to the passing of this legislation because closing this \ngap means women in my State will be able to afford 13 more months of \nrent or 39 more months of family health insurance premiums, according \nto an estimate by the National Partnership for Women and Families.\n  We have to level the playing field so these kinds of estimates are \nnot just projections but they are realities. We can't support the \nstatus quo while the economic security of women and families is \nundermined. One-third of families headed by women in my State are in \npoverty. This can be attributed, in part, to policies that perpetuate \nlower pay for women. So we must end unequal pay practices and level the \nplaying field.\n  It is in this spirit of fair play that we ask for the passage of the \nPaycheck Fairness Act. I know Senator Mikulski and others who have \nfought hard on this legislation will be here to speak this morning, and \nI am proud we are sponsors of the Paycheck Fairness Act that was \nintroduced just last week. Today, almost 50 years after passage of the \nEqual Pay Act and 4 years after the passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair \nPay Act, we still need to hit another giant milestone in helping women \nget fair pay in America.\n  We made a big step toward all this with Lilly Ledbetter's leadership, \nbut now we need to pass this new legislation. It was an important \nmilestone\n\n[[Page S374]]\n\nthat will help women be confident they will be treated fairly in the \nworkplace and to make sure they continue to have access to the courts. \nWhether they are an engineer or a lawyer or a police officer, women \nshould not have to earn less doing the same job as a coworker. That is \nwhy we need to pass this Paycheck Fairness Act today.\n  I want women who grow up in the United States of America to know \nthere is no doubt they will earn the same pay they deserve for their \nwork. That is what our country is all about, and that is why we are \ngoing to work hard this session to pass this legislation.\n  I thank the President pro tempore, I yield the floor, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I am so pleased to be joining \ncolleagues in celebrating the anniversary of the passage of the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act and to move on to what we need to do on full \npaycheck fairness with the passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  I wish to start by thanking our leader, the dean of the women in the \nSenate and the House, the longest serving woman, who is Senator Barbara \nMikulski. She has led us through the Lilly Ledbetter legislation and is \nnow leading us as we move forward to the next step in making sure women \nreceive equal pay for equal work. Her extraordinary leadership is \nsomething that has touched every woman, every man, and every family in \nAmerica. I wish to thank her for her leadership, as well as the efforts \nof all my colleagues.\n  It has been nearly 50 years since President Kennedy signed the Equal \nPay Act into law--a law that made it illegal for an employer to pay \nwomen less than men for the same work. With the stroke of a pen, he \nushered in a new era of opportunities for women and the American \neconomy as a whole. In those 50 years, many millions of American women \nentered the workforce and we have truly changed the nature of \nemployment in our country, including in the Senate, where we now have a \nwoman sitting as the distinguished Acting President pro tempore, and we \nhave 20 women who are a part of leading the country through the Senate, \nwith 7 of us now chairing committees.\n\n  I remember coming to the Senate in 2000, when it was the first time \nwe had enough women to even sit on every committee in the Senate. \nImagine that. It was the first time our experiences, our voices, our \nbackgrounds, our values, and our priorities were represented on every \ncommittee. So we have come a long way since that time 50 years ago, but \nthere is more to do.\n  In 1963, women were often very limited in the jobs we could \nparticipate in. There were outrageous working conditions and \nlimitations that made absolutely no sense. Today, nearly 40 percent of \nfull-time managers in our country are women. I am proud to look around \nmy great State and see two of the great universities in our country--\nthe University of Michigan and Michigan State University--both led by \nwomen presidents. We are seeing women moving up in every area. We have \nmade great strides, but we also know pay for women continues to be \nunequal, even though we have seen strides being made. That is why the \nPaycheck Fairness Act is absolutely critical.\n  This bill gives women tools to negotiate better pay and it stops \nemployers from using workplace gag rules to prevent women from \ndiscovering their pay is actually less than the pay of the men working \nbeside them. It strengthens the remedies women can use when they are \ndiscriminated against and ensures that discrimination based on sex is \ntreated the same as any other kind of discrimination in the workplace.\n  Four years ago this week, we passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act \nthat overturned the Supreme Court's decision limiting the ability of \nwomen to get justice when they were discriminated against. At that \ntime, Lilly Ledbetter did not know for a couple decades that she, in \nfact, was being paid less than the men she not only worked with but \nsupervised. When she went to the Supreme Court, they said: You can't \ncome before the Court. You have no standing because you should have \ndone that 20 years ago. But 20 years earlier, she didn't know.\n  We have fixed that loophole in the law, but now we need to go on and \ncompletely revamp and be focused on putting in place all the tools \navailable to women to keep the promise of the law that was passed 50 \nyears ago, which is equal pay for equal work.\n  In my State of Michigan, women are paid only 74 cents on every dollar \nthat a man makes. Even though we have made strides, we are still at 74 \ncents of what a man makes. And women are either participating as the \nsole breadwinner in their families now or part of a two-parent family \ntrying to hold things together and make ends meet.\n  It is not fair to the family that one of those who are working is \nonly getting 74 cents on a dollar of what males in the workplace are \ngetting. Over a lifetime, in Michigan that 26-cent difference equals \nover $\\1/2\\ million that women are losing because we don't really yet \nhave equal pay for equal work in every part of our economy.\n  When we look at this, it becomes very much about whether women are \ngoing to be able to pay their mortgage, their rent. When you walk into \nthe store, the grocer doesn't say: You only have to pay 74 percent of \nthe cost of this because you get paid less. The last time I looked, we \npay the same for gas, food, rent, or the mortgage, and yet too many \nwomen find themselves disadvantaged because they are not being paid \nequally for their work. That is just not right. Everybody knows it is \nnot right.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter Act took an important step 4 years ago in \noverturning a situation that the courts I believe inaccurately, \nunfairly decided as relates to women. But the Paycheck Fairness Act \ngives women the tools they need legally to be able to remedy unequal \npay situations and have the confidence that we are going to truly \nenforce equal pay for equal work in this country.\n  Fifty years ago, Congress and the President came together and agreed \nthat women should get equal pay for equal work. Right now, we need to \nreaffirm that. We need to make it real for all women in every part of \nour country who are working hard to make ends meet, to take care of \ntheir families, and to be able to move forward and realize their \ndreams. Passing the Paycheck Fairness Act is going to bring us closer \nto that reality.\n  I again thank the senior Senator from Maryland for her incredible \nleadership in bringing us to this point with the Lilly Ledbetter Act \nand now taking the next step, which is to realize the dream of 50 years \nand longer in America, which is to fully benefit from the ideas, the \nstrengths, and the talents of every individual and to make sure they \nare equally paid for what they are worth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to speak on the Paycheck \nFairness Act. I would ask how much time is remaining.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 17 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that we extend for another 15 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I join with my colleagues you have \nalready heard from--Senator Cantwell of Washington State, Senator \nStabenow of Michigan--and today I know other Senators will be coming to \nthe floor to say: We want to finish the job. We want to finish the job \nthat started 50 years ago when Lyndon Johnson introduced the first of \nthree civil rights bills that were designed to change America.\n  In the mid-1960s, there was turmoil. Change was in the air. People \nwanted equality. They were marching on the streets, they were pounding \non the tables, and they were organizing in civil disobedience. Dr. King \nmarched on Washington and Lyndon Johnson was laying the groundwork for \nthe famous Civil Rights Act that would open the doors for minorities. \nBut the very first bill he introduced was to guarantee\n\n[[Page S375]]\n\nequal pay for equal work for women. He did that as the first bill \nbecause he thought that would be one of the easiest to pass.\n  Well, 50 years later we are still being redlined, sidelined, pink-\nslipped because we fight for equal pay for equal work. Every time we \nmake an advance, they bring in the lawyers--the corporate lawyers--who \nthen hide behind small business exemptions, and they fret on how it \nwill wreck the economy of the United States.\n  Well, I know what wrecked the economy of the United States, and it \nwasn't women wanting equal pay for equal work. That is not what brought \nus fraud, scams, and greed in the mortgage market. That did not cause \nthe great collapse of the banks. We didn't cause that. Their hubris and \ngreed did. But when they bring in the lawyers, we have to pass \nlegislation.\n  Four years ago, the first bill that we passed during the Obama \nadministration was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. It repaired the \nright of women to address pay inequality in the courts. What it did was \ncorrect a misinterpretation by the court on what is the statute of \nlimitations when women seek redress.\n  But let me tell you that the fight continues. The fight continues \nnow. The reason we need the Paycheck Fairness Act is the fact that \nwomen continue to be discriminated against and economically harassed \nand punished if they even ask: How much do the guys get paid?\n  So if you are standing at the water cooler or if you go to your human \nresources and say: What do I get--if Georgette asks: What do I get, and \nshe wants to know what George gets, she could be punished. She could be \nfired. She could be penalized. She could be isolated for being too \naggressive. Haven't we heard that? Too uppity--my God, daring to ask \nwhat George gets paid. Well, the Lillies, the Georgettes, and everybody \nwho gets up every day and takes pride in their work, does the job they \nwere hired to do, they want to get the pay they have every right to. So \nour legislation will keep employers from retaliating against employees \nwho share information about pay.\n  Remember how Lilly Ledbetter's bill got triggered? Lilly was working \nat Goodyear, doing a good job, even promoted. But guess what, finally \nsome men, some great guys--and there are great guys--came and said: \nGuess what, Lilly. We get a better deal than you do. That is how Lilly \nLedbetter found out, and when she went to ask, she was punished. So our \nPaycheck Fairness Act would keep employers from retaliating against \nemployees who share information.\n  It will also close a loophole in the current law that allows \nemployers to use just about any reason for paying a woman less than a \nman by requiring that the reason be unrelated to sex and it has to be \njob related. The fact is that they will say: Well, we pay George more \nbecause you really should be 5-foot-8 to do the job, and most women \nmight only be 5-foot-6. Well, have you seen those title IX gals lately? \nAnyway, they always invent the reasons. That is where, instead of \nsolving the problem, they bring in the lawyers. They always bring in \nthe lawyers. Now we are bringing in the votes, and what we want to say \nis that we want to close that loophole.\n\n  We also want to improve the remedies available for victims of \ndiscrimination by simply putting the Equal Pay Act on par with other \nlaws to combat equal treatment.\n  Everyone wants to say what this bill is about. They all have \nopinions. It is not about politics; it is about a pay gap. It is not \nabout only gender; it is about an agenda. What is our country? Are we \ngoing to be fair with each other in the marketplace? This bill is about \nour families, it is about our economy, it is about bread-and-butter \ndecisions.\n  So what are the consequences of paying equal pay for equal work? No. \n1, it will put more money in the family checkbook. More money in the \nfamily checkbook means more spending in the economy. It is actually \ngood economic policy in the real economy. Now, it might result in lower \nexecutive compensation, but it will result in fair compensation to the \nwomen who work. As we know, women now are really a significant part of \nthe workforce, and we should be paid equal pay for equal work and not \nharassed when we want to ask questions, and close the loopholes to make \nsure they don't make up phony excuses.\n  This is very, very important. When we look at it, 50 years--50 \nyears--after Lyndon Johnson introduced his legislation, we are still at \n77 cents for every dollar a man makes. For women of color, it is even \nless, and for Hispanic women, it is only 60 percent. That is not \nenough.\n  So we want to change the lawbooks so we can put more money in the \nfamily checkbook and more money in our economy and make sure that the \ndream of 50 years ago that was started by Lyndon Johnson we rectify in \nthe passage of this legislation, which I hope we do expeditiously \nbetween now and Mother's Day.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nMaryland, who has been such a remarkable leader on all of these issues. \nWe have so much work to do, as she has outlined, and I will add a few \nspecific cases to what she said.\n  This is the 4-year anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter law, and we \nwere able to push it forward, and it was the first bill President Obama \nsigned in his first term. I think that said a lot about its importance.\n  Because Lilly Ledbetter is pretty well known in the country, we know \nher story. You can imagine the feelings she had when she found out that \nafter all the work she was putting in, simply because she was a woman \nshe was getting paid less than the men doing the exact same thing. And, \nyes, thank you to the men who respected Lilly Ledbetter enough to let \nher know. There was a notice in her locker that essentially informed \nher that she was working for way less than they were. Over the course \nof her lifetime, it was a huge amount of money that made a huge \ndifference.\n  When Lilly tells the story, you can just see the anguish in her face. \nAnd she, of course, went all the way to the Supreme Court trying to get \nredress. Finally, the Court decided, and they said: You know what. You \nhave a really good case, but you didn't move forward fast enough. You \nwere supposed to come and file this lawsuit much sooner.\n  Well, she didn't know much sooner. She couldn't have filed the \nlawsuit. And that is what led to our corrective legislation, so that in \nthe future a woman who has faced pay discrimination will have her day \nin court and will have the time necessary to proceed with the court \ncase and get justice. The court had said she had to file from the \nminute the discrimination started, but Lilly didn't know she was being \ndiscriminated against until years later. So thank goodness this \nCongress and the President remedied that.\n  But we have unfinished business. We have a bill called the Paycheck \nFairness Act, and I hope that all will get involved as well because the \nfact is that women, after all the progress we have made, earn 77 cents \nfor every dollar earned by a man. We women in the Senate are fortunate \nin the sense that is one battle we don't have to wage because a Senator \nis a Senator is a Senator. Imagine if they had a rule saying men \nSenators get this and women Senators get that. People would say \nsomething is very wrong with this picture. But that is the way it is on \nthe outside. It is undercover. People do not know about it, but women \nwho do the same job as a man on average will make 23 cents less.\n\n  You could say: Seventy-seven cents for every dollar--is that really a \nlot? Let me tell you, it is a lot. Over a lifetime it is about $434,000 \nless that she will have at the end of her career.\n  This pay gap persists across all occupation and income levels. A \nBloomberg analysis found that women earned less than their male \ncounterparts in 264 out of 265 major occupation categories. Women \nearned less than their male counterparts in virtually all of the \noccupation categories. So the wage gap clearly hurts women, but it also \nhurts their families. Think about families\n\n[[Page S376]]\n\nwhere the major wage earner is a woman. Those children and \ngrandchildren will feel the pain.\n  Of course the economy is hurt because there are fewer dollars \ncirculating in the economy. A woman is going to spend a lot of the \nmoney she earns right out there, supporting her family, going to the \nstore, organizing visits to camps and vacations, and all that money \nhelps the economy.\n  I am going to close this by reading a couple of stories, real-life \nstories. A woman from California had an identical advanced degree as \nher husband. She landed the exact same job as her husband but at a \ndifferent worksite. The woman's husband was offered $5,000 more in \nstarting salary for the same job with the exact same resume.\n  A health care worker in Long Island discovered she had been earning \n$10 an hour less than her male colleagues with the same experience. \nWhen she brought this up to her superiors, she was reprimanded for \nasking about the wage gap.\n  That goes to what Senator Mikulski said. Imagine the nerve of someone \nfinding out they were paid $10 an hour less and trying to find out why, \nand for that she is reprimanded, put in her place.\n  Then a female employee for a major corporation in Florida was told \nwhen she was hired that if she disclosed her salary to other workers, \nthat would be grounds for dismissal. She soon realized that her male \ncounterparts made more than she did but she did not have any written \nproof. A fellow female employee at the company was told that because \nher husband picked her up from work in a nice car, she did not need to \nget a salary increase.\n  We need to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. It closes loopholes that \nhave allowed employers to avoid responsibility for discriminatory pay. \nIt prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who share \nsalary information with their coworkers, and it puts gender-based \ndiscrimination sanctions on equal footing with other forms of wage \ndiscrimination such as race, disability, or age, so women would be \neligible for the same remedies available to other victims of \ndiscrimination, such as punitive damages.\n  It is simply a matter of fairness. Every American deserves equal pay \nfor equal work. We have to end this practice of shortchanging half of \nour country--more than half of the people are female. This means we are \nhurting our country, we are hurting their families.\n  In 2010, Senate Republicans filibustered our efforts to proceed to \nthis bill. All we wanted to do was proceed to it and get an up-or-down \nvote. We faced a filibuster. In June 2012, Senate Republicans blocked \nus again. We are calling on them in a spirit of fairness and justice to \nwork with us in this Congress and give all the women of America the \nsame chance for success as their male counterparts. Remember, $400,000-\nplus over a career is a tremendous amount of money for people. That can \nmake the difference in having a decent retirement. We heard today that \nthe vast majority of Americans, if they lost their job, have no savings \nat all. It is not as if we are paying people lavish salaries. Let's \nmake sure, whatever the salaries are, that they are fair, that they are \nequal to each other. If a woman is doing the same job, much as a \nSenator, as a male, they get the same pay. It is simple. It should not \nbe a problem.\n  If there is a filibuster, I will never understand it. I will say \nthis. No woman in America today will understand why anyone would \nfilibuster such a bill--equal pay for equal work. And no man in America \nwho loves a woman, be it their mom or their aunt or their wife or their \ndaughter, would understand it either. Let's hope we get to a vote on \nthis measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I thank my colleague from California for \nmaking those important remarks. I am also here to talk about the \nPaycheck Fairness Act for a few minutes, if I could. As she said in her \nlast remarks, it is very important to note the last few times this \nissue has come up it was filibustered. We did not even get to the bill. \nSo hopefully, according to the new rules we agreed on here and \ncoordinated in a bipartisan way, we will get to the bill and we will \ndebate it on its merits, not on whether it should proceed. Let's see \nhow that works. Again, I thank her for coming down here today.\n  I rise here on the anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of \n2009 to lend my support to the next bill we need to pass, the Paycheck \nFairness Act. I thank Senator Mikulski for organizing this important \ndiscussion.\n  Four years ago I entered this Chamber fresh from Alaska. Madam \nPresident, you are fresh from North Dakota. I probably sat right there \nduring that debate in 2009. I was finishing my second term as mayor of \nAnchorage and was excited to take on the new challenges in the Senate \non behalf of all Alaskans. I am honored to say one of my first votes in \nthe Senate as a new Senator was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. I was \nproud to add my support to the cause.\n  At the same time it was--and is--disheartening to continue hearing \nabout pay inequity as a major economic problem, that there are still \ndrastic wage gaps for women, that women on average still earn about \none-fifth less than their male counterparts.\n  We all know the numbers. That is why I have cosponsored Senator \nMikulski's Paycheck Fairness Act each time it was introduced. It \nprovides women with the tools to close this long-standing gap. Her bill \nis an important companion to the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which kept the \ncourthouse door open to demand justice over pay discrimination.\n  This was a crucial victory, but we must continue the fight and finish \nthe job by passing paycheck fairness. At its core, the bill is really \nvery simple: It says employees and employers can share wage information \nand that discrepancies in pay must be based on experience and \nqualifications--not on gender.\n  What is more fair than that?\n  Unfortunately, my State is not a leader on pay equity. In Alaska, \nwomen earn 78 cents for every dollar paid to men. Unless that changes, \nAlaska women will earn $623,000 less than men during their working \ncareers. This pay gap has harmed the families of roughly 155,000 women \nin the Alaska workforce. Women in Alaska have higher rates of economic \ninsecurity than men: In 2010, women working full time not only earned \nlower average wages but also were more likely to live in poverty--more \nthan 10 percent of Alaska women compared to about 7 percent of men.\n  Women in Alaska make up 47 percent of the state workforce and nearly \nhalf of them are married mothers who are the primary wage earners in \ntheir families. When they earn less than men, that burden falls on the \nentire family--including about 112,000 Alaska children who are \ndependent on their mother's earnings.\n  The State's highest-paying industries--including manufacturing, \nnatural resources and mining--are mostly dominated by men. Jobs such as \nminers, mobile heavy equipment mechanics and electrical power line \ninstallers pay much better than State average wages, but few women are \ngetting those jobs.\n  Our Alaska Department of Labor puts it bluntly: ``Women seem to be \nfunneled into lower-pay occupations.''\n  Listen to these numbers. If the gap between men's and women's wages \nin Alaska were eliminated, each full-time working woman could suddenly \nafford to pay for 2 more years of groceries, buy 3,700 more gallons of \ngas or pay the mortgage and utility bills for 8 more months.\n  So on this 4th anniversary of the signing of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair \nPay Act, I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: Let's \nfinish the job and pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. As I said, it's so \nsimple. The bill will close loopholes in the Equal Pay Act and \nestablish stronger workplace protections for women.\n  In the real world there should be nothing complicated or \ncontroversial about this, but sometimes we wonder where we are; it is \nnot always the real world. As I said at the beginning of my comments, \nhopefully the issue of filibuster will not be part of this equation, \nthat we actually get on the bill, have the debate, and people can vote \nup or vote down, amend it or not, and determine where we stand on this \nissue.\n  I am from a household where we were raised by a mother, the six of \nus. My father died when I was 10. She survived raising four boys, which \nis a miracle in\n\n[[Page S377]]\n\nitself, and two girls. The problem was not the girls, it was the boys. \nBut she raised six of us at a very young age. Hopefully some would \nconsider us productive parts of society. But when I saw what my mom had \nto struggle through, what she had to earn to make sure we had food on \nthe table, make sure we had opportunities in our lives, it is clear to \nme that this is not a complicated issue. This is a simple fairness \nissue.\n  I hope my colleague on the other side, again, would allow it to come \nforward. We will debate it and then we will vote on it, and the \nAmerican people, Alaskans, will see what we think of fairness in the \nsense of a paycheck for a woman working the same job--equal job as a \nman does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/30/senate-section/article/S377-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S377-S378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, breaking news. Just a short time ago the \nBureau of Economic Analysis issued its report for the fourth quarter of \n2012 in terms of our economy. I am sorry to say that the report said we \nhave contracted--not gained, but our economy contracted--during this \nfourth quarter, 0.1 percent at an annual rate last fall.\n  Here we are, about 3\\1/2\\ years from a deep recession, and in normal \nrecessions recovery occurs at a significant rate. That is what gets \npeople back to work. That is what gets our economy moving again. This \nis the growth we need to address our fiscal situation. Yet after nearly \n3\\1/2\\ years of stumbling along and bumping along in the most tepid \nrecovery since before World War II, we now learn that despite some of \nthe optimism that has been projected lately that things are getting \nbetter, things are growing, and unemployment is going to start coming \ndown, we get this distressing report that in the fourth quarter, the \nquarter where we all go out and buy Christmas presents and spend money \nat the end of the year, that fourth quarter contracted; it did not \ngrow.\n  The average rate of growth following recessions is about 4 percent \ngrowth per year. Sometimes it has been 6, 7, and even 8 percent. The \naverage rate we have had as a Nation following the previous recession \nhas been around a 2-percent level or even a little less. So, this is \nnot good news for the American people. This is not good news for all \nthose hoping to get back to work. This is not good news for those \nhoping to raise money to pay for their mortgage or try to keep their \nhouse or provide for their children's education going forward. This is \nnot good news for the American people. I think it says a lot about our \nfailure here in Congress to do what most people understand we need to \ndo and that is to get our fiscal house in order.\n  There is a cloud of uncertainty settled over the American economy \nover the last 3\\1/2\\ years that is destroying the hopes and dreams of \nyoung people and middle-aged people and those nearing retirement. They \nare worried about their savings, their ability to pay their bills, and \ntheir ability to maintain meaningful employment.\n  If we are going to get our fiscal house in order, we need to do some \nfundamental things. One, we need to summon the will to address this \nproblem--this challenge--and define it as the No. 1 challenge facing \nthe Congress and have the political will to do something about it. \nDoing something about it means we start with having a budget. It has \nbeen 1,372 days since the Senate passed a budget. That is nearly 4 \nyears. This is completely irresponsible. To deny the American people \nthe transparency of how we are spending taxpayers' dollars and how we \nare addressing this fiscal situation we are in which drives us into \nmore debt and more deficit is totally irresponsible. As I said, it \nstarts with passing a budget.\n  Every Hoosier family and every business in Indiana knows they cannot \nbe successful and financially sound without creating a budget on which \nto operate. Restaurants and coffee shops have budgets, Little League \nBaseball organizations have budgets, and our communities, States must \nhave a budget in terms of how much we are able to spend.\n  The reason a budget is so important is it forces us to determine how \nwe spend the revenue we have in a sensible way without having to go and \ncontinue to borrow and drive ourselves more deeply into debt. There are \na lot of things we would like to do. Everyone has their priorities, \ntheir interests, such as, education, medical research, more funding for \nsocial programs, more defense funding, funding for transportation \nneeds, paving roads, and repairing bridges. It goes on and on. We all \nhave those priorities. These are things we would like to do, but we \nhave not faced the fact that we cannot do everything we would like to \ndo. We have to do the essential things and prioritize our spending at a \ntime when we don't have the revenue to do everything we would like.\n  It is no different than a family with financial difficulties sitting \ndown and saying: Our annual trip to Disney World cannot happen this \nyear. Dad's paycheck is not bringing in the kind of money it used to. \nMaybe they are not in the financial position to be able to do what they \nwould like to do, therefore, they have to make some changes and \nadjustments. Maybe instead of Disney World, they decide to go to Brown \nCounty State Park, which, by the way, is a great place for family \nvacations. Priority decisions are the kind of decisions families have \nto make when they don't have the revenue to do everything they would \nlike to do.\n  We also have a legal duty--and personally I think a moral duty--to \npresent to the American people a budget plan indicating how we are \ngoing to spend their taxpayer dollars. Section 301(a) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 states--and this is the law of the \nland--``On or before April 15 of each year, the Congress shall complete \naction on a concurrent resolution on the budget for the fiscal year \nbeginning on October 1 of such year.''\n  When we passed that law, we didn't say Congress may pass a budget or \nthat Congress has the ability to avoid having a budget. The word \n``shall'' means we shall have a budget. Yet the failure to bring forth \na budget under the leadership of this Senate for 1,372 days--nearly 4 \nyears--has created even more dysfunction in an already dysfunctional \nSenate. It has helped lead to a broken appropriations process.\n  Last year, we did not pass a single appropriations bill through the \nSenate, which left us with what we call continuing resolutions. \nContinuing resolutions essentially fund the Federal Government on \nautopilot at previous levels without the type of scrutiny and oversight \nthat would be administered through the regular appropriations process. \nThis is no way to govern a country. We are not fulfilling our duty to \nthe people we represent and, most important, it hinders any attempt at \nreal spending reform.\n  The Republican-led House has passed a budget annually and fulfilled \ntheir duty. We have failed in fulfilling our duty. They have presented \ntheir priorities to the public. They have described how they will rein \nin spending, save programs from collapse, and reform the tax system. \nThey are being heavily criticized because they have a budget out there \nwhich tells the American people what they are going to do, and some of \nit is painful because we don't have the money to do everything we would \nlike to do.\n  People like to be able to come home and promise them everything they \nask for. We don't have that luxury. Perhaps we never did, but we did it \nanyway. No longer do we have the luxury of being able to even think \nthat. So all the criticism goes to the House because they want to cut \nthis or they want to modify that or the priority decision is for one \nthing over another thing. In the mean time, the majority and the \nadministration just sit back and say: We are not going to put out any \nnumbers; therefore, you cannot criticize us. We will just go along \ncriticizing the other team.\n  I know Paul Ryan is again working with Speaker Boehner on a 10-year \nbudget plan to put our country on a path to a balanced budget. They \nwill be heavily criticized for that, but they are stepping up to their \nlegal responsibilities and stepping up to the moral responsibilities we \nhave to do the job we were elected to do. I mean, that is why we were \nsent here. The Senate is going to have to get the will to make these \ntough choices, which we have been avoiding for years, or the market is \ngoing to force us to act. The more we prolong the challenges we face \nand the\n\n[[Page S378]]\n\nlonger we wait to act, the harder it is going to be.\n  If we don't put a Senate budget plan together, if we don't lay out \nour priorities and create a long-term economic plan to reform our \nspending habits, we are going to face a debt-induced catastrophe that \nwill make the economic downturn we experienced a few years ago look \nlike child's play. The fact is our failure to seriously grapple with \nour runaway deficit spending is already having huge detrimental effects \non our economy, and I just mentioned one of those. Sooner or later this \nbody needs to stand and get this done and it starts with a budget.\n  The President has made it clear over the past few years that when he \nproposed his budgets, he is not serious about leading the discussions \non the fiscal challenges facing us. He didn't mention it in his \ninauguration address, and he has publicly stated we don't have a \nspending problem. How he comes to that conclusion defies credulity.\n  Interestingly enough, by law, the administration is forced to produce \na budget which has been brought before this body. It is interesting \nthat the lack of seriousness of this is indicated by the fact that not \neven one Member of his own party voted for the President's budget.\n  I am just about ready to finish. I ask unanimous consent for 3 more \nminutes to finish.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, thank you. Not one Democratic Senator \nvoted for the President's budget in the last few years. His own party \ndidn't support his budget. It is hard for us to take the President's \nbudget seriously, and that is why the Senate--under the leadership of \nDemocrats--needs to put forward a serious budget, one we can debate, \namend, talk about, share with the American people, get their opinion as \nto whether this is an important priority program or one we can use as \nthe basis to make tough choices and explain why we made those choices. \nAfter all, that is why we are here.\n  So why am I here? I am urging my colleagues in the majority to act. \nLet's do our jobs. Let's perform our legal responsibility and duty. One \nof the most basic duties in Congress is to create a budget so we can \nbegin to get our fiscal books in order. It is our generation's duty \nalso to repair our Nation's financing and ensure we are not leaving \nbehind this dangerous debt burden on future generations. This is the \ntime to act. This serious debt threatens our national security and the \nfuture of our country, and this is the challenge both sides of the \naisle need to face.\n  Strengthening our country and putting us back on a sustainable path \nwill not be easy. It will require some sacrifices, but these are the \nresponsibilities we have to address. We need to be honest with the \nAmerican people. We must take the first step and it starts with a \nbudget.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/30/senate-section/article/S378-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S378-S381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EVENHANDED LAW ENFORCEMENT\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I am expecting the Senator from \nLouisiana, whom I had planned to follow, but since he is not here yet I \nwill go ahead with my remarks unless he walks in the door just now, and \nthen he can follow me.\n  We are both speaking today about selective enforcement of the law as \nit relates to the Department of Justice enforcing the law against \ncertain types of energy producers but not other types of energy \nproducers. Senator Vitter from Louisiana will talk about a letter he \nand I will be sending to the Attorney General of the United States \nasking why he does it.\n  I see Senator Vitter coming in just now, so now that I have given him \na preamble and a warm-up of about 2 minutes, I think I will sit down \nand listen to what he has to say, and then I will add my comments to \nhis when he finishes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Through the Chair, I also wish to thank my distinguished colleague \nfrom Tennessee for joining me. Together, as he mentioned, we are \nwriting the Attorney General today about a matter of real concern, and \nthat is why we come to the floor. We are both very troubled by recent \nreports that the Department of Justice is targeting whom to prosecute \nfor the incidental killing of migratory birds under the Migratory Bird \nTreaty Act. They are not targeting whom to prosecute by looking at \nbirds killed; they are targeting whom to prosecute based on the type of \nbusiness these various people are in--legal business--and, in \nparticular, the type of legal energy these companies produce.\n  What am I talking about? Well, on the one hand, oil and gas \nproducers--traditional energy producers--are clearly being targeted. \nThey are being targeted for prosecution, as I say, under the Migratory \nBird Treaty Act. They are being charged with the incidental killing--in \na particular case that a court has dealt with--with the killing of four \nmallards, one northern pintail, one redneck duck, and one Say's phoebe.\n  Now, in that case, the Federal judge involved correctly recognized \nthat this prosecution was off-base because it wasn't about trying to \nkill these birds--it wasn't about any willful act. It was about a \ncompletely incidental killing of these birds because they were doing \nthings in the normal course of business. Nobody wants any of these \nbirds to be killed, but that is not what criminal sanctions under the \nMigratory Bird Treaty Act are about.\n  As the judge said, ``then many everyday activities [would] become \nunlawful--and subject to sanctions--'' with ``fines'' under these sorts \nof prosecutions.\n  The judge pointed out that ``ordinary activities such as driving a \nvehicle, owning a building with windows, or owning a cat'' could be \nsubject to criminal prosecutions if this precedent were set.\n  So that is on the one hand: the Department of Justice, I think, \nclearly targeting these companies who are oil and gas producers. On the \nother hand, they have a very different approach to other types of \nenergy producers, such as wind producers. To our knowledge, there is \nnot a single Department of Justice prosecution regarding the killing of \nbirds because of windmills. That clearly happens. In fact, it happens a \nlot. I am not saying these wind producers want that to happen. I am not \nsaying they are trying to kill birds, but it happens and it happens a \nlot. And to our knowledge, the Department of Justice has never launched \na similar prosecution against a wind farm.\n  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's fiscal year 2013 budget \njustification actually estimated the annual bird mortality from wind \nenergy production. Do my colleagues know what the estimate was? It was \n440,000. I just mentioned this criminal prosecution on the oil and gas \nside for seven birds. On that side, total, we have this estimate of \n440,000.\n  But wait; it gets even more ridiculous. It appears the administration \nis also choosing to sanction this in the case of wind production \nbecause they are actually considering granting permits to wind energy \nproducers who state in their permits they will kill bald eagles. So in \nsoutheastern Minnesota the administration is considering a permit for a \nwind farm that states in its permit it has the potential to kill \nbetween 8 and 15 bald eagles each and every year.\n  So on the one hand we have an oil and gas producer who is gone after \nwith a criminal prosecution because they didn't intend but incidentally \nkilled seven birds--of course, none of them the status of a bald eagle, \nnone of them in danger. On the other hand, the administration is \nconsidering granting a permit where the wind producer says it is going \nto probably kill 8 to 15 bald eagles a year, the symbol of our Nation's \ngreatness.\n  It is pretty clear to us that what this is about is not evenhanded \nenforcement of the law. What this is about is targeting one type of \nenergy producer and favoring a different type of energy producer.\n\n[[Page S379]]\n\n  Here is a picture of a bald eagle. The wind farm has stated it will \nkill perhaps 8 to 12 of those a year. We also have photographs of birds \nthat were unfortunately killed at a wind farm. This is one victim. We \nhave another photograph of an eagle that was killed at a wind farm. \nThis is not a bald eagle; this is a golden eagle, an absolutely \nbeautiful bird.\n  All of these bird deaths are bad, but all of them are unintended. The \npoint is that the Migratory Bird Treaty Act did not intend criminal \nprosecutions for this unintended incidental effect. The judge ruled \nthat. We think the judge is right. But the broader concern is that the \nJustice Department seems to be targeting the companies it goes after \nnot based on what they do with regard to migratory birds but based on \nwhat they do as a legal business and what sort of energy they produce.\n  Is this really a policy that reflects an ``all of the above'' energy \nstrategy? We think not. We think it is pretty darn obvious it is not an \n``all of the above'' approach. That is something very different than an \n``all of the above'' energy strategy. It is strategy that says this \nsort of legal business, this sort of legal production of energy is evil \nand is to be gone after and combated in any way possible, and that sort \nof legal business, that sort of production of a different form of \nenergy is to be favored in any way possible. That is our broader \nconcern, and it is a pretty darn important one.\n  This is important in and of itself. It is an important part of the \nlaw. It is important that prosecutions be appropriate and evenhanded, \nbut the broader issue with regard to a true ``all of the above'' energy \nstrategy is even more important.\n  As I turn to my colleague from Tennessee, let me simply ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record of the Senate this letter which \nwe are both sending today to Attorney General Eric Holder.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 January 30, 2012.\n     Attorney General Eric Holder,\n     U.S. Department of Justice, Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Holder: We write today seeking \n     clarification of the Department of Justice's policy for \n     prosecuting alleged violations of the Migratory Bird Treaty \n     Act (MBTA). As you know, the MBTA is a criminal statute that \n     makes it unlawful to ``kill'' or ``take'' a migratory bird, \n     nest, or egg, except as permitted under the statute. We are \n     concerned by what seems to be a trend of the Department \n     pursuing MBTA enforcement actions against oil and gas \n     companies for conduct that is otherwise overlooked when it is \n     undertaken by renewable energy companies. Fair and consistent \n     application of federal enforcement authority is fundamental \n     to equal justice under the law as well as to the President's \n     and Congress' call for an ``all of the above'' energy policy \n     that pursues all forms of energy production.\n       On one hand, the Department of Justice chose to prosecute \n     three oil and gas production companies for the incidental \n     killing of migratory birds in North Dakota. In those cases, \n     the companies were charged with the incidental killing of \n     four mallards, one northern pintail, one red-necked duck, and \n     a say's phoebe. By determining that the MBTA ``only covers \n     conduct directed against wildlife,'' a Court rejected your \n     Department's claim that these producers had violated the \n     MBTA.\n       The Court noted, and we agree, that ``it is highly unlikely \n     that Congress ever intended to impose criminal liability on \n     acts or omissions of persons involved in lawful commercial \n     activity, which may indirectly cause the death of birds \n     protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.'' Furthermore, \n     the Judge reasoned that, if the Department's interpretation \n     of the MBTA was adopted, ``then many everyday activities \n     [would] become unlawful--and subject to criminal sanctions--\n     when they cause the death of pigeons, starlings, and other \n     common birds. For example, ordinary land uses which may cause \n     bird deaths include cutting brush and trees, and planting and \n     harvesting crops. In addition, many ordinary activities such \n     as driving a vehicle, owning a building with windows, or \n     owning a cat, inevitably cause bird deaths.''\n       On the other hand, you have not prosecuted a single wind \n     producer for migratory bird deaths that occur as a result of \n     wind energy production. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's \n     fiscal year 2013 budget justification estimated annual bird \n     mortality from wind energy production at approximately \n     440,000. This number suggests that a significant number of \n     birds, some of which have additional protections under the \n     Endangered Species Act, are harmed by wind turbines on wind \n     farms.\n       We were recently made aware that Federal officials have \n     decided to allow a wind energy farm in southeastern Minnesota \n     to apply for a permit to allow for the death of bald eagles, \n     who are obviously the symbol of the United States. If allowed \n     to proceed, the project has the potential to kill between \n     eight and fifteen bald eagles each year. We find it absurd \n     that the Department of Justice, in conjunction with the Fish \n     and Wildlife Service, could reasonably conclude that three \n     oil and gas operators should face prosecution for the \n     incidental killing of seven birds at the same time it \n     considers permits to kill between eight and fifteen bald \n     eagles. This does not pass the common-sense test, and \n     suggests the Administration is hostile towards traditional \n     energy production.\n       We do not condone the indiscriminate killing of birds from \n     any sort of energy production. Nor do we believe the \n     Department should target businesses because of the type of \n     energy being produced. To that end, we seek to understand why \n     your Department has chosen to selectively prosecute oil and \n     gas producers at the same time the Administration considers \n     granting permits that will result in the killing of bald \n     eagles. In order to help us better understand and analyze \n     your policy, please provide us with answers to the following \n     questions:\n       1. In the past four years, how many criminal prosecutions \n     has the Department undertaken against oil and gas producers \n     who have allegedly violated the MBTA? Of those prosecutions, \n     how many prosecutions involved a felony for a knowing MBTA \n     violation and how many prosecutions have involved a \n     misdemeanor prosecution?\n       2. In the past four years, how many criminal prosecutions \n     has the Department undertaken against wind energy producers \n     who have allegedly violated the MBTA? Of those prosecutions, \n     how many prosecutions involved a felony for a knowing MBTA \n     violation and how many prosecutions have involved a \n     misdemeanor prosecution?\n       3. Last year, Stacey Mitchell, Chief of the Environmental \n     Crimes Section, stated at a public conference that the \n     Department brings prosecutions based on the willingness of a \n     company to cooperate as opposed to the number of birds that \n     are killed. Please provide us with any guidelines the \n     Department considers when making the determination to \n     prosecute an energy producer under the MBTA. Do your \n     guidelines or any policy directives distinguish between oil \n     and gas producers and wind energy producers?\n       4. Please explain the apparent targeting of oil and gas \n     producers for violations under the MBTA. Do you believe it is \n     inconsistent to prosecute energy producers for the deaths of \n     seven animals among three producers at the same time the \n     Administration condones an energy project that plans to kill \n     between eight and fifteen bald eagles each year?\n       We hope that you will provide us a prompt response so that \n     we can understand the Department's decision-making processes \n     on this important issue. Should you have any questions, \n     please feel free to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n     David Vitter,\n       Ranking Member, U.S. Senate EPW Committee.\n     Lamar Alexander,\n       United States Senate.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Madam President. With that I close and thank, \nagain, my colleague from Tennessee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I am here to join with and \ncongratulate the Senator from Louisiana for his leadership on this \nissue. These are important matters for a couple of reasons. One is, as \nthe Senator from Louisiana said, the rule of law is one of the \nfundamental principles of the American character. We expect laws to be \nenforced evenly, whether it is a little law or whether it is a big law. \nObviously, here, the Department of Justice is enforcing a law against \noil and gas companies but not against wind companies. It is the same \nlaw; it should be applied in the same way.\n  The second is the matter of birds. Someone might say: Why would \nSenators take the time to talk about birds?\n  I am reading one of President Teddy Roosevelt's books. This is about \nhis African game hunt after he was President of the United States. He \nwrote a lot of books, and he was a great President. All of us concede \nthat. We remember him for many things, but if we read carefully Teddy \nRoosevelt's biography, his entry into political life was because of his \nconcern for birds. He was a bird man. He protected birds. He captured \nthem and brought them to various museums of America to serve as \nexhibits. He helped enact the laws that protect birds.\n  In one of the biographies of Teddy Roosevelt I read, the author \npointed out that the single largest spectator sport in the United \nStates is not football, it is not NASCAR, it is bird watching. I am not \nmuch of a bird watcher, but these laws are important for that reason as \nwell.\n  The Senator has spoken very specifically and clearly about what is \ngoing\n\n[[Page S380]]\n\non here. We have the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, almost 100 years old. A \nperson can go to jail if they violate the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. \nThen there is the Bald and Golden Eagle Act. That protects one of our \nnational symbols. A person can go to jail for that too, and be fined \n$100,000 and imprisonment of 1 year for killing bald eagles and golden \neagles.\n  The letter Senator Vitter and I sent today to the Attorney General \nasks: If you are enforcing that law against one kind of energy company, \nwhy aren't you enforcing it against another kind of energy company? Or \nif you think you are not going to enforce the law--and sometimes this \nadministration just decides that it will not enforce the law--then at \nleast enforce the law in an evenhanded way.\n  The Senator from Louisiana mentioned the energy farm in southeastern \nMinnesota that has applied for a permit that will allow the wind farm \nto kill the protected bald eagles. Basically, what is happening here is \nthe wind farm is applying for a federal hunting license to kill eagles, \nand the U.S. Government is considering granting a hunting license to a \nwind farm to kill these protected bald eagles. How does that fit with \nan evenhanded system of justice, equal treatment of the law?\n  ExxonMobil, in 2009, pled guilty to killing 85 birds that had come \ninto contact with crude oil. Exxon paid $600,000 in fines and fees. \nPacifiCorp in Oregon paid $1.4 million in fines for killing over 200 \neagles in Wyoming. Yet a wind farm in Minnesota is applying for a \nhunting license to put up Cuisinarts in the sky to kill protected \neagles. That is not evenhanded.\n  It is no excuse to say, well, cats kill birds, windows kill birds, \nother things kill birds. That may be, but we have Federal laws against \nthose who set out and set up machines that deliberately kill birds. We \nneed to have a rational policy for treating all energy companies the \nsame.\n  So that is our discussion today. We believe it is important. The head \nof the Audubon Society in Los Angeles says the threat to golden eagles \nby wind farms has the potential to wipe this large, long-lived species \nout of the sky.\n  I think all of us know these are not our grandmothers' windmills. \nThese are giant turbines that are three times as tall as the sky boxes \nat one of the most recognizable features in Tennessee, which is the \nUniversity of Tennessee football stadium. These are huge monstrosities, \nand they have many detriments to the environment. They destroy \nviewscapes, they are noisy, and we can see their flashing lights for \nmiles. We don't want to see them on the scenic mountains of east \nTennessee where people come to see the Great Smoky Mountains--not to \nsee these big white towers.\n  In their enthusiasm for wind power as a solution to our electricity \nneeds in the United States, I am afraid the administration is \ndestroying the environment in the name of saving the environment and \nproducing at the same time a type of electricity that is intermittent, \nthat only operates when the wind blows, is expensive, and has huge \nsubsidies from the Federal taxpayer that would make any tax subsidy for \noil companies look small by comparison.\n  Let's put all the questions about wind power to one side except this \none: Why is the U.S. Department of Justice enforcing the migratory bird \nlaws against one set of energy producers--oil and gas--and not against \nanother--wind farms? That is what Senator Vitter and I would like to \nknow. That is why we are sending the letter today.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two articles: \none from the Wall Street Journal and one other article from the Los \nAngeles Times about the effect of wind farms on protected birds.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Aug. 3, 2011]\n\n      Federal Officials Investigate Eagle Deaths at DWP Wind Farm\n\n                           (By Louis Sahagun)\n\n       Pine Tree facility in the Tehachapi Mountains faces \n     scrutiny over the deaths of at least six golden eagles, which \n     are protected under federal law. Prosecution would be a major \n     blow to the booming industry.\n       Federal authorities are investigating the deaths of at \n     least six golden eagles at the Los Angeles Department of \n     Water and Power's Pine Tree Wind Project in the Tehachapi \n     Mountains, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said Tuesday.\n       So far, no wind-energy company has been prosecuted by \n     federal wildlife authorities in connection with the death of \n     birds protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald \n     and Golden Eagle Protection Act. A prosecution in the Pine \n     Tree case could cause some rethinking and redesigning of this \n     booming alternative energy source. Facilities elsewhere also \n     have been under scrutiny, according to a federal official \n     familiar with the investigations.\n       ``Wind farms have been killing birds for decades and law \n     enforcement has done nothing about it, so this investigation \n     is long overdue,'' said Shawn Smallwood, an expert on raptor \n     ecology and wind farms. ``It's going to ruffle wind industry \n     feathers across the country.''\n       Wildlife Service spokeswoman Lois Grunwald declined to \n     comment on what she described as ``an ongoing law enforcement \n     investigation regarding Pine Tree.''\n       Joe Ramallo, a DWP spokesman, said, ``We are very concerned \n     about golden eagle mortalities that have occurred at Pine \n     Tree. We have been working cooperatively and collaboratively \n     with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the California \n     Department of Fish and Game to investigate these incidents.\n       ``We have also actively and promptly self-reported raptor \n     mortalities to both authorities,'' he said. ``Moving forward, \n     we will be ramping up further our extensive field monitoring \n     and will work with the agencies to develop an eagle \n     conservation plan as part of more proactive efforts to \n     monitor avian activities in the Pine Tree area.''\n       An internal DWP bird and bat mortality report for the year \n     ending June 2010 indicated that compared to 45 other wind \n     facilities nationwide, bird fatality rates were ``relatively \n     high'' at Pine Tree, which has 90 towers generating 120 \n     megawatts on 8,000 acres.\n       Golden eagles weigh about 14 pounds and stand up to 40 \n     inches tall. Their flight behavior and size make it difficult \n     for them to maneuver through forests of wind turbine blades \n     spinning as fast as 200 mph--especially when they are \n     distracted by the sight of prey such as squirrels and \n     rabbits.\n       DWP officials acknowledged that at least six golden eagles \n     have been struck dead by wind turbine blades at the two-year-\n     old Kern County facility, about 100 miles north of Los \n     Angeles, which was designed to contribute to the city's \n     renewable energy goal of 35% by 2020.\n       Although the total deaths at Pine Tree pale in comparison \n     with the 67 golden eagles that die each year in Northern \n     California's Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area, the annual \n     death rate per turbine is three times higher at the DWP \n     facility. The Altamont Pass facility has 5,000 wind \n     turbines--55 times as many as Pine Tree.\n       Nationwide, about 440,000 birds are killed at wind farms \n     each year, according to the Wildlife Service. The American \n     Wind Energy Assn., an industry lobbying group, points out \n     that far more birds are killed by collisions with radio \n     towers, tall buildings, airplanes and vehicles, and \n     encounters with household cats.\n       Attorney Allan Marks, who specializes in renewable energy \n     projects, called the Pine Tree deaths ``an isolated case. If \n     their golden eagle mortality rate is above average, it means \n     the industry as a whole is in compliance.''\n       About 1,595 birds, mostly migratory songbirds and medium-\n     sized species such as California quail and western \n     meadowlark, die each year at Pine Tree, according to the bird \n     mortality report prepared for the DWP last year by Ojai-based \n     BioResource Consultants.\n       BioResource spokesman Peter Cantle suggested that those \n     bird deaths may be unrelated to Pine Tree's wind turbines.\n       ``It's hard to tease out those numbers,'' he said. \n     ``Basically, we walked around the site to find bird \n     mortalities, which could have been attributable to a number \n     of things including natural mortality and predators.''\n       The death count worries environmentalists because the $425-\n     million Pine Tree facility is in a region viewed as a \n     burgeoning hot spot for wind energy production.\n       ``We believe this problem must be dealt with immediately \n     because Pine Tree is only one of several industrial energy \n     developments proposed for that area over the next five to 10 \n     years,'' said Los Angeles Audubon President Travis Longcore. \n     ``Combined, they have the potential to wipe this large, long-\n     lived species out of the sky.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 7, 2009]\n\n                    Windmills Are Killing Our Birds\n\n\n    One standard for oil companies, another for green energy sources\n\n                           (By Robert Bryce)\n\n       On Aug. 13, ExxonMobil pleaded guilty in federal court to \n     killing 85 birds that had come into contact with crude oil or \n     other pollutants in uncovered tanks or waste-water facilities \n     on its properties. The birds were protected by the Migratory \n     Bird Treaty Act, which dates back to 1918. The company agreed \n     to pay $600,000 in fines and fees.\n       ExxonMobil is hardly alone in running afoul of this law. \n     Over the past two decades, federal officials have brought \n     hundreds of similar cases against energy companies. In July, \n     for example, the Oregon-based electric utility PacifiCorp \n     paid $1.4 million in fines and restitution for killing 232 \n     eagles in Wyoming over the past two years. The birds were \n     electrocuted by poorly-designed power lines.\n\n[[Page S381]]\n\n       Yet there is one group of energy producers that are not \n     being prosecuted for killing birds: wind-power companies. And \n     wind-powered turbines are killing a vast number of birds \n     every year.\n       A July 2008 study of the wind farm at Altamont Pass, \n     Calif., estimated that its turbines kill an average of 80 \n     golden eagles per year. The study, funded by the Alameda \n     County Community Development Agency, also estimated that \n     about 10,000 birds--nearly all protected by the migratory \n     bird act--are being whacked every year at Altamont.\n       Altamont's turbines, located about 30 miles east of \n     Oakland, Calif., kill more than 100 times as many birds as \n     Exxon's tanks, and they do so every year. But the Altamont \n     Pass wind farm does not face the same threat of prosecution, \n     even though the bird kills at Altamont have been repeatedly \n     documented by biologists since the mid-1990s.\n       The number of birds killed by wind turbines is highly \n     variable. And biologists believe Altamont, which uses older \n     turbine technology, may be the worst example. But that said, \n     the carnage there likely represents only a fraction of the \n     number of birds killed by windmills. Michael Fry of the \n     American Bird Conservancy estimates that U.S. wind turbines \n     kill between 75,000 and 275,000 birds per year. Yet the \n     Justice Department is not bringing cases against wind \n     companies.\n       ``Somebody has given the wind industry a get-out-of-jail-\n     free card,'' Mr. Fry told me. ``If there were even one \n     prosecution,'' he added, the wind industry would be forced to \n     take the issue seriously.\n       According to the American Wind Energy Association, the \n     industry's trade association, each megawatt of installed \n     wind-power results in the killing of between one and six \n     birds per year. At the end of 2008, the U.S. had about 25,000 \n     megawatts of wind turbines.\n       By 2030, environmental and lobby groups are pushing for the \n     U.S. to be producing 20% of its electricity from wind. \n     Meeting that goal, according to the Department of Energy, \n     will require the U.S. to have about 300,000 megawatts of wind \n     capacity, a 12-fold increase over 2008 levels. If that target \n     is achieved, we can expect some 300,000 birds, at the least, \n     to be killed by wind turbines each year.\n       On its Web site, the Wind Energy Association says that bird \n     kills by wind turbines are a ``very small fraction of those \n     caused by other commonly accepted human activities and \n     structures--house cats kill an estimated one billion birds \n     annually.'' That may be true, but it is not much of a \n     defense. When cats kill birds, federal law doesn't require \n     marching them to our courthouses to hold them responsible.\n       During the late 1980s and early '90s, Rob Lee was one of \n     the Fish and Wildlife Service's lead law-enforcement \n     investigators on the problem of bird kills in Western oil \n     fields. Now retired and living in Lubbock, Texas, Mr. Lee \n     tells me that solving the problem in the oil fields ``was \n     easy and cheap.'' The oil companies only had to put netting \n     over their tanks and waste facilities.\n       Why aren't wind companies prosecuted for killing eagles and \n     other birds? ``The fix here is not easy or cheap,'' Mr. Lee \n     told me. He added that he doesn't expect to see any \n     prosecutions of the politically correct wind industry.\n       This is a double standard that more people--and not just \n     bird lovers--should be paying attention to. In protecting \n     America's wildlife, federal law-enforcement officials are \n     turning a blind eye to the harm done by ``green'' energy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/30/senate-section/article/S381-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S381-S383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RECESS APPOINTMENTS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, last Friday, a three-judge panel of \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued a \ndecision that basically said the era of recess appointments is over. \nThe three-judge court unanimously ruled that President Obama, on \nJanuary 4, 2012, made three recess appointments which were \nunconstitutional, and, therefore, said the court, these three \nindividuals--one who is already gone from the NLRB--so two NLRB \nindividuals who were in the case that was before this court hold their \nseats unconstitutionally.\n\n  The Chairman of the National Labor Relations Board nevertheless said, \nin effect, that the NLRB is open for business. I respectfully suggest \nthat a different sign should go up--``help wanted; nominations \nneeded''--and that the two NLRB members whose recess appointments were \nunconstitutional should leave the NLRB because the decisions in which \nthey participated--and there were 219 of them--cannot be valid if they \nare challenged, just as this 1 decision was vacated, because since they \nwere unconstitutionally there, the NLRB did not have a quorum, and \ntherefore, when those decisions are challenged, under the ruling of \nthis court, those decisions cannot stand. They are important decisions. \nAs the Senator from Wyoming undoubtedly will mention more about, they \ninvolved some controversial issues.\n  Several observers have said the court's decision is broad. In fact, \nit is a breathtaking decision. It is a bold decision. But by all \nstandards, it seems to be the correct decision. This is why I say that \nif you take an American history book in one hand and the U.S. \nConstitution in the other and you read them both at the same time, you \nsee that the Constitution, which was ratified a long time ago--before \n1800--has in it article II, section 2, which says that the President \nmay make nominations of a number of people, such as soon-to-be \nSecretary of State Kerry, who was confirmed yesterday--a number of \npeople--but that those nominations require the advice and consent of \nthe Senate.\n  We have done some work here in the Senate over the last 2 years, and \nwe have improved the nomination process. We have eliminated a number of \nthe nominations that are subject to advice and consent. We have made it \neasier for people to move through, and we have expedited a large number \nof those. For example, 273 of the 1,100 nominations that require advice \nand consent can be sent right to the desk by the President, and if a \nsingle Senator does not want it to go through the entire process, after \nthe relevant committee gets all the relevant information, the majority \nleader can just move, after 10 days, to confirm that person. But if it \nis a Secretary of State or if it is a Secretary of Defense or if it is \na member of the National Labor Relations Board, the Senate has a \nconstitutional responsibility to consider those nominees.\n  I would suspect that the advice and consent role of the Senate is \nprobably our best known power. It is the title of a book that Allen \nDrury wrote that came out, I think, in the late 1950s. Most Americans \nknow about the advice and consent role of the Senate, and they know why \nwe have it. We have it because our Founders put their necks on the line \nin a revolution against a King, and they did not want an imperial \nPresidency. So they put into place a system of checks and balances, \nwhich is being exercised this very moment because of the courts saying \nthat the President's use of the--I ask unanimous consent for another 3 \nminutes, please.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I believe we have 30 minutes for this \ndiscussion; is that right?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twenty-three minutes remains.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes. I thank the Chair.\n  So as we look back over the history of checks and balances and the \nimperial Presidency and the importance of making certain we do not have \nan imperial Presidency, we are reminded the reason we did that was a \nsingle word: liberty--the revulsion by the Founders who created this \nsystem and who then made sure our President was a President, not a \nKing. And George Washington, who exercised great modesty and restraint, \nimpressed into the American character his own modesty and restraint \nwhen he asked that he be called ``Mr. President,'' not something more \ngrand, when he retired to Mount Vernon after two terms, when he could \nhave been President of the United States for life.\n  So that is what the Constitution talked about. It said that for these \nimportant positions, the President may nominate, but if the Senate does \nnot confirm them, they cannot serve.\n  There is also a provision toward the end of article II, section 2 \nabout recess appointments. Here is what the court said when it got out \nits American history book and began to compare that with the \nConstitution: This was written for a time when it took Senator Houston \nof Texas--I ask, Madam President, that I have time to speak in morning \nbusiness.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. So this was written at a time when Senator Sam Houston \nof Texas had to ride a horse, get on a steamboat, get in a stagecoach, \nand make his way to Washington over a period of 5 or 6 or 7 weeks, and \nthe same to go home; and when President Polk had a vacancy in 1846 in \nthe Attorney General's Office and wrote a letter to someone in New \nHampshire and invited him to take the position and that took 2 or 3 \nweeks to get the letter, and then in 2 or 3 weeks back came the answer: \nNo.\n  Communication was a little different back then, so it was necessary, \nfor the\n\n[[Page S382]]\n\ngovernment to operate, to put into the Constitution that when the \nCongress, the Senate was home--which meant all over this big, grand \ncountry, before the days of communication and travel--that during a 4- \nor 5- or 6-month period, the President could appoint someone to that \nposition during the recess, the Constitution says.\n  The Constitution says, according to the court, that when a vacancy \noccurs during the recess, the President may make an appointment during \nthat recess. So the court was talking about only one recess, and that \nis the one between the annual sessions of Congress--the one between \nwhen we end in 2012 and start in 2013.\n  Since that time, starting right after the Civil War, the President \nand Congress have been inventing these various ideas about other \nrecesses. We even got down to the idea where we created having a recess \nfor 3 days and then having a pro forma session to prevent the President \nfrom making any, quote, recess appointment during that time. But what \nthe court has said is that all that does not really matter, that the \nonly recess during which a President may make an appointment is between \nthe end of an annual session and the beginning of the next.\n  I believe the ruling is correct. I believe it will be affirmed. I \nhave no idea whether the Supreme Court will affirm it in whole, but \nsurely they will at least say that the Senate itself--not the \nPresident--will decide when the Senate is in session and when the \nSenate is in recess, and if they do that, the era of the recess \nappointment is likely over. There is no need for a recess appointment \nin a modern era where the Senate is in session almost all the time. And \nthe recess appointment has become used by Presidents to get around the \nchecks and balances that are in article II, section 2 of the \nConstitution that provide liberty for the citizens of this country by \navoiding an imperial Presidency.\n  So I call on the NLRB to take down the ``open for business'' sign and \nput up one that says ``help wanted; nominations accepted.'' The NLRB \ncan do a number of things, but the Board cannot as long as it does not \nhave a quorum. And the two members who are there unconstitutionally \nshould leave their positions immediately, and accept no more pay.\n  Madam President, the Senator from Wyoming has been a leader on this \nissue, and I would like to now yield the floor and listen to his \nremarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I agree completely with my colleague, \nwho has really shown significant leadership in this area, worked \nclosely on it. He has been a Governor for two terms, knows about \nappointments, knows about advice and consent.\n  What we have seen from this President of the United States, just last \nJanuary, is a flagrant disregard for the Constitution and the laws of \nthis land by bypassing the Senate and appointing three members to the \nNational Labor Relations Board, claiming--claiming--the Senate was in \nrecess, even though the Senate was meeting regularly in pro forma \nsessions. So last week the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia ruled unanimously--unanimously--that those unilateral \nappointments were unconstitutional.\n  It is interesting because I saw the whip of the Senate Democrats on \none of the television shows this weekend, and he said: Well, we need to \nmake sure people have plenty of time for hearings. They did not have \nhearings.\n  Madam President, the Democrats are in control of the Senate. They \ncould have called hearings but chose not to. The President let these \nvacancies sit for long periods of time, and only in the middle of \nDecember of 2011 did he even put names up and then summarily, just a \nfew weeks later, went and unilaterally appointed them. The Senate was \nreally never consulted. The Senate did not have an opportunity to \nadvise and consent. That is why I use the word ``flagrant'' in terms of \nthe President's bypassing of the Senate in making these alleged recess \nappointments.\n  Well, over the weekend, newspapers across this country reported on \nthis consequential ruling by the court and what it will mean for the \nadministration going forward.\n  The Wall Street Journal called it ``Obama's Abuse of Power''--abuse--\nabuse of power.\n  Politico said: ``President Obama's Recess Appointment Bet Sours.''\n  Investor's Business Daily reported: ``Court Finally Reins in Obama's \nImperial Presidency.''\n  The Washington Post explained: ``Court Says Obama Exceeded Authority \nin Making Appointments.''\n  The Los Angeles Times reported: ``Court Rules Obama's Recess \n[Appointments] Are Illegal''--illegal.\n  After we go on reading through all of this, after this court ruling, \nthe White House should finally realize--finally realize--that the \nPresident's power to use recess appointments is not unlimited.\n  The court's decision reaffirms that America's Founding Fathers \nprovided the Senate--the Senate--a responsibility, a duty to advise and \nconsent, and they did it with the strong, coequal responsibility on \nimportant nominations.\n  Well, let's take a look at what the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia actually ruled when they talked about the \nPresident's so-called recess appointments.\n  The court said:\n\n       An interpretation of ``the Recess'' that permits the \n     President to decide when the Senate is in recess would \n     demolish--\n\n  ``Demolish,'' the court said--\n\n     the checks and balances inherent in the advice-and-consent \n     requirement, giving the President free rein to appoint his \n     desired nominees at any time he pleases, whether that time be \n     a weekend, lunch, or even when the Senate is in session and \n     he is merely displeased with its inaction.\n\n  The court went on to say: ``This cannot be the law.''\n  I agree completely with the court, which is why I am here on the \nfloor of the Senate with my colleagues. Senator Johanns, also a former \nGovernor, is with us today. These are individuals who understand the \nimportance of advice and consent. And again, as to Senator Johanns, he \nhas been a Cabinet member. He has been subjected to the process of \nadvice and consent, and he knows how important that is in the balance \nof power, in how Washington and our Nation are supposed to work by the \nConstitution.\n  As the court wrote, ``Allowing the President to define the scope of \nhis own appointments power would eviscerate the Constitution's \nseparation of powers.''\n  The court added, ``It would make little sense to extend [the recess \nappointment authority] to any intrasession break'' because the ability \nto make recess appointments would swallow the advice-and-consent role \nof the Senate.\n  Because of the President's illegitimate appointments, the NLRB is now \noperating under a cloud of uncertainty all across the country in all of \ntheir regulations and rules. That is why shortly after the \nappointments, the President's appointees to the NLRB--Sharon Block, \nTerence Flynn, and Richard Griffin--began issuing orders and opinions \nin labor disputes. So they have been doing that now for over a year.\n  All of those decisions that the Board issued by a quorum made up by \nthose members--there were over 200 of those rulings coming out in the \npast year--are subject to challenge and to invalidation. We have heard \nfrom Senator Alexander on one of those having to do with micro unions. \nAnother had to do with collection of union dues even after the \ncontracts had expired. On and on and on, numbers of rulings, over 200 \nhave been made. They are all subject to challenge and invalidation \nbecause there was no legitimate quorum for the National Labor Relations \nBoard. At this moment it is practically impossible for anyone to know \nwhich NLRB decisions are valid and which are not. It is my opinion that \nnone of them should be valid. But it is time to stop this regulatory \ntrain wreck from getting any worse. That is why this week I am \nintroducing a bill that will freeze any decisions, any regulations, any \nrulings made by this unconstitutionally appointed and invalid quorum of \nthe National Labor Relations Board. Until we have final resolution from \nthe courts, the NLRB should not be able to move forward and create even \nmore uncertainty across this country.\n  We would not be in this position if the President of the United \nStates had done what legally he is mandated to\n\n[[Page S383]]\n\ndo, which is work with Congress and follow the Constitution. I hope \nthat court ruling serves as a wakeup call for President Obama and for \nhis entire administration. Instead of going around Congress, instead of \ngoing around the Constitution, it is time for the Obama administration \nto work with us on nominations.\n  I see the Senator from Nebraska is here, the former Governor, former \nCabinet member. I look forward to hearing his comments as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I rise today, first of all, to say \nthank you to Senator Barrasso and Senator Alexander for speaking so \nforcefully on this issue. All of us in this body are elected officials \nand we take an oath. In that oath, we raise our right hand and we \npromise our Nation that we will uphold the Constitution of the United \nStates, this very sacred document that has so soundly guided our great \ncountry from one decade to another, one century to another, one \ngeneration to another.\n  In fact, many of my colleagues in Congress took that oath earlier \nthis month. Just 10 days ago, President Obama took the Presidential \noath of office with great pomp and circumstance. We were all on the \nplatform with him. He promised the Nation that he would preserve and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States. But I fear that now what \nwe are seeing is a flaunting of that very document.\n  You see, the DC Court of Appeals ruled that the President violated \nthe Constitution with his appointment of three members to the National \nLabor Relations Board. I read the opinion. I saw no other solution than \nto ask these individuals to leave. The truth of the matter is they are \nnot constitutionally there and need to leave.\n  This request was not about a personal preference or an attitude about \nany one individual. It was not about their qualifications. It was about \nthe oath of office we take. And that oath of office says we will uphold \nthe Constitution. The NLRB appointments were unconstitutional because \nthe President only has the power to bypass our advice-and-consent role \nhere in the Senate under the language of the Constitution. The court \nunequivocally found that the appointments were made last January while \nthe Senate was not in recess, and were therefore void. Therefore, the \nPresident could not use the recess appointments clause of the \nConstitution to appoint these individuals. The ruling correctly \nconcludes: ``Allowing the President to define the scope of his own \nappointments power would eviscerate the Constitution's separation of \npowers.''\n  The separation of powers is a critical safeguard to ensure that one \nbranch of government does not overstep the other. The court goes on to \nsay that allowing these nominations to stand ``would wholly defeat the \npurpose of the Framers in the careful separation of powers.''\n  Additionally, because these appointments were unconstitutional, the \nboard lacked the quorum necessary to make decisions over the past year. \nThis calls into question over 200 rulings of the board since last \nJanuary. I personally believe that there is no doubt, if they are not \nconstitutionally there, if they are there violating the Constitution, \nthen all of their rulings, all of their regulations, all of their \nactions as a board are invalid and void.\n  That is why I wrote last Friday to the Government Accountability \nOffice asking them to report to us every single decision they had made \nthat was in excess of their powers to be there. You would think it \nwould be common sense that the board would suspend all further action. \nYou know, as a former member of the Cabinet, it never occurred to me \nthat I had the right to ignore court decisions. I cannot imagine. The \nChairman of the NLRB said this, ``The board respectfully disagrees with \nthe decision.'' The Chairman indicates they will continue to conduct \nbusiness as usual, even though a unanimous appeals court has deemed the \nappointments of all but one member of the board to be unconstitutional. \nI find their action absolutely appalling. Decisions by the NLRB are \nfelt across the country.\n  It is not fair for the Board to say to the court: Go pound sand, \nwhich is exactly what they are telling this court. It is already awful \nthat 200 litigants now have to go through the time and expense to \nappeal their rulings. Instead of continuing business as usual and \nissuing more bogus rulings, the Board should recognize that it is time \nto leave and to honor the Constitution.\n  I will wrap up with this. The D.C. appeals court ruling was a victory \nfor our system of government. I believe it was a victory for the \nConstitution. It ensures that no one, including the President of the \nUnited States, is above the Constitution. I simply ask the NLRB, its \nmembers who were unconstitutionally appointed, to recognize the \nsanctity of our Constitution and vacate their offices immediately. \nLeave. Let us in the Senate have the powers granted to us by the U.S. \nConstitution to offer advice and consent to the President of the United \nStates.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking my colleagues--\nall of them--for their unbelievably generous comments to me personally, \nin the committee, on the floor, and in the halls and at meetings over \nthe course of the last weeks. I will always be grateful for our \nfriendships.\n  I thank my wife Teresa, who is here with us, and my entire family for \ntheir unbelievable support through this journey.\n  Five times Massachusetts has voted to send me to the U.S. Senate. \nYesterday, nearly three decades after the people of Massachusetts first \nvoted me into this office, the people with whom I work in the Senate \nvoted me out of it. As always, I accept the Senate's sound judgment.\n  Eight years ago, I admit that I had a slightly different plan to \nleave the Senate, but 61 million Americans voted that they wanted me to \nstay here with you. So staying here I learned about humility, and I \nlearned that sometimes the greatest lesson in life comes not from \nvictory but from dusting oneself off after defeat and starting over \nwhen you get knocked down.\n  I was reminded throughout this journey of something that is often \nsaid but not always fully appreciated: All of us Senators are only as \ngood as our staff--a staff that gives up their late nights and \nweekends, postpones vacations, doesn't get home in time to tuck \nchildren into bed, and all of those lost moments because they are here \nhelping us serve. They are not elected. They didn't get into public \nservice to get\n\n[[Page S384]]\n\nrich. That is for sure. And their names are rarely in the newspapers. \nBut from the staff in the mailrooms to the people who answer the front \nphones to the policy experts and the managers, the legislative \ncorrespondents who write the letters, the caseworkers who make \ngovernment accountable, and the people everywhere in between, they make \nthe Senate work for people.\n  I have been blessed to have a spectacular staff. And while I know \nevery one of my colleagues would say the same thing about their staff, \nit is true about mine.\n  If I start naming names, I am going to miss somebody, so I am not \ngoing to. But I think every one of my staff will understand why I want \nto acknowledge five who are not with us any longer. They are up in \nheaven looking down on all of us, and Ted Kennedy has probably drafted \nall of them; Jayona Beal, Jeanette Boone, Bill Bradley, Louise \nEtheridge, and Gene Heller--the latter two of whom were senior citizen \nvolunteers in my Boston office who opened our mail for over a decade. \nThey were not paid. They just did this out of love of country. We miss \nthem all, and we thank them for their selfless contribution.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this point a \nlist of names of the people who have helped me serve this Nation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       George Abar, Nardos Abebe, Adam Abrams, Alex Abrams, Corey \n     Ahearn, Robert

As I thank an entire staff of 561 incredible men and women \nin Massachusetts and Washington with whom I have been privileged to \nwork through these 28 years, I also think about the interns, 1,393, who \nhave come in and out of our offices from Washington to Worcester. I am \nespecially proud of those who started as interns and ended up as my \nchief of staff, a legislative director, and senior policy staffers, or \nthe Kerry interns who went on to work not just for me but who have for \nthe last 4 years been top speech writers, trip directors, and senior \ncommunications staff at the White House for the President of the United \nStates. I am proud of our internship program, and I am grateful to the \npeople who built it and who sustain it.\n  I also thank the incredible group of unsung heroes who literally make \nthe Senate work, people who work not for individual Senators but work \nfor all of us, in every room and nook and cranny of this great series \nof buildings. The men and women who operate the Senate subways--Daryl \nand many others--the trains and elevators, they take us to the votes \nand meetings. They are really the glue, and we couldn't function \nwithout them; they are an extraordinary group of people; the Capitol \nPolice who protect us--police, whom a lot of people around here started \nto notice a little bit more after that awful day in 1998 when two were \nshot and killed on a busy Wednesday afternoon; the Parliamentarians and \nthe clerks and staff here on the floor, including Gary, Tim, Trisha, \nMeredith, and all the folks in the cloakroom. And Dave on the other \nside and all the folks in the Republican cloakroom--all of whom help to \nkeep us going and are unfailingly patient when we call for the \numpteenth time to find out whether the vote schedule is going to let us \ngo home to a child's dance recital or birthday party or any kind of \nfamily event.\n  I want to thank the many Bertie Bowmans who came here more than 40 \nyears ago, dug in, and made the Senate their cause and their concern; \npeople such as Meg Murphy of the Foreign Relations Committee, who makes \neverybody's life easier.\n  I thank the reporters who catch us in the hallways--trap us, ambush \nus in the hallways, and who, despite all the changes and challenges in \ntheir own business, still dutifully document the first drafts of \nAmerican history. I thank all the incredible people who travel through \nthese Halls working incredibly hard to get it right, people of \ncharacter who cover this place as a public service, not a sport. I \nthank them.\n  I thank David Rogers for all that he has stood for so long in this \ninstitution. It is hard to imagine my job without seeing him in that \nlong green coat waiting by the elevator after a late-night vote.\n  Sometimes in politics it is now almost a sport in America to dismiss \nthe contributions of people who work in government, people who make the \nSenate work, but people whom the public never sees. I have admired the \nway our former colleague, Ted Kaufman, used to come down to the floor \nonce a week and tell the story of one individual Federal worker. The \nstories are legion. Instead of tearing these people down, we ought to \nbe lifting them up. And I thank them all for the part they play in our \ndemocracy.\n  I will share with you, now that I have come to this moment in the \njourney, I can say without reservation that nothing prepares you for \nit. Many times now in 29 years I have been at my desk on the Senate \nfloor--starting way over there, No. 99--listening as colleagues bid the \nSenate farewell. Sometimes a farewell speech signals a complete \ndeparture from public life, sometimes a new journey altogether, \nsometimes forced departure, sometimes a leap for freedom.\n  I am grateful that at this moment, thanks to my colleagues, \nserendipity, and the trust of our President, while I am closing a \nchapter, it is not the final one. But I assure you, amid the excitement \nand the possibility, I do feel a wistfulness about leaving the Senate; \nand that is because, despite the obvious frustrations of recent days \nand years--a frustration that we all share--this place remains one of \nthe most extraordinary institutions of any kind on the face of the \nEarth.\n  On occasion we have all heard a Senator leave here and take their \nleave condemning the Senate for being broken, for having become an \nimpossible setting in which to try to do the people's business. Well, I \nwant to be very clear about my feelings. I do not believe the Senate is \nbroken--certainly not as an institution. There is nothing wrong with \nthe Senate that can't be fixed by what is right about the Senate--the \npredominant and weighty notion that 100 American citizens, chosen by \ntheir neighbors to serve from States as different as Massachusetts and \nMontana, can always choose to put parochial or personal interests aside \nand find the national interest.\n  I believe it is the honor of a lifetime--an extraordinary privilege--\nto have represented the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the Senate for \nmore than 28 years. What a remarkable gift it has been to carry the \nbanner of ``Senator from Massachusetts,'' just as each of you feel that \nway about your States--a banner, in our case, that was passed from the \nsons of the American Revolution, such as Daniel Webster, to the sons of \nimmigrants such as Paul Tsongas, and to know that a State where the \nabolitionists crusaded at Faneuil Hall and the suffragettes marched at \nQuincy Market could send to Washington sons, such as Ted Kennedy and Ed \nBrooke, who fought to expand civil rights; now, a woman, Elizabeth \nWarren, who proved that in Massachusetts the glass ceiling has finally \nbeen forever shattered. And what a remarkable gift Massachusetts has \ngiven me to come here and learn so much about the rest of our country.\n  I have had the privilege of learning what truly makes our Nation \ntick. What a gift, to have been the nominee of my party, to have come \nwithin a whisper of winning the Presidency against a wartime incumbent; \nbut more important, to have experienced the magic of our Nation in such \na personal way, to experience the gift of traveling along the banks of \nthe mighty Mississippi through Iowa and South Dakota and along the \nrivers where Louis and Clark marked and measured the dream of our first \nSecretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, who foresaw an America that would \nadvance into the West; to experience a journey that took me to Alabama, \nwhere I stood silently in the very pulpit from which Dr. King preached \nhis dream of an America united, and dipped my fingers into the fountain \nin Birmingham where water flows over the names of those murdered trying \nto vote or just registering to vote, to see the water trickle over the \nwords of Dr. King's prayer that ``justice might roll down like waters \nand righteousness like a mighty stream.'' I drove across the Hoover \nDam, and I wondered, as I did, at what America can accomplish when we \nwant to, when we put our minds to it. Driving across the Golden Gate \nBridge at dawn I was reminded it was built at the height of the Great \nDepression, when so many feared our best days were behind us. What I \nhave seen and heard and learned in traveling across our country as a \nSenator from Massachusetts has prepared me more for my travels to other \ncountries as Secretary of State than any travel to any foreign Capitol.\n  I already know I will miss the best reward of carrying the title \n``Senator,'' and that is when you open a letter from someone who has \ntraveled every route and exhausted every option and who ultimately \nturned to you as the last resort in public life and they finally got \nthe help they needed. I know my colleagues who have experienced this \nwill say there is nothing better than getting that ``I have tried \neverything, but nobody would listen to me, but you got it done'' letter \nor sometimes when you are walking a street in a community at home and \nsomebody comes up to you and thanks you for a personal response they \nnever expected to receive. That is when public service has more meaning \nthan the war of words our constituents dodge on the cable news.\n  Standing at this desk that once belonged--at this desk that once \nbelonged to President Kennedy and to Ted Kennedy, I can't help but be \nreminded that even our Nation's greatest leaders and all the rest of us \nare merely temporary workers. I am reminded\n\n[[Page S386]]\n\nthis Chamber is a living museum, a lasting memorial to the miracle of \nthe American experiment.\n  No one has captured this phenomenon more eloquently or \ncomprehensively than Robert Caro did in his masterpiece about the \nSenate called ``Master of the Senate.'' I am sure many in this room--I \nknow most people have read it. In that book, before we learned of the \nlevers Lyndon Johnson pulled to push our Nation toward civil rights, \nCaro described the special powers the Founders gave the Senate and only \nthe Senate, powers, Caro writes, ``designed to make the Congress \nindependent of the President and to restrain and act as a check on his \nauthority, power to approve his appointments, even the appointments he \nmade within his own administration, even the appointments to his own \nCabinet.''\n  This body has now exercised that power on my behalf and I will always \nbe grateful.\n  Another master of the Senate, Massachusetts' Daniel Webster, \ndelivered 183 years ago this week what has often been praised as the \ngreatest speech in Senate history. He stood at the desk that now \nbelongs to the senior Senator from New Hampshire and argued forcefully \nin favor of the very idea that makes us the United States, that we are \nall in this together, that we each have a stake in the successes and \nfailures of our countrymen, that what happens in Ohio matters to those \nin South Carolina or in Massachusetts or to Montanans. ``Union and \nliberty,'' Webster shouted, ``now and forever, one and inseparable.''\n  As Caro retells it, those words spoken among the desks in the Senate \nleft those in the gallery in tears and cast a model for how those of us \nin this Chamber must consider the constituents of our colleague's as \nwell as our own. But the truth is that none of us ran for this office \nbecause of a great debate held centuries ago. None of us moved here \nbecause of the moving words of a Senator long since departed. We honor \nthis history because we are here because of the legacy that we can and \nwant to leave. It is up to us, to my colleagues here today and to those \nwho come after us, it is up to us to keep the Senate great.\n  I fully believe we will meet that obligation if, as the President \ntold the Nation and the world last week, we seize this moment together. \nYes, Congress and public life face their difficulties these days but \nnot because the structure our Founding Fathers gave us is inherently \nflawed. For sure there are moments of much great frustration, for the \nAmerican people and for everybody in this place. But I don't believe \nthey are the fault of the institution itself. It is not the rules that \nconfound us per se. It is the choices people make about those rules.\n  The rules we work by now are essentially the same ones that existed \nwhen I joined the Senate and found things to move much more easily than \nthey do today. They are essentially the same rules under which Daniel \nWebster and Lyndon Johnson operated, and they did great things. They \nare almost the same rules Mike Mansfield and Everett Dirksen and Ted \nKennedy and Orrin Hatch used to pass great pieces of legislation. They \nare the same rules under which the Senate Democrats and President \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush passed an agreement, including tax \nincreases, to at least begin to tackle the deficit. I remind everyone, \nas I take my leave from the Senate, when President George H.W. Bush \nreturned from agreeing to a deficit reduction agreement at Andrews Air \nForce Base, he wrote in his personal diary that he might well have \nsealed his fate as a one-term President. He did what he thought was \nright for the country, and he laid the groundwork for our ability to \nthree times balance the budget at the end of the 1990s. That is \ncourage, and the Senate and the Congress and the country need more of \nit.\n  Frankly, the problems we live through today come from individual \nchoices of Senators themselves, not the rules. When an individual \nSenator or a colluding caucus determines that the comity essential to \nan institution such as the Senate is a barrier to individual ambition \nor party ambition, the country loses. Those are the moments in which \nthe Senate fulfills, not its responsibility to the people but its \nreputation as a sanctuary of gridlock.\n  I ask colleagues to remember the words of Ben Franklin, as that long \nPhiladelphia summer yielded our remarkable Constitution. Late at night, \nafter their work was complete, Dr. Franklin was walking down the steps \nof Constitution Hall, of Independence Hall, and a woman called out to \nhim and she said: Well, Doctor, what have we got, a Republic or a \nmonarchy? Franklin answered: ``A Republic, if you can keep it.''\n\n  Sustaining a functioning Republic is work and it is, more than ever, \nI believe, our challenge today. I am hardly the first and I will, I \nhope, probably not be the last to call on Congress to remember why we \nare here, to prioritize our shared interests above the short term, to \nbridge the breadth of the partisan divide and to reach across the aisle \nand take the long view. Many have stood here delivering farewell \nspeeches and lamented what became of the Washington where President \nReagan and Speaker O'Neill could cultivate an affiliation stronger than \nparty or a Congress that saw true friendships between Senators such as \nKennedy and Hatch, Inouye and Stevens, Obama and Coburn; the odd \ncouples, as they have been dubbed.\n  I cannot tell you why, but I do think it is possible this moment may \nsee a turn in the spirit of the Senate. There are new whispers of \ndesire for progress, rumors of new coalitions, and a sense of \npossibility--whether it is on energy or immigration.\n  I am deeply impressed by a new generation of Senators who seem to \nhave come here determined not to give in to the cynicism but to get the \npeople's business done. I am confident that when today's freshmen take \ntheir turns in leaving the Senate, they will be able to tell of new \nSenators added to that estimable list of odd couples, and with any luck \nby then it will not be odd.\n  So I leave here convinced we can keep our Republic strong. When \nPresident Kennedy observed that ``our problems are manmade; therefore \nthey can be solved by man,'' he was talking about a much more literal \nkind of nuclear option than the euphemism we use today to discuss \nSenate rules. But his vision is just as important for us to recognize \nin our time, whether we are talking about the ability of Senators to \ndebate and vote or about the issues on which they do so. It is still \ntrue today, as he said 50 years ago, that ``reason and spirit have \noften solved the seemingly unsolvable, and we believe,'' he said, \n``they can do it again.''\n  I believe that too.\n  So what effort do we need to put into our reason and spirit in order \nto do it? I believe there are three most significant challenges that \nhave conspired to bring about a dangerous but reversible erosion in the \nquality of our democracy: the decline of comity, the deluge of money, \nand the disregard for facts.\n  First, I have witnessed what we all have, a loss of simple comity, \nthe respect that we owe one another, and the sense of common cause that \nbrings all of us here. The Senate as a body can change its rules to \nmake itself more efficient, sure. But only Senators, one by one in \ntheir own hearts, can change the approach to legislating which Henry \nClay correctly defined as the art of consensus.\n  I came to the Senate in 1985 as a Member of a hopeful and hard-\ncharging class of freshmen. Paul Simon, Tom Harkin, Al Gore, Phil \nGramm, Jay Rockefeller, and I all have at least three things in common. \nWe were all sworn in as Senators at the same time. We each explored \nrunning or ran for the White House, and none of us made it there.\n  (Laughter.)\n  The last remaining Member of that class, Senator Mitch McConnell, has \nnow again been elevated by his peers as the Republican leader.\n  I see a lot of a very similar aspiration that we felt when I came \nhere in 1985 in today's freshmen and sophomores. Many came to the \nSenate running on the premise that it is broken beyond repair. I \nencourage each and every one of them to reject that premise in order to \nrestore the promise of the Senate. The Senate cannot break unless we \nlet it. After all, the value of this institution, similar to any \ninstrument of power, is how you use it. But we can't ignore the fact \nthat today, treaties that only a few years ago would have passed 100 to \nnothing, don't pass at all. People who want to vote for\n\n[[Page S387]]\n\nsomething they believe in actually don't do so for fear of retribution. \nThat is a reflection on all of us. As I prepare to represent our Nation \nin capitals around the world, I am more than conscious that my \ncredibility as a diplomat and ours as a country is determined, to a \ngreat degree, by what happens right here in our own Capital City.\n  The antidote to the current narrative of American decline--and you \nwill hear it in China, in Iran, in other parts of the world--the \nantidote to that, and it is pushed by rival countries, is to \ndemonstrate that we can get our economic house in order because we can \nbe no stronger abroad than we are here at home. It is that simple. The \nunwillingness of some to yield to the national interest is damaging to \nAmerica's prospects in the world. We are quick to talk about the global \neconomy and about global competition, but it is our own procrastination \nand outright avoidance of obvious choices that threatens our own \nfuture. Other nations are both quick and glad to fill the vacuum that \nis brought about by our inaction.\n  If the Senate favors inaction over courage and gimmicks over common \nground, the risk is not that we will fail to move forward, it is that \nwe will fall behind, we will stay behind, and we will surrender our \npromise to those who are more than willing to turn our squandered \nopportunity into their advantage.\n  The world keeps turning. The Senate cannot afford to forever stand \nstill. Just as failing to deal with our deficit and our debt puts our \nlong-term interests at risk, so does taking America to the brink of \ndefault. Our self-inflicted wounds reduce our leverage and our \ninfluence in the world. By failing to act, Congress is making it harder \nto actually advance America's interests and making it harder for \nAmerican business to compete and for American workers to succeed. If \nAmerica is to continue to lead the free world, this must end.\n  We have all bemoaned the lack of comity in the Senate. Those of you \nwho remain here will have the power to restore it. The choice to work \nrespectfully with one another is about as simple as it gets. I have one \nsuggestion, perhaps. While I am honored by the presence of so many \ncolleagues who are here now--Republicans and Democrats--I have to say \nwe all look forward to more days when the U.S. Senate desks are full \nwith Senators debating, deliberating, learning, listening, and leading. \nWe would all be stronger if this Chamber is once again crowded because \nit is the world's greatest deliberative body, the home of debate and \ndeliberation, and not only when it becomes a departure lounge.\n  There is another challenge we must address, and it is the corrupting \nforce of the vast sums of money necessary to run for office. The \nunending chase for money, I believe, threatens to steal our democracy \nitself. I used the wording--and I want to be clear about it--I mean by \nit not the corruption of individuals but corruption of a system itself \nthat all of us are forced to participate in against our will.\n  The alliance of money and the interest it represents, the access it \naffords to those who have it at the expense of those who don't, the \nagenda it changes or sets by virtue of its power, is steadily silencing \nthe voice of the vast majority of Americans who have a much harder time \ncompeting or who cannot compete at all.\n  The insidious intention of that money is to set the agenda, change \nthe agenda, block the agenda, define the agenda of Washington. How else \ncould we possibly have a U.S. Tax Code of some 76,000 pages? Ask \nyourself: How many Americans have their own page, their own tax break, \ntheir own special deal?\n  We should not resign ourselves to a distorted system that corrodes \nour democracy. This is what is contributing to the justifiable anger of \nthe American people. They know it, they know we know it, and yet \nnothing happens. The truth requires that we call the corrosion of money \nand politics what it is: It is a form of corruption and it muzzles more \nAmericans than it empowers. It is an imbalance that the world has \ntaught us can only sow the seeds of unrest.\n  Like the question of comity in the Senate, the influence of money in \nour politics also influences our credibility around the world. So too \ndoes the unacceptable and extraordinary difficulty we continue to have \nin 2013 operating the machinery of our own democracy here at home. How \nextraordinary and how diminishing it is that more than 40 years after \nthe Voting Rights Act so many of our fellow citizens still have great \ndifficulty when they show up on election day to cast their vote and \nhave their voices heard. That too matters to all of us.\n  For a country that can and should extol the virtues of democracy \naround the world, our job is made more difficult through long lines and \novert voter suppression and efforts to suppress people's ability to \nexercise the right that we extol. So many still struggle to exercise \nthat right here at home.\n  The last of the three obstacles we have the ability, if not the will, \nto overcome is the unbelievable disregard for facts, for science in the \nconduct of our affairs. It, like the first two, degrades our \ncredibility abroad as well as at home.\n  My friends, the persistent shouting match of the perpetual campaign--\none that takes place in parallel universes, thanks to our polarized, \nself-selected media, to some degree--makes it harder and harder to \nbuild consensus among people. The people don't know what to believe. So \nin many ways it encourages an oversimplification of problems that too \noften retreat to slogans and not ideas for real solutions.\n  America, I regret to say, is increasingly defaulting rather than \nchoosing, and so we fail to keep pace with other nations in the renewal \nof our infrastructure, in the improvement of our schools, in the choice \nof our energy sources, in the care and nurturing of our children, in \nthe fulfillment of our God-given responsibility to protect life here on \nEarth. That too must change or our experiment is at risk.\n  To remain a great Nation we must do the business of our country, and \nthat begins by putting our economic house in order. It begins by \nworking from the same set of facts. Although I believe we cannot solve \nany of these problems unless we solve all of them, I note these three \nchallenges because I believe the Senate is going to be locked into \nstalemate or our politics are going to be irreversibly poisoned unless \nwe break out of it. I say this hopefully as someone who respects and \nloves this institution and loves this country and wants to see us move \nforward.\n  Some things we know are moving forward. In the same time that comity \nhas decreased and the influence of money has increased, I have seen the \nSenate change for the better. This Chamber used to be filled with the \nvoices of men, and men only. Decisions affecting more than half the \npopulation were made by people representing the other half. When I \nwalked into the Senate Chamber to take my first oath 28 years ago, I \nwas joined by my two teenaged daughters. It struck me that I had twice \nas many daughters as there were women in the U.S. Senate. Today, with \nthe service of 20 women--including Massachusetts' new junior Senator--\nthis is a stronger and smarter place, more representative of our belief \nthat out of many, we are one; more capable of fulfilling the vision \ncarried from Washington to Webster to our current President; that we \nare a stronger Nation when our leadership reflects our population.\n  We have made huge strides on turning the page on gay rights. In 1993, \nI testified before Strom Thurmond's Armed Services Committee, pushing \nto lift the ban on gays serving in the military, and I ran into a world \nof misperceptions. I thought I was on a ``Saturday Night Live'' skit. \nToday, at last, that policy is gone forever, and we are a country that \nhonors the commitment of all willing to fight and die for our country. \nWe have gone from a Senate that passed DOMA--over my objections--to one \nthat just welcomed its first openly gay Senator.\n\n  These are good changes for our Senate and our country, but we have \nmore work to do. This place needs more women, more people of color, \nmore diversity of background and experience, but it is still a \nremarkable place.\n  I am reminded of the letters of Harry Truman that he used to write \nhome to wife Bess as he sat in the back row of the Chamber. Late one \nnight after the great debate of the New Deal Era, he wrote:\n\n\n[[Page S388]]\n\n\n       I hear my colleagues, and I pinch myself and ask, How did I \n     get here?\n\n  Several months later, he wrote Bess once more:\n\n       Again it is late at night and I am sitting here listening \n     to the debate, I look across the aisle at my colleagues and I \n     listen and listen, and I hear my colleagues, and I ask \n     myself, How did they get here?\n\n  Well, I have no doubt that colleagues have asked that question about \nme or any one of us, and it has been back and forth. But 29 years later \nI have learned something about myself. I learned that the Senate runs \non relationships. I know that some of my more recent colleagues--sent \nhere in tumultuous election cycles--hear that and think it is code for \nchecking their beliefs at the door and going Washington. It is not. And \nI would add: Don't kid yourself; no one got here on a platform of \npledging to join an exclusive club and forget where they came from.\n  When I say that relationships matter, I don't mean back-slapping, \nglad-handing, hail-fellow-well-met, go-along-to-get-along \nrelationships; I mean real relationships. And to today's hard-charging \ncolleagues who came to Washington to shake things up, I would remind \nthem, so did I, so did Tom Harkin, and the others I mentioned. If I \ntold you that a 40-year-old newly minted Senator John Kerry was going \nto tell you that relationships mattered most, I would have looked at \nyou as if you had three heads. I cut my teeth in grassroots activism. I \ndidn't come up through the political ranks. I burst onto the scene as \nan activist, and when you are an activist, all that singularly matters \nto you--to the exclusion of almost everything else--are the issues. \nWhere are you on an issue? Right or wrong, that is the ballgame.\n  Wrong. It is not the ballgame. That is not what makes a good Senator. \nThat is not what makes the Senate work. My late colleague of 25 years \nTed Kennedy taught me that. I saw him late at night on the Senate floor \nsitting with his colleagues talking and listening. He wanted to know \nabout your State; he wanted to know about your family; he wanted to \nknow why you came here. He had a unique ability to know not just what \nhe needed from you on a vote or a piece of legislation but to know what \nyou needed on a personal level as a friend, as a colleague, as a \npartner.\n  My old friend--now Vice President Joe Biden--had a saying in his \nfamily: If you have to ask, it is too late. With Teddy, you never had \nto ask. He always knew, and he was there. He was there on a foggy \nmorning on Nantucket when my father passed away, and Teddy materialized \nalmost out of nowhere. There he was at my porch door. He didn't call \nahead; he didn't ask. He came to mark the passage. He was there. It was \nan instinct for people and an impulse to help.\n  He taught so many of us during that period of time. Somewhere along \nthe line, he passed it on not only to me but to every colleague here \nwho was privileged to work with him.\n  I will never forget in 2007 on the day I announced I would not be \nrunning again for President. Another rough day, another passage. I got \na call. Tom Harkin wanted to see me. My staff surmised that he was \nprobably coming to ask for money for the Iowa Democratic party. They \nwere wrong. It was a visit where Tom just came to share a few words \nthat were very simple but which meant the world to me; a colleague \nvisiting just to say he was proud that I had been the nominee of the \nparty in 2004, and he looked forward to working with me more in this \ninstitution.\n  Let me tell you, those are the conversations that make the \ndifference, those are the conversations you never forget, and that is \nthe U.S. Senate at its best. It is a place where relationships matter \nthe most. And it matters because Teddy, Tom, and so many others here \nunderstood instinctively that if 100 Senators knew each other--and our \nleader has worked very hard to try to find a way to make this happen--\nthen you can find the ways to work together.\n  To my surprise, I learned it here in a way that I never could have \npredicted, alongside people I never thought I would count as one of my \nproudest friends. Last week John McCain introduced me at my \nconfirmation hearing. John and I met here in the Senate, coming from \nvery different positions and perspectives. We both loved the Navy; I \nstill do to this day. But I have different feelings from John about a \nwar.\n  For both of us, Vietnam was a demarcation point in our lives, the way \nit was for so many of our generation. Well, late one night on a CODEL--\nfor people who are listening and don't know about CODELs, it is a trip \nof Senators and Congressmen going somewhere in the world--to Kuwait \nafter the first gulf war, John and I found ourselves in a C-130 sitting \nopposite each other. Neither of us could sleep, so we talked. We talked \nlate into the night about our lives and our war. Shortly thereafter, \nGeorge Mitchell and Bob Dole flew us together on a select committee to \ninvestigate the fate of Americans missing from the war in which we had \nfought. It was a tough time, an emotional issue in an era where Rambo \nwas a box office smash and a Newsweek magazine cover printed \nprovocative photos which asked whether Americans were still alive over \nthere.\n\n  Into that cacophonous cauldron, John McCain and I were thrown \ntogether. Some were suspicious of both of us, but together we found \ncommon ground. I will never forget standing with John in the very cell \nin the Hanoi Hilton in which he spent a number of years of his life, \njust the two of us alone in this cell, listening to him talk about that \nexperience.\n  I will always be grateful for his partnership in helping to make real \npeace with Vietnam by establishing the most significant process in the \nhistory of our country--or of any country--for the accounting of the \nmissing and dead in any war and afterwards and then working to lift the \nembargo and ultimately normalize relations with an old enemy. John had \nevery reason to hate them, but he didn't. We were able to heal deep \nwounds and end a war that divided an awful lot of people for much too \nlong. That is a common experience, and only the relationships that are \nforged in the Senate could have made that happen.\n  John has this great expression: A fight not joined is a fight not \nenjoyed. He loves to debate, he loves to battle, and so do I. But I \nwill tell my colleagues, having fought beside him and having fought \nagainst him, it is a heck of a lot better and more fun to have John \nfighting alongside of you. We still have differences. There has been a \nlot of newsprint used up covering some of them, but I will tell my \ncolleagues this: We both care about the Senate as an institution, and \nwe both care about the country's leadership and the world even when we \nsee it differently, and we both know that at some point America has to \ncome together.\n  We shared this common experience, and we have seen a lot together. We \nboth were able to travel the country as Presidential nominees for our \nparty, and both returned to the Senate to carry on in a different way. \nFew people know what that feels like. But just being by his side in \nHanoi made it impossible for me not to be overwhelmed by his sense of \npatriotism and his devotion to country. It meant something else: If you \ncan stand on the kind of common ground that we found in the Hanoi \nHilton, then finding common ground on issues here at home isn't hard at \nall. I will always thank John McCain for that lesson.\n  One of the magical things about the Senate is this amazing mix of \npeople and how they could come together to make something happen. I \nhave learned and been impressed by the experiences of every single one \nof my colleagues, and I honestly marvel at the reflection of each \nState's special character in the people they send here. I have learned \nfrom all--from a fiery, street-smart social worker from Maryland; from \na down-to-earth, no-nonsense farmer from Montana; from a principled, \nconservative doctor from Oklahoma; from an amazingly tenacious advocate \nfor women and the environment who blazed a trail from Brooklyn to \nRancho Mirage and the Senate, who teams with a former mayor of San \nFrancisco who took office after the assassination of Harvey Milk, \ncommitted to stand against violence and for equality; from a \ncantankerous, maverick patriot and former prisoner of war from Arizona, \nwhom I just talked about; to a songwriting, original, compassionate \nconservative from Utah; from a fervent, gravel-voiced people's champion \nfrom Ohio; from a soft-spoken, loyal, Medal\n\n[[Page S389]]\n\nof Honor winner from Hawaii who used to sit right here; and from a \ncollege professor turned proud prairie populist and Senate Pied Piper \nwho was taken from us far too soon and far too quickly. From every \nMember of the Senate, there are characteristics, passions, quirks, and \nbeliefs that bring this place alive and unite to make it the most \nextraordinary legislative body on Earth. That is what I love about the \nSenate.\n  I love that instead of fighting against each other, Bill Frist, the \nformer Republican leader, and I were able to join forces to fight HIV \nand AIDS around the globe and to convince an unlikely conservative \nnamed Jesse Helms to support and pass a bill unanimously that saved \nmillions of lives on our planet. That is what makes this place so \nspecial.\n  Instead of ignoring a freshman Senator, Chairman Claiborne Pell \nallowed me to pass my very first amendment to change our policy on the \nPhilippines. So I found myself with Dick Lugar, paired as Senate \nelection observers who helped expose the voter fraud of the Marcos \nregime, ending a dictatorship and giving a nation of more than 90 \nmillion people the opportunity to know democracy again. That is what \nthe Senate can do, and that is what I love about it.\n  Instead of focusing on our different accents and opposite ideologies, \nJesse Helms and I found that our concern for illegal drugs was greater \nthan any political differences between us. So Jesse made it possible \nfor an investigation to proceed and for the Senate to expose the \nlinkages between the Contras in Nicaragua and the flow of drugs to \nAmerican cities. That is what the Senate can do.\n  The Senate can still work if we learn from and listen to each other--\ntwo responsibilities that are, like Webster said about liberty and \nunion, one and inseparable.\n  So as I offer my final words on the Senate floor, I remember that I \ncame of age in a Senate where freshman Senators didn't speak that \noften. Senators no longer hold their tongues through whole sessions of \nCongress, and they shouldn't. Their voices are just as valuable and \ntheir votes count just as much as the most tenured Member of this body. \nBut being heard by others does not exempt them from listening to \nothers.\n  I came to the National Mall in 1971 with fellow veterans who wanted \nonly to talk to our leaders about the war. President Nixon tried to \nkick us off The Mall. We knocked on door after door on Capitol Hill but \ntoo often couldn't get an audience of representatives. A precious few, \nincluding Ted Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey, came to where we were camped \nout and heard what we had to say. I saw firsthand that our political \nprocess works only when leaders are willing to listen to each other but \nalso to everyone else. That is how I first came to the Senate--not with \nmy vote but with my voice--and that is why the end of my tenure here is \nin many ways a bookend.\n\n  Forty-two years ago, I testified before Senator Fulbright's Foreign \nRelations Committee about the realities of war in Vietnam. It wasn't \nuntil last week that I would sit before that committee again, this time \ntestifying in my own confirmation hearing. It completed a circle which \nI never could have imagined drawing but one our Founders surely did. \nThat a citizen voicing his opinion about a matter of personal and \nnational consequence could one day use that voice as a Senator, as the \nchairman of that same committee before which he had once testified as a \nprivate citizen, and then as the President's nominee for Secretary of \nState, that is a fitting representation of what we mean when we talk \nabout a government ``of the people, for the people, and by the \npeople.''\n  In the decades between then and now, this is what I have learned \nabove all else: The privilege of being here is in being able to listen \nto your constituents. It is the people and their voices much more than \nthe marble buildings and the inimitable institutions they house that \ndetermine whether our democracy works.\n  In my first appearance before the Senate, at the Fulbright hearings, \nI began by saying, ``I am not here as John Kerry. I am here as one \nmember of the group of 1,000, which is a small representation of a very \nmuch larger group.''\n  I feel much the same way today as I leave. We are still symbols, \nrepresentatives of the people who have given us the honor to speak and \nadvocate and vote in their name, and that, as the Bible says, is a \n``charge to keep.'' One day, the 99 other Senators who continue on for \nnow--and soon to be 100 again in a few days--will also leave in their \nown turn--in your own turn--some by their own choosing and some by the \npeople's. Our time here is not meant to last forever. If we use the \ntime to posture politically in Washington, we weaken our position \nacross the world. If democracy deadlocks here, we raise doubts about \ndemocracy everywhere. If we do not in our deeds prove our own ideals, \nwe undermine our security and the sacred mission as the best hope of \nEarth. But if we do our jobs right, if we treat our colleagues with \nrespect and build the relationships required to form consensus and find \nthe courage to follow through on our promises of compromise, the work \nwe do here will long endure.\n  So let us in the Senate or in the House be bigger than our own \ndistricts, our own States. Let us in spirited purpose be as big as the \nUnited States of America. Let us stand for our beliefs but, above all, \nlet us believe in our common history, our common destiny, in our common \nobligation to love and lead this exceptional Nation. They say politics \nstops at the water's edge. That is obviously not always true. But if we \ncare for our country, politics has its limits at home and abroad.\n  As I leave here, I do so knowing that forever the Senate will be in \nmy soul and that our country is my cause and yours. I thank you all for \nyour friendship and the privilege of serving with you.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/30/senate-section/article/S389-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, the nomination of Chuck Hagel to be the \nnext Secretary of Defense has already done damage to the credibility of \nthe United States in its attempt to deny Iran a nuclear weapon, thus \nemboldening one of the most dangerous regimes in the Middle East. To \nlimit that damage, President Obama should choose someone else to lead \nthe Pentagon.\n  After all, the Nebraska Senator is the same person who has \nconsistently opposed sanctions against Iran. He is the same person who \nwanted Washington to support Iranian membership in the World Trade \nOrganization. He is the same person who voted against designating the \nIranian Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist group at a time when \nit was orchestrating the murder of U.S. troops in Iraq.\n  He is the same person who refused to sign a letter asking the \nEuropean Union to label Hezbollah--an Iranian proxy--as a terror group, \neven though it is so designated by the U.S. State Department. He is the \nsame person who urged President Bush to offer Iran ``direct, \nunconditional, and comprehensive talks.'' He is the same person who \ncalled for establishing a U.S. diplomatic mission in Tehran.\n  He is the same person who dismissed ``a military strike against \nIran'' as ``not a viable, feasible, responsible option.'' And he is the \nsame person who suggested that the United States might be able to live \nwith a nuclear Iran.\n  During his years in this Chamber, Senator Hagel's opposition to Iran \nsanctions placed him in a very small minority. For example, only one \nother Senator joined him in voting against sanctions in 2001, and only \none other\n\n[[Page S390]]\n\nSenate Banking Committee member joined him in rejecting a different \nsanctions package in 2008.\n  Simply put, Senator Hagel has no credibility on perhaps the biggest \nforeign policy challenge facing the Obama administration's second term \nand on American national security interests in the Middle East and \naround the world.\n  Consider how his nomination was interpreted by Iranian journalists \nand government officials. Press TV, a Tehran-based propaganda network, \nnoted with satisfaction that Senator Hagel is known for ``his criticism \nof Washington's anti-Iran policies'' and ``has consistently opposed any \nplan to launch [a] military strike against Iran.''\n  The point is, not that we should be threatening military strikes \nagainst Iran, but to take this off the table entirely completely \nundercuts any diplomatic efforts we might take to deny Iran a nuclear \nweapon.\n  Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Iranian foreign ministry responded to \nthe Hagel announcement by declaring:\n\n       We hope that practical changes will be created in the U.S. \n     foreign policy and . . . that the U.S. officials will favor \n     peace instead of warmongering.\n\n  The Iranians are claiming we are the ones warmongering, while they \nare building a nuclear weapon.\n  Just for good measure, the Al Jazeera Web site published an article \nheadlined: ``Obama defeats the Israel Lobby.'' Is this really the \nimpression we want to give our adversaries and our allies in the Middle \nEast? Is this how we encourage our friends, to say we will be there to \nsupport our allies? Is this the message we want to convey to our \nadversaries such as Iran, that has threatened the annihilation of \nIsrael, to wipe it off the map? Unfortunately, that is the message that \nis conveyed by the nomination of Senator Hagel as Secretary of Defense.\n  Not only has Senator Hagel been a persistent critic of Iran \nsanctions, he has also displayed a stubborn hostility toward America's \nclosest Middle Eastern ally.\n  In October 2000, shortly after Yasser Arafat launched the second \nIntifada, 96 Senators signed a letter to President Clinton affirming \ntheir solidarity with Israel. Senator Hagel was not among them. Six \nmonths later, after a relentless onslaught of Palestinian terrorism, 87 \nSenators signed a different letter asking President Bush to ``initiate \na reassessment of our relations with the Palestinians.'' Once again, \nSenator Hagel refused to sign. He also refused to join 89 other \nSenators in signing a November 2001 letter that urged President Bush to \nmaintain strong support for Israel and to continue snubbing Arafat \nuntil the Palestinian leader ended his terror campaign.\n  On April 12, 2002, a Palestinian suicide bomber killed 6 people and \ninjured more than 100 others in Jerusalem. That same day, Senator Hagel \nwent to the Senate floor and suggested a moral equivalence between \nPalestinian terrorism and Israeli self-defense.\n  Three months later, he published an article in the Washington Post \nbemoaning ``the endless cycle of violence'' and declaring that ``Israel \nmust take steps to show its commitment to peace.''\n  In a 2003 interview with a local newspaper in Lincoln, NE, Senator \nHagel ratcheted up his rhetoric even further, saying the Israelis \n``keep Palestinians caged up like animals.''\n  In 2009, Senator Hagel coauthored a policy paper that advised \nPresident Obama to pursue a dialog with Hamas--again, a State \nDepartment-designated terrorist organization; Iran's primary proxy in \nthe area. More specifically, the paper recommended that Washington \n``offer [Hamas] inducements that will enable its more moderate elements \nto prevail, and cease discouraging third parties from engaging with \nHamas in ways that might help clarify the movement's views and test its \nbehavior.''\n  Most of us believe, including the U.S. State Department, that Hamas' \nviews and behavior are already clear enough: It is committed to the \nannihilation of Israel; it fires rockets and Iranian-made missiles at \ncivilian areas; and it indoctrinates Palestinian children in a culture \nof hatred and violence.\n  Of course, Senator Hagel's most famous comments--or I should say \ninfamous comments--on Israel were delivered during a 2006 interview \nwith former Clinton administration official Aaron David Miller. In that \ninterview, Senator Hagel said ``the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of \npeople up here.'' These remarks are deeply offensive, but they are also \nquite revealing, for they confirm that he simply does not understand \nthe true basis of the U.S.-Israeli alliance.\n  The American people and their elected representatives support Israel \nfor obvious reasons: Both of our countries are pluralistic democracies \nwith a shared commitment to liberty, equality, and basic human rights; \nboth of our countries are threatened by radical Islam; and both of our \ncountries have responded to that threat while remaining free and open \nsocieties.\n  In other words, we have an alliance based on shared values and a \ncommon determination to defend liberal democracy against terrorists and \ndictators alike.\n  I realize Senator Hagel is now repudiating many of his past actions \nand statements, but we have seen this before, unfortunately: \nindividuals approaching the confirmation process undergoing a seeming \ntransformation. But this sudden and convenient transformation beggars \nbelief. Senator Hagel has not undergone an abrupt ideological makeover; \nhe just wants to win approval from Members of this Chamber in what we \nmight call a ``confirmation conversion.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to advocate for a secure \nenergy future for our Nation. There is no question that we can achieve \nenergy security or energy independence for our country, and I believe \nwe can do it within the next 5 years.\n  I define energy security or energy independence as producing more \nenergy than we consume. I mean, this is an interrelated, high-tech \nglobal economy. Energy will move back and forth between nations, but we \ntruly become energy secure when we produce more energy than we consume. \nBut to do that, to achieve energy independence or energy security, we \nmust take the commonsense steps necessary to achieve it. That is why \ntoday, once again, I call on President Obama to approve the Keystone XL \nPipeline project now that Governor Heineman of Nebraska has approved \nthe new route through his State of Nebraska.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline is not just about bringing Canadian oil to \nU.S. refineries, it is also vital to move our own U.S.-produced oil \nthrough our refineries. In fact, that is how I got involved with this \nproject in the first place.\n  Although it is hard to believe, TransCanada first applied for \napproval of this project 4\\1/2\\ years ago. Let me repeat that--4\\1/2\\ \nyears ago. At that time, I was Governor of North Dakota, and I was \nworking with Governor Brian Schwietzer, of Montana, to make sure that \noil producers in the Bakken regions of our States, in North Dakota and \nMontana, could put light sweet crude oil from the Bakken into the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. We met with TransCanada, contacted our oil \nproducers, met with TransCanada, and they agreed. TransCanada agreed to \nan on-ramp so that the Keystone XL Pipeline would move North Dakota and \nMontana light sweet crude from the Bakken to refineries throughout the \nUnited States--to refineries in Illinois, Texas, Oklahoma, and \nLouisiana, hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil from our oilfields \nfrom day one.\n\n[[Page S391]]\n\n  That is what this chart shows. Here you see the original Keystone \nPipeline that was built during my tenure as Governor. Here we show the \nroute of the Keystone XL Pipeline, and you can see that it comes \nthrough North Dakota and Montana--our Bakken region--so that we can put \noil into the pipeline. It gives us access to all these refineries in \nIllinois, Oklahoma, Texas, and Louisiana.\n  We are talking about U.S. energy, we are talking about U.S. jobs, and \nwe are talking about commerce in our country, getting our economy \ngrowing and growing. We are talking about generating tax revenue \nwithout raising taxes to help with our debt and our deficit, and we are \ntalking about energy security. Why wouldn't anyone want that? Why \nwouldn't everyone support this project? Why is it being held up? Why is \nthe President holding up this project? Because the net effect is, with \nPresident Obama continuing to hold up this project, we are continuing \nto rely on oil from the Middle East when we could be relying on oil \nthat we produce here at home and from our closest friend and ally, \nCanada.\n  Well, some argue, it is because producing oil from the oil sands in \nCanada creates more greenhouse gas emissions. Let's look at the facts--\nnot rhetoric, not hype, not spin, let's look at the facts. Oil sands \ncrude produces about 6 percent more carbon dioxide than the U.S. crude \nsupply average--the average. Canadian oil sands crude produces less \ncarbon dioxide than the heavy crude we get from California or the heavy \ncrude we get from the Middle East. Think of that. By blocking the \nKeystone XL Pipeline, President Obama will continue to require that we \nrely on heavy crude from the Middle East rather than crude that is \nproduced with less emissions from Canada. How can that make sense?\n  Furthermore, since 1990 Canada has reduced the greenhouse gas \nemissions associated with every barrel of oil sands crude by almost 30 \npercent, and the technology continues to improve. Canada is investing \n$3 billion in carbon capture and storage technology--$3 billion. Eighty \npercent of the new development in Canadian oil sands is in in situ \nproduction, meaning drilling--like conventional drilling--rather than \nthe old method of excavation, and that means a smaller environmental \nfootprint.\n  Still, someone might say: Well, I don't care about that. I don't \ncare. I just don't want the Canadian oil sands produced.\n  The Canadian oil sands are going to be produced, just as sure as \ndeath and taxes. They are going to be produced. The only question is \nwhether the oil comes to us or goes to China.\n  I want to show my second chart. It is a simple map. The oil is going \nto be produced, but is it going to come down, pick up oil from our \noilfields, and move that product to our refineries, state-of-the-art \nrefineries with lower emissions, or is that oil, as you can see from \nthese green lines, going to go to the west coast of Canada and there be \nput on ships and sent to refineries in China and be refined in their \nrefineries, which have much higher emissions?\n  If it goes to China, that means there will be more greenhouse gas \nemissions as the oil is transported via tankers across the ocean rather \nthan a pipeline, and you also have the added risk of spills in the \nocean, affecting the ocean ecosystem. Meanwhile, we will continue to \nget oil from the Middle East with higher greenhouse gas emissions and \nthe risk of tanker spills rather than the greater safety and the lower \ncost of pipelines, not to mention the fact that we continue our \ndependence on oil from the Middle East. How can we continue to depend \non energy from the Middle East when we see what is going on, when we \nsee what is going on in Syria, when we see what is going on in Egypt \nand we see what is going on in Iran?\n  Recently, I attended the movie ``Argo.'' It is a great movie. If you \nhaven't seen ``Argo,'' I would recommend it. I would recommend it to \nanyone. It is about the Iran hostage crisis in 1979. Six American \ndiplomats fled to the Canadian Embassy when the U.S. Embassy was \nstormed by the Iranians. Our people, as you remember, were held at the \nEmbassy in Iran for 444 days. We all remember that terrible time.\n  This movie is the story of how our government, working through the \nCIA, working with the Canadian Government, helped the six Americans out \nwho were able to get to the Canadian Embassy. Our governments worked \ntogether and helped those hostages--in this case, the six who weren't \ntaken hostage but the six who were at the Canadian Embassy--took them \nout of Iran. It really is a great story. It is a story of how the \nUnited States and Canada worked together when a Middle Eastern country \nthat defines the United States as the ``Great Satan'' was holding our \npeople hostage.\n\n  Here we are today continuing to rely on oil from the Middle East. We \ncannot continue to rely on the volatile countries of the Middle East \nfor our energy. The American people couldn't be more clear. We have to \nstop our addiction to Middle Eastern oil. At the same time, we can't \ncontinue to send them billions of our dollars as we buy the oil, \nbillions of dollars that are used against us. We can and we must rely \non ourselves. We must rely on those we can count on, such as our \nclosest friend and ally, Canada.\n  If we don't learn from history, we are doomed to repeat the failures \nof the past. The time has come to act.\n  President Obama, the time has come to give us a decision on the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. The time has come to approve it. On a bipartisan \nbasis, we have worked to address all of the concerns you have raised \nregarding the project, including the new route through Nebraska.\n  On a bipartisan basis, we have asked to meet with President Obama, \nRepublicans and Democrats together. The response has been silence and \ndelay. The fact is that we can build a bright energy future for this \ncountry, but we need the President to join with us to do that. We can \ncreate energy, jobs, tax revenues that will reduce our debt and deficit \nwithout raising tax rates, and energy independence for our Nation.\n  Again, I ask President Obama to work with us, to work with us on a \nbipartisan basis, and the winners will be the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/30/senate-section/article/S391-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S391-S392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO STAFFORD, KANSAS\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, in my home State of Kansas, there are \nhundreds of small communities that line the highways and county roads \nthat stretch across the prairie part of the country. In many of these \ntowns, the populations are shrinking, but they are still called home by \nthousands of Kansans.\n  I grew up in one of those small communities out in western Kansas, a \nplace where folks know their neighbors and they try to take care of \nthem. Much of what I know about people, about human nature, is what I \nlearned by growing up in a small town where we all knew each other. I \nworked at the local hardware store, swimming pool, the drugstore, and I \nhad a paper route and got to meet almost everybody in my hometown.\n  In these small communities across America, the people work hard, they \ncome together to find commonsense solutions, and they solve problems. \nThey try to make a difference in the lives of their families and the \ncommunity. They also strive to provide a better future for their kids \nso that every child has the opportunity to grow up, pursue the American \ndream, and reach their goals.\n  For rural communities to survive and prosper, citizens have to work \ntogether to create their own opportunities for success. What happens \nhere in Washington, DC, has a huge consequence on the future of rural \ncommunities in my State. The reality is that those communities that are \ngoing to have a bright future are those that decide on their own to \nwork together within that community to make certain that is the case.\n  An example of a community that rallied together in this way to make \ngood things happen and to make the community better for the future is \nthe community of Stafford, population 1,042. I would like to recognize \nthe efforts by this community, the Stafford residents, with the \nBuilding Better Communities Award. They made the effort to preserve \ntheir town for another generation.\n  Rural communities across our State have been hit hard by the economic\n\n[[Page S392]]\n\ndownturn over the last few years. Many towns have encountered the \nclosing of businesses, Main Street looks a lot less appealing, there is \na shortage of health care services, and a younger generation is leaving \nhome in search for employment. In light of these challenges, the \ncommunity leaders of Stafford are taking steps to cure that town's \nfuture.\n  We have a chain of retail stores across our State called Duckwalls. \nTwo years ago they announced that they were closing 20 of their stores \nacross Kansas, and the residents of Stafford were left to drive more \nthan 20 miles to do their routine shopping. What happens in a community \nlike Stafford? The community leaders gathered and they raised the funds \nto open and operate a new store, a general store on Main Street called \nStafford Mercantile.\n  One of the things that makes this shop unique is it is owned by the \ncommunity and it features a lot of Stafford's history, including a 1928 \nsoda fountain and the marble-topped counter. In fact, one local \nresident, Judy Mayes, brought her mother to that store to have ice \ncream from the same fountain used at their wedding reception in 1934. \nThe new shop brings back fond memories of the past but also now brings \na future for younger folks in Stafford to enjoy a store, a mercantile, \nand a soda fountain. The mercantile has made it possible, once again, \nfor residents to see what can happen when they work together and now \nthey can shop at home.\n  Another challenge Stafford faced was the likelihood its local \nhospital would have to close its doors, after more than 50 years of \nserving that community, due to the pressures of declining population, \nMedicare reimbursement rates, and the difficult financial circumstances \nmost hospitals across Kansas now face. Access to health care services \nand hospitals is vital to the survival of a community. If you can't \naccess health care in communities across my State, it is one more \ncircumstance that creates the likelihood senior citizens will \nreluctantly move away to someplace where there is a doctor and a \nhospital, and young families will not take the risk of raising their \nfamilies without access to that health care. But with more than $\\1/2\\ \nmillion in debt, it seemed like, other than closing the hospital, there \nwas no option for Stafford. But rather than throwing in the towel and \ngiving up, the hospital got new leadership, they sought help from the \nfolks in the county, and they worked hard to make ends meet so the \nhospital doors could remain open and continue that long tradition of \nserving the residents of Stafford County.\n  Many rural communities often struggle to add younger generations of \nresidents to their workforce, given the lack of job opportunities. The \nsuperintendent of the local school district, Mary Jo Taylor, recognized \nthis challenge in her community, and she decided to do something about \nit. With the support of the leadership of the community, the citizens, \nthe business community of the town, and the support of local teacher \nNatalie Clark, the Stafford Entrepreneurship and Economic Development \nCenter was created at Stafford High School in 2003.\n  The goal of this center is to equip high school sophomores, juniors, \nand seniors with the training needed to become successful \nentrepreneurs. Who better to start a business in their hometown than a \nyoung person who grew up there and who is now educated and trained and \nhas a desire for entrepreneurship? More likely that person than \nprobably anyone else. By learning what it takes to develop and manage a \nsmall business, young people gain those valuable skills that open doors \nfor a wide range of future employment opportunities and, most \nimportant, the opportunity to create a business at home.\n  As part of that learning experience, local store owners hire those \nstudents and give them hands-on experience in managing their own \nbusiness. Those skills are important as those students leave high \nschool and will help enable them to create those jobs the community of \nStafford so desperately needs.\n  These are only a few examples of how the community of Stafford worked \ntogether to revitalize their community and pave the way for its future. \nCarolyn Dunn, the Stafford County Economic Development Director, summed \nit up this way when she said: ``Stafford is proving that when \ncommunities look within themselves for growth, they do have the \ncapability to forge a stronger, more positive future.''\n  The community of Stafford is a success story. It is a role model. It \ndemonstrates how teamwork and creative thinking and how caring about \nthe future of your community can make a positive difference for that \ncommunity and for all of rural America. I am proud to recognize the \nefforts of Stafford with what we have called the Building Better \nCommunities Award. Today, in the Senate, I offer my congratulations and \ngratitude for the kind of leadership and effort among all residents of \nthe community to see that Stafford is a good place to live today and, \nperhaps even more important, a great place to live tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use oversized \ncharts on the floor today because, basically, the information I have \nwill not fit on a standard size chart and still be readable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/30/senate-section/article/S392-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S392-S396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OUT OF CONTROL SPENDING\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, in a very short period of time, we are \ngoing to be considering an increase in the debt limit. It is for a \nspecific period of time, but it is, at a minimum, going to be $500 \nbillion. What is in front of our country, especially as we see negative \ngrowth in the third quarter, as reported today, and the continued \nprinting of money by the Federal Reserve, is that there is no \naccountability to rein in either the size, the scope or the spending \nhabits of the Federal Government.\n  Over the next 2 weeks, I am going to be very succinctly outlining \n$1.35 trillion worth of spending reductions that I would imagine the \nvast majority of Americans would agree with me on. I am going to build \nthe case almost every day as I come out here as to why we can't keep \ndoing what we are doing, and I will demonstrate the stupidity in how \nthe Federal Government is running today.\n  I know I will have no chance to defeat an increase in the debt limit \nthat is coming forward. I don't expect to accomplish that. The votes \nare here to raise the debt limit and not do anything about our \nspending. But most Americans realize the Federal Government is twice \nthe size it was 11\\1/2\\ years ago--twice the size. In just the last 4 \nyears, the average family income has declined over 7\\1/2\\ percent. So \nwhile family income is declining, our deficits are rising. Our debt is \nnow at almost $16.5 trillion and we are projected to spend $1.3 \ntrillion more than we take in this year and we have claims by the \nPresident and others that we have already cut something from the \nFederal Government. The fact is, that is only true using Washington \naccounting.\n  As somebody with a degree in accounting and understanding generally \naccepted accounting principles, what I want America to know is the \nFederal Government is bigger right now than it was last year at this \ntime. We have not spent $1 less than we were spending last year at this \ntime. As a matter of fact, we have spent about $18 billion more. Is \nthat an improvement? Yes. But the claims we have cut $2.7 trillion from \nthe budget are absolutely bogus. There is no truth in it. There is no \nreality in it. All anyone has to do is look at the amount of money we \nare borrowing to recognize that.\n  I want to lay out in sequential fashion five areas where we can, in \nfact, make significant changes in the Federal budget and start truly \naddressing our problems. These changes will have an impact of over $1.3 \ntrillion over the next 10 years. That doesn't solve our problem \nimmediately, but if in fact we do this, what we will have done is to \nstart down a long road of making the hard decisions. The decisions I \nwill outline are not hard. They are the easy ones. But we will be \nstarting down a road to get our country back and to secure the future \nof the young people sitting right down here and their children\n\n[[Page S393]]\n\nand the expectation that opportunity could be alive and well in \nAmerica.\n  There is coming to this country a debt bomb. There will come a time \nwhen the world will not loan us additional dollars. When that happens, \nthe consequence of that will be rising interest rates. The Fed will no \nlonger be able to control interest rates, and the interest rate will \nend up being whatever it takes, whatever the people of the world need \nin terms of what they require to loan us money. If we go back to \nhistorical interest rates, the average over the last 50 years on what \nwe have borrowed--the cost per year for the debt we have today, not \nafter the additional $500 billion, at a minimum, we will increase with \nthis new debt limit--will be an additional $640 billion per year added \nto the must-pays coming from Congress. Once that starts, if we have \nmade none of the adjustments, none of the changes, none of the choices \nof eliminating some of our wasteful and profligate spending, the next \nyear it adds another $150 billion on top of that. So then we would be \nat $700-some billion, and pretty soon we will be in a spiral where the \ndebt bomb explodes. That is the last place we want to go. The reason it \nis the last place we want to go is because the very wealthy aren't \ngoing to be harmed by that. The middle class will be destroyed, and \nwith all the programs we have to support the lower class, we will not \neven be able to fund those.\n  It is imperative we no longer just have words. It is time for us to \nact. I know the administration doesn't agree with that. I know a lot of \nmy colleagues on the other side do agree with it but will not offer up \nthe courage that is going to be required to make the tough choices in \nthis country.\n  We just increased tax rates in this country $600 billion over the \nnext 10 years.\n  I voted for that bill. But the problem isn't revenues; the problem is \nthe size and scope of the Federal Government.\n  I want to spend a little bit of time showing you what the GAO--not \nTom Coburn, not my oversight, not my research, but what the GAO has \nsaid about where we are in terms of stupidity and duplication. I asked \npermission for these oversized charts because the detail behind them \ncannot be seen unless you have it on a chart this size. I will go \nthrough these rather quickly so the American people can get a little \nbit of a flavor of the programs we have.\n  We have 15 different programs run by 13 different agencies in the \nFederal Government that cost $30 million to teach financial literacy to \nthe American people. No. 1, I don't think that falls within the \nenumerated powers. But let's assume it does. Why in the world would we \nhave 15 sets of administrators, 15 sets of overhead, to spend $30 \nmillion? It makes no sense whatsoever. Let's assume that is a role for \nthe Federal Government. I disagree that it is. But why not one program? \nIf you take away the overhead, you could spend exactly the same amount \nof money teaching financial literacy and you wouldn't waste it on \noverhead. The savings just from this one simple program are $15 million \nto $20 million a year. The way you get to 1 billion is 1 million at a \ntime, and the way you get to 1 trillion is 1 billion at a time.\n  Let's take the next program, green buildings. We have 94 separate \nprograms run by 11 different agencies spending $1 billion on green \nbuildings. There is nothing wrong with incentivizing green buildings, \nbut anybody with any common sense has to ask the question, Why does the \nFederal Government need 94 separate programs to incentivize green \nbuildings? And why do we need to run it through 11 different agencies \ninstead of 1? And why do we need to have 11 sets of overhead, \nadministration, and costs associated with it? It makes no sense at all.\n  The next one, housing assistance. We have 160 programs. Nobody in the \nadministration--nobody in the country--knows all the programs. I am \nprobably the only one in Congress who does, because nobody else has \nlooked at it. Twenty different agencies spending $170 billion. If we \nare really interested in housing assistance, why would we have 20 sets \nof overhead and 20 sets of administration? And what would it cost to \naccomplish the same thing?\n  All these numbers come from the Government Accountability Office, by \nthe way. They don't come from me.\n  The other part of the report is that nobody knows if these programs \nare working. We have no data to say that with the 160 programs we are \nactually making a difference on housing assistance through this \nexpenditure of money. So we are not even asking the most basic \nquestions a prudent person would ask--in fact, if it is our role in \nhousing assistance--do we know what we are doing is working? And the \nGAO says you can't tell. There are no metrics on it. No wonder we have \n160 programs. Because the first time somebody sees there is another \nneed out there, rather than reform and oversight the programs we have, \nwe create another one without ever looking at our housing programs.\n  Department of Justice grants. The Department of Justice is the only \nagency in the Federal Government where if they don't spend all their \nmoney every year, they get to keep it. Most people don't know that. \nThey have 253 different grant programs, and outside of the Department \nof Justice are 9 other agencies involved in that. Most of these grant \nprograms have no metrics, no measurement on them whatsoever to say \nwhether they are actually accomplishing the purpose Congress created \nthem for in the first place.\n  So if, in fact, a prudent person would say, We have these grant \nprograms, what are they doing, what are they supposed to do, and how \nare they measuring up, we don't know, because we don't require the \nFederal Government to measure the effectiveness of its programs.\n  If, in fact, it is a legitimate role for the Department of Justice \nand these 10 other agencies to grant taxpayer dollars to all sorts of \nState-based criminal defense--prison, police force, investigative--if, \nin fact, that is a Federal role--which, again, I would go back to the \nConstitution and the enumerated powers and ask the question, and I \nthink about half of these would fail. But if it is, why would we have \nthis many different grant programs? Why would we have this much \noverhead? Why would we have absolutely zero measurement on whether they \nare actually accomplishing their goal?\n  Where we have been so far, just so we know, we have $176 billion \nworth of spending that is wastefully spent. It is duplicative, one \noverlaps the other, and we have no knowledge whatsoever about what we \nare doing. We know from our heart we are trying to accomplish good, but \nwe have no capability to measure what we are doing. And that is just \nthe first four.\n  Look at diesel emissions. We all want clean air. Why would we have 14 \nseparate programs on diesel emissions run through 3 different agencies? \nWhy not have three--one for agriculture, one for routine surface \ntransportation, and one for stationary? That is all there is out there. \nThere is transportation, there is agriculture, and there is stationary, \nand yet we have five times as many grant programs as we have \nutilization.\n  I hope America can see how incompetent we are as we allow all these \nthings to continue.\n  We are going to raise the borrowing against your children. In less \nthan a week we are going to raise the borrowing against your children, \nand we are not going to do anything to fix these problems. Nothing.\n  Early learning and childcare. We have 50 different programs, 9 \ndifferent agencies on which we spend $16 billion.\n  Employment assistance for disabled individuals. This is job training \nfor disabled people. Fifty different programs run through nine \ndifferent agencies, and we are going to spend $16 billion. I think that \nis an appropriate thing for us to be involved in, but why in the world \nwould we have 50 different training programs for the disabled? \nNobody can answer that. There won't be a person come to the floor and \nanswer the question of why we have 50.\n\n  What we continue to do is treat the symptoms of our disease and not \nthe real disease. We are going to argue we should have training \nprograms for the disabled, but we are going to deny the fact that the \ntraining programs for the disabled that we have oftentimes are \nmarginally working. And if we streamline them and focus them, we would \nget a whole lot more value for our money, and we would also save money \njust in the overhead associated with it.\n  Surface transportation programs, 55, and 5 different agencies. We \nhave a transportation bill every year. It is $43\n\n[[Page S394]]\n\nbillion. And yet we take that money--which, by the way, isn't being \nadequately funded. We are stealing from other things to keep the \ntransportation funding alive, and we run it through all this \nbureaucracy rather than say, We took the money from the States, it is \nfor highways and mass transit, and give it back to them and let them \nprioritize it themselves. Instead, we consume a good portion of it \nhere. We put all sorts of mandates on what they can and can't do with \ntheir own money that we collect from them and send it back to them, and \nthen we run it through five different Federal agencies. So they are \njumping through five agencies' hoops just to be able to spend their own \nmoney--their own tax money.\n  Support of entrepreneurs. I can guarantee you this one doesn't fit in \nthe enumerated powers of the Constitution.\n  So we have 53 times that we have said, We don't care what the \nConstitution says, we are going to go out and support our \nentrepreneurs. It is not a role for the Federal Government. We are \nterrible at it. We don't know what we are doing at it. And yet we have \n53 programs run through 4 agencies, $2.6 billion a year, and the vast \nmajority of it is waste and ineffectively spent.\n  STEM education programs. This is science, technology, engineering, \nand math. It is an area we need to work on. It is an area we need to \nincentivize. But 209 different programs, 100 or more of which are in \nthe Defense Department? Two hundred nine programs to incentivize \nscience, technology, engineering, and math? How about a couple of them \nthat really work, that really create the incentives people will really \ngo after that you can really manage and measure whether they are \neffective--$3.1 billion a year.\n  This is just the first of what the GAO has so far outlined, at the \nrequest of my office, which became a law which forced GAO to have to do \nit.\n  Just a little history on this. Three years ago I asked the Government \nAccountability Office and Congressional Research Services, Tell me \nevery program in the Federal Government. And both of them said, \nImpossible; we can't do it. The Congressional Research Service said: We \ncan't do it. We do not have the capability to do it.\n  So I put into statute a law mandating that the Government \nAccountability Office over a period of 3 years will identify and seek \nout every Federal program, and notify Congress where they overlap. So \nthat is how we have gotten this information thus far. In April of this \nyear, we will get the last third. There is no doubt in my mind at all \nthat we are wasting at least $200 billion a year through duplication \ncoming from the Federal Government.\n  Think about that for a minute. If I am right--and I dare anybody to \ncome down here and challenge me on it--that is $2 trillion over the \nnext 10 years. That is 18 percent of our deficit this year.\n  The question you have to ask is, Where is Congress? Why aren't they \ndoing something about this? We passed one bill out of the Senate in the \nlast 3 years associated with this--it got thrown out in conference--\nthat saved $5 billion. We could easily save $20 billion to $30 billion \nwith minimal work.\n  I know it is much greater than that. There will be controversy as you \ngo up. But the fact that we have done nothing addressing these issues \ntells you that there is a problem in Congress in terms of facing \nreality.\n  It also tells you there is a problem in Congress in that the \npolitical is much more important than the country; that we dare not \noffend anybody who is a partaker of any of these programs, especially \nthe people who are employed in the administration in the implementation \nof these programs--even though some programs have 250 or 209 \nduplications.\n  We have met the enemy, and the enemy is the U.S. Senate and the U.S. \nCongress.\n  Let me go to the next list.\n  Unmanned aircraft programs. There is no question in terms of our \nwarfighting and our intelligence services that our unmanned capability \nhas been a tremendous asset to us. But somebody needs to ask the \nquestion, Why do we have 15 different sets of programs run from 5 \ndifferent agencies costing us $37 billion over 5 years? Where is the \nexplanation for that? Where is the idea that we might concentrate \nexpertise in one or two areas or three areas or four? But to have 15 \nseparate programs means we are wasting money and getting less out of \nthe research and less out of the dollars we invested than if we were to \nstreamline those programs and limit them to targeted objectives. But we \nrefuse to do that.\n\n  Domestic food assistance, 18 different programs, 3 agencies; homeless \nprograms, 21 different programs, 7 agencies, $2.9 billion; \ntransportation services for transportation-disadvantaged persons--that \nis something we ought to be involved in. I don't have any problem with \nthat. But 80 programs, each with their own overhead, each with their \nown set of rules that communities have to comply with? Why would we not \nwant to say: How do we make this 20 programs, make it more effective, \neliminate the overhead and save the difference? We don't have to cut \nmoney. What we have to do is save money, and we could have exactly the \nsame result through efficiency and smart planning by eliminating \nduplication.\n  In my hometown there are 78 different programs for transportation for \nthese people that they can access, lapping over each other. It is not \nthat we should not be doing it, but what about the saving? Are we in a \ncrunch or not? Are we going to continue to stick our heads in the sand \nand say we don't have a difficult time in front of us in terms of our \nfinancing the basic needs for our Federal Government?\n  We are less than 8 years away, where Medicare, Medicaid, Social \nSecurity, and interest on the debt will consume every penny of tax \nrevenue this country has. That is less than 8 years away, if we make it \nthat long, before we have hyperinflation. Why would we in Congress not \nstart addressing these very real needs?\n  Job training and employment--47 different programs, $18 billion a \nyear, 9 different agencies. In the House subcommittee, Chairwoman \nVirginia Foxx, last year, I think, took about 35 of these programs and \nconverted them into 6. She did not look at all of them because she did \nnot have the authority or jurisdiction in her committee. It is the only \nthing that has been done in the last 3 years that addresses anything \nthe GAO has said. Yet we will not even take it up. Saving billions of \ndollars a year and improving the job training programs, yet we will not \ntake it up. It is not a priority for the HELP Committee.\n  Teacher quality--82 different programs. We have 82 programs to \nimprove the quality of teachers. Remember, we have a Department of \nEducation, but nine other agencies have teacher improvement programs. \nWhy would we have agencies outside the Department of Education running \nteacher improvement programs? Is it because some Congressman or Senator \nwanted a program named after them? Maybe they saw a need and did not \nwant to put it in with the other ones so we expanded it. So we expanded \noverhead and we expanded the costs and we decreased the efficiency.\n  I would also make note that Thomas Jefferson, in his inaugural \naddress, addressed the American people when it came to the Federal \nGovernment and education. Here is what he said: In order for the \nFederal Government to be involved in education, you must make an \namendment to the United States Constitution.\n  I don't know a greater authority, other than maybe Madison and \nMonroe, on the Constitution. But here is one of the authors. In his own \ninaugural address as President of the United States, he said we have no \nbusiness being in education. Just so I might enlighten my colleagues \nand the American people, since the Department of Education was founded, \nwe have spent in excess of $2 trillion of Federal taxpayer money, and \nthere is not one parameter that we can measure that is better than when \nwe started. Not one--we cannot find one parameter that is better than \nwhen we started.\n  So there was wisdom in our Founders. We have great hearts, but we are \nnot very good at some things, and this is one of them that we are not \nvery good at. Yet here we have 82 different programs from 10 different \nagencies.\n  Food safety--a legitimate role for the Federal Government. We have \ndone\n\n[[Page S395]]\n\nsome work improving food safety in the last few years, but we have \nmultiple agencies. Do you realize if you buy a cheese pizza that the \nFDA doesn't have any control over that, but if you buy a meat pizza the \nFDA controls the food quality? But the cheese pizza, that is not FDA. \nSo the Agriculture Department takes care of one pizza and the FDA takes \ncare of another one. Does that make any sense to anybody in America? \nYet we do not have one agency totally responsible for food safety in \nthis country. Instead, we have 15 different agencies with 30 different \nprograms, and the cost of food goes up--not because we are markedly \nimproving food safety, but we are markedly increasing the regulations \nand requirements from 15 different agencies. There are all sorts of \nhidden costs in this as well.\n  Military and veterans health service. I want you to think about this \nfor a minute. We have a Pentagon and we have a Veterans' \nAdministration, two agencies. But we have four different agencies \ninvolved in veterans and military health care. Why is that? Can anybody \nexplain that? What is the purpose of that? Why do we have three \ndifferent sets of rules and regulations within the Pentagon for health \ncare: one for the Army, one for the Navy, and one for the Air Force? \nAll of them are different. They are still taking care of the same \ndiseases among the same group of people, but we are a bureaucracy. \nRather than one organization running that we have three giant \norganizations running that. How stupid is that? Is that pride of \nkeeping everything within the Air Force or in the Navy or in the Army?\n  When we are facing a $1.3 trillion deficit this year--that is what it \nis going to be at a minimum--why would we not streamline that? Why \nwouldn't we ask the hard questions? Why wouldn't we do the things \naligned with common sense and prudence instead of a political spoils \nsystem?\n  Economic development--4 different agencies, 80 separate programs, \ntons of waste, tons of duplication, tons of overlap, tons of fraud. \nWhen we have 80 programs, or 85 programs, and the bureaucracies cannot \nmanage them, the gamers come in. The Federal Government this year will \ncreate over $800 billion worth of grants. I want us to think about that \nfor a minute. Somewhere between one-fourth and one-fifth of our budget \nwill go out of here in terms of grants. There is only one agency that \noversees their grants effectively and smartly. The rest of the grants \nare totally not overseen--effectively. We work at it a little bit.\n  If we think about it, one-fifth of the Federal budget is run out of \nWashington in terms of grants that have requirements on them, that have \ntime lines on them, that have specifics on them, and nobody is watching \nthem.\n  Do you know what happens when you go to look at those? What you find \nis fraud, mismanagement, some accomplishing exactly what they were \nsupposed to but not in the time, some underbudget, but the money never \ngets sent back to the Federal Government; some grant money that is sent \nout and a penny is never spent, and it is lost out there so it is never \nrecaptured. There are hundreds of billions of dollars of grant money \nsitting out there that have never been used and never been pulled back \nto the Federal Government. Why is that? That means hundreds of billions \nof dollars that we are going to borrow because we have moneys that we \ndo not manage effectively.\n\n  Let me just do the third one, and I will wind up in a little bit, and \nI will come back tomorrow and talk about the details of these. Here is \nthe third sheet. I suspect when we get the report, April 1, from the \nGAO, I will have another two sheets.\n  When we start adding up this money, we get real money. We get \nhundreds of billions of dollars that we are wasting. But nobody is \nworking on it.\n  Reducing reliance on petroleum fuel for the Federal fleet. We have 20 \nagencies working on that, but we only have 5 programs. So we have 20 \nsets of bureaucrats and administrations and everything else for 5 \nprograms, and we are spending--it is not a lot of money in terms of \nWashington money, but fuel efficiency for the Federal fleet? We put in \nnew CAFE standards. We could replace this $50 million and say, you \nwould not buy an automobile that doesn't have X mileage; you will limit \ntrips. We can do lots of management things to eliminate the need for a \nprogram like this just through sound management and proper management.\n  Electronic health records system for veterans and the military. The \nVA has a pretty good program. We have two different agencies, the VA \nand the military, the Pentagon. We have 10 separate programs. We are \nspending all this money at the Pentagon right now on electronic medical \nrecords when we have a system already at the VA that they could have \nadopted. Are we just doing one? No. We are doing different ones for \neach branch of the service.\n  It makes you want to throw your hands up and get sick to your stomach \nwhen you think about what we are doing today that we should stop doing \nso we protect the future of this country.\n  Here is an area that I have looked at closely, preparedness grants. \nRemember when FEMA was started 10, 11 years ago--maybe 15 years ago--\npreparedness grants, we built all this up so we could prepare for \ncatastrophes--right? We have been doing this a number of years, well \nover a decade, maybe almost two. Why do we continue to need more \npreparedness grants?\n  I have not done this yet, but we plan on going back to look at all \nthe money that has gone out for preparedness. But we just passed a \nSandy bill, and 64 percent of the money is going to be spent on \npreparedness and mitigation for the future on 50-year events. Yet we \nare continuing to spend money every year on preparedness. Is there ever \na time at which we get prepared, that we can stop spending money? That \nis a question the average American would probably ask: Is there a point \nin time when we have prepared enough? Or can we spend enough money to \ntotally prepare against anything? And, of course, the answer is no. So \nhow much is enough? How much is prudent, given our budget situation \ntoday.\n  Anyhow, I think you can see, just from this limited list of words--\nand this is just one section of what I am going to be talking about. \nDuplication. I am going to be talking about health care. I am going to \nbe talking about the Defense Department. Republicans have a blind eye \nto the waste in the Defense Department and the mismanagement and the \nduplication and the swinging revolving door from retired military \nofficers to the very companies that end up getting the contracts that \npay their salaries to get another contract to keep going on things that \nnecessarily are not priorities.\n  Let me just take an example for a moment, if I can. This is the best \none. Here is green buildings. Here are all the programs on green \nbuildings. Does any of that make sense? That is why we had to have a \nchart this big. What we are doing is absolutely asinine as far as \nduplication and what we are doing through multiple different \ndepartments in terms of incentivizing green buildings.\n\n  Just think if we had 5 or 10 people in the administration of each one \nof these programs and what we could save if we ended up just having 5 \nor 6 programs. Just think what the benefit would be that would inure \nthrough the years in terms of the compounded savings for our kids and \nyoung people in this country.\n  This chart depicts green buildings. The Institute of Standards and \nTechnology has three or four or five or six programs. The Department of \nHealth and Human Services has a multitude of programs. The Department \nof Agriculture has a multitude of programs. The Department of \nTransportation has multiple programs for green buildings. Why don't we \nhave a green building department in the Federal Government? If we have \nthat, we can just have one and save the overhead and the money. We can \nsee all the Environmental Protection Agency's programs on the chart. \nThis is lunacy. It is craziness.\n  I am going to stop at that, but I have this comment for my fellow \nOklahomans and fellow Americans: The next time you hear from a Member \nof the congress that we cannot cut spending, come and play this C-SPAN \ntape back for them. Either they don't want to or they know nothing \nabout management or efficiency or common sense. There is no longer an \nexcuse to say we cannot get marked savings from our Federal Government.\n\n[[Page S396]]\n\n  As I go through this over the next couple weeks, I am going to show \nexample after example. It is painful to say the greatest Nation in the \nworld is absolutely incompetent when it comes to managing its \nbureaucracy, its programs, and its money, but that is a true statement. \nI am going to show evidence over the next 2 weeks of just how \nincompetent we are.\n  I hope to build a case so no Member of Congress can ever tell a \nconstituent again that we cannot cut significant spending by at least \n$2 trillion just from duplication over the next 10 years.\n  The work of the government is hard. The work of the Congress is built \non compromise, but there is no longer going to be a bogus set of facts \nout there that says we cannot cut spending. I am going to prove we can \ncut spending and the onus is going to be on the rest of the Members of \nthe body to say why we cannot.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/30/senate-section/article/S396-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S396-S398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BUDGET AUSTERITY\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here because I was on the floor \nthe other day and I heard--while I was waiting my turn to speak--\nSenator Hatch give a speech. I have the very highest regard for my \nfriend, the Senator from Utah, and his speech was very thoughtful. It \nwas passionate. It was thorough. I thought it deserved a respectful \nresponse and so I am here to respond to that and I hope to begin a \ndebate or engage in a debate, if not begin it.\n  Senator Hatch was talking about the fiscal situation, and he framed \nhis remarks with the observation that our $16.4 trillion debt is too \nhigh and the observation that ``annual trillion-dollar deficits have \nbecome the norm with the current administration.''\n  Senator Hatch is certainly right that debt is too high and annual \ntrillion-dollar deficits have indeed briefly become the norm. But I \nwould suggest that is not the norm recently because of this \nadministration; it is the norm because the economy collapsed.\n  We all remember the economy collapsed. To withdraw Federal spending \nfrom a collapsing economy is only to make things worse. The economic \ncollapse created these deficits and, as the economy recovers, we can \ndraw them down.\n  There is not agreement on that. Some have preached austerity as the \nway forward when the economy collapses. When this began, there was \nlively debate between those who thought that stimulating the economy \nand supporting the economy would be more sensible than applying \nausterity. We are past theory and now we are into experience. The \nexperience of foreign countries belies that austerity works when \neconomies are collapsing. From Spain to Greece, European countries that \nresponded to the economic downturn by slashing their budgets are \nsuffering from shrinking economies and persistent double-digit \nunemployment rates.\n  A recent IMF, International Monetary Fund, report estimates that \nbudget austerity in a weak economy might actually inflict significant \nharm and have a much lower than expected effect on the deficit, \nconsistent with the observations in Europe.\n  The reason this is this way--I will get into jargon just for a \nminute--economists measure the effects of changes in government \nspending on GDP with a metric called the fiscal multiplier. A \nmultiplier of 0.5, for example, means that a $1 decrease in government \nspending would reduce GDP by 50 cents.\n  The higher the fiscal multiplier, the worse the impact a cut in \nspending has on the overall economy and, therefore, the lower its \nactual ultimate effect on deficit reduction.\n  The new IMF report suggests that in the United States--as in other \ncountries that are recovering from the great recession--the fiscal \nmultiplier is actually greater than 1, meaning that a $1 reduction in \ngovernment spending shrinks the overall economy by more than $1, doing \nnet harm.\n  Oxford Economics puts the fiscal multiplier of the United States at \n1.4, which means that for every $1 we cut, we would lose $1.40 in gross \ndomestic product. Goldman Sachs, which is not exactly a leftwing \noutfit, has put the multiplier for the United States close to 1.5--cut \n$1; lose $1.50 in gross domestic product. Economists at the University \nof California found that during recessions--and it is important, during \nrecessions--the fiscal multiplier in developed countries generally \nfalls between 1.5 and 2.\n  That complicated economic gobbledygook boils down to this: $1 in \nreduced government spending will reduce gross domestic product by more \nthan $1--by $1.40 or $1.70 or whatever the multiplier is--and damage \nthe economy without accomplishing the intended deficit reduction.\n  Other countries attempted budget austerity during the economic \ndownturn. Spain, Greece, and Portugal, particularly, have persistent \ndouble-digit unemployment--over 26 percent in Spain and Greece--and \nthey have anemic or negative economic growth rates. Contrast that with \nthe United States, where a more balanced approach to the economic \ncrisis yielded an unemployment rate that is still far too high but \nmarkedly lower than the austerity countries and economic growth of 2.1 \npercent, where all the other countries are experiencing negative \neconomic growth--Spain, Greece, and Portugal.\n  So let's not fault the President and the administration for deficits \nthat were caused by, A, an economic collapse and, B, the wise decision \nto avoid the austerity path that has thrown Spain and Greece into \nnearly 27 percent unemployment rates and all three countries into \nnegative GDP growth.\n  We will need to address the debt more and more as economic conditions \nimprove, and Senator Hatch was correct to point to health care expense \nas our biggest national fiscal concern. It would, however, I believe, \nbe a misdiagnosis to focus on Medicare and Medicaid as the source of \nthe health care spending problem. Indeed, Medicare may be the single \nmost efficient health care provider in our entire health care system. \nMedicare is a place where the health care cost problem hits the Federal \nbudget because the Federal budget pays for Medicare, but Medicare is \nnot the underlying source of the problem. I hope this was what Senator \nHatch meant when he said ``the problems with the program are \nsystemic,'' and when he said the solution is ``structural reforms.''\n  I know that one of the leading health care providers in the country, \none of the best at seeing the health care cost problem as systemic and \none of the best at addressing it with structural reforms, is the health \ncare system in Senator Hatch's home State of Utah, Intermountain \nHealthcare. The Senator has a living example at home that health care \nspending can be addressed through structural reforms, through delivery \nsystem reforms.\n  One example is that just a few weeks ago, Intermountain clinicians in \nUtah were recognized for their work in greatly reducing the number of \npatients who die from sepsis, which is the leading cause of death in \nU.S. hospitals. So it is no small matter. Through a new protocol to \nbetter detect and treat sepsis, these doctors and nurses brought the \ndeath rate for septic patients entering through the emergency room down \nfrom over 20 percent, 5 years ago, to under 9 percent. These advances \nhave saved hundreds of lives in Utah, and they are a model to be \napplied by hospitals around the world.\n  That is an example of how the real problem in health care is the \ntotal cost of the underlying system. We pay more for health care than \nany other developed nation. Here is the United States at 17.6 percent \nof our gross domestic product spent on health care. The most expensive \nand least efficient other industrialized nation in the world is the \nNetherlands at 12 percent. Behind it fall France and Germany at 11.6 \npercent, Switzerland at 11.4 percent, and England and Japan at 9.6 and \n9.5 percent, respectively.\n  If we could simply make our health care in this country as bad as the \nworst other industrialized country in terms of efficiency, if we could \njust meet the\n\n[[Page S397]]\n\nstandard met by the other least efficient country in the world, we \nwould save about $800 billion a year.\n  So there is a huge savings opportunity in the health care system for \nall of that extra spending. For that $800 billion a year in extra \nspending that we do, do we get great outcomes? Are Americans healthier \nand better cared for than people in those other countries? Well, \nunfortunately, the answer is not at all. Each little dot represents one \nof the OECD countries. This represents life expectancy from 72 to 84, \nwhich is a pretty good measure of how good the health care system is, \nif it is making you live longer.\n  This represents the cost per person of health care. As you can see, \nvirtually everybody is grouped kind of around in here, with reasonably \ngood life expectancy between 78 and 82. Japan has actually driven it up \nto 83. It is roughly $2,000 to $4,000 per individual.\n  Everybody--I can almost cover them all with my hand. This is the \nUnited States of America, below all of them in life expectancy, above \nall of them in cost. So let's not pretend there is not a lot of room \nfor progress.\n  The worst part is that this is the rate of growth of our U.S. health \ncare system. Look at this: 1960--I will astound the pages who are \nlistening by telling them that I was alive in 1960; I was 5 years old \nthen--$27.4 billion. Now it is $2.7 trillion. We spend 100 times as \nmuch on health care now as we did when I was 5 years old. We blew \nthrough the halfway point probably back in around 1990. We have doubled \nsince then to $2.7 trillion.\n  This is what is happening to our national health care costs. This is \nour national health care cost curve. If you think that with this kind \nof a rocketing cost structure, we are going to be able to solve this \nproblem by cutting Medicare, that is not going to work. Trying to solve \nthat kind of a cost-increase problem by cutting Medicare benefits is a \nlosing game. It will cut Medicare away to nothing.\n  We have to address the conditions that caused this increase. We have \nto address the discrepancy between us and other nations and, indeed, as \nthe Senator from Connecticut who is presiding well knows, the \ndiscrepancy between different States. His brother is one of the great \nexperts on the discrepancy that allows Medicare to pay 2\\1/2\\ times \nmore per patient in Miami than it does for a patient in Minneapolis, \nwhen the patient in Minneapolis is getting as good or better care.\n  We have to be able to get those discrepancies out of the system. When \nwe do, when we do it that way, the savings will fall to Medicare and \nMedicaid. Indeed, 40 percent of those savings will go into the Federal \nGovernment, Medicare, Medicaid, VA, TRICARE, employee benefits. It will \nalso help Blue Cross, Kaiser, and United. It will help all the private \ncompanies that pay for private insurance. It will help individuals who \nhave to pay for that skyrocketing cost now because we run a system that \nis 50 percent more inefficient than the least efficient industrialized \ncountry with which we compete.\n  So this is a big deal. It is not just me saying so; some very \ncredible folks agree. President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers \nsays that you can save annually out of our health care system $700 \nbillion. The National Institute of Medicine says it is $750 billion a \nyear. The New England Health Care Institute estimated that it was $850 \nbillion. And a well-regarded group that studies health care called the \nLewin Group, together with George Bush's Treasury Secretary Paul \nO'Neill, has estimated that it is $1 trillion a year in savings to be \nhad. So this would look a lot better if instead of $2.7 trillion you \nwere spending only $1.7 trillion. And those are the kinds of savings \nthat are conceivable, are possible. We really have to focus on that.\n  The Commonwealth Fund recently released a report that outlines a \nvariety of policies that would accelerate health care delivery system \nreform and slow health care spending by $2 trillion from 2014 to 2023. \nThose are the policy ideas we should be considering because those ideas \ngo to the real heart of the cost problem. Going after Medicare benefits \nrather than going directly after the underlying health care cost \nproblem reflects a misdiagnosis of the problem. When you have a \nmisdiagnosis of the problem, you get the cure wrong.\n  Senator Hatch was very thoughtful, and he offered some specific \nproposals. I think the proposals to combine deductibles for Parts A and \nB and the limitation on first-dollar coverage of Medigap plans could \nwell fit into a good health care compromise. I suggest we should also \ninclude letting Medicare use its substantial market power to negotiate \ndrug prices just as the VA now does. It is hard to imagine that our \ndeficit problem could be as dire as Senator Hatch has described and at \nthe same time less important than providing this notorious Federal \nhandout to immensely profitable pharmaceutical companies.\n  Finally, let me say that Senator Hatch indicated he thought the \nrevenue discussion was now done. I would respectfully disagree. The \nrevenue discussion is not done. To date, through the Budget Control Act \nand through other measures enacted in the last Congress, we have cut \nthe deficit by $2.4 trillion. In rough numbers, we have achieved $1.7 \ntrillion of that through spending cuts and then the related interest \nsavings. In contrast, we have only cut the deficit by $700 billion \nthrough new revenues, by restoring Clinton-era tax rates for the top 1 \npercent of income earners. That is what we have done so far.\n  I think it is probably safe to say the tax rate discussion is \nprobably done, but we have not even begun to discuss tax loopholes. Why \nshould millionaires get more tax benefits against their charitable \ncontributions than middle-class families do? Why should a billionaire \nwho builds a wing on a museum and puts his name on it get more tax bang \nfor his charitable buck than the middle-class family who gives to their \nlocal church? Is protecting that benefit for high-end charitable donors \nmore important than addressing our deficit?\n  How about tax subsidies to the most profitable companies in the \nworld, the Big Oil behemoths? The American taxpayers have to provide \nmoney to big and often foreign oil companies. Is keeping Big Oil \nlobbyists happy with subsidies from the American people more important \nthan addressing our deficit?\n  Should companies and wealthy individuals be allowed to hide their \nmoney from the tax man in offshore accounts, while working families pay \ntheir taxes fair and square? Is protecting that tax gimmick more \nimportant than addressing the deficit?\n  How about that carried interest trick that allows hedge fund \nbillionaires to treat their income as low-tax capital gains while their \nchauffeurs, gardeners, maids, and executive assistants pay regular \nincome taxes? Is it more important to keep that sweet deal running than \nit is to fix the deficit?\n  Our friends on the other side cannot have it both ways. They cannot \nsay that the deficit is so desperately important that we have to cut \nMedicare, cut food stamps, cut off scientific research, cut the FBI and \nthe national parks and Big Bird, for Lord's sake--that is how important \nthe deficit is--and then say that the deficit is not such a big deal \nafter all, that it is less important than tax breaks for offshore \ncorporations, special deals for the pharmaceutical industry, favors for \nhigh-income Americans that regular families do not get, and subsidies \nto Big Oil.\n  It cannot be both things at once. Frankly, even without the deficit, \nmany of those tax deals are the things we should get rid of just on the \nmerits, just because they are sleazy and unfair and the product of \nWashington insider dealing. We should be rid of them. They cannot be \nmore important to keep than addressing the deficit.\n  So while there are surely still ways to trim the deficit by improving \ninefficient programs and cutting wasteful spending, let's not say tax \nrevenue is done before we have even gotten into the rich trove of tax \ndeals and gimmicks that we give away every year through the Tax Code.\n  In 2012, corporations benefited from an estimated $127 billion in \nloopholes and special provisions. In addition, the individual income \ntax code permitted over $1 trillion in deductions, exclusions, and \ncredits last year--$1 trillion in 1 year. Many of those only benefit \nthe wealthiest taxpayers. Overall, there are hundreds of billions of \ndollars a year in tax expenditures that we can use to address the \ndeficit.\n  My last point on revenues is this: As our friend Kent Conrad, the \nformer\n\n[[Page S398]]\n\nchairman of the Budget Committee, used to point out, every time in \nrecent history that we have had a balanced budget, we balanced it with \nrevenues and spending around 20 percent of gross domestic product. Our \nrevenues are now at about 16 percent of gross domestic product. If we \nbalanced our budget at that level, at 16 percent of gross domestic \nproduct, it would be the lowest level of Federal spending since 1951, \nwhen half of the Federal budget still went to the Department of Defense \nand half of American seniors still lived in poverty.\n  They say the Republican Party wants to go backward, but do they \nreally want to go back to that? That would change our country \ndramatically and for the worse at a time when, even with Federal \nstudent aid, the cost of college remains unaffordable for too many \naspiring students, when our energy and technology infrastructure is \nlagging and our transportation infrastructure is crumbling, and when \nour international competitors are making greater investments in 21st \ncentury innovation than we are.\n  Saving money by reforming how we deliver health care is not just \npossible, it is happening around us. A 2008 report from the Dartmouth \nAtlas Project held up some promising examples, predicting that, using \nthe Mayo Clinic as a benchmark, the Nation could reduce health care \nspending by as much as 30 percent for acute and chronic illnesses. A \nbenchmark based on Senator Hatch's home State company, Intermountain \nHealthcare, predicts a reduction of more than 40 percent.\n  So let's get to work, together in a bipartisan fashion, to give \nAmerican families the health care system they deserve.\n  Instead of waste and inefficiency, poor outcomes and missed \nopportunities, let's have a health care system that is the envy of the \nworld, not an outlier on high costs and low results.\n  This approach has a triple benefit: It protects seniors and families \nwho rely on Medicare and Medicaid. It improves patient outcomes and \nmakes our experience of the health care system better in terms of \nresults, and it dials back health care spending and helps protect us \nfrom that exploding cost.\n  The alternative, slashing benefits, does nothing to curb the \nunderlying cost problem, and it certainly doesn't improve care. It only \ndoes one thing, harms seniors and degrades the programs they count on.\n  During a 2011 Senate HELP Committee hearing that I chaired, Greg \nPoulsen of Utah's Intermountain Healthcare said:\n  Intermountain and other organizations have shown that improving \nquality is compatible with lowering costs and, indeed, high-quality \ncare is generally less expensive than substandard care.\n  Let this be our guiding principle as we work together to ease the \nburden of excessive health costs on both the Federal balance sheet and \non our fellow Americans' pocketbooks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/30/senate-section/article/S398-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, I rise to honor a man of great distinction \nand valor: Maj. Jaime I. Hernandez of the United States Air Force. It \nis my great honor to acknowledge this American hero on the cusp of his \npromotion to Lieutenant Colonel.\n  Jaime is a loving son and a man of perseverance. A loyal Nevadan and \nAmerican, he hails from Las Vegas. Upon graduating from Bonanza High \nSchool in 1994, Jaime entered the Air Force Academy, where he began his \nnoble service to our Nation.\n  Major Hernandez's promotion to Lieutenant Colonel marks another \nchapter in his inspiring story. Major Hernandez has risen through the \nranks during his time with the Air Force--a testament to his steadfast \ndedication, unyielding courage, and impressive tactical skill. His \ncareer is a decorated one. Major Hernandez has served six combat \ndeployments in support of operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, logging \nmore than 2900 hours in flight, 1300 of which were in combat. His work \nas Chief of Weapons and Tactics for the 37th Expeditionary Bomb \nSquadron led to hundreds of successful missions. He has proven himself \ntime and again through his B-1 aircraft expertise.\n  During one of his six overseas deployments, Major Hernandez earned an \nAir Medal with 4 Oak Leaf Clusters. While on a mission to safeguard a \nlost team of Marines in eastern Afghanistan, Jaime and his crew were \nfired on by a team of insurgents on the ground. In an act of bravery \nand skill, Jaime and his aerial crew drew fire from the insurgents \nwhile the lost Marine ground team could recover and maneuver around the \ninsurgent squad.\n  Major Hernandez has demonstrated repeatedly his exceptional skill and \ncourage. He has flown across the desert skies of both Iraq and \nAfghanistan, to provide support for operations there. Over the course \nof his career, he has served as a squadron Electronic Warfare Officer, \nFlight Commander, Instructor and Evaluator Weapon Systems Officer, Wing \nWeapons Officer, and Instructor at the USAF Weapons School.\n  Major Hernandez is currently the Deputy Division Chief at Joint Base \nLangley-Eustis, and is responsible for policies and procedures relating \nto the Combat Air Forces Information Operations. Among other \nachievements, he graduated in the top third of his class from Squadron \nOfficer's School and received an Outstanding Flying Award from the U.S. \nAir Force Weapons School.\n  I laud Maj. Jaime I. Hernandez's dedication to the United States Air \nForce and country. His father Phillip Hernandez and their family are \nhappy to celebrate Major Hernandez's upcoming promotion on February 1, \n2013, to Lieutenant Colonel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/30/senate-section/article/S398-3", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S398-S399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ROBERT MITCHELL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear \nfriend of mine and a distinguished citizen of the Commonwealth of \nKentucky, Mr. Robert Mitchell. Mr. Mitchell--better known across \nKentucky's Fifth Congressional District as Bob--recently received the \nWilliam Hacker, M.D. 2013 Leader of the Year Award from Kentucky's \nLeadership Tri-County. This organization, which represents Laurel, \nKnox, and Whitley counties, recognized Bob for his decades of service \nto the Bluegrass State.\n  From 1986 until his retirement last year, Bob served as Congressman \nHal Rogers's district administrator for the Fifth District. In that \njob, he was Hal's eyes and ears throughout southern and eastern \nKentucky. He oversaw three field offices, provided constituent \nservices, and was Hal's liaison to State and local government. It is \nthanks to him that many people in Kentucky now enjoy the benefits of a \nmultitude of infrastructure, economic development, and tourism \nprojects.\n  Bob has also served as Hal's top political adviser and campaign \nmanager, and was his field representative from 1981 to 1986. He has \nserved on the executive committee of the Republican Party of Kentucky, \nbeen a delegate to Republican National Conventions, and was twice \nelected magistrate in Knox County.\n  Bob's father, the late Murrell Mitchell, also served as a magistrate \nof Knox County and was a member of the Knox County School Board. It was \nhe who inspired Bob to seek fulfillment in public service. A graduate \nof Lynn Camp High School in Corbin, KY, Bob first served his country in \nthe uniform of the U.S. Army. He was in the Army's military police and \nserved in Vietnam.\n  Bob has been employed in the private sector, too: He has worked for \nL Railroad, United Parcel Service, and as the owner and operator of a \ngrocery store. He has been a member of the Corbin Rotary Club and the \nLynn Camp Optimist Club. And the Mountain Laurel Boy Scouts of America \nDistrict honored him with its first-ever Daniel Boone Visionary Award.\n  Bob enjoys politics, obviously, as well as fishing and following \ncollege sports. He is an avid fan of Keeneland Race Course and has \nowned racehorses. But I believe what he is most looking forward to is \nspending more time with\n\n[[Page S399]]\n\nhis family and spoiling his grandkids. Bob and his wife, Nancy, have \ntwo daughters: Stephanie Alsip lives in Louisville with her husband \nRick and their two sons, Trenton and Ethan. Jennifer Mitchell lives in \nCorbin with her two daughters, Tori Beth and Taelor Jade.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to join me in \nsaluting Mr. Robert Mitchell for over three decades of service to the \npeople of my State. He is admired and respected across the Commonwealth \nas an ambassador, not just for Congressman Rogers, but for everything \nwe're proud of in southern and eastern Kentucky. I wish Bob well in his \nretirement, and I rest assured he will find success in whatever \nendeavors lie ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/30/senate-section/article/S399-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 177.

A bill to prevent gun trafficking; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of the \nmillions of Americans who are saying: Enough is enough. They have seen \ntoo much senseless deadly gun violence and are demanding commonsense \nsolutions out of Congress.\n  One solution I have been focused on for a long time is ending gun \ntrafficking. This is a critically important public safety issue where I \nbelieve Members of both sides of the aisle can come together and agree. \nWe can and should agree that it is time to crack down on the black \nmarket of illegal guns that criminals rely upon to obtain weapons that \nare later used in violent crimes.\n  Almost 1 month ago, the NYPD suffered one of its bloodiest nights in \nhistory when three officers suffered gunshot wounds in two separate \ncrimes an hour apart. According to news reports, one of the handguns \nrecovered from the scene was imported by traffickers from Philadelphia, \nand one came from North Carolina. Thankfully, these heroes are on their \nway toward recovery.\n  Just 1 year ago, New York police officer Peter Figoski, the father of \nfour beautiful girls, was tragically killed on the beat with an illegal \nweapon purchased on the black market in Virginia.\n  I will never forget the faces of slain 17-year-old honor student \nNyasia Pryear-Yard's parents whom I met just weeks after being sworn \ninto the Senate. Nyasia was also killed by an illegal gun one terrible \nnight when she was doing nothing more than enjoying an evening with \nfriends.\n  According to the New York City's mayor's office, 85 percent of the \nguns used in crimes in New York City come from out of State, and 90 \npercent of those guns are bought through the illegal black market run \nby traffickers. The sad fact is more than 30 people die every single \nday due to gun violence. These senseless killings must stop.\n  We have an obligation to act and prevent tomorrow's senseless deaths \nby ensuring that guns stay out of the hands of criminals, and the \ndangerously mentally ill, and to strengthen our laws so that law \nenforcement has the ability to go after the gunrunners and take down \nthese illegal markets.\n  The truth is that supporting the second amendment and reducing gun \nviolence are compatible and consistent. Responsible gun owners \nvehemently oppose the kind of gun violence that struck Newtown, Aurora, \nOak Creek, and to thousands of families across America every single \nyear who suffer. We should be able to find reasonable and commonsense \nreforms that can preserve our rights but also protect our families.\n  Keeping our children safe from the scourge of gun violence is not a \nDemocratic or Republican principle, it is not pro-gun or anti-gun. This \nis an issue that all Americans can support. There is no political \nideology that finds this cruel loss of life acceptable. I was \nincredibly pleased to see President Obama include as part of his \ncomprehensive plan to prevent gun violence a bill that I first \nintroduced in 2009 with Mayor Bloomberg and Commissioner Kelly, called \nthe Gun Trafficking Prevention Act, which would be the first Federal \nlaw to define gun trafficking as a Federal crime and prevent scores of \nillegal guns from being moved into the hands of criminals.\n  We have thousands of laws, but effectively none of them are directly \nfocused on preventing someone from driving from one State to another \nState with a load of guns in the back of a truck that they can sell \ndirectly to criminals.\n  It is shocking to me as a mother. It is shocking to me as a lawmaker. \nBut this is something that we can actually fix.\n  Over the past 3 fiscal years, more than 33,000 guns used in violent \ncrimes showed telltale signs of black market trafficking, 420,000 \nfirearms were stolen, and thousands of guns with obliterated serial \nnumbers were recovered by law enforcement. While law enforcement is \nworking overtime to track down illegal guns and apprehend those who \ntraffic these weapons, current law restricts their ability to \ninvestigate and prosecute these crimes. We may all agree this simply \nmakes no sense and leaves all our communities vulnerable.\n  I am very proud to have worked with my colleague and friend Senator \nMark Kirk to introduce a bipartisan bill today, S. 179. This bill takes \nthe problem of gun trafficking head on. Our bipartisan bill would \nempower local, State, and Federal law enforcement to investigate and \nprosecute gun traffickers, straw purchasers, and their entire criminal \nnetworks. Our bill does nothing to affect the constitutionally \nprotected rights of responsible, law-abiding gun owners.\n  By cracking down on illegal trafficking and their vast criminal \nnetworks, we can stop the flow of these illegal guns that are coming \ninto our city neighborhoods and reduce gun violence. Law enforcement \nofficials across the country have said they need this legislation to be \nable to fight crime.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I urge passage of this \ncommonsense, nonpartisan, bipartisan piece of legislation.\n Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Gun \nTrafficking Prevention Act of 2013, which I am proud to have introduced \nwith Senator Gillibrand (D-NY) this morning. There are an estimated \n33,000 gangs with 1.4 million active members who live in our \nneighborhoods, towns and cities across the United States. With more \nthan 100,000 gang members, the city of Chicago has more gang members \nwho terrorize its residents than any other city in the United States. \nThe Chicago Crime Commission also reported the existence of an \nadditional 15,000 gang members operating in our suburbs.\n  Gangs like the Vice Lords, Gangster Disciples and the Latin Kings are \nresponsible for nearly 80 percent of the city's homicides, which just \nlast summer amounted to 500 deaths in Chicago. These homicides are most \noften perpetrated with illegal weapons. Law enforcement officers in \nChicago confiscate an average of 13,000 illegal weapons each year. It \nmust end.\n  That is why I have joined with Senator Gillibrand of New York to take \nserious action to prevent weapons trafficking and straw purchasing, \nwhere a third-party member legally purchases a firearm, then sells or \ntrades it to a criminal who is legally barred from purchasing such a \nweapon. Our bill would be the first Federal law to criminalize the \ntrafficking of illegal guns. This legislation also calls upon the \nsentencing commission to substantially increase the penalties for \ntrafficking when committed by or in concert with gang members.\n  The Gun Trafficking Prevention Act keeps Americans safe by giving law \nenforcement the tools it needs to crack down on straw purchases, \norganizers of trafficking rings, and those involved in the conspiracy \nof trafficking while protecting the constitutional rights of \nresponsible, law-abiding gun owners. I hope my colleagues will join me \nin supporting and quickly passing this critical legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Begich):\n\n[[Page S403]]\n\n  S. 181. A bill to authorize the establishment of the Niblack and \nBokan Mountain mining area road corridors in the State of Alaska, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would potentially help in solving a significant unemployment \nproblem in my home state of Alaska. Today, joined by my colleague, \nSenator Mark Begich, I reintroduce the Niblack-Bokan Mountain Mining \nArea Road Authorization Act to permit road access to two proposed \nmulti-mineral mines on southeast Prince of Wales Island in Southeast \nAlaska.\n  Prince of Wales Island, formerly the main area for timber activity in \nSoutheast Alaska, has fallen on hard times during the past decade. In \n1990, when Alaska's timber industry in total harvested more than 1.1 \nbillion board feet of timber, Prince of Wales was the center of \nactivity. In 1994, for example, timber jobs accounted for 32.8 percent \nof all wages on the island. Six years later, with total regional \nharvests having fallen to about 350 million board feet, timber \naccounted for less than 19.8 percent of wages on the island, according \nto the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development. Today, \nwith total harvests of timber being just above 100 million board feet a \nyear in the region, just 35 million board feet being harvested from \nfederal lands in 2011 and just about 50 mmbf sold in 2012, and timber \njobs statewide having fallen from about 4,000 to just over 400, Prince \nof Wales has been particularly hard hit. According to the State, timber \njobs have fallen by more than 1,700 positions on the island.\n  As of November of last year, the unemployment rate on the island was \n``down'' to 12.1 percent, compared to 13.8 percent in November 2011, \npartly because of the outmigration of some of the unemployed. Those \nrates are nearly 5 percent higher than the national average.\n  While the Viking Lumber Co. of Klawock remains the largest private-\nsector timber employer on the island, the island, the third largest in \nthe United States, is badly in need of new employment opportunities. \nFortunately today's high metal prices are encouraging a resurgence of \nmineral development on the 2,231 square-mile island.\n  Currently, Heatherdale Minerals of Canada is considering reopening \nthe Niblack Mine, a gold, copper, zinc and silver deposit. The company \nis in advanced exploration and development study of the estimated 9 \nmillion-ton mine, forecast to cost $150 million to $200 million to \nreopen. The mine, likely to last at least 12 years, is forecast to \nproduce 1,500 tons of ore per day and require 130 workers at the mine \nsite, and another 60 to 70 at a processing mill, which could be located \nnear the site, or perhaps in Ketchikan, AK, 40 vessel miles away.\n  The Niblack property is also close to another mineral deposit that is \nin the advanced stages of economic feasibility review, the Bokan \nMountain Rare Earth Elements, REE, mine. Bokan Mountain, being \nconsidered for opening by Ucore Inc. of Canada, likely will employ 170 \nworkers. It, too, will involve an investment of $221 million for the \nmine and processing plant to process the heavy rare earths, REEs, that \nthe site contains. Both mines currently estimate they could be open \nwithin three to four years, depending on final economic reviews and \ncurrent permit approval timeframes. Bokan Mountain is located about 28 \nair miles south of Niblack and can be accessed by boat by traveling \ndown the relatively protected Moira Sound to the end of South Arm, or \nby an about 50-mile road that would branch off of a road to the Niblack \nmine.\n  The two mines could produce substantial numbers of high-paying jobs \nfor the residents of southern Southeast Alaska. Niblack, for example, \npredicts the average salary for mine workers at its facility will be \n$80,000 a year, compared to the current median income in Craig of \n$48,594 a year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The problem of \ngetting those jobs to people who need them is one of logistics.\n  There currently is no road access to reach either mine site, both \nlikely to be supplied by boat from Ketchikan, AK. That means that \npotential workers on Prince of Wales Island will need to travel by boat \nor more likely by airplane to Ketchikan, in order to turn around and \ntake a mine boat back to the island to report for work, a costly, time-\nconsuming, often unpleasant and sometimes dangerous process given sea \nconditions in Southeast Alaska. Or they will need to pilot their own \nsmall boats to the mine site, a hazardous process given that reaching \nNiblack from the community of Thorne Bay to the north, a site that is \nlocated on the island's road system, will require a daily 60-mile one-\nway boat trip down perilous Clarence Strait, a difficult water body \nduring fall, winter and spring storms, when seas can easily top 17 feet \nwaves.\n  But the problem could be solved, if a road could be extended the \nroughly 29 miles to connect the Niblack mine, by means of existing \nlogging roads, to the state highway system on the island. Such a road \nwill involve at least 2.5 miles of logging road reconstruction and the \nconstruction of 26.3 miles of new road. Those roads, if built to \nexisting logging road standards, are estimated to cost $7.075 million, \nthe cost certainly rising if the roads are built to Federal Aid Urban \nHighway standards. The issue is that 18.3 miles of that new \nconstruction is across federal lands in the Tongass National Forest \nand, more importantly, across areas classified as inventoried roadless \nunder the 2001 U.S. Forest Service roadless rule, as it was reimposed \non the Tongass in 2009.\n  Looking at the topography of the area, located inside the Eudora \ninventoried roadless area, the road would begin at the Haida, Hydaburg, \nNative village corporation's West, Cholmondeley, Arm sort yard and head \nSoutheast through the Big Creek Valley and climb to a mountain pass at \nthe roughly 1,400-foot elevation. From there it will drop onto land \nowned by the Kootznoowoo Native village corporation of Angoon and \nfollow existing logging roads that lie on the western side of the South \nArm. The route then runs south and parallels South Arm on the west side \nuntil the southern end of the bay is reached. Then the route follows \nthe shoreline of the south end of the South Arm until the far southeast \ncorner of the bay is reached, the location of existing cabins and a \nState of Alaska Department of Fish and Game fish weir. From this point, \nthere are two potential route alternatives: the 1A route continues to \nrun in a southerly direction through a mountain pass of slightly more \nthan 500-feet elevation passing two unnamed lakes. Once it reaches the \nshoreline of Dickman Bay, the road turns in a more easterly direction \nand runs across the south end of Kugel Lake and Luelia Lake, and the \nnorth end of Kegan Lake. From the 900-foot elevation pass on the west \nside of Luelia Lake, the route continues to run in an easterly fashion \nand must cross 1,200- and 1,400-foot passes before the route turns \nnorth to reach the Niblack mine at tidewater. That total route is 26.3 \nmiles of new construction and a total distance of 28.8 miles. There is \nan alternative, Route 1B, early in the route corridor to reduce the \nelevation and add switchbacks required to reach the first pass, an \nalternative that would add 1.9 miles to the road.\n  There is another alternative route, Route 2A, that leaves from the \nsame location and runs on the same route until the south end of South \nArm. The second route then turns in a northerly direction and continues \nto follow the eastern shoreline of South Arm, Cholmondeley, for roughly \n1.5 miles. The route then turns in an eastern direction and climbs \nthrough a mountain pass of about 900-feet elevation. From this pass, \nthe route descends into the existing road system on Kootznoowoo lands \nnear the south shores of Miller Lake. At the eastern terminus of these \nexisting roads, the new route picks up again and continues in a \nsoutheast direction along the south end of Clarno Cove and Cannery Cove \nuntil Cannery Point is reached. From there the route turns into a \nsoutherly direction and climbs to another mountain pass of roughly \n1,000-feet elevation. The route then follows the hillside to the west \nof Niblack Lake and meets another mountain pass of the same elevation \nand then descends in a southerly direction along the west side of \nMyrtle Lake to reach the Niblack Mine and tidewater. That route \ninvolves 24.6 miles of new construction, 6.1 miles of road \nreconstruction and involves a total length of 30.7 miles, thus costing \nmore. It involves, however, constructing only one\n\n[[Page S404]]\n\npass higher than 1,200 feet, compared to 3 on the first route, but may \nhave more environmental impacts given its route along Cannery Cove and \nNiblack Lake.\n  An additional road, running to the Bokan Mountain mine, would branch \nfrom the Niblack road and then run south to the Bokan mine site.\n  I mention the two detailed routes, and the third branch route, only \nto indicate that substantial work has been done to select a potential \nroad corridor to the Niblack/Bokan Mountain mines and to make clear \nthat I am not prejudging the route with the fewest environmental \nimpacts. I am leaving that to the Forest Service to decide after an \nenvironmental assessment or impact statement is undertaken. The \nlegislation I am introducing simply says that the Forest Service should \npermit development of a road along one of the two routes and the third \nbranch route, picking the route that both minimizes the costs, while \nalso minimizing the effects on surface resources, prevents unnecessary \nsurface disturbances and that complies with all environmental laws and \nregulations.\n  These roads, I need to point out, will not set a precedent in any way \nweakening the inventoried roadless rule's implementation in Alaska, \nregardless of how I feel about that rule. Under the original \nregulations governing roadless areas in Alaska issued by the Clinton \nadministration in January 2001, Section 294.12(b)(7) permits roads to \nbe built across inventoried roadless areas if needed ``in conjunction \nwith the continuation, extension or renewal of a mineral lease on lands \nthat are under lease by the Secretary of the Interior. . . . Such road \nconstruction or reconstruction must be conducted in a manner that \nminimizes effects on surface resources, prevents unnecessary or \nunreasonable surface disturbance, and compiles with all applicable \nlease requirements.''\n  The patents on the Niblack property and on the Bokan Mountain deposit \ncertainly predate the creation of the roadless rule. The mines were \ndiscovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, according to the \nU.S. Forest Service. Modest copper production occurred between 1902 and \n1908 at Niblack and modern exploration on the 2,000-acre site began in \n1974, some 150 patented claims being in place at the mine. Development/\nproduction on the uranium/REE deposits at Bokan Mountain began in the \n1940s and continued through the 1950s.\n  The point is that Niblack and Bokan Mountain are certainly real \nprospects that offer the likelihood of real employment for many who are \nunemployed on Prince of Wales Island, if they simply can access the \nsites from their homes in Craig, Klawock, Hydaburg, Thorne Bay, Kasaan, \nWhale Pass and even Coffman Cove, located on the northeast end of the \nisland. The need for these jobs has prompted the City Council of Craig \nto formally request Congress to accelerate the approval of a road \ncorridor to the mines. Such a road could be built by the mines, but \nmore likely funded and built by the Alaska Department of Transportation \nand Public Facilities at state expense, not federal expense. A road \ncould also allow a power line to be built to either or both mines, \nallowing non-carbon producing hydropower to power the mines, rather \nthan them relying on expensive diesel generation for energy. That would \nreduce greenhouse gas production and benefit the environment.\n  It makes no sense in a state that already contains 58 million acres \nof formal wilderness, and in the Tongass National Forest contains \nnearly 6.4 million acres of parks and wilderness areas, to bar \nconstruction of a road that does not cross any wilderness areas but \ncould provide a good income to more than half of all of the people, 281 \npeople, unemployed on the island as of November 2012, according to the \nAlaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development.\n  I would hope that this Congress would look favorably on allowing \nthese roads to this mining area, so that residents on the island can \nget the jobs they so desperately need in the years ahead.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 182. A bill to provide for the unencumbering of title to non-\nFederal land owned by the city of Anchorage, Alaska, for purposes of \neconomic development by conveyance of the Federal reversion interest to \nthe City; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto clear the title to three small parcels of land owned by the \nMunicipality of Anchorage, AK, my home State, so that the land can be \nput to more productive uses in the future.\n  At different times between 1922 and 1991, Anchorage, AK, received a \nnumber of parcels of land from the Federal Government, including these \nthree parcels of land, located in downtown Anchorage, comprising 2.65 \nacres in total. They were conveyed to either the former ``City of \nAnchorage'' or more recently the ``Municipality of Anchorage.'' They \nwere transferred by the Federal Government to the local government for \na wide variety of specific purposes, but all were transferred for the \noverarching purpose of helping the then nascent City of Anchorage, \nwhich was, and largely still is, surrounded by Federal lands, have \nsufficient land resources to provide municipal services to the growing \ncommunity. For reasons that made sense decades ago, all of the deeds \nfor these properties contain reversionary clauses, that should the land \nnot be used for various general ``municipal purposes'' their ownership \nwould revert to the Federal Government. The problem is that in each \ncase, the tracts are no longer useful for the purposes originally \nintended, the lands are not needed by the Federal Government, the \npublic purpose for which the reversion clause was put in place has long \nago been fulfilled, and in case they were to be returned to the Federal \nestate, it would cost the Federal Government substantial sums to \nmaintain the properties or prepare them for future sale.\n  These small tracts are not practical for the Federal Government to \nrepossess for several reasons: the Federal Government is barely able to \nmanage all the land it currently owns in Alaska, including in \nAnchorage, let alone adding small tracts to burden its responsibility. \nAfter more than 50 years since the Statehood Act, and 42 years since \nthe Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act's passage, the State and our \nNative People still have not received final patent to all their lands. \nThe public purposes for which the Federal reversionary clauses were put \nin place have been met. These clauses were added to insure that during \nits earlier, developmental stages, Anchorage would use the Federal land \nconveyed to it to build the city and the municipal and public \ninfrastructure of the community. After decades of dedicated public use \nof these properties, the ``public purpose'' basis for the clauses has \nbeen fulfilled. For these properties, my legislation addresses the \nquestion of how long is long enough for a reversionary clause to have \nserved its purpose, by recognizing that after decades of living up to \nits obligations under what are now outdated restrictions from the last \ncentury, it is time to let the City move forward with its vision for \nthe new one. The commercial use of the properties will add to the \npublic municipal treasury, and to the Federal treasury, hence \ncontinuing the public benefit of the lands, albeit in a different way.\n  In 1922 the City of Anchorage received a number of properties around \nAnchorage for municipal/school purposes. One of the properties was the \n1.93-acre site in Block 42 downtown that since the early 1980s has been \nthe site of the William A. Egan Convention Center. With the completion \nin 2010 of the larger Dena'ina Civic and Convention Center, the tract \nis surplus to municipal needs, and could best be utilized for sale to \nthe private sector that would then be best able to afford the cost of \nconversion of the property for future use, adding to the Federal income \ntax base and local property tax base.\n  The second tract is a lot of .48 acres at Seventh and I Streets \ndowntown, currently being used as a municipal parking lot. The land, \nobtained by the city as part of a 1982 land exchange that cleared the \nsite for a major office building across the street, is too small for \nmunicipal or Federal office space use, or for park construction, but \nmight be properly sized for a commercial enterprise. It is zoned for \nbusiness, but cannot be used for business that\n\n[[Page S405]]\n\nwould contribute to the local property tax base or Federal income tax \nbase, because of the inability of the Municipality to sell the property \ndue to the Federal reversion clause.\n  The third site at the corner of H Street and Christiansen Drive, .24 \nacres in size and obtained by the city in 1963, again is too small for \nmunicipal or Federal office space, and unneeded for park space, but \nmight be of use for a retail establishment given its location near a \nmunicipal parking facility. Likewise, it is zoned for business/\ncommercial, but cannot be used and potentially contribute to the local \nand Federal tax bases due to the Federal reversion requirement. It \ncurrently sits vacant and idle.\n  In all cases, the best municipal use of the lands would be for sale \nto provide revenues to the Municipality of Anchorage that could be used \nfor provision of municipal social services. In each case, reversion of \nthe lands to the Federal Government would result in Federal ownership \nof tracts unneeded for Federal purposes, but lands that would produce \ngreater conveyance and management costs to the Federal treasury than \nare likely to be recovered through fair market sales.\n  The Municipality of Anchorage and its Mayor Daniel Sullivan have \nasked that the reversionary clauses be repealed on the three tracts, \nthe city absorbing all costs connected with surveying, recording and \nother costs connected with the properties. In these cases, lifting of \nthe reversionary clauses on three of the literally thousands of acres \nconveyed to Anchorage, partially as a result of the Alaska Statehood \nAct, makes for good land use, and economic and public policy sense for \nboth the local government and the Federal Government. The Municipality \nof Anchorage has already established 223 parks containing 82 \nplaygrounds and 250 miles of trails, encompassing 10,946 acres inside \nits boundaries. There is no shortage of park and open space in the \nmunicipality. There is no public policy purpose in the 21st Century not \nto permit these very limited Federal reversion extinguishments.\n  Passage of this act would cost the Federal Government nothing, but \nwould aid the citizens of Anchorage by allowing lands to be put on the \ncity's tax rolls. I am introducing this bill now, joined by my Alaska \ncolleague and former Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich as cosponsor, to \nfoster action, hopefully, early in this 113th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BLUNT (for himself, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Lee, Mr. Scott, Mr. \n        Inhofe, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 188. A bill to prevent certain individuals purportedly appointed \nto the National Labor Relations Board from receiving salaries, and to \nprevent an unconstitutional quorum of the Board from taking agency \nactions, until there is a final decision in pending lawsuits regarding \nthe constitutionality of certain alleged recess appointments; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a piece of legislation \nI intend to introduce on behalf of Senator Cruz and myself, The Advice \nand Consent Restoration Act, which responds to last week's decision \nannounced on Friday by a three-judge panel on the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals, where they unanimously ruled that President Obama violated the \nConstitution when he made so-called recess appointments to the National \nLabor Relations Board. They are so-called recess appointments because \nthe Senate was still in session.\n  The fundamental question is does the President get to decide whether \nthe Senate is in session or does the Senate get to decide whether the \nSenate is in session. If that question had been debated when the \nConstitution was being debated, I am sure they would have said: That \nwill never come up; there is no way we are going to develop a system \nwith this separation of powers and the President will decide whether \nthe Senate is in session.\n  This President did decide that, and the court agreed with the \nargument that a number of Senators, Senator McConnell and I, along with \n40 of our colleagues, filed in an amicus brief that clearly made the \npoint the Senate gets to decide when the Senate is in session. We \nargued that the Constitution does not empower the President to make \nthis decision. The court agreed with that argument, stating that any \nother interpretation of the Constitution would give the President free \nrein to appoint his desired nominees anytime he pleases. In a direct \nquote, the court said it would give ``the President free rein to \nappoint his desired nominees anytime he pleases, whether that time be a \nweekend, lunch or even when the Senate is in session and he is merely \ndispleased with its inaction.'' That is the end of the quote from the \nthree-judge panel's decision.\n  The right of the Senate to provide advice and consent is an important \ncheck on the risk of this type of Presidential overreach and one the \nSenate should actively exercise. In fact, the Senate actively and \nconsciously made the decision in January to stay in session to do some \nof the work that needed to be done during the session and, frankly, to \nbe sure that the President couldn't avoid the constitutional \nrequirement of advice and consent.\n  Allowing the President to determine the Senate's schedule would \nseriously damage the balance of powers; it would seriously damage the \nSenate's autonomy. It eliminates an important check on the executive \nbranch.\n  The court invalidated the one ruling that was being appealed. Of \ncourse, the Presiding Officer understands this exactly, that the court \ncase would only have appealed one ruling that impacted one company or \none employer, and the court said that ruling can't stand. There are \nmore than 200 other actions this same group, which the court said is \nnot legally functioning, had taken, and all 200 or more of those \nactions are now in question.\n  I believe the answer will be clear. Perhaps all those will have to be \nappealed in some way so that a court can say, No, just as in the first \nruling we made, the people who made these decisions were not \nconstitutionally in place; consequently the ruling they made isn't in \nplace. The work of this agency will not pass constitutional muster and, \nof course, the President needs to now appoint people who would be \nconfirmed by the Senate.\n  In spite of the three-judge panel's unanimous decision, the National \nLabor Relations Board recently announced that it intends to ignore the \nruling and carry on with business as usual. This is not a very \nacceptable response. The President first decides he is going to decide \nwhether the Senate is in session. Then the people he appoints in an \nunconstitutional way decide they are going to ignore the court ruling \nand continue to do what they have been doing.\n  The President needs to reappoint, and until the President does \nreappoint, Congress has a responsibility to block this unconstitutional \nact by terminating the salaries of those who were illegally appointed \nand by preventing them from conducting any official business until the \nSenate acts to approve their appointments.\n  Senator Cruz and I urge our colleagues to join us in supporting this \neffort. The National Labor Relations Board should take down the ``open \nfor business'' sign they put up on Monday after the court ruling on \nFriday. Frankly, they need to put up a ``help wanted'' sign.\n  The Constitution matters. What the Constitution says matters. The \nSenate, I hope, will be vigorous in enforcing its constitutional \nresponsibility.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself, Mr. Flake, Mrs. \n        Gillibrand, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 189. A bill to establish an employment-based immigrant visa for \nalien entrepreneurs who have received significant capital from \ninvestors to establish a business in the United States; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that \nI, along with Mr. Flake of Arizona, reintroduce the Startup Visa Act. \nThe Startup Visa Act of 2013 allows immigrant entrepreneurs and foreign \ngraduates of U.S. universities to appeal for a two-year visa on the \ncondition that they secure financing from a qualified U.S. investor and \ncan demonstrate the ability to create jobs in America.\n  If they are successful in developing their company and hiring \nAmerican workers, they would be eligible for legal permanent residency \nand would be free to continue building their companies, creating more \nhome-grown jobs\n\n[[Page S406]]\n\nand continuing our legacy of unmatched innovation and entrepreneurship.\n  The United States has a proud history of providing entrepreneurs from \naround the world the freedom and resources to turn an idea into a \nsuccessful venture. Well-known U.S. companies such as Google, Yahoo, \nIntel, Pfizer and eBay all began as startups that were founded by \nimmigrants. These businesses have grown into multibillion-dollar \nindustry leaders that provide thousands of Americans with high-paying \njobs in cutting-edge fields.\n  The number of jobs offered by startups is dropping off. While this is \npartly due to the economic downturn it is also because of our Nation's \nbroken immigration system. Many of the world's best and brightest minds \nare finding that our current visa restrictions discourage them from \nlaunching new companies here. This is a major competitive disadvantage, \nand one that runs counter to our Nation's history of fostering foreign-\nborn innovators, such as Albert Einstein or Andrew Carnegie.\n  More worrisome is that while we try to work out a solution to our \nbroken immigration laws, our foreign competitors are catching up and, \nin some cases, passing us by in many of the fields we once dominated. \nIn 2009, for the first time in recent memory, foreign innovators were \nawarded more patents than Americans pioneers. Only a decade earlier, \nU.S.-based entrepreneurs were awarded almost 57 percent of all patents \nworldwide. We must work quickly and in a bipartisan manner to reverse \nthis trend. The Startup Visa Act of 2013 is a strong and simple step \nthat will reward foreign innovators, pioneers and entrepreneurs for \ncreating jobs in America. Put simply, this legislation will help \nprotect America's position as the global leader in innovation.\n  We do not have to look far for evidence that our broken immigration \nsystem is hurting our economy. We only need to look at our Canadian \nneighbors. The Canadian founders of Vanilla Forums, an innovative and \nfast-growing company, whose products are used by websites around the \nworld to host online forum discussions, spent a summer in my home State \nof Colorado participating in a mentorship program with U.S.-based \nentrepreneurs and investors. Despite the numerous investors who were \ninterested in funding Vanilla Forums and developing the company in \nColorado, concerns about the founders' ability to obtain visas won out. \nAs a result, Vanilla Forums is a successful company that is hiring \nemployees at its headquarters in Montreal, Quebec.\n  America has tremendous untapped potential for innovation and it is \nour responsibility to give our Nation every opportunity to remain \nglobally competitive. By passing the Startup Visa Act of 2013 we can \ncreate high paying jobs here in the United States, and help ensure that \nthe next globally transformative company is based in America. This \nlegislation is bipartisan and fiscally responsible; it will spur \nprivate investment and it will help put our economy back on track. I \nask my colleagues to join me in support of this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/30/senate-section/article/S406-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 21--DESIGNATING FEBRUARY 14, 2013, AS ``NATIONAL \n            SOLIDARITY DAY FOR COMPASSIONATE PATIENT CARE''\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, let me make a comment, if I could, to the \nChair. It is my hope that we don't have sequestration with the \nmilitary, with the Defense Department. I have been very much concerned \nabout that. I am going to do everything I can to preclude that from \nhappening. In the event that did happen--we are looking at about a \nmonth from now--I have an amendment I wanted to put on this bill. I \ncould do it another way too, but perhaps as a freestanding bill. I wish \nto explain what it is, and then I wish to ask the distinguished \nmajority leader a couple of questions.\n  The amendment I had, or that could be in a freestanding bill, would \ngive the Secretary of Defense the flexibility to implement the cuts \nunder the sequestration in the least harmful way possible, that would \nauthorize him to have the power to make adjustments within the confines \nof the sequestration so if there would not be any more money, it would \nnot change that. It would allow the Chiefs to examine and determine \nwhether they could make some changes to make something that could be \ncatastrophic maybe less catastrophic. I have supplied a copy to the \nleader's office.\n  What I wish to do--I don't want to object to this, because I want to \nmake sure this continues. I wish to ask if I could have some latitude \nto help me to get this before the Senate so we could accomplish this.\n  I would say this, through the Chair, to the leader, that I have \nalready talked to not just the Chair of the Joint Chiefs but all of the \nChiefs. They all say that in a period of 1 month, quite frankly, they \nare starting right now to see if there is something they could put \ntogether to make it less onerous should we have to have that.\n  So I would like to ask if there is something that could be done \nthrough the leadership to help me get this done if the worst should \nhappen and we should be faced with sequestration a month from now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair to the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, as the \nleader for the Republicans on that committee, he understands the \nimportance of the military and what sequestration would do. I have \nspoken to the distinguished Senator previously--and, in fact, as late \nas this morning we talked--and there are Democrats who also believe \nthere should be some relief given in regard to sequestration. The issue \nwe have to work through is how we have a balance between the cuts in \ndefense and nondefense.\n  So there are many different ways we could approach this, but I am \ncommitted to approaching it. I have said, and I will continue to say, \nsequestration was a last resort. We thought we would do better with the \nsupercommittee. We didn't. So this is what we are faced with. I hope we \ncan all work together to lessen the burden on defense spending and, of \ncourse, nondefense spending. That is what sequestration is all about. I \nam committed to doing that.\n  I am happy to work with my friend from Oklahoma. If he can't find \nenough allies, either Republicans or Democrats, I will be happy to \ncontinue to work with him to figure out a way we can have this issue \nbrought before the Senate.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Through the Chair, I would make a comment that many times \nthe distinguished leader has been helpful, such as with the highway \nbill and the pilots bill of rights and others, and I have to say I \nwould not have been able to get them through without that support. What \nI would ask for is the same support to help me overcome some of the \nproblems that would come with sequestration.\n  To give an example, sequestration would cancel flying operations for \nfour out of nine aircraft carriers, which would take about 9 to 12 \nmonths to restore at a cost of two to three times as much. What they \ncould do with this bill, which I plan to introduce tomorrow, is have \nthe latitude, while spending the same amount of money, to keep the \nflying hours where they are so they would not have to be restored in \nanother vehicle. Little things such as that are significant.\n  It also would address the problems we hear of every day from the \nSecretaries in the military--the various departments and the Chiefs--\nhaving to do with the other problems on the CR. So this would address \nboth of them and give latitude and make it better.\n  I would just say I hope the leader could assist me in getting this \nbill through in a timely fashion that I will be introducing tomorrow.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think it is my choice, and I am confident \nthe choice of the senior Senator from Oklahoma, to avoid sequestration. \nWe need to do this through some type of balanced plan, and I am \ncommitted to doing that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate that very much, Mr. President. I do not \nobject.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would finally say it is not as if the \nSenator from Oklahoma is asking that the actual amount of dollars be \nlessened. He is just saying they should be rearranged. So I appreciate \nhis good will on this legislation.\n  We need to get this bill to the President. So it is my intention, \nafter the use or yielding back of time, to move to table these \namendments and the Vitter motion.\n  We expect to have one vote tomorrow prior to the Senate recessing for \ncaucus lunch meetings, and the remaining votes will occur after the \ncaucus meetings. Again, I express my appreciation to the Senator from \nOklahoma. I know how strongly he feels about the military and that he \nwants to try to relieve the pain in some way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request is agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/30/senate-section/article/S407-3", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S407-S408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATING THE MEMBERS OF DELTA SIGMA THETA SORORITY, INC.\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, as a Member of this body representing \nthe State of Georgia, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to \nrecognize a Georgia resident and my good personal friend, Davis Love, \nIII, on being named the recipient of the 2013 Bob Jones Award.\n  The award, named in honor of another great Georgia golfer, Robert \nTyre Jones, Jr.--better known as Bobby Jones--is the U.S. Golf \nAssociation's highest honor and recognizes individuals for their \ndistinguished sportsmanship in golf. Since 1955, the Bob Jones Award \nhas been presented annually to an individual who ``emulates Jones' \nspirit, his personal qualities, and his attitude toward the game and \nits players.'' Past recipients include some of golf's alltime greats, \nsuch as Byron Nelson, Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Tom \nWatson. And it comes as no surprise to see Davis Love's name added to \nthis distinguished list.\n  Davis and his wife Robin are longtime residents of Georgia, and Davis \nis receiving an award that embodies much of our State's rich golfing \nhistory. He has long been a champion of the game and embraced many of \ngolf's finest traditions.\n  Throughout his impressive career, Davis has represented our country \nwith dignity and honor. In the 1985 Walker Cup match, Davis helped lead \nthe USA team to a narrow 13-to-11 victory over Great Britain and \nIreland by winning two matches on the final day of play. He is also a \nsix-time member of the President's Cup team and has been a member of \nthe U.S. Ryder Cup team seven times and was captain of last year's \nRyder Cup team.\n  Since he earned his PGA Tour card in 1985, Davis Love, III, has won \n20 events, including a major, the 1997 PGA Championship. He is also a \ntwo-time winner of the prestigious Players Championship and has \nfinished at the top of the leader board in many of golf's other major \ntournaments.\n  His respect and love for the game is admired by fellow players and \ngolf fans around the world. I can think of no other professional golfer \nwho is more deserving of this award than is Davis Love, III, and I \ncongratulate him and Robin on being named the recipient of USGA's 2013 \nBob Jones Award.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/30/senate-section/article/S408-7", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S408-S409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONGRATULATING SECRETARY OF STATE KERRY\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate overwhelmingly \nconfirmed the nomination of John Kerry to be the next Secretary of \nState of the United States of America. I was away from the Capitol \nduring the 2 hours allocated for that debate, and I wanted to add my \ncomments and my commendations to now Secretary Kerry on his \nconfirmation to be Secretary of State of our country.\n  For the last 4 years, I had the privilege of serving on the Foreign \nRelations Committee with Senator Kerry as chairman. During that period \nof time, I got to watch him as a diplomat, as an American, as a Member \nof the Senate, and as one committed to peace and security around the \nworld. I watched him carefully in the Middle East as he negotiated and \nworked hard to see to it that we had peace but that we had peace \nthrough strength and we had peace through our partnership with the \ngreat State of Israel. I watched him on the comprehensive peace \nagreement in the Sudan to help shepherd across the creation of the \nnewest nation, South Sudan, and a bloodless election that caused that \nto take place. I watched him in many other cases dealing with diplomats \nfrom Africa, to Europe, to the Middle East, representing the United \nStates of America in all of its best interests. I watched him work hand \nin hand with\n\n[[Page S409]]\n\nSecretary of State Clinton to ensure that there was no division between \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the policies of this \ncountry. But most importantly of all, in those tough, tough issues, \nlike the ratification of the New START treaty, now Secretary Kerry, \nthen Chairman Kerry, made sure that every member of the committee in \nthe entire markup and hearing process had their questions answered, \ntheir concerns answered, and was a part of the process. He never tried \nto ramrod anything through the committee nor through the Congress but, \nrather, did his job in an exemplary way.\n  It is a privilege for me to rise tonight to pay tribute to John \nKerry, the next Secretary of State of the United States of America, and \ncommend him on his confirmation to that job.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/30/senate-section/article/S409-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
