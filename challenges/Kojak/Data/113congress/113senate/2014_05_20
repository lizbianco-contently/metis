Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, if any, the Senate will be in a period of morning \nbusiness until 5:30 p.m. The time from 2:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. will be \nequally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.

At 5:30 p.m. there will be at least two \nrollcall votes: confirmation of the Costa nomination to be a U.S. \ncircuit judge and a cloture vote on the Fischer nomination to be a \nmember of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.\n\n\n                brown v. board of education anniversary\n\n  Mr. President, we hear a lot--and have for many years--about the \nBrown v. Board of Education case, but what was that all about? Well, it \nwas about a dad and a mom who decided they could no longer just go \nalong; they had to try to do something to take care of their little 7-\nyear-old girl Linda. In the 1950s this family lived in Topeka, KS, and \nthe State was racially segregated. Little Black boys and girls went one \nplace to school; little White boys and girls went someplace else. But \nit was clear where the little Black boys and girls went to school the \nschools were not very good; where the little White boys and girls went \nthe schools were pretty good--certainly better than where the Black \nboys and girls went.\n  But a courageous father named Oliver Brown was determined to give his \nlittle third grader Linda a fair shot at a good education. These were \nlong odds he took. Mr. Brown tried unsuccessfully to enroll his \ndaughter Linda in the neighborhood all-White elementary school, the \nschool that was close by. But the doors of that school were shut to \nlittle Linda because she was an African American--because of the color \nof her skin. It had nothing to do with her intellect; it had everything \nto do with the color of her skin.\n  She was forced to walk--a little 7-year-old girl, a third grader--\nseven or eight blocks to a bus stop where she waited for a bus to take \nher to an all-Black elementary school some distance away.\n  Rather than accept the status quo, the Browns--and they got some \nother neighbors to join them--brought a civil case against the Topeka \nschool board challenging the school district's segregation policy.\n  This case took a long time to work up to the U.S. Supreme Court, but \nit got there. This case is now commonly known as Brown v. Board of \nEducation. As I said, it was eventually argued before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  The plaintiffs were represented by the NAACP and a young lawyer by \nthe name of Thurgood Marshall. I just finished a stunning book about \nthis man. It is called ``Devil in the Grove,'' and\n\n[[Page S3152]]\n\nfor anyone within the sound of my voice, I would recommend they read \nthis book. It tells a lot about Thurgood Marshall and the struggles he \nwent through. But it also talks about the South and what he had to put \nup with--death threats, accommodations. He had to stay at other \npeople's homes. Even though he would go to a courthouse, and he would \nhave to spend weeks in that town, he could not get a room nearby. He \nhad to go live with an African-American family during that period of \ntime. It is a good book, and it talks about how courageous the Brown \nfamily would have to be to do what they did: to challenge the status \nquo.\n  In rendering the decision, the U.S. Supreme Court--not in a 5-4 \ndecision, not in a 7-2 decision, but in a unanimous decision--under the \nleadership of Chief Justice Earl Warren, unanimously held that a \nracially segregated public school was ``inherently unequal,'' and they \noverturned--some say half a century--what America had been for a long \ntime. They changed it. We all know it did not change like that, but it \nchanged.\n  I had the good fortune last night--I got home fairly early, 7 \no'clock--and watched the news. Every news show talked about the 60th \nanniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, which occurred last \nSaturday. They interviewed everyone, and even though we have a long way \nto go, everyone acknowledged that decision changed America. The status \nquo of separate but equal in our Nation's public schools was struck \ndown. It was gone--not in a decision, I repeat, that was close but \nunanimous. We need more of those. We need more collegiality in the \nSupreme Court, not only here in the U.S. Senate but in the Supreme \nCourt, because after that was struck down, little kids such as Linda \nBrown were able to attend class with little White boys and girls.\n  This past Saturday marked the 60th anniversary of the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Brown v. Board of Education.\n  My children are not little kids anymore, but in Nevada, we had \nsegregation. I can remember a man I served with in the State \nlegislature. His name was Woodrow Wilson, an African American. He told \nme about Las Vegas and taking his children to a lunch counter that was \nin a drugstore. They told him to leave, that he could not eat there. \nThat is Las Vegas; that is not Mississippi.\n  So things changed in Nevada. When my children were young, schools \nwere not really segregated as I just described what was going on in \nKansas, but they still had some issues. How it was handled in Nevada--\nlet's see if I can remember the grade--yes, for all sixth graders, \nWhite kids were bused to an African-American community to go to school \nfor 1 year of their school career, but the rest of the time the Black \nkids were bused. So for 1 year White kids were bused; the rest of the \ntime Black kids were bused. That is gone now. But it was handled \ndifferently. Was what took place with my two oldest children good? No. \nBut it was better than it used to be.\n  After six decades, our Nation still owes a debt to those few brave \nindividuals who stood against racial segregation in American schools, \nand the lawyer there was a man by the name of Thurgood Marshall. I \nnever had the pleasure and honor of meeting this man when he was on the \nSupreme Court, but, boy, what a stalwart he was. And that book was so \ngood. Again, I repeat, it is called ``Devil in the Grove.'' It is \nfocused mainly on Florida and what went on in Florida--what a bad \nsituation there, created by lots of people but principally one sheriff.\n  The Brown family, their fellow plaintiffs, the legal teams, and the \nnine Supreme Court Justices all refused to let inequality go \nunchallenged.\n  For the Browns, it was difficult, it was scary, and it was courageous \nto pursue legal recourse in the face of insults, slanders, and threats. \nBut the Brown family and their fellow plaintiffs stood firm in the face \nof their opposition. Their legal teams did not waiver, led by Thurgood \nMarshall, and their supporters had their backs from the beginning to \nthe end.\n  These parents could have given up, and I am sure there are stories \nthat are untold where parents did give up. But here the Browns knew it \nwas their responsibility to fight for justice. There was nothing given \nwhen they started this. In fact, the odds were stacked against them.\n  Today, along with my Senate colleagues, I express my gratitude for \nthe men, women, and children whose iconic efforts helped bring racial \nsegregation to a screeching halt. As I have said before, today our \nNation is still far from perfect, and, sadly, we still see racism rear \nits ugly head. We saw what happened in Nevada very recently where a man \nsaid that African Americans were better off with slavery. Some people \nstill believe such things. But no one can dispute that we are better \noff because of Brown v. Board of Education.\n  It is my hope we will recognize and support those other children like \nlittle Linda Brown in doing our part to equally and fairly look at what \nis going on and do our part to defend equality and fairness in our \nsociety. As we do that, we will complete the unfinished work of Brown \nv. Board of Education.\n\n\n                              nominations\n\n  Mr. President, I want to briefly call attention to something that I \nthink is extremely important for our country and for the Senate.\n  Last week we had all the police officers from Nevada, New Jersey, \ncame from all over the country, to celebrate National Police Week, to \nexpress our appreciation for the crime-fighting men and women who \nprotect our families every day. They had an honor roll there of people \nin our country who were killed in the line of duty as police officers.\n  While the rest of America honored our Nation's police officers, the \nU.S. Senate failed to do its part in supporting law enforcement.\n  For months--for months--we have struggled to get nominations done.\n  The chief law enforcement officer of our country is Eric Holder. He \nis the Attorney General of the United States. He has awesome \nresponsibility. Yesterday we saw that seven Chinese military officers \nwere indicted for hacking into different businesses to steal their \ntrade secrets. A day rarely goes by where we don't see the Justice \nDepartment announcing something they have done for the good of our \ncountry. A big bank was fined $2.5 billion yesterday for doing things \nthat were criminally done in our country--hiding money that people were \nputting into banks so they wouldn't have to pay taxes on them. The \nJustice Department is so important to the integrity of our Nation, but \nwe have about 140 nominations that have been stalled by the Republican \nobstruction.\n  We changed the rules in the Senate. We are getting our judicial \nnominations done. These good men and women will serve a lifetime in \ntheir jobs. They were blocked, and now we have a way to get them done. \nBut rather than live up to those responsibilities, Republicans are \npouting. They are pouting. They are saying: Oh, they changed the rules \nto get these judges done, so we are going to agree to nothing--things \nwe used to do as a matter of fact. I can remember when I was the whip \nhere and I did work for Senator Daschle, who was the leader. One \nevening, by consent, we did 70 nominations just like that, walked out \nwith a consent agreement and approved them. That is the way we used to \nalways do it until President Obama was elected. They have done \neverything they can to make it so that this man's job is very \ndifficult. Everyone can try to figure out why they have done it, but \nthey have done it. They have opposed everything this good man has tried \nto do.\n  Right now, if you can imagine this, we have three people--it is very \nimportant--who want to be U.S. attorneys in New Mexico, Louisiana, and \nConnecticut. These are extremely important jobs, fulfilling those \nresponsibilities. But they can't fulfill those responsibilities because \nthey are being held up by Republicans. These are jobs that were never \nheld up in the past. These are people who are prosecuting crimes in the \nStates of New Mexico, Louisiana, and Connecticut, but they are being \nheld up. Why? For no good reason. These are all good men and women.\n  The U.S. attorneys are our Nation's top prosecutors for drug \ntrafficking, bank robbery, counterfeiting. When I practiced law, it was \nkind of a joke: What are they trying to do--make a Federal case out of \nit?\n  Yes.\n  Why do they say that? Because Federal cases are good cases. They are \ninvestigated by the FBI and other agencies, and they bring these cases \nto the\n\n[[Page S3153]]\n\nU.S. attorney, and they make a Federal case out of them. But they are \nnot making Federal cases out of those cases in New Mexico, Louisiana, \nand Connecticut. Everyone who is watching what I say today, that is a \nsham.\n  The reason I mentioned the Attorney General, we have two Assistant \nAttorneys General they are holding up. Eric Holder called me yesterday \nand said: Is there anything that can be done to help me?\n  Again, I will have to file cloture on these. This is how it works, \neverybody: I file cloture, we get cloture, and they have 30 hours to \nstand around and do nothing. When 30 hours is over we finally get a \nvote. They get 30 hours for a circuit court judge, Supreme Court \nJustice, and Cabinet officer. For U.S. attorneys and assistant U.S. \nattorneys, they get 8 hours--an arbitrary number.\n  I don't plan on changing the rules again, but how much longer can we \nput up with this? Even law enforcement officers, as I have indicated, \nare held up for no reason. We don't hear people giving speeches about \nwhat horrible people the President selected to be U.S. attorney in \nConnecticut, Louisiana, and New Mexico--not a word. They just hide \nbehind their obstruction.\n  I ought to mention that we have about 40 ambassadors they have held \nup. These are not political appointments; these are career ambassadors \nwho have worked their whole lives to have one of these jobs where they \nrepresent our country. We have major countries where they have held up \nambassadors: 25 percent of all African countries, no ambassadors; Peru; \nand on and on with all of the things that are being done--not for the \nbetterment of our country.\n  We have the Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and \nNatural Resources Division. One would think that is kind of important \nwith the fires burning in the West and the number of fires caused by \nmalicious acts.\n  Is it right that we have all this degradation of our environment and \nthere is nobody to enforce the law? I know the Koch brothers want no \nenvironmental protection. They say that, so maybe they are at the beck \nand call of the Koch brothers, who don't want these laws enforced.\n  The U.S. Department of Justice is the crime-fighting arm of our \ngovernment, and they should not be handcuffed by not having the people \nto allow the Attorney General to have help with his responsibilities. \nIt is hard to fathom that the work of Attorney General Eric Holder is \nbeing recklessly hindered by Republican obstruction.\n  It used to be easy for me to say ``I call on my Republican colleagues \nto stop it,'' but they haven't stopped it for 5\\1/2\\ years. It is a \nshame. I would at least hope they could give our Nation's law \nenforcement all the tools they need to protect us.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I take this time to urge my colleagues to \nfind a way to proceed with the EXPIRE Act that Senator Wyden and \nSenator Hatch worked on.\n  I am proud to be a member of the Senate Finance Committee, where this \nlegislation was passed by a unanimous vote. We had an extensive markup \nwhere members offered numerous amendments.\n  This deals with expiring tax provisions, and if we don't take action, \nwe will find that those who depend upon this tax policy remaining in \neffect--such as small business owners, students, people who use certain \nbenefits, and some of our energy provisions--will find that policy \nexpires at the end of the year. If that happens, what happens, quite \nfrankly, is that--it has already expired in some provisions, and if we \ndon't extend it, there will be continued uncertainty in our Tax Code.\n  It also means that if we don't pass this bill, it effectively raises \ntaxes on a large number of Americans. So it will affect those who ride \nour transit systems. It is already affecting those who use transit \nsystems. It is already having an impact because we haven't taken timely \naction. We can't wait any longer on the passage of this bill.\n  I would like to take this time to express my strong support for \ngiving a fair shot to all Americans who depend upon a stable tax policy \nand are finding that our inactions are causing more uncertainty. It \naffects job creation in our communities. Let me give a few examples.\n  Small businesses depend upon the passage of this bill. Why do I say \nthat? The research and development tax credit is very much at stake. \nSmall businesses depend upon the help in the Tax Code to take risks, to \ninvest in new innovation. More innovation occurs through small \nbusinesses than large businesses. More jobs are created through small \nbusinesses than large businesses. They need a tax code that is friendly \nfor small business owners to accumulate capital, to take risk, and to \ndevelop the next cure for a dread disease, the next technology that \nwill help us deal with cyber security, and the list goes on and on. But \nwithout the extension of the research and development tax credit, small \nbusinesses particularly are put at a tremendous disadvantage.\n  We have the expensing provision, which is a very popular provision, \nwhich allows small business owners to be able to take off immediately \nthe cost of their investments in their company. It is bipartisan. We \nhave always thought of that as a good idea.\n  If you are a small business owner and you are trying to plan as to \nyour next investment but you don't know what the tax policy is going to \nbe, you are going to withhold. You are not going to make those plans to \nput in that new piece of equipment that perhaps expands capacity or \nmakes you more efficient so you hire more people, sell more product, \nand create more jobs. If you don't have the certainty in the Tax Code, \nyou put off that decision, delaying the acquisition. Then maybe when \nyou get back to it, times are different and maybe it is more \nchallenging and you never go forward with that expansion. Those jobs \nare lost forever.\n  Literally, the passage of this bill helps small business owners to be \nable to make decisions to expand opportunity and create more jobs. That \nis at jeopardy if we do not move this bill forward.\n  One of the provisions that I have worked on with other Members in the \nSenate is the S corporation. S corporations are preferred by small \ncompanies because it allows them to pass through their income and \nexpenses as if they are an individual taxpayer, avoiding the double \ntaxation of a C corporation. Well, there have been changes over time on \nhow businesses operate, and we need to reform the S corporation \nprovisions so that they are friendlier toward small businesses and give \nthem more flexibility on the use of this structure.\n  These are the provisions we want incorporated into the EXPIRE Act.\n  Let me mention one other provision that I think is very important in \nNew Jersey, Maryland, and in all of our States. We have yet to recover \nfully from the housing crisis. We still have too many people in \nMaryland and--I am sure the Presiding Officer would agree--in New \nJersey who are in danger of losing their homes through foreclosure. We \nstill have a disconnect between many of the balances that are on \nmortgages and the value of the homes. So it is in everyone's interest \nto readjust the numbers so that it works; the person can afford to stay \nin the house. It makes sense economically, it is less costly to the \nmortgage holder, and it is certainly better for our community and \ncertainly better for the homeowner to be able to maintain their house. \nSo we restructure the loan.\n  We have had a policy in place that said restructuring those loans \nwith loan forgiveness does not trigger a taxable event. That makes \nsense. Everybody agrees with that. We have to extend that policy \nbecause it is still needed today. We still need to make that connection \nbetween homeowners and the mortgage holders to adjust mortgages where \nit is appropriate to avoid foreclosure, to keep neighborhoods more \nstable, to help individual\n\n[[Page S3154]]\n\nfamilies and, by the way, it will also help the banking institutions \nbecause they will lose less money if they have a person paying their \nmortgage on time. That policy will be at stake if we do not pass the \nEXPIRE Act.\n  Another issue I have been working on personally--and I know this one \nwill be very important to the Presiding Officer--is the transit \nbenefit, the parity provision. We had a policy in place that provided \nparity between those who use transit to get to work and those who are \nprovided parking spaces, and that parity expired. So we need to extend \nthat provision so those who help us--help our energy policy in this \ncountry by using transit rather than driving a car, help those who \ndrive cars by having fewer cars on the road so that they can get into \nwork a little easier, and help our environment by taking cars off the \nroad--receive a comparable tax break as those who drive their cars to \nwork. That is another provision that is critically important in the \nEXPIRE Act and another reason we have to get it done.\n  The low-income housing tax credit--we have worked on this, and it is \nthe most important tool we have for affordable housing in this country \ntoday. It is the No. 1 tool today. Senator Cantwell and others have \nworked together to try to make it more effective with certain floors to \nguarantee a certain amount of help to different communities. We extend \nthat policy in the EXPIRE Act so that we again are able to maintain the \nexisting tools of today to help provide affordable housing by \npartnerships with the private sector. This is jobs. This is the private \nsector being incentivized to construct affordable housing in the \ncommunity, privately owned, with the government as a partner. It is \nmore cost-effective to the taxpayer and provides a greater stock of \naffordable housing. That policy will be in jeopardy if we cannot pass \nthe underlying bill.\n  A section I have worked on with many of my colleagues is the \nextension of 179D, which deals with energy efficiency. We all talk \nabout incentives so that when you build a building, you make it energy \nefficient. It is good policy for our energy and for our environment. We \nall know it makes us less dependent upon foreign sources of energy--all \nof the above.\n  This energy credit has been very, very effective in getting \nbusinesses and institutions to incorporate energy efficiency when they \nconstruct their buildings. So we want to extend that policy, \nabsolutely, and I am proud of the role many of us have played in this \narea to get that extended.\n  We also want to improve that, and one of the provisions that is \nimproved in the underlying bill is to help nonprofits take advantage of \nthe 179D credit. It makes no difference whether it is a commercial or a \nnonprofit venture; we should be friendly to all from the point of view \nof being able to make buildings more efficient. That is what is \nincorporated in the underlying bill.\n  I must say I hope we will have an opportunity to offer some \namendments, and I would hope, if we do, we can expand that to \nretrofitted buildings. We should be dealing not just with new \nconstruction, but we should also be dealing with older buildings from \nthe point of view of giving incentives for retrofitting and saving \nenergy, saving costs, making this country more efficient, creating more \njobs and, by the way, also helping our environment. All of that can be \ndone, and the EXPIRE bill helps us move forward on all those issues.\n  A provision I worked on with Senator Schumer on section 181 deals \nwith film expensing rules. This is very important because filmmaking, \nwhether it is for the theater or for TV, is a global competition. It is \nno longer whether it is going to be done in your State or in my State; \nit is whether it is going to be done in America or in another country. \nWe have certain provisions in the code that make it easier for \ncompanies to locate in our States.\n  I am proud of the filmmaking industry in Maryland. It is very \nimportant to our economy, with literally hundreds of jobs dependent on \nthat every week when we have new companies coming in. So extending this \ncredit will help us in that regard, and that is in the underlying bill.\n  A provision I worked on with Senator Portman, the work opportunity \ntax credit, is a credit we give to employers who hire very difficult-\nto-hire individuals. It has been very successful in getting jobs for \npeople who would otherwise be unemployed. The company takes a risk, and \nthey are compensated for it because it is a more vulnerable group of \nunemployed workers.\n  Senator Portman and I have introduced an amendment to expand that to \nthe long-term unemployed. When an employer is looking for someone to \nhire, they do not normally go to the long-term unemployed list. This \nwill allow us to deal with that. It takes the pressure off the \nunemployment insurance system, and it provides incentives for job \ngrowth. That is in this bill.\n  I could go on and on. There are literally dozens and dozens of \nsimilar provisions that are extended and improved--extended and \nimproved--in the underlying bill. That is what the Finance Committee \ndid under the leadership of Senator Wyden and Senator Hatch. We looked \nat all these provisions and asked: Which ones should we extend and \nwhich should we modify?\n  The next thing we want to do is to make permanent decisions. We know \nuncertainty is not healthy. We know we have to make permanent decisions \non which credits should be there and which ones should not. We want to \nlevel the playing field as far as the Tax Code is concerned, but you \ncan't get there unless this bill is first passed. This gives us a 2-\nyear window in order to pass tax reform.\n  It is called EXPIRE for a reason--because we don't want to see \ntemporary provisions in the Tax Code. We think we should make permanent \njudgments, and this bill gives us a chance to do that. So it will help \nus from the point of view of a more predictable tax policy. It will \nhelp us create jobs. There is no question about that. It does help \nsmall businesses. They are the ones most at risk by our failure to act. \nThe uncertainty and the timing of this affects small businesses more. \nBased upon current policy, it would increase the tax burden of \ncompanies in this country and individuals. It is not only businesses \nbut also individuals' tax burdens which will go up if we don't pass \nthis bill.\n  This is not the time that any of this should be done. It makes more \nsense for us to move this bill forward. So let us find a way to do it. \nI might add that, traditionally, tax bills coming out of the Finance \nCommittee are not an open process for amendments. I understand that. I \nthink most of my colleagues understand that. So let us use reason to \nfigure out a path forward so that at the end of the day we can pass \nthis most important piece of legislation and help our economy grow.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3154-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3154-S3157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BARRON NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak about Harvard law \nprofessor David Barron's nomination to the First Circuit. I will do so \nby addressing some aspects of Professor Barron's record I find \nparticularly troubling. At the end of the day, I believe his record \nreveals a nominee who simply doesn't belong on the Federal bench.\n  I will also update my colleagues on the efforts to withhold material \nrelevant to this nominee from the American public, as well as, it \nappears, from the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, the White House continues its refusal to confirm that \nit has provided the full Senate with all Barron-related drone \nmaterials. As I stated 2 weeks ago, every Senator should be provided \naccess to any and all Barron memos related to the drone issue, but \nbefore I turn to Barron's drone materials, I will discuss with my \ncolleagues some of the other problematic aspects of this nominee's \nrecord.\n  I have reviewed the record. It is a record of legal reasoning and \npolicy positions that are far outside the mainstream of legal thought. \nProfessor Barron's record is even outside the mainstream of typically \nleft-wing legal thought that we see in so many of our\n\n[[Page S3155]]\n\nlaw schools. It is a record that reveals Professor Barron's judicial \nphilosophy. While that judicial philosophy may be appropriate for the \nivory towers of academia, it has no place on a Federal appellate court. \nIt is also a record that reveals Professor Barron's embrace of an \napproach to judging that is flatly inconsistent with what Federal \njudges are called upon to do.\n  Professor Barron has been very candid about his view on the role of \nthe Federal courts. So from that standpoint, he is intellectually \nhonest. It is fair to say he appears to view the Federal judiciary as a \npolitical branch of our government, not the judicial branch \ninterpreting law instead of making law. I will recount some of the \nevidence which leads me to this conclusion.\n  Professor Barron has written that the courts are a ``significant \nwielder of power'' for ``progressive potential.''\n  What he appears to mean is that the courts should be used as an \ninstrument to impose progressive policies on the American people, a \nrole generally reserved to the legislative branch of government. These \nare of course policies that liberals couldn't otherwise impose through \nlegislation because they are so far outside the political mainstream.\n  Professor Barron also appears to believe that progressives should \nmask their motives. He has written that candor and clarity have \npotential to ``obstruct progressive decisionmaking'' and that ``candor, \nclarity, and activism cannot co-exist.''\n  If that is what he believes, he is intellectually honest. His \nsolution to this problem is, ``Candor and clarity seem a preferable \nchoice for sacrifice'' to all-important progressive decisionmaking.\n  I would like my colleagues to stop and think about whether that kind \nof thinking is compatible with the role of a Federal judge. It is \nsurely compatible with being a legislator but not being a judge. I \nthink the answer is, quite simply, it is not because judges are called \nupon to decide cases based upon laws applied to the facts.\n  Consider this quote from the professor: ``Principled frankness has \nits place, but it need not always lie between the covers of the United \nStates Reports.''\n  Let that sink in for a moment. The ``United States Reports'' he is \nreferring to of course are the volumes containing the reported opinions \nof the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  So when we consider this statement together with his view that candor \nand clarity have the potential to ``obstruct progressive \ndecisionmaking,'' it then becomes very clear he believes that liberal \njudges should hide their true intent.\n  That is an astounding proposition. It is unthinkable that someone who \nholds such a cynical view of the judiciary could obtain a lifetime \nappointment to one of the Nation's highest courts. What more assurance \ncould my colleagues have that Professor Barron views the Federal \njudiciary merely as a tool for liberal policymaking?\n  Consider another statement. The professor has suggested that \n``principled judicial interpretation may obstruct democratic \nconstitutional politics.''\n  Is that the sort of person who should be judging instead of \nlegislating? Comments such as these make it clear to me that this \nnominee has a ``whatever it takes'' judicial philosophy. He will \naggressively do whatever it takes to reach his desired progressive \npolicy outcomes.\n  Are any of my colleagues ready to vote for a judicial nominee who has \nhinted that ``principled judicial interpretation'' might occasionally \nneed to take a backseat to political considerations? It is in a body \nsuch as we are in right now--the Senate--where political considerations \nand policy considerations rule according to what our constituents tell \nus, but that is not something a judge takes into consideration.\n  The professor is an unabashed advocate of what he calls ``progressive \nfederalism.'' According to Professor Barron, the purpose of progressive \nfederalism is to ``promote national and local relations consistent with \na broader liberal political vision.''\n  Legislators are supposed to have political vision. Judges are \nsupposed to judge and not have political vision because they don't run \nfor office. Is that the type of individual we want on the Federal \nbench?\n  He has added:\n\n       Federalism is what we progressives make of it. Rehnquist \n     and his conservative colleagues have been making the most of \n     it for more than a decade. It's time for progressives to do \n     the same.\n\n  That is a pretty explicit example of his judicial philosophy. That \nphilosophy is that the courts are an instrument of leftist \npolicymaking. He sees the courts as basically a third political branch. \nThat view of the Federal judiciary is totally incompatible with the \nlimited role the Constitution assigns to the courts.\n  It should be clear to all Senators that if he is confirmed, the \nprofessor would bring an extreme progressive political agenda with him \nto the First Circuit. Political agendas belong in the Senate, not in \nthe First Circuit.\n  His academic work gives us some indication of the kind of judge he \nwould be. I would note that we had a hearing last week where some of my \ncolleagues on our Judiciary Committee expressed their frustration about \nthe nomination process. They remarked that every nominee who comes \nbefore a committee dutifully promises that he or she will objectively \nand dispassionately apply the law to the facts and respect precedent.\n  But my Democrat colleagues claim, after being confirmed, some \nnominees do not simply call the balls and the strikes. Let me assure my \ncolleagues that we don't need to guess at what kind of judge the \nprofessor would be. It is not a mystery. He makes no secret of it.\n  Let's take another look at his academic work. It is clear the \nprofessor wouldn't be bound by the law when deciding cases. He's \nadmitted as much. Professor Barron is an outcome-oriented legal \nthinker. He will select his desired progressive results and then find a \nway to get there. As I said, it is a ``whatever it takes'' judicial \nphilosophy.\n  Here is what the professor said about precedent and the doctrine of \nstare decisis: ``Any good lawyer knows how to distinguish a precedent, \nif you need to.''\n  You see, in the professor's world view, precedent is just an \ninconvenient obstacle that can be easily dismissed on the road to his \npreferred outcome. Can any of us doubt that as a judge the professor \nwould cleverly choose the precedents that he agrees with and ignore \nthose he disagrees with?\n\n  Let me give you some more evidence. He lost a case before the Supreme \nCourt 9 to 0. In other words, a unanimous vote against legal arguments \nthat the professor advocated. He told the press that the Supreme Court \n``got it wrong'' and that his brief ``was right after all.'' Imagine \nthat, being voted down 9 to 0 and saying the Supreme Court got it wrong \nbecause in the professor's judgment every member of the Supreme Court \ngot it wrong--but not our professor nominee. What does this statement \nsuggest that we can expect from him when it comes to his respect for \nlegal precedent? I don't think we can expect much. We cannot expect him \nto follow legal precedent because he disagrees with the Supreme Court \neven after they disagree with him 9 to 0.\n  There is more evidence the professor wouldn't be confined by the law \nin reaching the right outcome in a case. He has written that judicial \ndecisionmaking, guided by statutes and legal precedent, is ``awfully \ncramped and technical, because it doesn't reflect a broader legal \nculture.''\n  Now, get back to basics. I thought the role of a judge was to apply \nthe law, not to go fishing around for the ``broader legal culture'' \nuntil you find support for the result you want.\n  So I think we can be very clear. I don't expect President Obama to \nnominate conservatives to the Federal bench. When this President was \nelected, I didn't expect that a crop of young Scalias, Thomases, and \nAlitos would be filling the vacancies in our courts. Judicial nominees \nare a Presidential prerogative, and I voted for many of this \nPresident's judicial nominees who don't share my views on \nconstitutional interpretation or federalism or the First Amendment. I \nvoted for them because they were accomplished judges and lawyers who I \nbelieved could put their personal preferences aside once they took to \nthe bench. I would and did expect when I voted for them to objectively \nrule based upon the law; or, if I wasn't absolutely sure, I was willing \nto give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\n[[Page S3156]]\n\n  However, given the statements from this nominee's body of work that I \nhave recounted today, as well as others, I can't understand how any of \nmy colleagues could think the same about this nominee. In fact, I don't \nbelieve that I have seen a nominee who has been more candid about his \nor her desire to use the courts as an instrument of political ideology \nthan Professor Barron.\n  This nominee's views are fundamentally incompatible with the limited \nconstitutional role of the Federal courts. Here I want to go back to \nthe people who wrote the Constitution and tell you what they really had \nin mind about the courts. In Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton \nfamously referred to the judicial branch of government as ``the least \ndangerous branch,'' because in the constitutional vision of our \nFounders the courts would have ``neither force nor will, but merely \njudgment.'' The professor's judicial philosophy turns that vision on \nits head. His record reveals a judicial philosophy that says \nprogressive policy ends justify the legal means to get there. It is a \njudicial philosophy in which will trumps judgment. I don't share those \nviews, and I cannot vote for this nominee or a nominee who does.\n  Now I will take a few minutes to update my colleagues on another \naspect of this nominee that deals with the Barron drone materials and \nthe White House's apparent refusal to provide this body with every one \nof the Barron-related drone materials.\n  Two weeks ago I came to the floor calling on the Obama administration \nto release any and all Office of Legal Counsel materials on the drone \nprogram that were written by or related to the professor. I also called \nupon the administration to comply with the Second Circuit's opinion \nlast April ordering the Department of Justice to release a copy of the \n41-page Barron drone memo in redacted form. We know this particular \nmemo provides the legal arguments for targeted killing of American \ncitizens overseas.\n  Yet the administration refuses to comply with the court order of the \nSecond Circuit to make the arguments public, albeit in redacted form, \nand I haven't heard any indication that the administration intends to \ndo that. Not only that, but the White House refuses to tell us whether \nthey have made available to the full Senate all of the professor's \ndrone-related materials.\n  Since 2010, the press has reported that Professor Barron wrote at \nleast 2 memos that justified the Obama administration's drone policies \nwhile he was at the Office of Legal Counsel, and the Second Circuit \nsaid that there are at least 3 and possibly as many as 11 memos on the \nadministration's drone policy. That much is very clear. What isn't \nclear is the scope of the professor's writings on the legality of the \nadministration's drone program. We don't know this because the \nadministration continues to ignore the bipartisan demands of Members of \nthe Senate to make available all of those drone memos, particularly the \nones written by the professor. We don't know how many of the drone \nmemos exist because this administration refuses to even confirm whether \nthey have provided all the drone memos to the full Senate. These \nmaterials are of crucial importance to the full Senate's consideration \nof this nominee.\n  I would recount for my colleagues what has happened thus far. On May \n12, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said that a single drone \nmemo--what Carney referred to as the al-Awlaki memo--had been made \navailable to the full Senate. But the Press Secretary was asked \nrepeatedly how many drone memos exist, and he repeatedly dodged the \nquestion.\n  Here is what Mr. Carney said. Question: ``How many of them are \nthere?'' Mr. Carney answered:\n\n       What I can tell you is a couple of things. First, on the \n     Senator Paul op-ed in which he does call for the memos to be \n     made available to senators, we have made the memo available--\n     the memo in question available before the vote.\n\n  Again, the White House is dodging here and just addressing one memo. \nSo Mr. Carney was asked a second time at the news conference. The \nquestioner said: ``How many memos are there? How many memos in which he \n[meaning Barron] was a principal author outlining the legal case?''\n  Mr. Carney answers: ``There was one memo in question that I have \nreferred to, and that has been made available to U.S. Senators.''\n  So the questioner came back: ``Are there others?'' Mr. Carney, the \nPress Secretary, answers: ``Are there other memos that he [meaning \nBarron] drafted? I don't know.''\n  Now get this: An answer of ``I don't know'' to how many memos exist. \nThat is as good as the White House can do when there is this high level \nof discussion about how many memos exist? Surely there are people \nscrambling around the White House to have an answer, even if they don't \nwant to give the answer, because it is already obvious that they want \nto know what is going on themselves. But you still get the answer: I \ndon't know how many memos there are. That is the best answer we can get \nfrom the White House after weeks of bipartisan requests from Senators \nto provide the full Senate with any and all of the professor's drone \nmaterials. ``I don't know'' is simply not an acceptable response from \nthe White House.\n  Again, the White House seems to imply that it has provided all of the \nBarron-related memos on the drone program, but the fact of the matter \nis that they will not confirm that. Unfortunately, it appears many \nDemocrats as well as members of the media have fallen for this ruse. \nThe Second Circuit mentioned at least three memos that were responsive \nto the New York Times Freedom of Information Act request for materials \non killing Americans abroad. So we know that there are multiple drone \nmemos. That is a matter of public record.\n  Has anyone in this administration bothered to read the Second \nCircuit's opinion? We know that there are multiple memos on the drone \nprogram--as many as 11. As the New York Times has reported since 2010, \nthere are at least two drone memos that this nominee has written. But \nthere may be more. The best answer we have gotten so far is ``I don't \nknow.''\n  On May 14 the White House changed its tune just slightly. Another \nWhite House spokesperson told the press that the White House said it \nhad provided all of the Barron drone materials related to ``U.S. \ncitizens.''\n  But, again, the White House hasn't said whether there are additional \nmaterials that the professor wrote on the drone program. It is not at \nall clear to me why this administration thinks it has done its duty to \nprovide the full Senate with materials that are crucial to our \nconsideration of this nominee's fitness for a lifetime appointment, \nparticularly considering the fact that the White House should make at \nleast that one memo available to the public. It is similar to when \nPresident Jackson didn't like what John Marshall ruled in a particular \ncase; the Chief Justice ruled, now let him enforce it. Are we going to \nhave that respect for the circuit court opinion that says the White \nHouse ought to release to the public this decision? Is that the oath \nthe President of the United States took to uphold the Constitution?\n  Why does this administration think that any Senator would vote on a \njudicial nomination without having reviewed the nominee's work on such \nan important topic?\n  Moreover, as I mentioned 2 weeks ago, the Freedom of Information Act \nlitigation in the Second Circuit is still ongoing. Whatever responsive \nmemos that the administration has not yet released may become public in \nthe future. Again, are my colleagues ready to vote on this nomination \nwithout having reviewed all relevant writings of the nominee? Are my \ncolleagues ready to shrug their shoulders and accept the White House \nPress Secretary's statement when he says, ``I don't know'' how many \nmemos there are? Are my colleagues prepared to face their constituents \nand explain that they didn't bother to track down this controversial \nnominee's complete record on this topic before they voted?\n  The Constitution requires every Senator to provide advice and consent \non a nominee. We cannot satisfy that obligation if this administration \ncontinues to withhold the professor's writings. At the very least, the \nWhite House should say definitively that no additional Barron-related \ndrone materials exist. What are they hiding?\n  The Second Circuit says the professor is the author of the memo that \nsets forth the legal framework used to justify killing Americans \noverseas. What\n\n[[Page S3157]]\n\nelse has he written that the administration refuses to release to the \nfull Senate? The Members of this body will never know until the \nadministration ends the obstruction and provides access to each and \nevery one of the memos on drones that Professor Barron has written. \nAgain, the administration should comply with the Second Circuit's order \nrequiring them to make the opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel \npublic, even if it is with redactions.\n  Why the rush to have this vote before the public gets to read the \nlegal reasoning? Why is the other side so afraid of waiting to vote \nuntil their constituents read this nominee's legal rationale for the \ntargeted killing of American citizens?\n  It is time for the White House and the administration to stop playing \ngames regarding how many of the professor's memos there are. It is time \nfor the White House to stop hiding from the public the materials they \nhave been ordered by the court to disclose.\n  I will vote against this nominee and urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, under the order I ask unanimous consent \nfor 20 minutes to address the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3157-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3157-S3159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                BENGHAZI\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to urge Senator Reid to say a very \nclear no to the request by 37 Republicans that we create a new Senate \nselect committee on Benghazi. I was astounded to see 37 Republicans--\nmany of whom have worked on this issue with me and Senator Menendez on \nthe Foreign Relations Committee--essentially make this request at a \ntime when we have so much information already on Benghazi. To spend the \nfunds for this separate committee--in addition to the one the House has \nset up--doesn't make sense unless you believe, as I do, that this is \nall a political witch hunt.\n  The attacks of September 11, 2012, in Benghazi that took the lives of \nfour Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, were a tragedy. \nAfter such a tragedy, we should all come together and make certain that \nthis never happens again, but we should not play politics. Instead of \nfocusing and agreeing on how we can prevent future attacks against U.S. \npersonnel overseas--as they have had an opportunity to do by adding \nmore funding for diplomatic posts to protect our people--the \nRepublicans want to turn the Benghazi-Libya tragedy into a scandal. \nThat is scandalous. The way they are handling this issue is a scandal.\n  The American people are smart. I have seen recent polls, and they get \nit. More than 60 percent--and I will look that up again--say this is \nall about politics; it is not about anything else.\n  I wish to explain to the American people what we have done about this \ntragedy. Over the last 20 months, these attacks have received \nunprecedented scrutiny. I have a chart I wish to share that explains \nit.\n  We have had nine House and Senate investigations on Benghazi. We have \nconducted 17 hearings. We have held 50--5-0--briefings. We have \nconducted 25 interviews, issued 8 subpoenas, and reviewed 25,000 pages \nof documents. There are 25,000 pages of documents that have been \nreviewed. We have had six reports released. All of these little boxes \nrepresented here show the various hearings, the various committees, the \nvarious briefings, the various documents. We look at this chart and \nrealize this is unprecedented.\n\n  Nine different House and Senate committees have investigated the \nattacks. Seventeen hearings have been conducted. Fifty briefings have \ntaken place. Twenty-five transcribed interviews have been conducted. \nEight subpoenas have been issued. More than 25,000 pages of documents \nhave been reviewed, and 6 congressional reports have been released.\n  I have gone over this a couple of times this morning because I want \nto make sure the Record reflects all of this accurately.\n  In case that is not enough to convince the people of this country \nwhat a witch hunt the Republicans are on, I will show my colleagues a \npartial viewing of the materials, if my colleagues will excuse me while \nI bend down. That is just one stack of binders. All of these binders \nare filled--filled--with all of the information that came out of these \nreports.\n  So before people get up here and say, Oh, we need more information, \nhow about reading what we already have: stacks and stacks of \ninformation.\n  Within these binders are the reports and the testimony Congress has \nalready heard over the last 20 months, but my Republican friends would \nhave us believe none of this happened and none of what the chart \ndepicts happened. They are not satisfied with exhaustive reviews, much \nof which was conducted by House Republican committee Chairs, by the \nway. They walk away from their own work because they are playing \npolitics. They should be proud of the work they did, but this isn't \nabout the work they did. It is about playing politics. It is about \nhurting people--hurting people.\n  Benghazi was a tragedy. We lost four beautiful, patriotic Americans. \nDon't turn it into a scandal.\n  I guess these filled binders were not enough for them in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I will take these down now.\n  This wasn't enough for them: 9 committees, 17 hearings, 50 briefings, \n25 interviews, 8 subpoenas, 25,000 pages of documents, 6 reports. All \nof this was not enough for them. The House set up a new select \ncommittee and, again, 37 of my Republican friends now want their own \nselect committee. That is right; they want two new committees to \ninvestigate what has been investigated, investigated, and investigated.\n  A person doesn't need a degree in political science to know what a \npolitical witch hunt looks like. All a person needs to do is to look at \nthis and a person understands. This is a campaign tactic by my \nRepublican colleagues to gin up their base ahead of the midterm \nelection and, by the way, look ahead to 2016, where they are filled \nwith anxiety at the thought that the former Secretary of State, Hillary \nClinton, may be the Democratic nominee.\n  This is a campaign tactic, this call for these committees. We know \nRepublicans have been actively fundraising off this tragedy. That is \nright; they have been fundraising off this tragedy. When Speaker \nBoehner was asked about it, all he did was walk away from the question. \nI watched that interview. It was painful.\n  They said: Aren't you going to stop the fundraising?\n  He said: We are just interested in the facts.\n  They said: Aren't you going to stop this fundraising?\n  He said: We are just interested in the facts.\n  Answer the question. We know it is a political witch hunt because \nbefore he was minding his Ps and Qs, the House Select Committee \nchairman suggested the administration should be put on ``trial'' over \nBenghazi--put on trial.\n  We also know the House GOP refused House minority leader Nancy \nPelosi's offer to put an equal number of Democrats and Republicans on \nthe panel. Oh, no, because it is a political witch hunt and they want \ntotal control over that committee.\n  Here is one issue I know the select committee won't be investigating \nin the House, and that is the budget cuts House Republicans made to \nsecurity at our embassies and at our consulates, at our diplomatic \nposts around the world--cuts that Republicans actually boasted about \nmaking. Here in the Senate, we have tried to get through an embassy \nsecurity bill by unanimous consent and they objected I don't know how \nmany times--a couple of times.\n  So we are not going to see an investigation into why the Republicans \nthought it was wise to cut spending on embassy security. Oh, no, they \nwon't look at that. One Congressman in the House was asked by CNN \nwhether the GOP cut embassy security, because the reporter was \nincredulous, and this Congressman said: Absolutely. Look, we have to \nmake priorities and choices. You have to prioritize things. So, \nclearly, this particular Member of Congress was proud they cut embassy \nsecurity; but, believe me, they are not\n\n[[Page S3158]]\n\ngoing to be investigating that in their investigative committee.\n  I will tell my colleagues what else they are not going to \ninvestigate. They are not going to investigate the tragedy and the \nscandal of more than 4,000 Americans killed in the Iraq war based on \nphony intelligence--4,000 Americans dead, based on phony intelligence. \nI never heard one call for a select committee to find out why that \nhappened. And that ignores the tens of thousands of wounded, some with \npost-traumatic stress, and all the problems we know are happening.\n  Here is something else they won't tell us. Between 1998 and 2013, \nthere were at least 501 significant attacks against U.S. diplomatic \nfacilities and personnel in 70 countries, resulting in the deaths of \n586 people, including 67 Americans. During the Bush administration, \nthere were 166 attacks which killed 116 people, including 18 Americans. \nAll of these attacks were terrible tragedies, but not one of them was \nexploited for political gain. Why would we exploit a tragedy where an \nAmerican got killed for political gain? We could have done it.\n  I was serving in the House back in 1983. I know that is probably \nclose to when the Presiding Officer was born. I was serving in the \nHouse in 1983 when a truck bomb exploded outside the Marine barracks in \nBeirut, Lebanon, killing 241 American servicemembers. The attack came \njust 6 months after 17 Americans were killed in the bombing of the U.S. \nEmbassy in Beirut. Let me tell my colleagues about how that was handled \nby then-Speaker Tip O'Neill when Ronald Reagan was President. Tip \nO'Neill conducted real oversight with the two parties working closely \ntogether. Within 2 months, the House stepped forward--Democrats and \nRepublicans--and produced a report that criticized the lax security \naround the barracks and called for new measures to keep our brave \nmilitary men and women safe. That is the way we should handle these \nthings, not a kangaroo court, not a political witch hunt, not a \npartisan investigation.\n  Let's face it. This is politics. They are about discrediting the \nObama administration and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. I \nrepeat: Never in history, to my knowledge--and I have gone back and \nback--has any political party done what they are doing on Benghazi.\n  There is disinformation. They say: Well, the President kept saying it \nwas because of the movie that was produced. The President stepped \nforward and in his first comment said the attacks were acts of terror. \nThat is his quote. We never hear that from the Republicans. He called \nthem acts of terror.\n  I will tell my colleagues what else they forget to mention: that \nSecretary Clinton was the first person to convene an independent \ninvestigation of the attacks. Let me reiterate. The very first person \nto convene an independent investigation of the attacks in Benghazi was \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n  The independent investigation was nonpartisan. It was called an \ninvestigation by the Accountability Review Board. It was chaired by \nAmbassador Thomas Pickering and Admiral Michael Mullen. Talk about a \nnonpartisan team. I can attest to the fact they are nonpartisan. I am \nprivileged to sit on the Foreign Relations Committee. I am the most \nsenior member on that committee. I will tell my colleagues these two \ngentlemen came forward and delivered their report. They talked very \nopenly and honestly about the systemic problems that undermined \nsecurity in Benghazi. And guess what happened after that report. \nSecretary Clinton and the State Department quickly accepted all 29 of \nthose recommendations and put them into place--first under Secretary \nClinton and now Secretary Kerry.\n  So let me say this again. There is this call for this political witch \nhunt because they want to hurt Hillary Clinton, and Hillary Clinton was \nthe first person to convene an independent investigation that made 29 \nrecommendations that she started to put in place, and Secretary Kerry \nis completing that task. Unbelievable. But we won't hear that from our \nRepublican friends. They want to make Benghazi into a scandal, but they \nare the scandal. That is the scandal: playing politics with a tragedy. \nThat is the scandal.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee produced a bipartisan report based \non dozens of committee hearings, briefings, and interviews--that is in \nhere as well--that highlighted the need to better respond to security \nthreats against our diplomatic posts and personnel around the world.\n  Instead of going over all of these reports--I showed my colleagues \nhow many there are, and this chart demonstrates that as well in a very \nclear way how many investigations that have been conducted--instead of \nfocusing on protecting Americans serving abroad by carrying out the \nrecommendations of these reports, my colleagues are obsessing over \ntalking points prepared for a Sunday TV show.\n  There is nothing in the thousands of documents released that even \nremotely suggests an attempt to cover up what happened in Benghazi. As \nI said, the President said they were acts of terror. Hillary Clinton \nlaunched the investigation. The investigation made 29 recommendations.\n  This new select committee request is a sham. It is a kangaroo court. \nIt is a waste of taxpayer dollars. If Senate Republicans really wanted \nto help protect the men and women who bravely serve our country \noverseas, they would stop objecting to our request to take up our \nbipartisan embassy security bill.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed S. 1386. It is named \nafter Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, and Glen Doherty. It is \ncalled the Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, and Glen Doherty \nEmbassy Security Threat Mitigation and Personnel Protection Act.\n  It was passed and reported in December of last year. It was authored \nby Senators Menendez and Corker. I thank them for that. This bill will \nauthorize funding for key measures recommended by the Accountability \nReview Board, including security upgrades at our embassies, consulates, \nand other diplomatic posts, especially high-risk posts. It also \nauthorizes new funding for security training, including language \ntraining for high-threat security environments. It would direct the \nSecretary of State to expand the Marine Corps security guard detachment \nprogram to help protect our diplomatic facilities and personnel.\n  Why do the Republicans keep objecting to this bill? You cannot, with \na straight face, tell me you truly care about our foreign personnel \nwhen you stand in the way of S. 1386, a bill to provide for enhanced \nsecurity, a bill that is bipartisan, a bill that came out of the \ncommittee on which I serve, Foreign Relations.\n  I hope other colleagues will come down and talk about this sham. We \nhave so much to do. We need to grieve for the families, the deaths of \nfour Americans. Their loss is deep, very deep. To turn that into some \ninvestigation, some witch hunt, is not the right thing to do for their \nmemories. The right thing to do for their memories is to pass this \nembassy security bill.\n  I do not know how to say it, but it does cost money to make upgrades \nto your home, to your buildings. We are here in the Capitol, we protect \nand upgrade these beautiful buildings because of their history. We have \nto upgrade our buildings. That does not come free. It does cost money.\n  Yet House Republicans were bragging that they cut embassy security. \nSo I am going to talk about this a lot because I care so deeply about \nmaking sure our personnel are safe all over the world. Until they allow \nthis bill to go through, I truly question the deep concerns that are \nbeing expressed by my Republican friends. Oh, they need yet another \ncommittee to get to the bottom of Benghazi.\n  We know what happened. It was a terror attack on a facility that \nneeded more protection. OK? How do we make sure that does not happen \nagain? We have had more than 500 attacks--significant attacks--on our \nfacilities since 1998, between 1998 and 2013 over 500 attacks.\n  Never has anyone of any party tried to play politics with it. The \nreason I am so, shall we say, upset with this is because it is the \nwrong way to move forward. People look at us and they wonder if we can \nget anything done. I am so proud. I have a very important water \nresources bill coming up. We worked so well together across the aisle. \nWe did a highway bill. We worked so well across the aisle. Why don't we \ndo what we did when Tip O'Neill was\n\n[[Page S3159]]\n\nSpeaker and work well across the aisle on foreign policy? When I was \ncoming up, foreign policy basically stopped at the water's edge. We \nrespected the President, whoever it may be, Republican or Democrat.\n  If we had a critique, we expressed it, but we did it in a way that \nwas, if I can just say, less partisan. I will leave you with the image \nof this chart. This chart says it all. We have investigated this. We \nhave looked at it. We have conducted hearings and briefings and \ninterviews and issued subpoenas and reviewed documents and issued \nreports.\n  We do not need to spend money on another committee because someone is \nafraid of Hillary Clinton's candidacy. Just deal with it. Do not try to \nrevise history. She was the first person to convene an independent \ninvestigation to begin to put the pieces into play that would in fact \nmake sure this did not happen again.\n  Don't say you care about embassy security when you stand and oppose a \nbipartisan bill that would make sure we make the requisite improvements \nto our facilities? I hope Harry Reid, our leader, will not say yes to a \ncommittee that is nothing but a political witch hunt. I will continue \nto come down to the floor to discuss this issue, to debate this issue \nif it is necessary to do so.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there were two polls that were released \nthis week, one from Gallup and one from Politico. Both polls asked \nAmericans what concerns them the most. Both polls got the same answer: \nthe economy, jobs, and health care.\n  That response is not too surprising. Unemployment is high. In fact, \nthere are 3\\1/2\\ million Americans who have been unemployed for 6 \nmonths or longer. Last month more than 800,000 Americans gave up hope \nof finding work and dropped out of the labor force entirely. The \neconomy barely grew at all last quarter--one-tenth of 1 percent.\n  Household income is down by $3,500 since the President took office. \nSome 6.7 million Americans have fallen into poverty since 2008. \nMeanwhile, the price of everything from gas to college to health care \nkeeps going up. It is no wonder Americans list jobs and the economy as \ntwo of the issues that concern them the most.\n  It is not surprising that the other top concern of Americans is \nhealth care, because over the past 4 years the President and his team \nhave taken an imperfect health care system and made it much worse. \nThanks to ObamaCare, millions of Americans have lost their health care \nplans, plans which in many cases they liked and wanted to keep.\n  Many of the 8 million exchange signups the President likes to brag \nabout were actually people who were forced into the exchanges after \ntheir health care plans were canceled. In fact, according to a recent \nMcKinsey survey, only one-quarter of the people who signed up on the \nexchanges were previously uninsured. In addition to losing their plans, \nmillions of Americans have also seen their costs increase.\n  Family health insurance premiums, which the President claimed would \nfall by $2,500 under his health care law, have actually risen by \n$3,671, and they are still going up, no end in sight. I would like to \nread just a few of the headlines from last week. This is from the \nFiscal Times. It says, ``Big Increases in ObamaCare Premiums and \nDeductibles Coming in November;'' from Forbes, ``First ObamaCare \nPremium Notices for 2015 Show Double Digit Increases;'' from the Los \nAngeles Times, ``Employer health costs to rise nearly 9% this year, \nsurvey finds;'' from Investors Business Daily, ``ObamaCare Deductibles \nto Rise to $6,600 by 2015;'' from the Associated Press, ``Cost-Control \nPlan for Health Care Could Cost You.''\n  There are more, but we get the idea. Prices are not on their way \ndown; they are in fact on their way up. Then of course there is the \nPresident's ``if you like your doctor, you'll be able to keep your \ndoctor'' promise. As too many Americans have found out, that was \nanother promise destined to be broken. Over the past 4 years, Americans \nhave not only discovered that in many cases they will no longer be able \nto see the doctors they have been seeing for years, they have also \ndiscovered their choice of a replacement is limited.\n  The New York Times reported last week:\n\n       In the midst of all of the turmoil in health care these \n     days, one thing is becoming clear. No matter what kind of \n     health plan consumers choose, they will find fewer doctors \n     and hospitals in their network or pay much more for the \n     privilege of going to any provider they want.\n\n  That is from the New York Times. One quote in that article struck me \nparticularly. It was something Marcus Merz, the CEO of Minnesota \ninsurer PreferredOne, told the Times. This is what he said:\n\n       We have to break people away from the choice habit that \n     everyone has. . . . We're all trying to break away from this \n     fixation on open access and broad networks.\n\n  Let me repeat that to get the full context of what he is saying. We \nhave to break people away from the choice habit that everyone has. Is \nthis what we wanted out of health care reform? Was that not one of the \ngood things about our health care system, the fact that people are able \nto, by and large, go to the doctor they chose; that people could look \naround for the best doctor in a particular field or find a doctor who \nthey felt comfortable with?\n\n  Do we really want a health care future where Americans don't have a \nchoice about the doctor they see?\n  Limited choice doesn't just mean that Americans might not be able to \nfind a doctor they like. It also means that Americans may not be able \nto go to a doctor they need.\n  A Daily Caller article from last week noted:\n\n       Cancer centers, with their top-of-the-line physicians and \n     expensive procedures, have been a primary casualty of narrow \n     networks. According to an Associated Press analysis, just \n     four of the top 19 comprehensive cancer centers are covered \n     by all Obamacare exchange plans in their states.\n\n  Four of the top 19 cancer centers in the country--that is not what \nyou want from of a health insurance plan if you have cancer.\n  Given the President's broken promises and the havoc that ObamaCare is \nwreaking on our health care system, it is no surprise that 83 percent \nof those Politico surveyed want to modify or repeal the law entirely or \nthat health care was the most frequently cited reason for a negative \nexperience with the government over the past year or that nearly 90 \npercent of respondents say that ObamaCare will be important in \ndetermining how they vote this fall.\n  There is a lot more that could be said about ObamaCare, such as the \ndamage it is doing to our economy.\n\n\n                            Veterans Affairs\n\n  I want to move on to talk about another, very serious instance of \ngovernment mismanagement--what is going on in the Department of \nVeterans Affairs.\n  Almost every day a new report surfaces of mistreatment or \nmismanagement at VA facilities across the country. At least 40 veterans \nhave reportedly died because of delayed or inadequate care.\n  It is now clear that this is not an isolated problem at a few select \nlocations but a system-wide crisis, and it is a national embarrassment.\n  Our contract with our servicemen and women is a sacred trust. They \npledge their lives in the service of our country and take upon \nthemselves the burden of defending liberty for the rest of us. In \nreturn, we promised them benefits, including health care and a college \neducation.\n  Our men and women in uniform uphold their end of the contract, \nsometimes at the cost of their own lives. For us to fail to uphold ours \nis a disgrace and a betrayal of their sacrifice.\n  Every resource of this administration should be focused on \ndiscovering the full scope of this problem and immediately starting to \nfix it. Yet this administration has shown a startling lack of concern \nabout the widespread mistreatment of veterans in our country.\n  When it became clear that his health care Web site was a disaster, \nthe President employed an ``all hands on deck''\n\n[[Page S3160]]\n\napproach to fixing the problem, spending hundreds of millions of \ndollars in the process.\n  In response to the VA disaster, on the other hand, the President has \ndispatched just a single staffer to oversee the investigation. This is \nnot acceptable. As Commander in Chief our Armed Forces, the President \nshould be leading the charge to fix this problem, but he hasn't even \nspoken publicly about it for weeks.\n  Regardless of the President's inaction, Congress must take immediate \nstep to address this crisis. This week the House of Representatives is \ntaking up a version of Senator Rubio's bill, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs Management Accountability Act, which would allow the VA \nSecretary to fire or demote senior executives in the department when \nwarranted.\n  Private organizations can fire employees who fail to fulfill their \nresponsibilities. We ought to be able to fire officials who fail in \ntheir obligation to our veterans.\n  Yet all we have seen from the VA is the resignation of the Under \nSecretary for Health, Dr. Petzel, who was already planning to retire--\nhardly the accountability our veterans deserve.\n  I have introduced a bill to require the VA inspector general to \nconduct a national investigation into the wait times veterans face. It \nis essential that we get an idea of the full scope of this problem so \nwe can ensure that it gets fully fixed.\n  Under my bill the inspector general will have 6 months to investigate \nand submit a report to Congress. In the meantime, the VA would be \nforbidden from closing any of its medical facilities.\n  No facility--not the Hot Springs facility in my State of South Dakota \nor any other--should be closed unless we make very sure that veterans' \ncare is not going to be affected.\n  There are other bills this body should be considering as well, \nincluding Senator Heller's bipartisan legislation, to reduce the \nbacklog of veterans' disability claims, and I hope the Senate will take \nthem up quickly.\n  This crisis can't wait. There is every likelihood that right now--\nright now--veterans around our country are still failing to receive the \ncare they need. I hope the President of the United States will come to \nhis senses and treat this situation with the seriousness it deserves.\n  If he won't act, Congress must. It is the very least that we owe our \nveterans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Ms. Heitkamp).

Madam President, this year Congress has not particularly \nbeen noted for much of an accomplishment of anything. We have been in \ncloture atrophy and we have been in political atrophy, but we are about \nto change that for a day.\n  I want to pause for a moment and acknowledge the hard work of a \nnumber of Members in the House and the Senate on what is known as the \nWater Resources Development Act, which soon will be on the floor of the \nSenate, and I understand will be on the floor of the House today for \nits ratification.\n  The Water Resources Development Act is the authority of the U.S. \nGovernment to move forward on infrastructure across the country.\n  I congratulate Chairman Shuster in the House and Chairman Boxer in \nthe Senate for their hard work on the conference committee.\n  Ranking Member Vitter has been an untold hero for us and working hard \nfor the Senate.\n  I give thanks to Sylvia Burwell of the OMB. She has been a lifesaver \nfor us on the Port of Savannah. I appreciate her cooperation and her \nhelp.\n  I thank Vice President Biden. We did a tour of ports on the east \ncoast of the United States to focus on the importance of improving our \ninfrastructure.\n  In this WRDA bill are improvements across the country, but the one I \nwant to talk about for a second is an example of why infrastructure is \nso important, and that is expansion of the Savannah Harbor and the \ndeepening project in the Savannah at the Port of Savannah. That is a \nproject that was authorized 16 years ago--the year I was elected to the \nHouse of Representatives. It was authorized to be built, but it hasn't \nbeen expanded for 16 years or authorized for 16 years because of \nenvironmental concerns, atmospheric concerns, sometimes funding \nconcerns, and sometimes political apathy concerns. But finally everyone \nhas their act together. NOAA has endorsed it, Fish and Wildlife has \nendorsed it, the EPA has endorsed it, and the Corps of Engineers has \nendorsed it.\n  Thanks to this Water Resources Development Act authorization, a $706 \nmillion project in my State for the southeastern United States will \nbecome a reality over the next 5 years.\n  Why is it important? It is important for this reason. As we sit and \ntalk today, the nation of Panama is widening and deepening the Panama \nCanal. Within a few months, they are going to be taking through the \nPanamax ships of the 21st century, ships that can carry not 9,000, not \n11,000 but 14,000 containers.\n  Ports along the east coast of the United States, such as the Port of \nSavannah, are not able to take that deep of a ship. They will have to \nwait until high tide to bring it in and then have to wait a day for \nhigh tide to come back to take the ship out. That costs money, and it \ncauses people to divert to other ports, to other countries, and it \nhurts our economy.\n  Over the next 5 years as we deepen the Savannah River and Savannah \nHarbor, and as we improve that port, we are improving the opportunity \nfor the entire southeastern United States to grow, prosper, and be \ncompetitive in the 21st century. The Port of Savannah directly \ncontributes to 297,000 jobs in our State. It contributes to 49 of the \n50 States on the continental United States. It provides jobs, economic \nvitality, tax revenues, and prosperity for America. Its time has come.\n  I am so delighted the Water Resources Development Act is done. I am \nso delighted that Chairman Boxer, Ranking Member Vitter, and Chairman \nShuster have put their teams together, dotted the last ``i'' and \ncrossed the last ``t.''\n  I encourage everybody in the Senate to ratify prosperity, employment, \nand economic development for America. When the bill comes before the \nSenate, ratify the Water Resources Development Act and that final \nconference committee report.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3160-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3160-S3161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. REED. I rise to discuss again the urgent need to restore \nemergency unemployment insurance.\n  Like many Americans, I am hopeful about our future but concerned \nabout how the great recession has impacted our fellow Americans, \nparticularly those who have been hit the hardest--the long-term \nunemployed. These are good people from all walks of life, from all 50 \nStates. They are people who work in a variety of fields, from high tech \nto manufacturing, from cubicles and offices to plants and factory \nfloors.\n  Many of them are older and find themselves out of work for the first \ntime in decades. All of them, all 2.78 million of them, lost out on \nDecember 28 of last year. While they have been looking for jobs, \nCongress has failed to do its job and restore unemployment insurance.\n  Previously, Congress had never let emergency benefits expire when the \nlong-term unemployment rate was so high. Today's long-term unemployment \nrate is 2.2 percent, and it is still well over the highest rate, 1.3 \npercent, of previous expirations.\n  In the past, when the rate was this high for long-term unemployment, \nwe maintained these benefits. This is still an emergency, and we have \nto maintain these benefits. It still requires our attention and swift \nbipartisan action.\n  To the Senate's credit, there has been bipartisan action. Thanks to \nmy Republican colleague from Nevada, Senator Dean Heller, and a \ncoalition of 10 Senators--5 Democrats and 5 Republicans--the Senate \npassed a 5-month extension of these vital benefits that would provide \naid to job seekers who have been searching for work for more than 26 \nweeks. Senators on both sides of the aisle recognize this is the right \nthing to do for workers and the smart thing to do for our economy.\n\n[[Page S3161]]\n\n  So the Senate responded and found a path forward, and it was a \ndifficult path. Majority leader Harry Reid dedicated a vast amount of \nfloor time. Our bipartisan coalition reached a true compromise and \nstuck together on vote after vote. On April 7, 43 days ago, the full \nSenate approved the measure.\n  Unfortunately, Speaker Boehner and the House Republicans in charge \nhave refused to take up our bipartisan legislation or pass their own \nextension of these emergency efforts. Because of their obstruction, \nmillions of Americans are hurting.\n  We need to get our country back to full unemployment. That is the \nfundamental answer--to place people in jobs.\n  We have to move the country to a place where all Americans have an \nopportunity to earn a living and build a better life for their \nfamilies.\n  Some may be tempted to look at the latest unemployment numbers and \nsay: Well, see, ending job benefits is working because the numbers seem \nto be falling.\n  That notion is simply not supported by the facts. This long-term \nunemployment problem is still, as I mentioned, of significant \nproportions, and those are precisely the people who benefit from \nextended unemployment benefits.\n  A recent study by the Illinois Department of Employment Security \nfound that four of five Illinois workers who lost long-term \nunemployment benefits at the end of last year were still without work 2 \nmonths later. They are still struggling in a very difficult market.\n  I would agree with the director of this State agency who says: \n``Economic conditions should determine when this safety-net program \nends, not an arbitrary date on the calendar. ``\n  The economic conditions for the long-term unemployed are still \nperilous, and it is still an emergency. The Speaker's refusal to renew \nemergency unemployment insurance makes it even harder for struggling \nAmericans to feed their families, and it does nothing to improve our \neconomic outlook.\n  The Senate-passed bill was fully offset and included, in fact, \ndeficit reduction. So the idea that it was too expensive doesn't hold \nwater.\n  The fact that House Republicans are now moving $300 billion worth of \nbudget-busting tax breaks, many of which flow to corporations, but \nrefuse to renew emergency benefits for job seekers strikes many people, \nincluding myself, as not just an unfair double standard but as out of \nstep with what we need to do to get this economy moving forward.\n  Let me again remind everyone, we had a fully paid-for unemployment \nextension bill on a bipartisan basis that actually resulted in some \ndeficit reduction and the House has refused to take it up. But in the \nmeantime, they are moving $300 billion worth of tax cuts and tax breaks \nover several years, which flow to corporations, and all of it unpaid \nfor.\n  So for the sake of job seekers in our economy, I hope House \nRepublicans will stop obstructing emergency aid to job seekers. They \nneed to take up the bipartisan Senate agreement to restore these \nbenefits and work with us on strengthening our economic recovery. Just \ngive the bill an up-or-down vote and give millions of American job \nseekers the chance to get back on their feet. In fact, I am confident \nif there were an up-or-down vote it would pass the House. It is \nfiscally responsible, fully paid for, it provides assistance to people \nand families who desperately need it, and would help the economic \nclimate in every State in this country.\n  They can attach measures to the bill if they want. That is their \nprerogative. But let us go ahead and get a bill passed, and if we need \nto resolve the bill between the House and Senate, let us do so. \nRefusing a vote is irresponsible. The American people deserve better, \nand I hope they will see better in the coming days ahead.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, the steady trickle of allegations \nsurrounding abuses of our veterans has turned from a trickle into a \nmonsoon. It seems every day that goes by there is an additional bad \nnews story about appointment lists that have been\n\n[[Page S3162]]\n\ncooked to look like the waiting times were not as long as they were, \nallegations such as those at the Veterans' Administration hospital in \nPhoenix, where allegedly there were secret waiting lists where 40 \nveterans died waiting to get health care, and the secret waiting list \nwas being created to make the backlog appear not as serious as it was.\n  As we discuss and debate all the numbers on wait times and backlogs, \nit is important as always, whenever we are talking about statistics and \nnumbers, to remember these are real human beings and these are our \nveterans with real individual stories.\n  They represent people such as Dale Richardson, who is a Vietnam \nveteran from East Texas who died of cancer after reportedly waiting 2 \nmonths to hear back from the VA about scheduling chemotherapy \ntreatments. They represent people such as Thomas Breen, a Navy veteran \nwho, similar to Mr. Richardson, died of cancer after a 2-month period \nin which he reportedly waited in vain to hear back from the VA about an \nappointment time. They also represent people such as Edward Laird whose \nstory was written up in the Los Angeles Times this last weekend. Mr. \nLaird is a Navy veteran, age 76, who discovered a couple of unusual \nmarks on his nose, and so he went to the doctor at the Phoenix VA \nhospital to get it checked out, and according to the Los Angeles Times, \nthe doctor said he needed a biopsy, but it took almost 2 years before \nMr. Laird was allowed to see a VA specialist, and when he finally did \nget to see the specialist, he was told that the biopsy was unnecessary \nand so it wasn't done.\n  Mr. Laird found it hard to believe, but that is what they told him. \nUnfortunately, by the time he got the VA hospital in Phoenix to agree \nto see him--the situation with his nose which he could tell as simply a \nlayman had gotten worse--Mr. Laird was ultimately diagnosed with cancer \nand literally half of his nose had to be taken off because of cancer.\n  As Mr. Laird told the Los Angeles Times: ``I have no nose, and I have \nto put an ice cream stick up my nose at night so I can breathe.''\n  I will just mention one other story from the Phoenix system. Earlier \nthis month a woman named Kim Sertich told the Arizona Republic that her \nfather received such poor care at the Phoenix VA that she was forced to \npay for private care until he ultimately died in 2011. In her own \nwords, she said:\n\n       Whenever anyone asked how my father died, I say, ``From \n     being in the VA hospital.'' The icing on the cake is when I \n     received a letter of condolence from the hospital, and they \n     had the wrong name for my dad.\n\n  It is obvious from anecdote to anecdote, from the drip, drip, drip \nthat then turns into a flood, there is something terribly wrong with \nthe health care and the way the Veterans' Administration is \nadministering 589,000 claims, with more than half of them backlogged, \naccording to the standards and criteria of the Veterans' \nAdministration.\n  We have known that the backlog has been a problem for years. Indeed, \nwe have tried to come together in a bipartisan way and legislatively \nthrough the national defense authorization bill, where we added money. \nWe have added resources to the VA system. Obviously, we have not gotten \nto the bottom of the problem. Part of it, I am afraid, is systemic, and \nsome of it, sadly, is part of the bureaucratic culture at the VA, where \naccountability is unknown. You don't get credit for doing a good job. \nYou don't get demerits for doing a bad job. There is no accountability, \nand this is what you get without accountability.\n  Not only is the VA system failing to provide our military heroes with \nreliable health care that they deserve, there are also news reports \nthat the VA across the country has been falsifying appointment data in \nhopes of covering up wait times. Sadly, some of those allegations have \ncome from my State. We have allegations of data manipulation of these \nappointment times in Austin, where I live, and Harlingen, in South \nTexas, and San Antonio and Waco.\n  For that matter, a former VA doctor named Richard Krugman told the \nWashington Examiner that up to 15,000 VA patients in South Texas were \neither denied colonoscopies,--of course, those are cancer screening \nexaminations--or they were forced to endure long, pointless delays. Dr. \nKrugman fears that many of those patients simply died awaiting their \ncancer screening or awaiting treatment. If the problems at the VA are \njust a fraction as serious as what they appear from the news reports \nthat we see day in and day out or the stories I recounted today, if \nthey are a fraction as severe as what they appear to be, we have a \nnational scandal of the highest order.\n  Let's be clear about what is happening. U.S. military veterans are \nliterally dying because of bureaucratic failures and in some instances \nbureaucratic fraud. There is simply no excuse for what reportedly \nhappened in Harlingen, Phoenix or in any of the cities where veterans \nor veterans officials have made their allegations. Yet it disturbs me \nthat I am not sure the President is taking this with the requisite \nurgency. Apparently it is in the talking points to say, when somebody \nraises this scandal--I think Jay Carney said the President is mad as \nhell. That is what Eric Shinseki said when he testified before the \nSenate Veterans' Affairs Committee last week, but that is, frankly, not \ngood enough. We need less rhetoric and more action.\n  For starters, the President has still not demanded the resignation of \nthe person in charge of the Department of Veterans Affairs. We all \nadmire General Shinseki for his service in the U.S. Army, but he on his \nwatch has presided over some of the biggest scandals at the VA in \nhistory. It is painfully clear, no matter what you think about General \nShinseki--and I admire him for his service in the Army, but it is \npainfully clear the VA needs a fresh new set of eyes, new leadership, \nin order to recover, reform, and regain the confidence of America's \nveterans.\n  President Obama still stands by his VA Secretary while nothing seems \nto be happening. Yes, we read about where there is an audit here, audit \nthere, but we need top-to-bottom review and reform and we need to see \nthe VA once again regain America's confidence.\n  It is not just me who is saying this. One of the largest veterans \naffairs organizations in America, the American Legion, has called on \nSecretary Shinseki to step down and new leadership to be appointed.\n  Here is just another example of the administration's unserious \nresponse to this scandal. The person who has been nominated to serve as \nthe VA Under Secretary of Health, Dr. Murawsky, currently oversees a VA \nhealth care system in Illinois that was recently rocked by all-too-\nfamiliar allegations of secret waiting lists. I note that Dr. Murawsky \nspent 2 years as the direct supervisor of Sharon Helman, who worked in \nthe Great Lakes Health Care System before becoming Director of the \nPhoenix system. As we all know, Ms. Helman was placed on administrative \nleave after the Phoenix VA was charged with creating secret waiting \nlists of its own.\n  For these reasons I asked President Obama to withdraw Dr. Murawsky's \nnomination. We need a clean break. We need new leadership, a fresh set \nof eyes, and we need a sense of urgency in what is a growing scandal. \nAs I said a moment ago, if even a fraction of these failures and abuses \nwere true, it would represent a national scandal of the highest order. \nIt is not enough for the VA Secretary to say, I am ``mad as hell.'' \nThat doesn't solve anybody's problems. That doesn't fix what is broken \nin the VA health care system. What America's veterans want and deserve \nis bold reform and new leadership. President Obama has the power to \nmake that happen, and it is long past time for him to use it.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3162-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am here to talk about the future of \nour country and the future of our middle class, which I know the \nPresiding Officer cares deeply about as well.\n  A few years ago in Michigan something quite extraordinary happened. \nIn 1914 a man named Henry Ford did\n\n[[Page S3163]]\n\nsomething that all his business friends said was crazy. He doubled the \nwages of his workers to $5 a day. The headlines at that time showed \nthat those on Wall Street literally thought he was going to ruin the \neconomy, and everyone said he was going to go under. It was the \ncraziest thing they had ever seen.\n  Exactly the opposite happened. In fact, there were stories a month \nafter he did this--by the way, tens of thousands of people showed up \nfor these jobs. Around the plant there were newspaper interviews about \nhow all the small businesses had seen their profits double and how they \nwere hiring new people for the hotdog stand or the clothing \nentrepreneur who was selling shoes and suits, and so on. Small \nbusinesses said that it had been wonderful for them.\n  We all know what happened to Henry Ford. He went on to become one of \nthe wealthiest men of his generation by doing the right thing and \nunderstanding that we all do better if everybody has a fair shot to \nmake it and that he would do better as a business person if everybody \nhad a shot. In fact, we are very proud, and we believe we started the \nmiddle class in Detroit, MI.\n  We celebrate success in this country. We also understand that we are \nall in this together--our family, our community, and our country. We \ncan do great things by ourselves, but ultimately what makes us great as \nAmericans is that we are connected and in it together. That is the idea \non which America was built. Everybody contributes their fair share, and \nwe give everybody a fair shot to work hard and get ahead in life.\n  Just like Henry Ford, we understand that the economy is not working--\nour country is not as strong as it could be--unless it is working for \neveryone and not just the wealthy few.\n  In fact, Henry Ford showed that you can become very wealthy yourself \nby doing the right thing. We now have choices to make. Unfortunately, \ntoday a small number of incredibly rich people are doing the opposite \nof what Henry Ford did. They are literally trying to buy a government \nthat works only for them at the expense of every other American.\n  The Supreme Court's outrageous Citizens United decision and other \ndecisions that have followed have paved the way for multimillionaires \nto spend secret money on fake front groups and hundreds of millions of \ndollars on television and radio ads to twist the facts or just make \nthings up so they can impose their own extreme views on our country.\n  I want to speak about the two people who are at the forefront of this \neffort and what their views mean for the people I represent in \nMichigan, the people in Wisconsin, and the future of middle class \nfamilies all across America. The Koch brothers, two petrochemical \nmagnates, are reportedly now worth over $100 billion. Last month, their \nfortune grew by $1.3 billion in just 1 day. How many average Americans \nwould work a lifetime--added up together across the country--to try to \nreach the $1.3 billion they made in a day? They have built what the \nWashington Post called ``a far-reaching operation of unrivaled \ncomplexity, built around a maze of groups that cloak its donors'' in \nsecrecy. This ``maze of groups'' raised $400 million in 2012.\n  Just last week we found out one of the groups, Americans for \nProsperity, plans to spend $125 million in secret, undisclosed money in \nthis year's election alone--$125 million on people who support their \nviews of America.\n  One expert on taxes and political groups, a professor at Notre Dame \nLaw School, said he had never seen anything like the network of Koch \ngroups before. He said:\n\n       It is designed to make it opaque as to where the money is \n     coming from and where the money is going . . . It would only \n     be worth it if you were spending the kind of dollars the Koch \n     brothers are, because this was not cheap.\n\n  These are front groups that pose as senior citizen groups, \nenvironmental groups, and veterans groups. I could go on and on about \nall of the fake groups through which they are funneling money.\n  The Koch brothers may be able to hide their money and hide behind \nshadowy groups, but they can't hide their radical views from the \nAmerican people. Let me be clear. It is not only me who is saying they \nare being radical. Charles Koch described his own views as ``radical.''\n  Senator Sanders recently spoke on the Senate floor about some of the \nKoch brothers' extreme anti-middle-class views. I want to thank him for \nshedding light on some ideas that I know the vast majority of Americans \ndisagree with and many of us find frightening, frankly, for the future \nof our country.\n  We don't have to guess what these views are since David Koch ran for \nVice President on the Libertarian ticket in 1980 and loudly trumpeted \nthem for all to see. What did David Koch promise to do when he ran for \nthe second-highest office in the country? He promised to end the \n``fraudulent, virtually bankrupt, and increasingly oppressive Social \nSecurity system,'' which has lifted a generation of seniors out of \npoverty and given them dignity as they have moved on over the years.\n  He promised to abolish Medicare and Medicaid. By the way, the \nmajority of Medicaid funds is used on low-income seniors in nursing \nhomes. He promised to get rid of the post office. He didn't suggest \nthat it be cut it back to 5 days a week, he wanted to get rid of it. I \nsuppose you can deliver the mail yourself or go hire somebody from \nsomeplace to somehow deal with the mail. What about trying to get your \nSocial Security check? I guess it doesn't matter. Since he thinks you \nshould not get Social Security or Medicare, it doesn't matter if you \nget that check as a senior.\n  He proposed to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency--the \nagency that makes sure we have clean air to breathe and safe water we \ncan drink. For those of us in the Great Lakes region, we have the \nblessing of being able to fish and boat and have the beauty of the \nGreat Lakes.\n  He promised to end all programs for children and seniors, low-income \nveterans, and repeal all taxation--no funding for the police \ndepartment, fire department, roads, military, and veterans.\n  We just heard Senator Cornyn--and I agree with him--talk about our \nveterans and the great concern we have with what is happening to our \nveterans. The people supporting our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, the top two donors, said there should be no taxation and that we \nshould get rid of the minimum wage. Remember how Henry Ford became one \nof the wealthiest men of his generation. He helped build the middle \nclass by doubling their wages. By the way, if we were using Henry \nFord's formula, the minimum wage would be close to $15 right now.\n  The Koch brothers don't want a minimum wage, Social Security or \nMedicare. They don't want help for anyone. They expect people to go out \nand earn $1.3 billion in a day and purchase whatever they need. \nSeniors, children, people with disabilities, including our veterans, \nwould be left with no support, and, of course, no taxes for the Koch \nbrothers and their big-shot friends.\n  This is truly a radical agenda. Here is the truly shocking part. The \nKoch brothers' agenda, which, again, Charles Koch himself proudly calls \na ``radical'' agenda, is exactly the agenda we are seeing emerge from \nthe Republican House of Representatives right now. Too many Members in \nour Senate Republican caucus want to privatize Social Security and \ngamble seniors' money away in the stock market. They want to eliminate \nMedicare as we know it. They passed the Ryan budget, which does that. \nThey want to privatize the post office.\n  They passed a budget that guts efforts to help Americans in need or \ninvest in the future of education and innovation. This is not what was \nsaid in 1980. This is what has passed and is being promoted right now, \nwhich is why they are putting so much money into the elections. Their \nagenda is being promoted right now, which they themselves call radical.\n  They refuse to join us in giving Americans a raise so that people who \nwork 40 hours a week in a full-time job and make minimum wage--by the \nway, a majority of them are women who are raising children--are at \nleast above poverty level and have a fair shot to get ahead.\n  We also don't have to guess how this radical, ``I've got mine and \nyou're on your own'' Koch brothers agenda works in practice. We have \nseen how this plays out in Michigan.\n\n[[Page S3164]]\n\n  In Gaylord, MI--beautiful northern Michigan--hundreds of workers used \nto work at a plant making particleboard--that is, until the Koch \nbrothers bought their company, closed the plant, and left town. Instead \nof good-paying jobs that paid workers $15 to $20 an hour so they could \nwith their family enjoy the great outdoors in Michigan and send their \nkids to college--jobs that gave workers a fair shot to get ahead--the \nKoch brothers left behind rubble and scrap metal. But that is not all \nthe Koch brothers left behind.\n  Imagine you are outside with your family--or even inside your \napartment or home--and suddenly you see a giant cloud of toxic black \ndust blowing towards you. It is piling up, and later you discover that \nthis black dust includes a toxic metal that is believed to cause \ncancer. Imagine you own a restaurant and are forced to sweep up the \nsame toxic dust from your patio, and you have to worry about what it is \ndoing to your pregnant wife and unborn child. This is not something out \nof a Charles Dickens' novel or a story about the pollution in China \ntoday. This actually happened to the people in Detroit. Why? Because a \ncompany owned by the Koch brothers decided to illegally store piles of \npetcoke--a byproduct of refined, dirty tar sands oil--alongside the \nDetroit River. These piles were up to four stories high and piled up \nnext to where people lived.\n  Just the other day I read a story about the exact same thing \nhappening to people in Chicago. Another company owned by the Koch \nbrothers is storing giant piles of petcoke in a residential area, which \nis something I know Senator Durbin is very concerned about. It doesn't \nstop there.\n\n  Last Wednesday, Senator Levin, Congressman Fred Upton from Kalamazoo, \nand I wrote to the Environmental Protection Agency about a toxic waste \nsite in Kalamazoo, MI. We want to make sure it finally gets cleaned up. \nGuess who owns that toxic waste site and hasn't cleaned it up for years \nand years. That is right, the Koch brothers.\n  We have come together in this country and decided that it is not fair \nfor the rest of us to have to breathe dirty air and drink dirty water \nso a multibillionaire can have an even bigger profit. The Koch \nbrothers, however, whose companies have been fined numerous times, \napparently think it is just fine to pollute our air and our water and \nthen say to every American: You are on your own; you clean it up.\n  The New York Times reported this weekend that David Koch even ran ads \ncalling for the complete deregulation of the energy industry. Can we \nbelieve it. A billionaire oilman who thinks there should be no rules \nfor Big Oil at the expense of the public.\n  So whether it is clean air and clean water rules, whether it is \nMedicare, whether it is Social Security, funding for seniors in nursing \nhomes through Medicaid, other vital services that keep the promise of \nthe American dream within reach for every American, the Koch brothers \nwant to get rid of those things in order to help themselves and their \npowerful friends. They want to rig the game in their favor. They are \ntrying very hard to do that, with hundreds of millions of dollars of \nsecret money and phony groups. They are willing to use their billions \nto create a government that works for them--just them and their \nfriends. Heads they win; tails the rest of America loses.\n  That is not what this country is about. We need to stop this assault \non our democracy and our middle class by passing a constitutional \namendment to get this secret money out of our elections. That is why I \nam so proud to join in supporting and cosponsoring an amendment \nsponsored by Senator Tom Udall that so many of our caucus are \nsupporting because we need to make it clear that this is not acceptable \nin a democracy. In the meantime, though, we need to make sure the \nAmerican people understand the real agenda behind the front groups and \nthe secret money. That is why I am here today. That is why our majority \nleader and others speak out. It is because it matters. It is the money \npromoting the agenda, the money promoting actions such as closing \nplants and petcoke going into the rivers in our neighborhoods.\n  It is an agenda that is not the agenda of the American people. In \nAmerica, everyone deserves a fair shot to work hard and get ahead--\neverybody. It is not about rigging the game for a few. People shouldn't \nbe able to buy all the rules of the game by putting secret money and \nfront groups out there and saying things that aren't true and getting \npeople in there whom they know will just work for their own radical \nagenda. That is not what America is about. We have too many people \nbarely holding on to the middle class, struggling to get into the \nmiddle class, and all they want is a fair shot to make it. That is what \nwe are about. That is what we are fighting for every single day.\n  I see my colleague on the floor who is offering a constitutional \namendment that would address this issue of getting the light of day on \nthe money in politics in our great country. I wish to again, in his \npresence, commend Senator Udall for doing that, and I urge my \ncolleagues to come together. What is happening right now with the money \nis the worst of America, not the best of America. We can do better than \nthat. People expect us to do better than that. I am going to continue \nwith my colleagues in the Democratic caucus to fight to make sure that \nhappens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

What I \nhave found over the last several weeks is that everywhere I go, \neverywhere in the State--downstate small towns, medium-sized cities, \nand the city of Chicago--there is one issue that has everybody sitting \nup and listening. The issue is student loans.\n  We wonder why that issue would have so many people interested. It is \nbecause 34 million Americans are paying back student loans now. In the \nState of Illinois, there are 1.7 million people paying back student \nloans--1.7 million. Fifteen percent of our population is paying back \nstudent loans. There is more student loan debt in America today than \ncredit card debt.\n  Some of the loans these students are taking out to go to school are \noutrageous. There is no other way to describe it. These young people, \n19 or 20 years old, are sitting there at the desk at the college as \nsomeone is shoving a piece of paper toward them for them to sign \nsaying: Well, if you sign up here for your loans, you can start classes \non Monday. That young man or woman, who has been told since they were \njust a little kid to go to college, go to college, go to college, signs \non and heads to class. At the end of the day those students end up \n$20,000 in debt, $30,000 in debt, and more--dramatically more. Many of \nthem don't have a clue about the indebtedness they are getting into to \ngo to school. Some of them don't know they are being lured into these \nfor-profit colleges and universities. Sadly, too many of them are \nworthless. Students are signing up for these for-profit colleges and \nuniversities thinking they are real schools, thinking it is just like \nthe University of Wisconsin, just like the University of Illinois. No, \nit isn't. It is a business, and it is a business that makes its money \noff of kiting the cost of tuition for students and, if they can stick \naround to finish, handing them a worthless diploma. How does a student \nknow this? Well, the honest answer is they don't until it is too late.\n  Hannah Moore has been at my press conferences twice. She went to one \nof these awful for-profit schools and ended up with $120,000 in debt \nfor a bachelor's degree and a worthless diploma. She couldn't get a \njob. Her debt is now closer to $150,000. She can't pay it. Here she is \nbarely 30 years old with over $100,000 in debt for a worthless diploma. \nThat is the extreme, but for 10 percent of the students graduating from \nhigh school in America today,\n\n[[Page S3165]]\n\nthose are the schools they go to--for-profit colleges and universities.\n\n  Which are the biggies? The University of Phoenix, No. 1; DeVry \nUniversity from Illinois, No. 2; and Kaplan University, which used to \nown the Washington Post. These are the big ones.\n  Remember three numbers when you think about the for-profit colleges \nand universities: 10 percent of high school students go to these \nschools. These schools get 20 percent of the Federal aid to education \nbecause their tuition is so outrageously high--20 percent--over $30 \nbillion a year going to this industry. And here is the kicker: 46 \npercent of all student loan defaults are students at for-profit \ncolleges and universities. What does that tell us? They charge too \nmuch, the educations are not worth it, and the students can't get a \njob.\n  That is the most extreme example, but let's talk about the rest of \nthe world: 97 percent of students going to other colleges and \nuniversities. They are running up debt at record numbers, at a record \npace. Unfortunately, many of those student loan debts lure in their \nparents and sometimes grandparents to help them along, and the student \ndebt grows and grows. Sadly, if they make the big mistake of going not \nto a for-profit school but one of the regular schools and sign up for \nprivate loans, they are in for a beating, and they don't know it. They \nare young students. How could they possibly know what they are signing \nup for--a school that would lure them into a private loan to go to \ncollege and then subject them to the harshest, toughest, meanest, most \nunrelenting collection agency you have ever seen coming after these \nstudents on their student loans. That is the world we live in, and that \nis a world that needs to change.\n  When I go home and talk to people about it, they are either directly \npersonally affected by it, their family is affected by student debt, or \nthey worry that their sons and daughters who may want to have a chance \nat higher education will get sucked into this same scam. Well, help can \nbe on the way.\n  I have joined with two of my colleagues, Jack Reed of Rhode Island \nand Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. We have a package of three bills \nthat would give students from middle-income families, working families \nacross America, a fair shot at an affordable higher education. My bill, \nthe student borrower bill of rights, says the school has an obligation \nto tell students to stick with the government loan because it is a \nlower interest rate and not lure students into a private loan. Jack \nReed has a bill which stipulates that if schools keep sinking students \ndeeper in debt and they can't get out of it, eventually the school has \nto accept financial responsibility. That will get their attention. But \nthe big bill of the three comes from Elizabeth Warren--and we are \njoining her--to refinance college debt at lower interest rates, bring \nthem down from 7, 8, 9, 10 percent to 3.8 percent. Does it make a \ndifference? Anybody who has ever had a home mortgage will say it does. \nLowering that interest rate to 3.8 percent will finally allow some of \nthese families and students to start paying off the principal on the \nstudent loan and put it behind them. Consolidate the loans at lower \ninterest rates is what our bill says.\n  Oh, Senator, great idea. Who is going to pay for this?\n  I will tell my colleagues exactly how we pay for it--exactly. Does \nthe name Warren Buffett ring a bell? He is one of the richest men in \nAmerica. He has done very well for himself, the ``Seer of Omaha,'' \nBerkshire Hathaway. He came to Congress a few years ago and said: \nSomething is wrong with the Tax Code.\n  Do we know what is wrong with it? Warren Buffett is paying a lower \nincome tax rate than his secretary.\n  Why, he said, is my secretary, who makes dramatically less money than \nI do, paying a higher income tax rate than I am?\n  The reason is pretty clear: Most of his income comes from capital \ngains, and that is lower than the regular income tax rate.\n  So Warren Buffett said: We ought to have a rule that says if you are \na millionaire in America, you are going to pay at least as much as the \npeople who work for you pay in taxes--the Buffett rule. The Buffett \nrule generates enough money in the Tax Code by imposing that tax burden \non millionaires to refinance college loans across America. Is it worth \nit? You bet it is, and I will tell my colleagues why. I don't begrudge \nmillionaires their wealth if they have come by it legally, and I \nbelieve Mr. Buffett has. But they have an obligation to this great \ncountry that set the stage for their success, and that obligation is to \nbe a good citizen, pay their taxes. That is what Mr. Buffett has \nsuggested. He is willing to accept that responsibility.\n  And if we can refinance student loans, it doesn't just bring relief \nto these families, it does something else. Hannah Moore is living in \nher parents' basement with $148,000 in student loan debt and she is \nbarely 30 years old. The thought of borrowing more money to go to a \nreal college is out of the question. The thought of living in her own \napartment is out of the question. The thought of buying a car? No way. \nFor some young couples even having children is out of the question \nbecause of student debt. Do we see that when we bring this debt under \ncontrol, we unleash a positive growing force in our economy where these \nyoung people can get back and participate--buy homes, buy cars, become \nfull-fledged members of the economy again. So it not only brings relief \nto families and gives them a fair shot at a college education they can \nafford, it also can help our economy overall.\n  We don't have a single cosponsor from the other side of the aisle yet \non this--not one. They are scared of the Buffett rule. The idea that \nmillionaires might have to pay higher taxes scares them away. If they \nhave a different pay-for, come on down. Let's hear the ideas. Let's \nactually have a dialogue on the Senate floor. How about that. That \nwould be historic. And we could talk about solving a problem in America \nsuch as this runaway college debt and these awful for-profit colleges \nand universities.\n  We need to work together. What we have before us is the tax extender \nbill and a bill which involves a lot of different sections of the Tax \nCode. This bill is not paid for--by and large not paid for. Some of us \nbelieve that unemployment compensation, which was cut off for millions \nof Americans over the last several months, should be there to help them \nget back on their feet. When we suggest it to our Republican friends, \nthey say: No, no, you have to either raise taxes, which we will oppose, \nor cut spending to pay for unemployment.\n  But when it comes to tax cuts for businesses, good or bad, they look \nthe other way. They do not think that has to be paid for. I think \nhelping unemployed Americans get back on their feet, find a job, take \ncare of their families, is central to putting this economy on a \nglidepath to the future.\n  I hope as we measure the issues we can debate here on the floor of \nthe Senate, we will start with those issues that interest the people we \nrepresent and that affect their lives and give working families a \nfighting chance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I applaud Senator Durbin \nfor his comments on the fair-shot agenda and on an affordable college \neducation for all of our kids. It is something parents and families and \npeople in New Mexico talk to me about all the time. I want to join the \nSenator in his comments and say, let's get this done. Let's see if we \ncan get Republicans to work with us in a bipartisan way. I applaud the \nSenator's speech.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3165-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3165-S3166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             VA HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Next Monday is Memorial Day, a day when we \nremember the men and women who gave their lives defending our freedoms, \na day to remember our solemn obligation to veterans. I rise today to \nspeak about that obligation and about very troubling allegations that \nshould outrage all of us, of sick veterans desperate for care, of \nsecret scheduling lists, of mismanagement at Veterans Affairs medical \ncenters, and of coverups and misuse of taxpayer funds.\n  If true, this is a great disservice to our veterans. This is not \nquality care, it is betrayal. It is unconscionable, whether it is only \none facility, such as the facility in Phoenix, or more, or in\n\n[[Page S3166]]\n\nNew Mexico and other facilities. For many people this story began in \nPhoenix, AZ, but I do not think it ends there.\n  I asked Secretary Shinseki on May 8 to extend the investigation to \ncover the entire regional network, which includes Arizona, New Mexico, \nand Texas. The next day Secretary Shinseki announced an audit of the VA \nnationwide. Today, the VA appropriations subcommittee marked up an \nimportant bill to fund the Department of Veterans Affairs and to \naddress these allegations. I am thankful to Chairman Johnson and \nRanking Member Kirk for including a key provision I requested to \nprovide funding to expand the VA inspector general's investigation, and \ncalling out New Mexico as one of the States that urgently needs the \nattention of the inspector general.\n  These secret waiting lists, according to whistleblowers, were efforts \nin deception and fraud, hiding management failures. They kept \nappointment requests out of the VA computer system in order to cover up \na waiting list to see a doctor, preventing veterans from receiving \nnecessary care.\n  At worst, this deception not only kept veterans waiting but may have \ncontributed to the death of some who were very sick. There are also \nreports that allege these efforts to manipulate the schedule were taken \nto make managers look better to receive bonuses, bonuses that were \nsupposed to have been awarded for meeting high-quality care standards, \nnot for failing them.\n  If true, this is tragic and possibly a serious crime. Thankfully, the \nappropriations subcommittee has taken action to freeze this bonus \nsystem while the investigation continues. I hope the full Senate will \nmove quickly to do the same, to eliminate bad incentives which hurt our \nveterans.\n  If managers hide the extent of the wait times at the VA, then \nCongress does not have the right information to allocate resources to \naddress need. Lives are at stake. We are talking here about veterans' \nlives. VA Assistant Inspector General John Daigh testified before the \nHouse Committee on Veterans' Affairs regarding a facility in South \nCarolina. He said, ``Over 50 veterans had a delayed diagnosis of colon \ncancer, some of whom died from colon cancer.''\n  GAO's Director of Health Care Debra Draper also testified about \nongoing and past issues with the VA causing veterans to receive delayed \ncare and delayed appointments. The GAO cited these shortcomings in a \n2013 report and also made multiple recommendations to the VA on how to \naddress them.\n  Ms. Draper noted that the VA has not yet enacted their \nrecommendations and that the VA still has work to do to fix problems \nspelled out in the GAO report. The GAO concluded that:\n\n       Ultimately, VHA's ability to ensure and accurately monitor \n     access to timely medical appointments is critical to ensure \n     quality health care to veterans, who may have medical \n     conditions that worsen if access is delayed.\n\n  The GAO report speaks to a bigger picture, one we should not lose \nsight of, and that is the ongoing problem with scheduling gimmicks, \nwith ways to game the system, first identified by the VA itself in an \nApril 2010 memo. These practices have led to delayed appointments and \ncare. This is not an allegation, this is a fact.\n  Congress and the VA need to continue to work together for \ntransparency, for accountability, and for real solutions. The \nallegations being investigated are very disturbing. This is not just a \nfailure to provide timely care--that is bad enough--but also an \nintentional effort to cover up that failure by creating separate \nscheduling lists and gimmicks and harming veterans as a result.\n  These allegations are serious and we take them very seriously for \nevery veteran in this country. For every man and woman who puts their \nlife on the line to defend this country, a full inspector general \ninvestigation is essential. In some cases a criminal investigation may \nalso be needed. We need to find out what is truly happening at our \nveterans' medical centers. This investigation should be thorough. It \nshould be exhaustive. It should uncover the truth and it should hold \nthose responsible accountable.\n\n  I also want to commend those who brought these concerns to the public \nand send a clear message to them: Congress will not tolerate \ninterference or harassment with public servants who simply are trying \nto get out the truth, trying to do their job, and doing the very best \nto serve our veterans. The Whistleblower Protection Act is very clear: \nIf you retaliate against an employee who is trying to expose the truth, \nthen you are in the wrong.\n  Congress and the President should speak with one voice: We will not \ntolerate actions to retaliate against VA employees or contractors who \nshine the light on the truth.\n  Similarly, no one in the VA should be destroying or hiding any \nevidence of these practices. Destruction of a Federal record can be a \ncrime.\n  VA managers should come clean, not cover up. I urge any New Mexico VA \npatient, family member, current or former VA employee, to report \nserious management problems to the VA inspector general either directly \nor through my office.\n  To those employees who continue to provide quality care to our \nveterans, this is not about you. Overall, the VA does provide great \nhealth care. I have heard from veterans who have testified to this \nfact. Many veterans would not go anywhere else. We must act quickly and \ndecisively to restore faith in the VA and provide the care our veterans \ndeserve.\n  Today, the Appropriations Committee took a step in the right \ndirection to expand the investigation and halt the bonus program. I \nlook forward to continuing this work with the full Senate and also with \nthe administration. All of us who work to support our troops and our \nveterans have a sacred obligation to make sure they have the care they \nhave earned. They have been there for us; we have to be there for them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3166-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3166-S3168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BENGHAZI INVESTIGATION\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to discuss the state of play in \nBenghazi. Senator Boxer came on the floor this morning and talked about \nthe investigations and all the things that have been done to find out \nabout what happened in Benghazi.\n  No. 1, to those serving in Libya today, you are definitely in our \nthoughts and prayers. My advice to the administration is get those \nfolks out as quickly as you can, because this thing is going downhill \nvery quickly in Libya. So let's not have another Benghazi on our hands. \nI feel as though the security environment in Libya is deteriorating as \nI speak.\n  Let me, if I can, set the stage for my concern. One, I think most \npeople on this side of the aisle, rightly or wrongly, believe that if \nthe names were changed, this whole attitude toward finding out what \nhappened in Benghazi would be different; if it had been the Bush \nadministration, Condoleezza Rice, not Susan Rice, that we would be on \nfire as a nation to find out how the President could have 2 weeks after \nthe attack--mentioned a video as the cause of the attack--that all the \ninformation coming from the intelligence community to the White House \nand others, there was never a protest. If Secretary Rice had gotten on \nthe national news or Mr. Hadley or John Bolton, the U.S. Ambassador to \nthe United Nations had gotten on television 5 days after the attack and \ntold the story about the level of security: We believe it was a protest \ncaused by video, not accordingly a terrorist attack--if that had all \nbeen said by the Bush people, there would have been definitely a \ndifferent approach about this issue. That to me is very sad. You may \nnot agree with that observation, but almost everybody over here I think \nbelieves that.\n  Mr. Zucker today--I know him from CNN; fine man--said he would not be \nbullied into covering the select committee. Nobody is asking any outlet \nto be bullied. But I have some questions I want CNN to answer, or \nsomebody who would answer questions that I think are very relevant.\n  What is the state of what? As far as the Senate goes, we have had the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence issue a report on January 15, \n2014. I think they did a very good job covering their lane. They did \nnot have jurisdiction over the State Department so their report was \nlimited. There was a minority report inside the report by\n\n[[Page S3167]]\n\nRepublicans taking some issues with some of the findings. But the \nbottom line was, the Senate intel committee, in a bipartisan fashion, \nlooked at Benghazi and said it could have been prevented. So that is \nsomething to be positive about.\n  The Armed Services Committee has done nothing. They have not issued \nany reports. This is the report of the Armed Services Committee in the \nSenate looking at DOD's responsibility that night.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee--this is their report. Nothing \nlooking at the State Department's behavior that night.\n  We have had hearings, but the relevant committees have not issued \nreports.\n  The Homeland Security Committee on December 30, 2012--Senators \nLieberman and Collins did a good job talking about Homeland Security's \nrole in Benghazi, a very good report. But a lot has happened since \nthen.\n  I want people in the country and the Senate to know the reason I want \na select committee in the Senate. We are not the House. Two of the \ncommittees very relevant to oversight of Benghazi have not issued any \nreports.\n  The Armed Services Committee has done nothing, nor has the Foreign \nRelations Committee, and I think this is worthy of our time.\n  This is a bipartisan report issued in 2008 by the Armed Services \nCommittee about detainee abuse. I participated in this report in the \nBush administration. We had some serious system breakdowns when it came \nto detainees in U.S. custody.\n  Senator McCain and I worked with Democrats to issue this report. I \nthought it was important to get to the bottom of system failure in the \nBush administration. But I would argue that four dead Americans are \nworthy of a report, and we have not had one. There are a lot of things \nthat could be done, should be done in the Senate, and have not been \ndone.\n  What would I like to find out about Benghazi that we did not know? \nThis is the Accountability Review Board, an internal investigation by \nthe State Department. Two fine men led this investigation--appointed by \nSecretary Clinton. This thing has more holes in it than Swiss cheese. \nThey missed a lot. They didn't talk to Secretary Clinton or Ambassador \nRice.\n  In this report they talk about the reason that Ambassador Stevens was \nin Benghazi was that they were looking at closing the consulate in \nBenghazi in December. I finally got to talk to one survivor after 18 \nmonths of trying.\n  I found out from that survivor, the person in charge of security in \nBenghazi on the night of the attack, that they had renewed the lease on \nthe consulate in July for 1 year. So that makes no sense. The report \nsays he went there to look at closing the consulate, and they just \nrenewed the lease in July before he went there in September. So it is \nnot by any means an exhaustive review of Benghazi.\n  This is a readout on September 10, 2012, the day before the attack. \nThis is a readout of: ``President's Meeting with Senior Administration \nOfficials on Our Preparedness and Security Posture on the Eleventh \nAnniversary of September 11th.''\n  Apparently the President had a meeting--in the White House, I \nassume--with all of our national security folks talking about what we \ncan expect on September 11 because it was the 11th anniversary of 9/11. \nIt states:\n\n       During the briefing today, the President and the Principals \n     discussed specific measures we are taking in the Homeland to \n     prevent 9/11 related attacks as well as the steps taken to \n     protect U.S. persons and facilities abroad, as well as force \n     protection.\n\n  I have one simple question: Did they bring up Libya? Did they talk \nabout the security situation in Benghazi and Libya? If not, why not? \nBased on this statement--it is a reassuring statement to the American \npeople that the President and his team are on top of the situation.\n  They were not on top of it when it came to Libya. So I want to find \nout if that meeting had any discussions about the deathtrap called \nBenghazi.\n  This is the security situation in Benghazi pre-9/11. On March 28 \nthere was a request for additional security which was denied.\n  Our security footprint was very light. We had an agreement with a \nmilitia in Benghazi that was supposed to be our primary reaction team--\na Libyan militia that proved to be less than reliable.\n  On April 6 an IED was thrown over the fence of the U.S. post in \nBenghazi. Did the President know about this? Did Secretary Clinton know \nabout it? I assume they did, but nobody in any of these investigations \never told us that the President was aware of this.\n  On June 6 a large IED destroyed part of the security perimeter of the \nU.S. post in Benghazi, leaving a whole ``big enough for 40 men to go \nthrough.'' They commissioned a study or some kind of review. Where is \nit? It has been attacked in April and June. Did the President know \nabout these attacks. They blew a hole in the wall large enough for 40 \npeople to go through.\n  On June 11, 5 days later, the British Ambassador's motorcade is \nattacked--very close to the Benghazi facility, our facility--and U.S. \npersonnel go help the British ambassador. After this attack, the \nBritish closed their consulate in Benghazi. Why did we leave ours open?\n  On July 9, there was a request from Ambassador Stevens for additional \nsecurity. No response.\n  On July 1, Lieutenant General Neller sends an email to Under \nSecretary Kennedy offering additional security. Kennedy responds saying \nno additional DOD support is needed.\n  There is a 16-person Special Forces National Guard team that was \nready to volunteer for an extra year to help our folks in Benghazi, and \nthe State Department folks said: No, thanks.\n  On August 6, the International Committee of the Red Cross has been \nattacked four times. They finally close up shop and leave town on \nAugust 6. The British leave and the Red Cross leaves.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Wood was a National Guard soldier trying to help \nsecurity doing a site security team investigation. Instead of being \nextended--and he volunteered to stay for 1 additional year--he was sent \nhome in August.\n  On August 16--this is the most damning of all--there was a cable that \nwas sent from Benghazi by our Ambassador telling the people in \nWashington that the consulate could not withstand a coordinated \nterrorist attack and the Al Qaeda flag is flying all over town, \nbasically begging for additional security, letting people in Washington \nknow: We cannot withstand a coordinated terrorist attack. Al Qaeda \nflags are flying all over the place.\n  That is the state of play. That is the background in terms of \nsecurity regarding the consulate in Benghazi.\n  Fast forward. These are statements by the Regional Security Officer \nwho was asking for additional security. He was so frustrated by the \nresponse he had received in Washington he said the following: ``For me \nthe Taliban is inside the building.''\n  What Eric Nordstrom was talking about is that the people in \nWashington seemed to be completely deaf as to his needs for additional \nsecurity. He thought the people in Washington were working against him, \nand he was very worried about what would happen if there was an attack, \nand he believed that one was coming.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Wood, a Utah National Guard Special Forces soldier \nwho left in August, said:\n\n       It was instantly recognizable to me as a terrorist attack. \n     . . . Mainly because of my prior knowledge there, I almost \n     expected the attack to come. We were the last flag flying; it \n     was a matter of time.\n\n  This had gone up DOD channels as well as the Department of State. So \nthat is the history of the security situation in Benghazi.\n  Now, to the people at CNN, to my Democratic colleagues, to anybody \nand everybody, please explain to me how on September 16, 5 days after \nthe attack, Susan Rice, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations was \nchosen to appear on five Sunday talk shows to talk about the attack in \nBenghazi on our facilities. But I can assure you, she was very worried \nabout what was going to happen--the questions regarding Benghazi--\nbecause we had four people killed.\n  This is what she said about the level of security on September 16:\n\n       Well, first of all, we had a substantial security presence \n     with our personnel . . . with our personnel and the consulate \n     in Benghazi.\n\n  I have a question. Who told her that. Nothing could have been further \nfrom the truth. When you look at the history of the security footprint \nin\n\n[[Page S3168]]\n\nBenghazi, it was begging and pleading by the people in Libya to have \nmore help and everything was denied. It was to the point that the \nperson in charge of security felt like the Taliban were all inside the \nbuilding in Washington. Lieutenant Colonel Wood said:\n\n       We were the last flag flying. It was a matter of time.\n\n  On August 16, before the September 11 attack, there was a cable from \nAmbassador Chris Stevens saying: We cannot defend this compound against \na coordinated terrorist attack.\n  Those are the facts. This is what Susan Rice told the world:\n\n       Well, first of all, we had a substantial security presence \n     with our personnel . . . with our personnel and the consulate \n     in Benghazi.\n\n  I have a simple question. Who told her that, who briefed her about \nsecurity in Benghazi, because the person who told her that needs to be \nfired because they are completely incompetent or they lied to her.\n  If she made this up, she needs to resign because nothing could have \nbeen further from the truth. If she just made this up to make the \nadministration look good in light of all of the other evidence about \nsecurity, then she is not an honest person when it comes to conveying \nnational security incidents.\n  So, please, after all of these investigations, after all of these \nhearings, can somebody tell me from where Susan Rice got this \ninformation? How could she conclude, based on what we know now, that we \nhad a substantial security presence with our personnel in the consulate \nin Benghazi. She went on to say: ``Well, we obviously did have a strong \nsecurity presence.''\n  She said this on ABC and this on Fox. If you listened to her on \nSeptember 16, you would believe we were well prepared for this attack \nand we had secured the consulate in a reasonable fashion.\n  If anybody had looked at the actual record--the information available \nto our own government in our own files--you could not have said that \nhonestly. I am sure this was a good thing to say 6 weeks before an \nelection. The problem is it is not remotely connected to the truth.\n  To this day, nobody can answer my question. Where did she receive \ninformation about the security level in Benghazi? She has never been \ninterviewed by anybody 20 months later.\n  Why was she chosen? If John Bolton had taken Condoleezza Rice's place \nto talk about a consulate--not under his control but under her \ncontrol--people would want to know where the Secretary of State was. \nAmbassador Rice was the U.N. Ambassador--U.S. Ambassador to the United \nNations. She had no responsibility for consulate security.\n  The person responsible for consulate security and our footprint in \nLibya was Secretary Clinton. I have always wondered why they chose her. \nTo this day, no one has answered that, but Susan Rice said on 12/13/\n2012:\n\n       Secretary Clinton had originally been asked by most of the \n     networks to go on. . . . She had had an incredibly grueling \n     week dealing with the protests around the Middle East and \n     North Africa. I was asked. I was willing to do so. It wasn't \n     what I had planned for that weekend originally, but I don't \n     regret doing that.\n\n  And she further said she had no regrets about what she told the \nAmerican people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes have expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask for 5 minutes more if I could.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Reserving the right to object, how much longer----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Am I into the Senator's time? If the Senator is next, may \nI have 1 minute?\n  To be continued--I can't do this justice in 15 minutes, but this is \nwhat I am suggesting. If it is true that the Secretary of State could \nnot go on television and talk about the consulate under her control and \ntell us about how four Americans died at that consulate--the first \nambassador in 33 years--because she had a grueling week--if that is \ntrue--and I don't believe it is, but if it is--then we need to know \nbecause that will matter to the country as we go forth. If it is not \ntrue, why would Susan Rice say it?\n  To be continued--there is so much about this incident called \n``Benghazi'' that we don't know and that makes no sense to me that I am \nnot going to give up until I can tell the families what I believe to be \nthe truth. And what I have been told is nowhere near the truth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3168-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3168-S3169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NET NEUTRALITY\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. I apologize to my friend from South Carolina.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk about an issue that millions and \nmillions of people all over this country are increasingly concerned \nabout; that is, last week the FCC, the Federal Communications \nCommission, released a proposal in response to a recent Federal court \ndecision that struck down the Commission's 2010 Open Internet Order. \nThe proposal would, for the very first time, allow Internet service \nproviders to be able to pay for priority treatment.\n  What this means, in point of fact, is the end of net neutrality and \nthe end of the Internet as we know it. What net neutrality means is \nthat everyone in our country--and, in fact, the world--has the same \naccess to the same information. Whether you are a mom-and-pop store in \nHardwick, VT, or whether you are Walmart, the largest private \ncorporation in America, you should have the same access to your \ncustomers.\n  Net neutrality also means that a blogger, somebody who just blogs out \nhis or her point of view, in a small town in America should have the \nsame access to his or her readers as the New York Times or the \nWashington Post.\n  If the FCC allows huge corporations to negotiate ``fast-lane deals,'' \nthen the Internet will eventually be sold to the highest bidder. \nCompanies with the money will have the access and small businesses will \nbe treated as second- or third-class citizens. This is grotesquely \nunfair and this will be a disaster for our economy and for small \nbusinesses all across our country.\n  I want to take this opportunity to thank Commissioners Clyburn and \nRosenworcel for their strong support of net neutrality. They are doing \nexactly what the American people want from the Commission. During last \nweek's hearing Commissioner Rosenworcel stated:\n\n       We cannot have a two-tiered Internet, with fast lanes that \n     speed the traffic of the privileged and leave the rest of us \n     lagging behind.\n\n  Commissioner Clyburn noted:\n\n       [The] free and open exchange of ideas is critical to a \n     democratic society.\n\n  And she is, of course, absolutely right.\n  I have to say--and I don't mean to be particularly partisan on this \nissue, but the facts are the facts--that in contrast, the Republican \nCommissioners, Ajit Pai and Michael O'Reilly, would like to completely \nderegulate the Internet. Commissioner O'Reilly said, in response to the \nproposal:\n\n       As I've said before, the premise for imposing net \n     neutrality rules is fundamentally flawed and rests on a \n     faulty foundation of make-believe statutory authority. I have \n     serious concerns that this ill-advised item will create \n     damaging uncertainty and head the Commission down a slippery \n     slope of regulation.\n\n  That is Republican Commissioner O'Reilly.\n  What does all of this mean in English? What it means is that when we \ntalk about deregulating the Internet, we are talking about allowing \nmoney--big money--to talk, and allowing the big-money interests to once \nagain get their way in Washington. That is very wrong. We cannot allow \nour democracy to once again be sold to the highest bidder.\n  I think all of us agree the Internet has been an enormous success in \nfostering innovation and enabling free and open speech across the \ncountry and throughout the world. We kind of take it for granted. But \nwhen the Presiding Officer and I were growing up, there was no \nInternet, and I think we can all acknowledge now what a huge advance it \nhas been for business and for general communication. Unfortunately, \nthese Republican Commissioners on the FCC want to fix a problem that \ndoes not exist. What they want is to change the fundamental \narchitecture of the Internet to remove the neutrality that has been in \nplace for decades--since the inception of the Internet--and to allow \nbig corporations to control content online.\n  Let me say the American people--people in Vermont and across this\n\n[[Page S3169]]\n\ncountry--care very deeply about this issue. A little while ago, in \nadvance of the FCC's vote, on the Internet I asked people in Vermont \nand throughout the country to share their views with me, to write to me \nand tell me what they thought about the attempt to do away with net \nneutrality, and I was blown away by the response we received. More than \n19,000 people have submitted comments to my office so far, and what \nthey are saying in statement after statement after statement is that \nthe FCC has to defend net neutrality.\n  I think these 19,000 people represent the vast majority of the people \nin this country who understand how important net neutrality is, and I \nwant to take this opportunity and a very few moments to share some of \nthe comments I received through my Web site.\n  Anthony Drake of Moreno Valley, CA, said:\n\n       Net neutrality is vital for a free and open internet, and \n     the economic advantages that it has brought our nation and \n     the world. Please work to reclassify ISPs as common carriers \n     under Title II of the Communications Act.\n\n  Stamford, VT, resident Roy Gibson concurred, telling the FCC that \nInternet providers ``should be treated like utilities.'' I agree with \nRoy Gibson.\n  Reg Jones of Bennington, VT, said President Obama must uphold his \ncampaign promise to enforce net neutrality. He further said:\n\n       Net neutrality should be mandated as President Obama \n     promised. Any attempt to allow differential speeds and access \n     to the Internet should be squashed and those who propose it \n     should be replaced by people who represent all of the \n     citizens of this country. Internet access should be for the \n     good of all, not for the select few who already have too much \n     power and more money than they need.\n\n  William LaFrana of Versailles, KY, said:\n\n       Everyone should have equal access to the Internet. The \n     Internet was developed with taxpayer funding, and should not \n     be held hostage to corporate piracy.\n\n  Patricia Moriarty from Harwich Point, MA, wrote:\n\n       The Internet is the only place where we truly have freedom \n     of speech and the ability to freely exchange new ideas around \n     the world. Leave the Internet OPEN.\n\n  President Obama himself has long been on record supporting net \nneutrality. In 2007, then-Presidential candidate Obama said:\n\n       What you've been seeing is some lobbying that says that the \n     servers and the various portals through which you're getting \n     information over the Internet should be able to be \n     gatekeepers and to charge differential rates to different Web \n     sites . . . so you can get much better quality from the Fox \n     News site and you'd be getting rotten service from the mom \n     and pop sites. . . . And that I think destroys one of the \n     best things about the Internet--which is that there is this \n     incredible equality there.\n\n  That is what Barack Obama said when he was campaigning for the \nPresidency. Barack Obama was right when he said that, and I would very \nstrongly urge the President to stand for what he said when he was \ncampaigning for President and defend net neutrality.\n  I understand the FCC is an independent body, but the American people \nhave spoken with a clear and unified voice that they want to maintain \nnet neutrality. What is so frustrating for the American people is to \nelect a candidate--in this case President Obama--who campaigned on an \nissue and now see many of the FCC members he appointed moving in a \ndifferent direction. It is simply not enough for the President to sit \non the sidelines on this issue. We need him to speak out for net \nneutrality, as he did when he campaigned for President.\n  Let me conclude by simply saying the Commission will soon consider \nwhether to reclassify the Internet as a so-called common carrier. Under \nthis distinction, the Internet would be treated like other utilities. \nBeing classified as a common carrier will mean Internet service \nproviders must provide the same service to everyone, without \ndiscrimination. This is the only path forward to maintain an open \nforum, free of discrimination.\n  Over the next few months the public will have an opportunity to weigh \nin on this proposal by the FCC. Each of us--and I hope every Member of \nCongress--should be concerned about this issue. I encourage you to be \nvocal. If people want to write to my office--sanders.senate.gov--we \nalready have 19,000 people commenting and we welcome even more. I hope \nthe American people rally around this issue of net neutrality and that \nwe defeat any proposal to do away with that.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In recognition of Memorial Day, I would like to take a \nmoment today to honor three Hoosier servicemembers we lost in the last \nyear.\n  We remember Army SSG Jesse Williams of Elkhart, who was killed in \naction after his Black Hawk helicopter crashed in Zabul Province, \nAfghanistan, on December 17, 2013.\n  Staff Sergeant Williams attended Elkhart Central High School and \ncompleted basic training in 2006. He was deployed three times--once to \nIraq in 2007 and twice to Afghanistan in 2010 and 2013. Staff Sergeant \nWilliams is survived by his daughter, parents, grandparents, and \nsiblings. His family accepted the Purple Heart on his behalf last \nmonth.\n\n\n                    Technical Sergeant Dale Mathews\n\n  We remember Air Force TSgt Dale Mathews from Rolling Prairie, IN, who \ndied in a plane crash during a training exercise in England on January \n7 of this year.\n  Technical Sergeant Mathews graduated from New Prairie High School in \n1994. He served tours of duty in both Iraq and Afghanistan. His service \nin the Air Force centered on flying rescue missions and taking care of \nothers. After serving almost 20 years, he was involved in the rescue of \nnearly 300 people.\n  Technical Sergeant Mathews is survived by his wife, his son, \ndaughter, stepson, stepdaughter, and his parents and grandparents.\n\n\n                      Staff Sergeant Randall Lane\n\n  We remember Army SSG Randall Lane of Indianapolis.\n  Staff Sergeant Lane passed away from a noncombat-related illness in \nAfghanistan on September 13, 2013. Staff Sergeant Lane served his \ncountry proudly in the Marines and in the Indiana Army National Guard \nfor over 20 years. He is survived by his wife, three daughters, \nstepson, parents, brothers and sister, and his grandmother.\n  These men are all true heroes. They served their country with \ndistinction. They made their family, friends, and all the people of \nIndiana and America proud. I send my continued thoughts and prayers to \ntheir families.\n  Like these three men, the United States has a long history of \nselfless warriors--men and women choosing to serve not because of the \nglory it brings to them but because of the freedom and safety it brings \nto others. When one of them makes the ultimate sacrifice by giving \ntheir life for ours, it is important that we pause and remember the \ntrue price of freedom.\n  I was proud to see my fellow Hoosiers come together in reflection and \nremembrance when we lost these three American sons, and I ask that we \ndo the same this Memorial Day.\n  May God bless the United States of America.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3169-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3169-S3171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, this week President Obama told a group \nof campaign donors that people who still\n\n[[Page S3170]]\n\ntalk about his health care law are ``not speaking to the real concerns \nthat people have.'' The President still does not seem to understand \nthat Americans do have real concerns about his health care law. They \nare not partisan concerns, they are practical concerns. The reason \nAmericans are worried is because the law directly impacts their \npersonal lives, their personal health, and their personal pocketbooks.\n  That is why I have come to the floor week after week to talk about \nsome of the alarming side effects of the President's health care law, \nand there are many alarming side effects related to the law that people \nare seeing and dealing with in their everyday lives. I have talked \nabout how this law has increased premiums, how it has cut paychecks for \nmany families, how week after week more people are realizing that they \nare suffering as a result of the law. They are not helped by the law \nbut are suffering as victims of the President's law.\n  Today I wish to talk about another costly side effect of the law: the \nmassive amount of taxpayer dollars that continues to be wasted under \nthe law. For example, KMOV, a television station in St. Louis, recently \nreported about a call center in Missouri that processes paper \napplications for insurance in the State exchanges. Remember, the \napplications were supposed to be handled on a Web site, so they should \nnot need a call center handling very many paper applications, but it \ndoesn't seem to matter.\n  The company got a contract for $1.2 billion. According to the report, \nthere are 1,800 employees. What are these people doing who are taking \nall of this money? It turns out a lot of them are not doing very much. \nThey are being paid with hard-earned taxpayer dollars and they are not \ndoing very much. One employee said, ``There are some weeks that a data \nentry person would not process an application''--weeks, and not a \nsingle application. They are just sitting there and looking at their \ncomputers. The report says some of them are playing Pictionary or 20 \nQuestions and collecting paychecks funded by the taxpayers. Another \nformer employee told the Associated Press: ``It was like stealing money \nfrom people.'' It was like stealing money from people.\n  It is not just happening in Missouri. Another TV station, KOLR, found \na call center run by the same company--this one is in Arkansas--and \nreported that the same thing that is happening in St. Louis, MO, is \nhappening in Arkansas. One employee told the station that he has been \nthere 6 months--6 months and getting paid for full-time work--and has \nprocessed a total of 40 applications.\n  To make matters worse, we have learned of another clear way \nWashington is wasting taxpayer dollars while implementing the law. Over \nthe weekend the Washington Post reported that Federal health care \nsubsidies may be too high or to low for 1 million people. The headline \nsays: ``Health payouts may be wrong. Subsidies too high or [too] low \nfor 1 million. Government flags errors but can't fix them yet.'' \nIncredible incompetence on the part of this administration. There is \nmismanagement like people have never seen before in this country.\n  The Post reported:\n\n       The problem means that potentially hundreds of thousands of \n     people are receiving bigger subsidies than they deserve.\n\n  These are the subsidies some people get to help pay for their \ninsurance in the government exchanges. It turns out that the computer \nsystem Washington built to make sure it gave the right subsidies--well, \nguess what. It doesn't work.\n  When the healthcare.gov Web site crashed last fall, the Obama \nadministration scrambled to patch and duct tape it back together. But \naccording to the article, behind the scenes, important aspects of the \nWeb site remain defective or unfinished.\n  The article goes on:\n\n       The government may be paying incorrect subsidies to more \n     than 1 million Americans in the new federal insurance \n     marketplace and has been unable so far to fix the errors, \n     according to internal documents and three people familiar \n     with the situation.\n       The problem means that potentially hundreds of thousands of \n     people are receiving bigger subsidies than they deserve.\n\n  Apparently the government can't fix it and the Web site can't be \nfixed. So what do they do? These people are sending in information, \nand, according to this article, ``piles of unprocessed `proof' \ndocuments are sitting in a federal contractor's Kentucky office, and \nthe government continues to pay insurance subsidies that may be too \ngenerous . . .''\n\n       The inability to make certain the government is paying \n     correct subsidies is a legacy of computer troubles that \n     crippled last fall's launch of the Obama health care law.\n\n  So again we see more waste of taxpayer dollars and more reasons for \nAmericans to have very real concerns about the law.\n  Just this past week the President of the United States told donors: \nOh, not speaking to the real concerns that people have.\n  The President of the United States is wrong. The American people have \nreal concerns about these components of the health care law. President \nObama said to the Democrats in this very body: Democrats should \nforcefully defend and be proud of the health care law. I want to see \none of the Democrats stand and defend what I have just talked about and \nbe proud of what I just talked about. The President says you should, so \nwhere are you right now? Not one of them is here to make that defense \nor to stand proud about this law.\n  It is hard to imagine that my colleagues can possibly be proud of a \nlaw that pays people to do nothing all day long. Can they possibly be \nproud of a law that awards large subsidies for people who don't qualify \nfor them? Are the Democrats who voted for this health care law ready to \nforcefully defend all the taxpayer dollars that continue to be wasted \nevery day?\n  There is no end in sight and there is no effort to stop this. After \nall, how does that provide a fair shot for everyone? Isn't that what \nthe promises of the President are? He said: I want a fair shot for \neveryone. How does all of this actually help with this wasted money? \nHow does that help anybody get better health care? Millions and \nmillions of dollars are being wasted to pay people to sit around and \nplay computer games. Millions more are on Web sites designed in States \nthat have been basically called broken, dysfunctional, crippled--you \nname it, they are not working.\n  The FBI is doing an investigation about some of these reports. How \ndoes that give anybody better health care--all these wasted taxpayer \ndollars.\n\n  The people know what they wanted with health care reform. They wanted \nbetter access to quality, affordable care. Let's think about what \npeople want with health care reform. They want access, they want \naffordable care, they want choices--which they have been denied under \nthis President's health care law--and they want quality. That is the \nkind of fair shot they wanted, but it is not what they got from the \nPresident's health care law.\n  Republicans have offered a patient-centered approach that would solve \nthe biggest problems families face, such as access to care, cost of \ncare, quality of care, and choice. That means ideas such as allowing \nsmall businesses to pool together in order to buy insurance more \ncheaply for their employees. That gives small businesses and the \nemployees working there a fair shot. It means letting people shop for \nhealth insurance that actually works for them and their families, not \nwhat President Obama says is best for them. If I had to say who has the \nbest chance of knowing what is best for a family, I would say it is \nlikely the family and not President Obama and the Democrats who passed \nthis law. People deserve a fair shot at buying a plan that is best for \nthem and best for their families.\n  These are just a couple of the solutions Republicans have offered to \ngive Americans real health care reform and a real fair shot--health \ncare reform that gives patients the care they need from a doctor they \nchoose at lower costs, without the ongoing harmful, expensive side \neffects we are seeing every day with the President's health care law.\n  Thank you.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss a critical issue facing \nthis body and this country. The occasion for my remarks happens to be \nthe nomination of Sylvia Mathews Burwell to head the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. As a senior member of the HELP Committee and \nthe ranking member on the Finance Committee, I have taken a great deal \nof interest in her nomination and have participated in her confirmation \nhearings.\n  I am afraid the cordial nature of our exchanges and my recognition of \nMs. Burwell's impressive qualifications has allowed some ObamaCare \npartisans to misconstrue my approaches as an acknowledgment that \nsomehow the Affordable Care Act is working. Let me be absolutely clear \non this point. I oppose ObamaCare, and I am going to fight as long as \nit takes to repeal that misguided law and replace it with a system that \nactually works for American families.\n  That is why I have collaborated with several of my colleagues to \nunveil the framework of the Patient CARE Act, a plan that would repeal \nObamaCare and replace it with commonsense, patient-centered reforms \nthat would reduce health care costs and increase access to affordable, \nhigh-quality care. It would save the taxpayers about $1 trillion and \nyet have a better health care system than we have today with Obama.\n  Let me also be clear on another point. No matter what the \nadministration says, the reality is that ObamaCare is not working. The \nPresident and his allies are claiming the law is a success because the \nadministration has mostly corrected the botched rollout of \nhealthcare.gov and has had a certain number of individuals sign up--as \nif forcing people into ObamaCare, under the coercive threat of \ngovernment penalty, is somehow cause for celebration. In reality, the \nmass cancellation of insurance coverage last fall was just the first \nprick of pain ObamaCare will inflict on the American people.\n  I could talk for hours about rising premiums, growing deficits, \nbackdoor bailouts and of course numerous other maladies, all of which \nthreaten the quality and the enforceability of health insurance for so \nmany Americans already struggling through the Obama economy, but the \nconcern that motivates me to speak today goes beyond the many failures \nof ObamaCare as a matter of policy. Perhaps the most troubling of all \nhas been the unlawful manner in which this administration has gone \nabout implementing it.\n  When faced with the prospect of enforcing disruptive features of his \nsignature law, the President has chosen to ignore his fundamental \nobligation to enforce the law and has instead sought to rewrite various \nprovisions of ObamaCare unilaterally.\n  These actions form a troubling pattern of lawlessness and executive \noverreach by the Obama administration, one that all citizens and all \nMembers of this esteemed body, whether Republican or Democrat, ought to \ncondemn and resist.\n  The harms I will discuss today are not just a theoretical \nabstraction. This administration's abuse is a very real threat to our \nconstitutional system of government and to the liberties each of us \nenjoys. In recent weeks, I have come to the floor on a number of \noccasions to speak out about the Obama administration's lawlessness in \na wide variety of contexts. I will continue to do so to defend the \nseparation of powers, the rule of law, and the legitimate prerogatives \nof the legislative branch and this body in particular under the \nConstitution.\n  Even in light of these serial abuses which have only accelerated \nunder the President's new ``pen and phone'' strategy, the \nimplementation of ObamaCare stands out as the crown jewel of executive \noverreach. By my count, this administration has acted unilaterally on \nat least 22 separate occasions to alter the law, something it does not \nhave the right or power to do.\n  Through its actions, the Obama administration, in particular the \ncurrent Health and Human Services Secretary, has demonstrated cavalier \ndisregard for the constitutional obligations of the executive branch. \nThe President and his team have shown outright contempt for the \nlegitimate role of Congress.\n  Today, I wish to highlight a few of the Obama administration's most \negregious acts and explain why these actions are unlawful and pose such \na serious threat to our constitutional system of government. Let me \nbegin with something most Americans unfortunately remember all too \nwell, President Obama's now infamous promise that if you like your \nplan, you can keep it.\n  Make no mistake, this promise was the key selling point for \nObamaCare, which was approved by the Senate by a razor-thin party-line \nvote. Without the President's assurance that Americans could keep their \ncurrent health plans if they wished, the bill simply would not have \npassed this Chamber.\n  Yet it has long been clear that the White House never intended for \nAmericans to be able to keep their plan. I do not say that lightly. It \nis not some unsubstantiated partisan attack. It is a well-documented \nfact. From the very beginning one of the key premises underlying \nObamaCare's government takeover of health care was the notion that \nAmericans could not and should not be trusted to choose their own \nhealth insurance and that instead Washington's so-called experts could \nbe tasked with determining the sort of coverage Americans could buy.\n  Indeed, that is the entire point of having the minimum coverage \nprovision the Obama administration fought so hard to include in the \nbill. If Americans' existing plans do not comply with some government \nofficial's specifications, then ObamaCare forces individuals off of \ntheir insurance. To put the President's promise more honestly, if he \nlikes your plan, you can keep it.\n  Several respected news outlets have responded how policy aides within \nthe Obama White House objected to the President's obviously inaccurate \nclaim that if you like your plan you can keep it, only to be overruled \nby the President's appointed political advisers. Despite knowing it was \nfalse, the administration purposely perpetrated this dishonest claim.\n  Tragically, millions of Americans relied on the President's promise, \nonly to face the prospect of having their health insurance plans \ncancelled after his reelection. To make matters worse, the \nadministration did not settle for the natural attrition that would \neventually force Americans with the plans they like to buy an \nadditional level of coverage, one they did not want, but one that \nObamaCare forced them to purchase. No. Instead the administration \nrushed to publish regulations that defined exactly which existing plans \ncould be grandfathered into the new scheme. The regulatory definition \nwas so narrow in scope that even a minor or routine change to an \nexisting plan could disqualify it.\n  As the Solicitor General recently conceded to the Supreme Court, \nObama administration officials knew the number of qualifying \nindividuals would be ``very, very low, because it is to be expected \nthat employers and insurance companies are going to make decisions that \ntrigger the loss of the so-called grandfather status under the \ngoverning regulations.''\n  Given the President's broken promise and the many cancelled plans, I \njoined with a number of colleagues to move quickly to use our power \nunder the Congressional Review Act to try to overturn these \nregulations. Unfortunately, every single one of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle voted against providing this relief.\n  What followed was tragic but entirely predictable. Insurers were \nforced to cancel policies and millions of Americans were unable to keep \nthe plans they liked. When ObamaCare's failed social engineering became \na reality in the wake of millions of cancellation notices that went out \nlast fall, even staunch supporters felt the intensity of the inevitable \npublic outrage. Many in this body were eager to support legislation \nthat offered relief to constituents suffering from this latest dose of \nthe ObamaCare plan.\n  The House of Representatives passed legislation with the bipartisan \nsupport of more than three dozen Democrats that would have allowed \ninsurers to continue to offer the plans that millions of Americans had \nchosen to purchase. Yet once the chorus of public outrage got so loud \nthat even President Obama could no longer ignore\n\n[[Page S3172]]\n\nObamaCare's destructive effects, what did he do? Did he try to work \nwith a bipartisan majority in Congress to provide relief to the hard-\nworking Americans injured by ObamaCare's forced cancellations, did he \nmove to rescind the administration's aggressive regulations, or did he \nbite the bullet and enforce the law as written, demonstrating that he \nwas willing to endure the unpopularity in order to live up to his \nobligations under the Constitution?\n  Unfortunately, President Obama chose none of these legitimate \napproaches. Instead, his Department of Health and Human Services simply \nacted unilaterally to cancel and then rewrite the minimum coverage \nrequirements in the statute. After doing so, HHS simply cited the vague \nnotion of transitional relief as the only possible suggestion of where \nthe administration could find executive authority to refuse to enforce \nclear statutory law.\n\n  In reality, this action represents a shocking and radical abuse of \npower by this administration. Let me offer some background to \ncontextualize how extreme the Obama administration's claimed authority \nis in this instance. In the enforcement of this Nation's tax laws, the \nIRS has for some time claimed the authority to adjust how a new tax is \nphased into operation, providing a slight delay in enforcement to ease \nthe administrative burden imposed by the new tax.\n  The IRS has engaged in this practice to adjusting enforcement timing \nwith some regularity through the use of this asserted authority, which \ntends to be narrow, for example, by delaying the retroactive \nenforcement of an aviation fuel excise tax by just 16 days. The Obama \nadministration's attempts to fix the failed bailout from the ``if you \nlike your plan you can keep it'' lie does not even involve tax law, nor \ndoes it involve the IRS's past practice or its claimed legal authority.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services simply invoked the \nclaimed powers of the IRS in a wholly distinct context, a context in \nwhich it could not point to statutory authority or a similar history of \npast practice. In the absence of clear authority to alter or cancel \nenforcement, the President remains constitutionally obligated to take \ncare that the laws be faithfully executed.\n  In this case, the Obama administration does not have a leg to stand \non. The sort of transitional relief here is nothing like a minor 16-day \ndelay. The failure to enforce the minimum coverage provisions will now \ndrag on for 3 full years past the required statutory deadline. The \nadministration's fix is different in kind from prior examples of \ntransitional relief, because in this case the government did not \nactually face enforcement difficulties. Insurance companies had already \ncomplied with the statute by canceling millions of plans, as the law \nrequired them to do.\n  In fact, precisely the opposite was true. What finally motivated the \nadministration to act was, instead, the public backlash generated from \nproper compliance with the law.\n  No matter how much the Obama administration may want to mitigate the \ndisastrous effects of its own signature law, neither HHS nor any other \npart of the executive branch has legitimate authority, in the form of \nprosecutorial discretion or otherwise, to ignore or rewrite a Federal \nstatute.\n  In the words of the Justice Department's longstanding position: The \nPresident may not ``refuse to enforce a statute he opposes for policy \nreasons.'' But that is precisely what the Obama administration has done \nin this case. The whole idea of administrative transitional relief is \npremised on the notion that such action is properly derived from, or at \nthe very at least is consistent with, relevant statutory authorities. \nHere, the administration's action directly contradicts the plain \nlanguage of the statute, which obligates insurance companies to offer \nonly plans compliant with the statute's requirements and which \nobligates State and Federal governments to enforce those requirements.\n  A generic brand of regulatory authority cannot provide the executive \nbranch with unilateral power to rewrite effective dates made explicit \nin the statute. This is especially true of ObamaCare, since, as we were \ntold repeatedly during the debate over the law, the precise effective \ndates for various intertwined provisions were deemed central to the \neffectiveness of the entire statutory scheme.\n  All this is to say that the Obama administration's actions in this \narea far exceed any transitional relief authority the President might \nrightfully claim and instead amount to a vast illegitimate use and \nabuse of power by the executive branch. The Constitution obligates the \nPresident to follow the law. It also commands him to ``take care that \nthe laws be faithfully executed,'' meaning he must ensure that others \nsubject to his authority comply with the law.\n  In this case, President Obama has not only rejected his own \nobligation to follow and enforce the law, but he is also permitting, \neven urging, States to disobey their obligations to enforce ObamaCare. \nHe is likewise actively encouraging insurance companies to offer plans \nthat violate the company's explicit obligation under the minimum \ncoverage requirements. He is encouraging consumers to participate in \nand rely on this lawlessness by purchasing what are, in fact, unlawful \npolicies.\n  Such executive lawlessness should be troubling to all Americans \nregardless of political stripe or partisan affiliation. It is the \nConstitution, the political institutions it established, the legal \nframework it enshrines, the checks and balances it requires, that \nensures we remain a government of law and not of men. Absent these \nessential restraints, we will all become subject to increasing \narbitrary rule, a government that knows no bounds and seeks to regulate \nand control virtually every aspect of our lives.\n  Sadly, this is just one example of the administration's lawlessness \nin implementing ObamaCare. It gets worse, though. Consider the \nindividual mandate. I firmly believe the individual mandate constitutes \nan unprecedented and unconstitutional overreach that, in the words of \nSupreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, ``changes the relationship of \nthe Federal Government to the individual in a very fundamental way.''\n  But even as we seek to repeal and replace ObamaCare, for now the \nindividual mandate is the law of the land. The President who fought so \nhard to impose this terrible burden on the American people through the \nlegislative process and in the courts, is bound to enforce it.\n  Yet when it came time to implement the individual mandate, which the \nadministration long argued was the linchpin of the entire ObamaCare \nscheme and ``essential to creating effective health insurance \nmarkets,'' the administration simply decided that enforcing that \nprovision as written in law no longer suited their interests.\n  Again, I ask, did the Obama administration work with Congress to \nrelieve this burdensome mandate? Of course not.\n  As has become his habit, the President once again chose to act \nunilaterally, stretching his statutory and constitutional authority to \nthe breaking point in an effort to avoid engaging in the legislative \nprocess, the only legitimate means of revising the individual mandate.\n  Let me reiterate that I abhor ObamaCare's individual mandate. I want \nto repeal it, along with the rest of the Affordable Care Act, so that \nit no longer infringes on the liberties of any American. But either \nimplementing or repealing the individual mandate must be done lawfully, \nnot by executive fiat.\n  The administration sought to justify its unilateral actions to delay \napplication of the individual mandate on the basis of ObamaCare's \nhardship exemption. But in announcing the delay, the administration \ndetermined it would exempt anyone who simply completes a hardship form, \nindicates that their current insurance policy is being cancelled, and \nconsiders other available policies unaffordable. Such a standard is the \nvery definition of lawlessness, and it contradicts the letter of the \nlaw. Indeed, the White House and its supporters in Congress drafted \nexceptions to the individual mandate very narrowly to make it as \nuniversal as possible.\n  Although the statute gives the HHS Secretary some flexibility in \ngranting hardship exemptions, the plain text of the law specifies \nprecisely when a health plan is unaffordable, when it costs 8 percent \nor more of household\n\n[[Page S3173]]\n\nincome. By granting an exemption to anyone who subjectively thinks that \navailable coverage is unaffordable, HHS has made a mockery of the \nmandate, not to mention completely ignoring the affordability \nexemption's objective standard.\n  In doing so, the Obama administration has stretched beyond \nrecognition the limited regulatory authority it does possess, simply in \norder to frustrate enforcement of its prized individual mandate.\n  The administration's unwillingness to enforce the individual mandate, \nwhich lies at the very core of ObamaCare, demonstrates not only how the \nbill has failed to live up to its lofty promises, more fundamentally it \nshows how irresponsible the President has been in failing to live up to \nhis constitutional obligation to take care that the laws--his signature \nlaw, no less--be faithfully executed.\n  But the administration's lawlessness does not end with the individual \nmandate. Once again, it only gets worse. In a massive law chock-full of \nburdensome requirements, the administration has found it necessary to \nignore mandates of all shapes and sizes.\n  Take also the employer mandate. Perhaps less public attention is \nfocused on the administration's effort to dictate coverage requirements \nbacked by stiff penalties to every American business with more than 50 \nemployees. But this employer mandate would have devastating effects, \nfirst, by discouraging small businesses from hiring and thereby leaving \nmillions unemployed; second, by forcing employers to cut their \nemployees' work hours, limiting take-home pay for millions of current \nworkers struggling to get by; and, third, by discouraging many \nemployers from even providing health insurance to their workers, \nleaving millions of Americans to fend for themselves.\n  As the statutory deadline for implementing the employer mandate \napproached, even ObamaCare supporters feared these consequences, and \nthe administration once again unilaterally suspended its enforcement of \nthe law.\n  The first clue that the Obama administration was up to something \nillegitimate came when HHS announced its total suspension of the \nemployer mandate in a blog post euphemistically and ironically entitled \n``Continuing to Implement the ACA in a Careful, Thoughtful Manner.''\n  That such a significant announcement was made using insidiously \ninnocuous language, that it was made via such an informal medium, came \nas little surprise given this administration's propensity toward \nflippant and frequently unaccountable governance by blog post, hashtag, \nand selfie.\n  In this case, the announcement did not bother to identify any legal \nbasis for suspending the employer mandate and merely made passing \nreference to the limited concept of so-called transition relief.\n  Upon subsequent scrutiny, it became clear that the logic of \ntransition relief simply doesn't apply here because Congress and the \nPresident, in passing the bill into law, enacted an explicit statutory \nrequirement detailing when the employer mandate must be implemented. By \nacting in direct contravention of this explicit statutory deadline, the \npower of the Obama administration's authority was, as the Supreme Court \nexplained, ``at its lowest ebb,'' with the President authorized to act \nonly if Congress has no constitutional power to act. But in this case \nCongress's power to lay and collect tax is clearly enumerated in \narticle 1, section 8 of the Constitution.\n  In other words, the Obama administration's unilateral action to \nsuspend the employer mandate was lawless by any definition, including \nof the Supreme Court.\n  It did not have to be that way, and it should not have been that way. \nA broad bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives acted to \nprovide lawful statutory relief from the employer mandate. The House \nbill was strictly limited to changing the statutory deadlines for the \nemployer mandate and its reporting requirements, and the bill changed \nthose dates to match the timeline on which the administration announced \nit intended to begin enforcement. In other words, the House bill gave \nthe administration the precise employer mandate delay it wanted and the \nbill contained none of the other policy changes that most Republicans \nfavor.\n  When offered the opportunity to delay the employer mandate in a \nlawful manner, what did President Obama do? He threatened to veto it. \nBy doing so, the President conveyed in unmistakable fashion that his \npriority lies in political gamesmanship and that he has no respect for \nhis constitutional obligations.\n  I wish I could say the Obama administration's reckless and unlawful \nunilateralism in refusing to enforce the employer mandate ended there. \nSadly, it does not.\n  A few months later, the administration essentially rewrote the \nemployer mandate, announcing it would delay enforcement for years--and, \nin some cases, permanently--well beyond the precedence of past \nenforcement delays.\n  But it still gets worse. Rather than simply offer another blanket \ndelay of the employer mandate, the Obama administration went much \nfarther. Officials announced that the mandate would only be enforced \nfor businesses with 50 to 99 employees if those businesses failed to \ncomply with a new onerous maintenance-of-workforce regulations. That \nregulation prevents businesses from reducing the size of their \nworkforce or the overall hours of service of their employees unless \nthey have a bona fide business reason acceptable to government \nbureaucrats.\n  For businesses with more than 100 employees, the Obama administration \nlikewise suspended enforcement of the employer mandate until 2015, at \nwhich time executive officials will replace the statutory requirement \nrequiring coverage for all employees with a new administrative formula \nfor determining how many employees must be offered coverage.\n  I could stand here all day criticizing the backward logic and \nterrible consequences of having Federal bureaucrats police the \nemployment practices of our Nation's small businesses. There are so \nmany reasons why the employer mandate is bad policy, but I have come to \nthe floor today to highlight the sheer lawlessness of these unilateral \nexecutive actions.\n  In the case of the employer mandate, the law itself dictates when \nthat mandate should be enforced. HHS has not suggested that it lacks \nsufficient resources to enforce the mandate, nor can it have considered \nthe equity of enforcement in individual cases when it sweeps up every \nsingle business subject to this mandate and categorically refuses to \nenforce this law.\n  Instead, the Obama administration has simply abdicated its duty to \nenforce the law. Even worse, it has usurped legislative authority by \ndevising a wholly different scheme--a wholly different enforcement \nscheme--with its own conditions, goals, and timeline inconsistent with \nthose prescribed in the statute.\n  Sadly, the executive abuses of this administration in implementing \nObamaCare extend beyond the minimum coverage requirements and the \nindividual and employer mandates.\n  Consider the unilateral use of a so-called demonstration project to \ndivert attention from ObamaCare's cuts to Medicare Advantage. By \nproviding seniors an alternative to traditional Medicare that takes \nadvantage of market-based competition to enhance patient choice, \nquality of care, and cost-effectiveness, Medicare Advantage has proven \nan extraordinary success. I am pleased to have played a role in its \ncreation.\n  In advancing President Obama's now-broken promise that his health \ncare plan wouldn't add one dime to our deficits, the final ObamaCare \nbill mandated more than $300 billion--with a B--in cuts to Medicare \nAdvantage over 10 years.\n  But the Obama administration has had to grapple with yet another \ninconvenient fact. Medicare Advantage has become increasingly popular \nwith each passing year. As of last year, nearly 3 in 10 Medicare \nbeneficiaries chose it over traditional Medicare. In my home State of \nUtah, one in three beneficiaries receives coverage from Medicare \nAdvantage.\n  Rather than acknowledge his blunder and ask Congress to reverse \nObamaCare's unwise and unpopular Medicare Advantage cuts, the President \nhas once again taken unilateral action that makes a mockery of his \nsignature law.\n  His administration used a minor provision, one that allows the \nadministration to demonstrate different bonus\n\n[[Page S3174]]\n\npayment models in pilot programs as a thinly veiled guise for delaying \nMedicare Advantage cuts ahead of an election. Never mind the clear \nconflict between awarding the bonuses across the board and the \nstatutory purpose of such demonstration projects to determine if the \npayment changes produced efficiency and economy. Never mind the obvious \nabsurdity of pretending to use pseudodemonstration authority to delay \nthe Medicare Advantage cuts unilaterally, when such a demonstration is \nat least seven times larger than any other Medicare demonstration \nconducted since 1995 and is greater than the budgetary impact of all \nthose previous demonstrations combined. And never mind that the \nstatutory authority for the demonstrations calls for budget neutrality.\n  When I first learned of the Obama administration's clear abuse of \nthis narrow statutory authority, I asked GAO to investigate. GAO's \nreport confirmed that the administration had indeed exceeded its legal \nauthority and recommended canceling the program because it wasted \ntaxpayer money. Still, the administration pressed forward, simply \nignoring its obligations and usurping Congress's constitutional power \nof the purse.\n  I wish I could say this move was surprising, but through a repeated \npattern of such actions, President Obama and his administration have \nearned a reputation for executive arrogance and constitutional abuse.\n  The list of fundamentally illegal actions by this administration in \nimplementing ObamaCare goes on and on. For now, let me mention one more \nexample where President Obama has completely disregarded his obligation \nto enforce the law and yet again sought to usurp Congress's power to \nmake taxing and spending decisions through the constitutionally \nordained legislative process.\n  The ObamaCare provision at issue in this instance is remarkably \nsimple. It provides tax subsidies for individuals to purchase health \ncoverage through an exchange ``established by the State under section \n1311.''\n\n  Section 1311 is the provision of ObamaCare that allows States the \noption to create their own exchanges, but section 1311 is not the \nprovision that authorizes the creation of the Federal exchange to \noperate where the States choose not to act. That is section 1321.\n  I can't imagine how this provision could be any clearer. The law only \nauthorizes subsidies in connection with State exchanges, not the \nFederal exchange, and this is no accident. ObamaCare incorporated the \nprinciple of so-called cooperative federalism--a polite term for thinly \nveiled Federal coercion and commandeering of the sovereign States. \nIndeed, this figleaf hiding Federal dominance was critically important \nto rounding up 60 votes to pass ObamaCare in the Senate.\n  As my friend, the former Senate from Montana--now Ambassador to China \nand a principal author of the ObamaCare text--noted during the Finance \nCommittee markup of the bill, conditioning tax credits in this way was \nthe only means by which our committee could establish jurisdiction to \ndemand rewriting State insurance laws, as ObamaCare requires, but in \nthe end, the Federal Government's own exchange ended up covering the \nmajority of States.\n  As written, the law does not permit subsidies in connection with the \nFederal exchange. Given these circumstances, did the administration \nchoose to enforce the legislative compromises to which President Obama \nagreed by signing the bill into law? Did the White House seek to work \nwith Congress to address this disparity? Of course not.\n  Yet again, HHS chose to ignore the clear statutory restrictions and \ninstead authorized billions of dollars in illegal subsidies through the \nFederal exchange in direct conflict with the plain text of the law.\n  This obvious abuse has been challenged in court, and after hearing \nthe judges' deep skepticism of the administration's case, I am \nconfident the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit will roundly \nreject the Obama administration's radical arguments seeking to justify \nthis lawlessness. I hope the court will hold the administration \naccountable for its deliberate and unmistakable violation of the law \nand that it will do so despite the effort by President Obama and his \nallies to fill the DC Circuit with compliant judges who might overlook \nthe administration's executive abuses, but whatever that or any other \ncourt determines as a matter of specific legal principle, the fact \nremains that Obama administration officials--and in particular the HHS \nSecretary--have repeatedly and purposefully sought to undermine \nCongress, usurp legislative power, and become a law unto themselves.\n  President Obama came into office promising the most transparent and \naccountable Presidential administration in history. The Obama \nadministration has ended up being transparently lawless.\n  Today I have discussed only five examples of the administration's \nlawlessness in implementing ObamaCare. I will save for another day the \nsignificant legal concerns surrounding the administration's abusive \nhandling of high-risk pools, its actions involving the small business \nexchange, its sweetheart deals granting unauthorized exemptions for \nlabor unions, and many other similarly problematic actions.\n  But even in the five examples I have mentioned today, the overriding \npoint is clear: the tenure of President Obama has amounted to an \nunmistakable pattern of executive abuse. Time and again his \nadministration has flouted its constitutional responsibilities, \nexceeded its legitimate authority, ignored duly enacted law, and sought \nto escape any accountability for its executive overreach.\n  Such executive abuse cannot stand. Whether Republican or Democratic, \neach of us has a sworn obligation to defend the Constitution, and each \nof us has the responsibility to defend the rightful prerogatives of the \nlegislative branch. I have long argued that ObamaCare \nunconstitutionally intrudes on our most basic liberties, but those \nliberties cannot be secured when the executive branch defies legal \nbounds and ignores its constitutional obligations.\n  The continued well-being of our Nation, the legitimacy of our \nrepublican self-government, and the basic liberties of our fellow \ncitizens depend on ensuring the exercise of executive prerogative is \nproperly kept within lawful bounds. Doing so requires continual \nvigilance--by the courts, by Congress, and by the American people--\nespecially in the face of such reckless lawlessness by the current \nadministration.\n  Our Nation needs new leadership. Ultimately, we need to elect a new \nPresident in 2016, one who will respect the Constitution and seek to \nprotect the rights of its citizens, but until then we need an HHS \nSecretary who will uphold the law and respect the rightful prerogatives \nof the legislative branch.\n  That is why I pressed Ms. Burwell during her confirmation hearing \nlast week about the administration's illegitimate and lawless actions \nand about the need for a different approach. No matter how cordial our \ndebate may be, no matter her impressive qualifications, my overriding \nconcern is that she be accountable to Congress, to the law, and to the \nConstitution.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren).

Madam President, I wish to call to the attention of the \nSenate the fact that there is a three-dimensional film I had the \npleasure of seeing at the Air and Space Museum theater about one of the \nlargest and obviously most successful military invasions in the history \nof the planet, and that was 70 years ago on June 6, 1944, what is known \nas D-day. The film is narrated by Tom Brokaw. He is a natural because \nhe is well known for having written the book ``The Greatest \nGeneration'' about the people who fought in World War II.\n  The timeliness of this documentary film is fitting in that as we go \nfrom one generation to the next, the stories told by grandfathers and \ngreat-grandfathers to their children are not necessarily being told to \nthe next and younger generation. This film captivates in 3-D the plans, \nthe operation, the logistics, and the enormity of the task of taking \nback continental Europe from Hitler's armies and how we drove that by \ngoing onto the beaches at Normandy with our partners, the Canadians, \nthe Brits, the French, and how it was done painfully, with a lot of \nloss of life, particularly on Omaha Beach--there was a lot less \nresistance on Utah Beach--and how the participants with us from those \nother nations met similar and withering fire, as they stormed on the \nbeaches as well the night before the paratroopers dropped.\n  I remember when I was a young Congressman sitting at the knee of \nCongressman Sam Gibbons of Tampa, FL, and he would tell us about the \nlittle clickers called crickets as the paratroopers dropped in, many of \nthem because of a mistaken landing where they landed and drowned in \nareas that had been flooded by the Germans.\n  But those who survived and then tried to regroup in the dark of \nnight, you would determine when you ran into somebody in the dark if \nthey were friend or foe by this little clicker. We call them crickets. \nYou click it and it sounds like a cricket. If they clicked two times \nand the response was back, they knew they were friends; otherwise, they \nhad to protect their life.\n  Those are the stories that are not made up. They are real. These are \nthe stories of the British pilots in gliders. How in the world, in the \ndark of night, could they bring those gliders in, landing them safely, \ngetting out with those troops to go and secure the Pegasus Bridge which \nwas a critical crossing point that had to be taken from the Germans?\n  Story after story, how next to Omaha Beach where the fires were, \nbloody, how to the south of it was this cliff rising straight out with \nthese enormous German guns on top of it, and how the U.S. Army Rangers \nscaled those rock cliffs straight up and then took on and silenced the \nGerman guns.\n  These are the stories we do not want to lose from one generation to \nanother. So this film in 3-D, narrated by Tom Brokaw, I want to commend \nto the Senate family. It will be shown around the country now that it \nhas opened on the west coast and here. It is a wonderful educational \nlesson of American history, of how we turned back an invader that was \ntrying to change the world. Therefore, we were able to keep America \nfree, as well as our allies. I commend it to the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3176-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. NELSON.

Madam President, I come to the floor to congratulate \nJustice Carlos Moreno on his confirmation as U.S. Ambassador to Belize.\n  Justice Moreno has served on the Federal district court in Los \nAngeles and the California Supreme Court with distinction. I am \nconfident he will continue to proudly serve his country as our Nation's \nrepresentative to Belize.\n  I have strongly supported Justice Moreno's nomination because I know \nhim very well. He has a powerful intellect. He has a good heart, and he \nhas sound judgment.\n  The son of Mexican immigrants, Justice Moreno grew up in East Los \nAngeles. He was the first in his family to graduate from college, \nattending Yale on a scholarship and graduating in 1979. He earned his \nlaw degree from Stanford Law School in 1975.\n  He then worked at the city attorney's office, in private practice, \nand as a judge at two levels of our State's judicial system.\n  In 1997, I recommended him to President Clinton for appointment to \nthe district court in Los Angeles.\n  I knew then that he was a ``ten,'' and I was very proud to introduce \nhim to my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee and to support his \nnomination on the floor of the Senate at that time.\n  In fact, I was not the only member to speak on Justice Moreno's \nbehalf on the floor. Senator Hatch did so. Senator Leahy did so. And he \nwas confirmed 96-0.\n  The reason is, to quote a letter from then-Los Angeles County \nSherriff Sherman Block, that Justice Moreno ``is an extremely hard \nworking individual of impeccable character and integrity.''\n  In 2001, Justice Moreno was appointed by Governor Gray Davis to serve \non the Supreme Court of California.\n  I was sorry to see him leave the Federal district court, but I knew \nGovernor Davis had chosen an outstanding individual to serve on our \nState's highest court.\n  Anyone who has followed California law since then knows that Justice \nMoreno served with great distinction, writing with a clarity and \npassion that served as an inspiration to our State.\n  In 2008, I invited him to serve on my bipartisan Judicial Advisory \nCommittee in Los Angeles. I use these committees to advise me on whom \nto recommend to the President for seats on the U.S. district courts.\n  Over the last 6 years, I have come to rely on Justice Moreno's fine \njudgment and sound advice in making these important appointments.\n  Unfortunately, his nomination to be an ambassador meant that that \nJustice Moreno had to leave my Judicial Advisory Committee behind.\n  I will miss his advice on judicial appointments a great deal. But I \nbelieve very strongly that Justice Moreno's record shows he has the \nintellect, judgment, compassion, and temperament to serve our Nation \nvery well as an ambassador.\n  I am very pleased my colleagues agreed to confirm Moreno's \nnomination. He is certain to make us very proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3176-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3176-S3177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MARSHWOOD HIGH SCHOOL\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

These students, who are members of \nMarshwood's Advanced Placement U.S. Government and Politics class, \nearned first place for the Northeast Region during this competition \nthat tested their knowledge of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. \nI am so proud of them as I know how\n\n[[Page S3177]]\n\nhard they worked to achieve this ranking.\n  Under the direction of their dedicated and talented teacher, Mr. Matt \nSanzone, the class spent the school year studying the history and \nprinciples of American democracy in preparation for the competition. \nEach student developed a broad understanding of the Constitution. The \nclass also divided into smaller units to analyze in depth specific \nconstitutional concepts.\n  The Marshwood team met its first challenge in March when it won the \nState-level competition and earned the right to represent Maine in the \nNational Finals. Through simulated Congressional hearings, they \ndemonstrated their knowledge of the Constitution before a panel of \nMaine Supreme Judicial Court justices, constitutional scholars, \nlawyers, and public officials.\n  The team's keen interest in our democracy serves as an example to \nother students in Maine and around the country. I know that these \nstudents will use the lessons they have learned in the classroom and in \ncompetition to guide them throughout their lives, to inspire others, \nand to be grateful for the rights and freedoms we enjoy as Americans. I \ncongratulate these talented students from Maine on their extraordinary \nachievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3177-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO EDWARD BLAU\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

As an all around \nexpert on budget process and the Congress, Mr. Blau has been invaluable \nin helping the Budget Committee execute our responsibilities to the \nSenate.\n  Mr. Blau is well-regarded by both Democrats and Republicans for his \ntireless and diligent work--as well as his patient and easygoing \nmanner. His attention to detail includes reviewing each and every \nCongressional Record to ensure that the database he maintains to help \nus with managing the Senate budget process is up-to-date at all times. \nIt is an incredibly important task and one that we are grateful to Mr. \nBlau for his help in overseeing the past three decades.\n  In short, Mr. Blau exemplifies CBO's high standard of \nprofessionalism, objectivity, and nonpartisanship. In fact, he twice \nhas received the CBO Director's Award, the agency's highest recognition \nfor outstanding performance.\n  As chairman, I greatly appreciate the sacrifice that Mr. Blau has \nmade in assisting the Budget Committee and the Congress. I wish him \nwell in his future endeavors, including, as I understand it, a plan to \nspend more time following in person his beloved Nationals--the other \nWashington baseball team.\n  I would like to now turn to my colleague, Senator Sessions, for his \nremarks.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Chairman Murray and join her in commending Mr. \nBlau for his many years of dedicated and outstanding service to CBO, \nthe Congress, and the American people. We wish him all the best in his \nwell-deserved retirement.\n  We hope our colleagues will join us in thanking Mr. Blau--and really \nall of the hardworking employees at the Congressional Budget Office--\nfor his and their service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3177-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, on May 17, 1954, U.S. Supreme Court \nChief Justice Earl Warren delivered the unanimous ruling in the \nlandmark civil rights case Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, \nKansas. The Court declared segregation of public schools \nunconstitutional under the equal protection guaranteed by the 14th \namendment. In delivering the opinion, Chief Justice Warren stated that \n``in the field of public education the doctrine of `separate but equal' \nhas no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.'' \nMay 17, 2014, marks the 60th anniversary of the Supreme Court's \nlandmark decision. This historic ruling began our great Nation down a \npath toward providing all children with equal access to education.\n  Education is a basic human right, and all students deserve equal \naccess to education. I would like to acknowledge the courageous \nstudents who attended desegregated schools during the years following \nthe ruling on Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. African-\nAmerican students in the South endured verbal and physical abuse just \nfor attending school. Their actions to attend desegregated schools not \nonly demonstrate their remarkable bravery but also the importance of \neducation.\n  Equal protection under the law is a fundamental right in our country. \nNo one should suffer discrimination because of their race, religion, \nnational origin, age, sex, disability, sexual orientation, or gender \nidentity. Whether applying for a job, finding a home, eating in a \nrestaurant, or attending school, we must ensure all citizens are \ntreated fairly and equally. To me, the fight for equality is a fight \nfor what it means to be American. That is why the 60th anniversary of \nthe Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, decision is so \nimportant. May 17, 1954, was a momentous day for the civil rights \nmovement and moved America a step closer toward justice and equality \nfor all.\n  Sixty years later, thanks to the Supreme Court's decision, students \nfrom all walks of life are guaranteed equal access to public schools. \nYet there is still more work to be done. Although 60 years have passed \nsince the Court declared separate is never equal, many schools across \nour country remain divided by race and socioeconomic status. A child's \naccess to a world-class education should not be determined by their ZIP \ncode or parents' income. So, as our country reflects on the historic \nimportance of the decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, \nKansas, we must also look to the future, to continue the fight to \nensure all children, regardless of race, have equal access to high \nquality education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3177-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3177-S3178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                STRONG START FOR AMERICA'S CHILDREN ACT\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, the question is not whether but how \nbest to make early childhood education available to the largest number \nof children.\n  The approach that I am offering is quite different than the \nDemocratic proposal.\n  Last year this time around, the Senate HELP Committee held a markup \non another bill which was the Senate Democrats' proposal to reauthorize \nNo Child Left Behind.\n  I said then that over the last decade, the combination of No Child \nLeft Behind, Race to the Top, and the Obama administration's use of \nwaivers has created a congestion of Federal mandates and rules that \namount, in effect, to a national school board for elementary and \nsecondary education.\n  The proposal that the HELP committee approved last year on a partisan \nvote would have ``doubled down'' on those mandates by setting \nperformance standards, giving the Secretary of Education the authority \nto tell 100,000 public schools what their standards and tests should \nlook like, how to measure their students' progress, and how to evaluate \ntheir teachers. And I said, then too, that if we wanted anyone to serve \nas chairman of the national school board, Arne Duncan would be a \nterrific one but Congress has said repeatedly that we don't want a \nnational school board.\n  Unfortunately, the bill that Senate Democrats are proposing today has \na familiar ring to it. It would, in effect, create a national school \nboard for 3- and 4-year-olds.\n  It would spend $27 billion in new funding over 5 years with \nWashington making the decisions about how States should run their \npreschool programs.\n  For example, it includes a lot of requirements for States that I \ndon't think the Federal Government has ever even attempted with \nelementary and secondary education, such as: determining teacher \nsalaries--that all preschool teachers be paid at a rate that is \ncomparable to K-12 school teachers; class sizes, student-teacher \nratios--class sizes can't be larger than 20 children, the ratio of \nstudents to teachers may be no higher than 10 to 1; length of\n\n[[Page S3178]]\n\nthe school day--a minimum of 5 hours or as long as a typical day in the \nK-12 system.\n  Never before, not even in No Child Left Behind, has the Federal \nGovernment told school districts in Maryville or Murfreesboro or \nMemphis how to run their schools in such detail.\n  The bill also includes requirements that sound a lot like what hasn't \nworked so well under No Child Left Behind, Race to the Top, and \nwaivers, such as: that States must ensure that preschool teachers have \na bachelor's degree in early childhood education--sounds a lot like the \nHighly Qualified Teacher provision; that States must establish early \nlearning and development standards and age appropriate standardized \ntests aligned to the State's academic standards under No Child Left \nBehind, which for more than 40 States now means Common Core.\n  Furthermore, that these standards, curriculum, and tests must be: \ndevelopmentally-appropriate; culturally and linguistically appropriate; \naddress all domains of school readiness, including physical well-being, \net cetera.\n  Then there are an assortment of vague requirements on States, which \nwill depend on the Department of Education issuing hundreds of pages of \nregulations and guidance of histories to define and implement, such \nthings as: vision, dental, and health services; mandatory family \nengagement such as parent conferences; nutritious meals and snack \noptions--what they consist of; physical activity programs that are \nevidence-based according to guidelines; evidence-based health and \nsafety standards; regular classroom observations and coaching for \nteachers.\n  Finally, the bill also includes new maintenance of effort standards. \nWe know what happened with those in Medicaid, during the last 5 or 6 \nyears.\n  As State economies tumbled, States were forced to continue to spend \nmore on Medicaid by maintenance of effort requirements. And that \nresulted in less money for higher education and driving up tuition \nrates.\n  Washington would pay 90 percent of the program's cost for the first \nyear for the Democratic proposal, but the required share of State \nspending will increase each year, eventually half the bill to Governors \nafter 8 years. And that also has a familiar ring.\n  Sounds a lot like Medicaid, where the State average is about 43 \npercent and most of the rules are Federal, even though the States pay \nnearly half.\n  What has happened with that model? Well, when I was Governor in the \n1980s in Tennessee, Medicaid was 8 percent of the State budget. Today \nit's 30 percent of the State budget.\n  Americans don't want a national school board. We'd like to move in a \ndifferent direction. I'd like to take, as an example of why we should, \nthe testimony of a witness at a HELP Committee hearing on this issue.\n  Superintendent John White of Louisiana testified that the ``greatest \nbarrier to achieving these conditions that we want in early childhood \neducation--no less than financial resources themselves--is the \nfragmentation of our country's early childhood education system.''\n  He went on to say: ``You can't claim to be providing full access and \nfull choice when you have separate centers, separate funding streams, \nseparate sets of regulations that literally require no coordination in \nthe offering of seats, even within the same neighborhood.''\n  That's the situation in Louisiana, and the Government Accountability \nOffice says it's true around the country.\n  Forty-five different programs support early education and child care. \nThirty-three of those permit the use of funds to provide support or \nrelated services to children from birth through 5. Twelve programs have \nthe explicit purpose to provide childhood and preschool or child care \nservices.\n  Then there are 5 tax provisions that subsidize private expenditures \nin the area of early childhood and preschool programs.\n  This year, Congress appropriated roughly $15 billion for the 12 \nprograms explicitly focused on early childhood, Head Start, Race to the \nTop, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and the Child Care \nand Development Block Grant.\n  And then there's another $3 billion in tax credits.\n  An earlier witness before our committee estimated that when you add \nup the 33 programs, the total Federal spending in this area is now \nabout $22 billion.\n  So, we believe a better way to give all children the best early \nlearning experience is to provide States with the flexibility to use \nsome or all of the more than $22 billion in Federal money that we \nalready spend and allow States to use it in the way that best suits \ntheir needs.\n  Under my proposal, Superintendent White would be able to take \nLouisiana's share of the $22 billion that the Federal Government spends \non early childhood and preschool programs--about $300 million--and do \njust that. In Tennessee, we'd have about $440 million a year.\n  If we were given this kind of flexibility, we could increase the \nvouchers for child care from 39,000 to 139,000; or the State-funded \nvoluntary preschool program, from 18,000 4-year-olds to 109,000. Or we \ncould expand Head Start, from 17,000 children to 56,000 or some \ncombination of that. We could create Centers of Excellence and \notherwise leave to Tennessee to figure out what works best for \nTennesseans.\n  So, the question is not whether, but how best to make early childhood \neducation available to the largest possible number of children. The \nanswer to that question is to not create a national school board for 3- \nand 4-year-olds to go along with the one we've effectively established \nfor K-12 education.\n  That is why I opposed the Democratic proposal and instead offered a \nproposal to enable States to take responsibility for developing the \nearly learning systems that best meet their needs and to use up to $22 \nbillion of existing federal dollars to help fund that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3178-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                BELARUS\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.

Madam President, I wish to recognize National Tourette \nSyndrome Awareness Month, which runs from May 15, 2014, through June \n15, 2014. This annual observance is an opportunity for us to help the \nmany Americans affected by Tourette syndrome by raising awareness and \nencouraging expanded investments in research.\n  Tourette syndrome, or TS, is a neurological disorder that typically \ndevelops during childhood. TS is characterized by repetitive, \nstereotyped, involuntary movements and vocalizations called tics, which \ncan range from mild to severe and disabling. The National Institutes of \nHealth, NIH, estimates that 200,000 Americans have the most severe form \nof TS and as many as 1 in 100 Americans exhibit milder symptoms such as \nchronic motor or vocal tics. Additionally, people with TS often have \nother co-occurring mental or behavior health conditions. A child \ndiagnosed with TS has a 79-percent chance of being diagnosed with \nanother condition such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, \nADHD, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, OCD, anxiety or depression.\n\n[[Page S3179]]\n\n  An often misunderstood and stigmatizing disorder, TS can have a \nprofound and negative impact on the quality of life of those affected. \nResearch indicates that TS may be hereditary and that abnormal \nsignaling between brain circuits plays a casual role, but the cause of \nthe disorder remains unknown. Treatments for TS are also limited, \nalthough several agents have proven effective in mitigating tics and \nimproving social functioning.\n  Expanding our national research efforts on TS can help us to identify \nthe cause, discover new treatments, and find a cure. Last session, I \nintroduced the Collaborative Academic Research Efforts, CARE, for \nTourette Syndrome Act, which builds upon our national research efforts \nin two major ways. First, the bill expands and intensifies data \ncollection on the prevalence of TS and the availability of medical and \nsocial services for those with TS and their families. Second, the bill \nestablishes centers of excellence to conduct in depth, \nmultidisciplinary research into the causes, treatments, diagnosis, and \nprevention of TS.\n  National Tourette Syndrome Awareness Month, which runs from May 15 to \nJune 15, presents us with an opportunity to advocate for the passage of \nthe Collaborative Academic Research Efforts, CARE, for Tourette \nSyndrome Act (S. 637). We must provide the NIH with the tools necessary \nto further our understanding of TS. Through greater awareness, expanded \ninformation, and enhanced therapies and treatments, it is my hope that \nwe will improve the quality of life for all people touched by TS.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3179-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HARRISBURG REGIONAL CHAMBER ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I wish to recognize the Harrisburg \nRegional Chamber on its 100th anniversary.\n  The Harrisburg Regional Chamber was established in 1914 by a group of \nlocal businessmen whose goal was to promote and grow Harrisburg's \nmanufacturing and distribution industries. Since then, the Harrisburg \nRegional Chamber has been a catalyst for smart public policy, job \ncreation, and business growth in central Pennsylvania. Starting with \n200 initial members, the Harrisburg Regional Chamber has grown to \nrepresent 1,300 members who employ nearly 100,000 people in the capital \ncity region.\n  Over the course of its 100 years, the Harrisburg Regional Chamber has \nplayed a key role in the planning and development of numerous \nconstruction and infrastructure projects in the region. Without the \nchamber's assistance, historic structures such as the Penn-Harris Hotel \nmay not have ever been built. The chamber was also instrumental in \ndeveloping the region's first airport in 1930. Additionally, the \nchamber backed U.S. military construction projects at Olmstead Army Air \nDepot in Middletown, the U.S. Army General Depot at New Cumberland Army \nDepot, and at Carlisle Barracks.\n  Since 2001, the Harrisburg Regional Chamber has completed 355 \nprojects, which have had an overall economic impact of $416 million and \nassisted businesses throughout the region create and retain over 12,500 \njobs.\n  The Harrisburg Regional Chamber is dedicated to the success of the \ncommunity and the members it represents. It continues to strive toward \nthe fulfillment of its core mission by adhering to a set of fundamental \nvalues: excellence, leadership, inclusion, innovation, and fun.\n  Today, I want to recognize the significant contributions that the \nHarrisburg Regional Chamber makes to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. \nI wish the chamber all the best as it continues its efforts to lead by \nexample with a vision for a better future for all and as it continues \nto grow and serve central Pennsylvania.

JONES\n\n Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I wish to recognize TSgt \nMichele L. Jones, originally from Pawcatuck, CT, on the occasion of her \nretirement from the U.S. Air Force. Since enlisting in the Air Force on \nDecember 17, 1992, she has served honorably all over the world--Iraq, \nJapan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Korea--while participating in and \ndirectly supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring \nFreedom.\n  Technical Sergeant Jones started her career as an information \nmanagement apprentice at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, NE. Following \nthat post, she was transferred in 1995 to Kunsan Air Force Base in the \nRepublic of Korea, the first of many demanding overseas assignments. \nShe then served at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama from 1997 to 1999.\n  Continuing her rise through the ranks, Technical Sergeant Jones \nserved again in the Republic of Korea, at Osan Air Force Base, from \n1999 to 2000. This was immediately followed by a 7-year tour in Japan \nwith the 35th Civil Engineer Squadron at Misawa Air Force Base, where \nshe served in the Big Sister Program and the Special Olympics.\n  As a noncommissioned officer, Technical Sergeant Jones was recognized \nas a top leader and expeditionary airman. While in Japan, she deployed \nto Saudi Arabia and Iraq and distinguished herself while serving with \nthe Civilian Police Assistance Training Team in Baghdad. During this \ntour, she earned high praise from LTG David Petraeus, then the \ncommanding general of Multi-National Security Transition Command--Iraq. \nIn addition to the personal recognition she has received, Technical \nSergeant Jones' hard work and leadership helped her units earn awards \nas top commands in Japan and the Air Force.\n  Following these demanding operational tours, Technical Sergeant Jones \ntransferred to Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada in 2007. Assigned as the \n563rd Rescue Group's information manager, she once again deployed to \nIraq in 2008, serving as the noncommissioned officer-in-charge, Task \nForce 134 in Baghdad, Iraq. She returned to Nellis Air Force Base and \nserved in the 53rd Test and Evaluation Group before deploying in 2010 \nto Qatar. There, she served as the noncommissioned officer in charge of \nprotocol at Al Udeid Air Base, supporting Operations Enduring Freedom \nand New Dawn.\n  Finally, during Technical Sergeant Jones' long and exemplary career, \nshe has interacted regularly with Congress. While deployed to MacDill \nAir Force Base, where she supported U.S. Central Command, or CENTCOM, \nTechnical Sergeant Jones coordinated Congressional delegation visits to \nthe CENTCOM Area of Responsibility, which included Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The able travel assistance she offered to Members of \nCongress and senior Defense Department leaders earned personal \nrecognition from the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Vice \nPresident of the United States. Since 2012, Technical Sergeant Jones \nhas provided additional outstanding support through her service in the \nOffice of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs.\n  I am delighted to commend Technical Sergeant Jones for her more than \ntwo decades of distinguished service to our Nation. I wish her the best \nas she begins the next chapter of her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3179-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3179-S3180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO GIBB STEELE\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I am pleased to commend Mr. Gibb \nSteele of Longwood, MS, for his service and contributions to the State \nof Mississippi while serving as the 78th president of the Delta \nCouncil. On May 30, 2014, Mr. Steele will conclude his term as \npresident. I am grateful for his leadership and dedication to improving \nthe quality of life in the Mississippi Delta and the entire State. \nSince 1935, Delta Council has played an important role in the promotion \nof agriculture, flood control, and economic development in the delta, \nwhich is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world.\n  Mr. Steele's tenure as council president coincided with the \ndevelopment and eventual enactment of the 2014 farm bill. Throughout \nthat process, he provided beneficial input from Southern rice, cotton, \ncorn, soybean, and catfish producers, which helped Congress craft a \nnew, 5-year agriculture policy bill. He was committed to meeting the \ndiverse needs of producers from various regions of the country who face \ndifferent risks when providing food and\n\n[[Page S3180]]\n\nfiber for the Nation. Mississippi has a rich agricultural history, and \nagriculture and related businesses support the livelihoods of thousands \nof Mississippi families and communities. Mr. Steele's leadership over \nthe past year contributed to the overall success of the farm bill \nendeavor, and I appreciate his advice and counsel related to serving \nthe interests of our State.\n  In addition to his role as president of Delta Council, Mr. Steele \nhimself farms rice, soybeans, corn, and wheat on several thousand acres \nscattered throughout Washington County. He also holds leadership \npositions with the Mississippi Rice Promotion Board, the Mississippi \nRice Council, and the USA Rice Federation, and is a commissioner of the \nWashington County Drainage Commission and past president of the \nHollandale Rotary Club.\n  Mr. Steele grew up on a small sheep farm in Greenwood. After earning \na degree from Mississippi State University, he began farming with his \nfather in Hollandale in 1973. Their farming operation has grown 20 \ntimes the size of the roughly 500 acres they first cultivated in the \nearly 1970s. Gibb Steele has achieved great success in agriculture, and \nhis willingness to give back to the Delta region by serving as \npresident of Delta Council is commendable. I applaud Mr. Steele for his \nservice to Mississippi, and share this appreciation with his wife Pam, \nhis son Gibson, and his two grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3180-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING RAYMONDE FIOL\n\n Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I wish to congratulate Mrs. \nRaymonde Fiol for being named the 2014 Nevada Senior Citizen of the \nYear, an honor that is well deserved by this truly remarkable Nevadan.\n  Every year in May, Nevada celebrates Older Americans Month to \nrecognize senior citizens for their contributions to our communities \nand to bring awareness on ways to continue a healthy, safe, and mobile \nlifestyle. Thirteen percent of Nevada's population is over the age of \n65, and these individuals like Mrs. Fiol, who are dedicated to \nstrengthening our communities, are why our State has much to celebrate \nthis month.\n  The Nevada Delegation of the National Silver Haired Congress, in \npartnership with the Aging Services Directors Organization, established \nthis award in 2013 to honor individuals who have selflessly worked to \nimprove their community. Given Mrs. Fiol's remarkable life story and \ndedication during her many years of work to preserve the memory of the \nHolocaust, it is easy to see why she has been chosen. At the age of 3 \nyears old, she was saved and sheltered when the Nazis invaded Paris. \nBoth of her parents were murdered at the concentration camp in \nAuschwitz. Against all odds, Mrs. Fiol is now living in Las Vegas, NV, \nand using her days to spread a message of tolerance through her role as \nthe president of the Holocaust Survivors Group of Southern Nevada and \nboard member of the Governor's Advisory Council on Education Relating \nto the Holocaust. She also serves on the Coordinating Council of \nGenerations of the Shoah International, the largest Holocaust survivor \nfamily organization in the world, and works to arrange social events \nfor the Las Vegas community survivors.\n  When she is not volunteering on these boards, you can find Mrs. Fiol \nin the classroom sharing her story with Nevada's youth or with UNLV's \ndocumentary filmmakers capturing her life and story, all with the noble \ngoal of ensuring that the world will never again turn a blind eye to \nstate-operated genocide of a culture. Mrs. Fiol is dedicated to making \nthis world a better place and educating our youth about the hardships \nthat people have had to endure and about a time in our world's history \nthat we must never forget. Her strength serves as an example not only \nto the Silver State but to the entire Nation.\n  Mrs. Fiol's mission and commitment to helping all of those who were \naffected by the Holocaust and to educating Nevada's youth about one of \nthe darkest times in international history is commendable, and I am \nboth honored and humbled to congratulate her today. She is a remarkable \nwoman who deserves our utmost praise and respect.

She spent the next 17 years \ndedicated to the university and in July of 2006 she became BHSU's ninth \npresident and first female president.\n  During her tenure as president at BHSU, she has managed the expansion \nand upgrade of the university's infrastructure and curriculum and has \ncontinued to enhance the university's already well-known and well-\nregarded reputation in the State, region, nation and world. Under her \nguidance, she has continued to aggressively promote the school's \nmission as an institution of excellence in teaching and learning, \nsupport and enhance research opportunities and maintain an impressive \narray of high-quality undergraduate and graduate programs.\n  Dr. Schallenkamp has also been actively involved in the higher \neducation community nationwide.

His work to protect \ncommunity landmarks and Portland's prized natural areas earned him \nnational recognition, including being appointed by President Ronald \nReagan to the President's Commission on Americans Outdoors and by \nPresident Bill Clinton to the American Heritage Rivers Initiative \nAdvisory Committee. Charles also served on the board of The \nConservation Fund for 20 years, and became the first African American \nto lead a national environmental organization when he served as \nchairman of the organization's board of directors.\n  Like me, Charles Jordan was a tall guy who went to school on a \nbasketball scholarship but found his calling in public service. His \npassion for equality, fairness and positive change improved the lives \nof many. Under Charles' tenure, the Portland Parks and Recreation \nDepartment increased the impact that parks had on everyone's lives, \nparticularly children. Thanks to his leadership, the number of parks \nand natural areas in the City of Portland increased from 184 to 228, \ncreating the opportunity for more and more families of all income \nlevels to enjoy the outdoors. His innovative work led to Portland's \naward of the National Gold Medal in 2011 as the best parks system in \nthe Nation from the American Academy for Park and Recreation \nAdministration and the National Recreation and Park Association, the \nNation's leading public park and recreation organizations.\n  His dedication to providing open spaces for children to play, along \nwith safe community centers for families to gather, were the result of \nhis inherent belief that all people must be treated with respect and \ndignity. In 2012, one of Portland's most popular community centers was \nrenamed the Charles Jordan Community Center, a fitting tribute to the \nadvice he gave to many kids:\n\n       Model the way. You never know who is watching and wanting \n     to be just like you.\n\n  In addition to all his hard work I have already mentioned, Charles \nalso served as my go-to person on senior issues. His insight and advice \nalways helped me see the right path forward. For that, and many other \nreasons, his loss has left a void.\n  Oregon commemorates his leadership in parks, conservation, providing \naccess to the outdoors for all Americans, civic involvement and civil \nrights. My thoughts are with his wife Esther, his son Dion, and his \ndaughter Trish. Charles was a true giant of our State, and he will be \ndeeply missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3181-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3181-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceeding.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3181-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:20 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 309.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 2357. A bill to provide for improvements in the consistency of \ndata collection, reporting, and assessment in connection with the \nsuicide prevention efforts of the Department of Defense; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President I have come to the floor today to \nintroduce a piece of legislation that I feel is timely and critically \nnecessary, the Department of Defense Suicide Tracking Act of 2014. As \nour Nation winds down involvement in the longest war in our history, it \nis incumbent on all of us to ensure that the men and women who have \ncarried the burden of combat in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other parts of \nthe world, as well as their family members, are taken care of to the \nfullest extent possible. That means we must address the tragic suicide \nepidemic in our military. While the services have focused on this \nproblem for years, there still appears to be significant gaps, \nespecially in reserve component and dependent tracking and analysis. \nThis is a complex issue with no obvious solutions, but I intend to work \nwith my colleagues in the Senate to develop comprehensive, meaningful \nways to address this problem.\n  The DoD recently released its 2012 DoD Suicide Event Report, which \nconcluded that there were a total of 319 active component suicides and \n203 reserve\n\n[[Page S3188]]\n\ncomponent suicides in 2012. That equates to 22.7 and 24.2 for every \n100,000 service members, respectively. Additionally, there were a total \nof 841 attempted suicides in 2012. While preliminary data suggests that \n2013 had an 18 percent drop in suicides, this is still a significant \nand tragic problem in the military that we need to tackle head-on. The \nreport doesn't include any data for dependent suicide or attempted \nsuicide, because currently only the U.S. Army even tries to track that \ninformation, so there is no comprehensive assessment of how years of \ncombat and readiness have impacted military dependents in that way.\n  The purpose of the DoD Suicide Tracking Act is to establish programs \nto consistently track and analyze information regarding suicides \ninvolving members of the reserve components and dependents of regular \nand reserve component members. Specifically, the bill would improve \nconsistency in reserve component suicide prevention and resiliency \nprograms by requiring the Secretary of Defense to develop a standard \nmethod for collecting, reporting, and assessing suicide data and \nsuicide attempt data involving members of the National Guard and \nReserves. Alaskans are extremely proud of the contributions of our \nNational Guard and Reserve members, both home and abroad. They have \nendured the stress of readiness, deployments and combat like the active \ncomponent, making us all very proud. As such, it is time that we ensure \nthe Department of Defense is tracking and addressing their mental well-\nbeing just like every other military member.\n  According to an annual survey by the Blue Star Families military \nfamily advocacy group, of 5,100 military family members surveyed in \n2012, 9 percent of military spouses reported that they had considered \nsuicide. Of those, nearly a quarter said they had not sought help. This \nbill would establish a Department of Defense suicide prevention program \nfor military dependents that requires each service to implement \nprograms to track, report and analyze information regarding suicides. \nWe often talk about the burden placed on military family members, but \nwhen it comes to suicide we have simply cut them out of the \nconversation. This bill would ensure the DoD finally focuses on the \nhardship and emotional stress born by military dependents and keeps \nthem in the picture when evaluating the problem and working towards a \nsolution. Our military family members have endured countless \ndeployments, cared for injured service members, and picked up the \npieces when heroes have made the ultimate sacrifice. I intend to make \nsure our government cares for them and gives them options beyond \nsuicide to recover from their pain and emotional stress.\n  Suicide among the active military, reserve and veteran populations \ncontinues to be a problem that doesn't appear to be improving. Sadly, \nthe problem will likely get worse before it improves as the war in \nAfghanistan winds down and the services downsize, sending veterans with \ncomplex mental issues into the private sector without the military for \nsupport. That is why we need to improve our efforts now to proactively \nidentify and care for these service members and their families as soon \nas possible and with the full resourcing of the Department of Defense. \nOur military men and women, and their families, have endured years of \nconflict across the world. They embody the proud tradition of selfless \nservice to our Nation and I cannot thank them enough for everything \nthey do. I call on all of my colleagues in the Senate to help those who \nhave dedicated their lives to helping others and who, day in and day \nout, make the ultimate sacrifice in the defense of our freedoms.\n  I would like to thank Representative Niki Tsongas for her leadership \non this issue and introduction of the House companion bill, H.R. 4504.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        Cardin, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Kaine, Ms. Hirono, Mr. King, Ms. Stabenow, \n        Mr. Schatz, Ms. Warren, Mr. Reed, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Franken, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Walsh, and Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 2360. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe rules relating to inverted corporations; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, along with 16 cosponsors, I have introduced \nand am introducing today the Stop Corporate Inversions Act of 2014.\n  This legislation is designed to address a loophole which, unless we \nclose it, will be used to unleash a flood of corporate tax avoidance \nthat threatens to shove billions of dollars in tax burden from \nprofitable multinational corporations onto the backs of their American \ncompetitors and other American taxpayers.\n  The issue we seek to address is known technically as corporate \ninversion. The details of inversion sound complex, but the principle is \nnot. Inversion means avoiding potentially billions of dollars of U.S. \ntaxes by changing a corporation's address for tax purposes to an \noffshore location. What we have is a tax avoidance scheme, an enormous \nloophole that allows companies to avoid billions in taxes without any \nsignificant change in where they operate, where their profits are \ngenerated, or where the location is of the executives who manage and \ncontrol these corporations.\n  A recent prominent example involves Pfizer, a U.S. drug company, and \nAstroZeneca, a U.K.-based company. This proposed corporate takeover, \nwhich Pfizer makes abundantly clear is all about avoiding U.S. taxes, \nhas gotten a lot of attention, and for good reason. It would cost the \nUnited States about $1 billion a year in tax revenue. But this is not \njust about two companies. This is not just about one merger, even a \nmerger that could shove billions of dollars of tax burden on other U.S. \ntaxpayers. The Pfizer-AstroZeneca deal is the latest example of abusive \ninversion deals. You cannot pick up a newspaper's business section \nthese days without reading about what Reuters calls ``a wave of tax-\ndriven overseas deal-making.'' Some companies that believe they are \nmeeting their tax obligations are under competitive pressure to invert. \nIt is clear dozens, perhaps scores, of companies are preparing to file \ntheir change-of-address cards and in doing so avoid billions in U.S. \ntaxes. That burden doesn't just go away. Either our remaining \nconstituents must pick up the tab or the loss of Treasury revenue adds \nto the Federal deficit.\n  We tightened the rules regarding inversion schemes in 2004, and we \ndid so promptly and on a bipartisan basis, but recent events show an \nenormous loophole remains, and so our bill seeks to address that \nloophole, and I hope once again we can do so promptly and on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  Essentially the problem we have today is that a U.S.-based \nmultinational can file a change-of-address card with the IRS simply by \nacquiring an offshore company that is much smaller than the U.S. \ncompany. Our bill would ensure that any inversion would meet a much \nmore stringent test.\n  Under current law, companies can pull off an inversion with a \nfraction of their stock, just over 20 percent, in the hands of the new \nstockholders overseas. Our bill would raise that threshold to 50 \npercent or more. In addition, it would stop tax-avoiding inversions in \ncases where management and control remain in the United States.\n  President Obama's 2014 budget included a similar proposal which one \nexpert told the New York Times ``essentially eliminates inversions as \nwe know them.''\n  Our bill provides for a 2-year moratorium of tax avoidance through \nthe use of inversions. Why a 2-year moratorium? This is in response to \na number of our colleagues who say this is an issue which should wait \nfor comprehensive tax reform. We all believe in comprehensive tax \nreform--or most of us do--but it is going to take time and it is \nuncertain. These corporate inversions represent an immediate threat. \nOur Treasury is bleeding from these inversions and from other loopholes \nwhich corporations use to avoid paying taxes. This bill is first aid \nfor the Tax Code. A 2-year moratorium on inversions that do not meet \nour tougher standard stops the bleeding while we debate the \ncomprehensive tax reform that most of us believe is desirable.\n  As of this moment, however, there is no comprehensive tax reform \nlegislation pending in either Chamber of Congress. There is no debate \nscheduled.\n\n[[Page S3189]]\n\nThere is, in fact, not a single comprehensive tax reform proposal that \nhas been formally introduced as legislation. That is not because no one \nin Congress cares about tax reform; nearly everybody does. But broadly \nreforming taxes is a complicated and time-consuming process.\n  But we simply cannot wait. Multinationals are exploiting this \nloophole today. Meanwhile, hard-working American taxpayers and small \nbusiness owners and even large corporations that have to compete with \nthe tax avoiders but believe that inversion is wrong for their \ncompanies and for America see their tax burden rise while our national \ndebt grows. How do we look them in the eye and say, ``We had a way to \nhalt this gimmick, but we decided to wait for comprehensive reform that \nmay or may not ever materialize?''\n  This is similar to what Congress did on a bipartisan basis a decade \nago. Then Senators Baucus and Grassley jointly declared they were \nworking on legislation to stop abusive tax inversions. The bill, along \nwith Chairman Wyden's announcement 2 weeks ago, should make clear to \ncompanies that considering tax inversion is now a mistake, because they \nare now on notice that it is not going to gain anything if a bill that \nprohibits tax avoidance through tax inversion passes, because the \nchairman of the Finance Committee has made it clear such a bill is \ngoing to be effective as of May 8 of this year, regardless of when the \nbill passes.\n  So companies are on notice. There is no use rushing to the door to \ninvert, or leaving the country to invert. It won't do them any good if \nthe Finance Committee chairman has his way with either of these bills \nor other bills that set an appropriate date, such as May 8, to pass the \nCongress.\n  These multinational companies benefit from the safety and security \nthe U.S. Government provides. Our troops protect them. Our intellectual \nproperty rights protections allow them to profit from their innovation. \nThey benefit from federally funded research. They claim tax subsidies \nfor their research and development. They raise capital in U.S. \nsecurities markets that are the envy of the world, thanks to the rule \nof law this government protects.\n  In the last 4 years, one of the companies at the center of this \ndebate, Pfizer, received more than $4.4 billion in taxpayer money for \nfederal contracts. Last month the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention awarded Pfizer a $1.1 billion contract.\n  Yet that company and others are now poised to shortchange Uncle Sam \nby billions of dollars simply by changing their address for tax \npurposes. I am sure most of our constituents wish they could do that. \nMichigan taxpayers cannot reduce their tax bill with the stroke of a \npen. Michigan small businesses cannot pretend they are based offshore \nfor tax purposes. There is no pretense that any of these corporate \ninversions make sense from any standpoint other than avoiding U.S. \ntaxes. That is their motivation and these companies aren't shy about \nsaying so. They will continue to operate in the United States. The \nexecutives who manage them will continue to live and work in the United \nStates. They will live under the umbrella of protection that our men \nand women in uniform provide, at the same time that we are cutting \nsupport to those same men and women because of the deficit these tax \navoidance schemes have helped to create.\n  Few even try to defend these inversions on principle. They are simply \ntax avoidance. Even the corporate executives who engineer them make \nlittle pretense as to any other purpose. So let us reform the Tax Code, \nyes. But while we craft and debate that reform, let us stop these \ntransactions that add massively to our deficit and to the burden \nAmerica's working families and small businesses must carry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2360\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \ncrack down on fraud in the Medicare program to protect seniors, people \nwith disabilities, and taxpayers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I am joined today by my colleague Senator \nCollins to introduce legislation aimed at strengthening the \ngovernment's hand in stopping Medicare fraud. Senator Collins and I \nhave tried to offer some decent leadership to the Senate Special \nCommittee on Aging and in the process we have heard a lot about \nMedicare and Medicaid fraud. I want to thank Senators Carper, Grassley, \nand Casey for partnering with us to sponsor this legislation we are \nintroducing today.\n  Earlier in the year Senator Collins and I convened a hearing of the \naging committee to examine what government was doing to prevent \nMedicare fraud. The committee heard from law enforcement that despite \nthe recent increase in prosecutions, Medicare fraud continues to run \nrampant. It is especially true in my State of Florida, where South \nFlorida remains, unfortunately, ground zero for Medicare fraud.\n  We also heard from the Medicare organization itself about what the \nprogram is doing to try to better detect and prevent con artists from \ndefrauding the system.\n  Then we heard from victims such as Patricia Gresko, a former \nschoolteacher from Michigan. She testified about this unbelievable scam \nwhere her doctor talked her into spending thousands of dollars for \ntreatments for an illness she later discovered she didn't have. These \ntreatments caused her to have chest pains and forced her to endure \nintravenous infusions that took hours.\n  Her doctor was arrested for bilking $225 million from Medicare. This \nis what he did: falsely telling patients they had cancer--if you can \nbelieve that, that they had cancer--so he could bill for expensive \nchemotherapy treatments. Ms. Gresko did not have cancer, but she had to \nendure all of that.\n  Today we are losing about $60 billion to $90 billion a year in \nMedicare fraud. Just last week, Federal agents arrested 90 people--50 \nof them, you guessed it, from Miami--on charges they had stolen $260 \nmillion from the Medicare Program. Fortunately, when we passed the \nAffordable Care Act, we put in provisions--some, I might say, at my \ninsistence, because of ground zero being in my State--such as \nbackground checks, site visits for prospective Medicare providers and \nsuppliers, and another one being stronger criminal and civil penalties, \nwith the authority to withhold payment in law where there is a credible \nallegation of fraud. Those are just a few of the weapons in law as a \nresult of the ACA.\n  This recent set of arrests of 90 people on charges of Medicare fraud \ntells us something else: We have to stop playing the game of Whac-A-\nMole with Medicare criminals in trying to stamp out the fraud one bad \nactor at a time. You know what Whac-A-Mole is. You whack this creature \non a table, and once you have whacked it, it pops right back up. So \nnaturally, we talked to Sylvia Burwell, the President's nominee for \nSecretary of HHS. She echoed that last week at her confirmation hearing \nin the Finance Committee. She stated that we need to move away from the \npay-and-chase model--which is what has happened. You have to chase them \ndown. If you catch them, they pop back up again. So we need a better \nstrategy.\n\n  While we are making strides by more aggressively pursuing this kind \nof fraud, obviously more needs to be done. That is why today Senator \nCollins and I are introducing the Stop SCAMS Act. It will require \nMedicare to verify that those wishing to bill Medicare have not owned a \ncompany that previously defrauded the government. It is going to also \nallow private insurers and Medicare to share information about the \npotential fraudulent operators in the system.\n  The bill also anticipates problems CMS may face in the future. It \ndoesn't delay the rollout of the 10 new medical codes in any way--or \nshall I say what they refer to as the ICD-10 medical codes; there are a \nlot more of those medical codes--but it takes some lessons learned from \nthe costly delays that have occurred with these codes and uses them to \nmake the process better in the future. The legislation also requires, \nfor the new medical coding systems after the ICD-10, that the agency \nassess the impact on fraud-prevention systems and do appropriate \ntesting.\n  Combating this fraud will continue to be one of the core missions of \nour Committee on Aging. We have taken a look at many types of fraud \nscams--Jamaican phone scams, identity theft, Social Security fraud, \npayday lending--and now we are continuing to focus on Medicare fraud \nand will continue to examine additional issues.\n  Every day, Senator Collins and I hear from seniors about scams, and \nthey let us know on our committee's hotline. I remind everybody: This \nhotline is there for you to report these scams--1-855-303-9470--and we \nare going to keep this committee going after these scams.\n  In the meantime, Senator Collins and I hope our colleagues will join \nus in support of this legislation to try to further clamp down on \nMedicare fraud. I am so happy to have the partner I have in helping \nlead the Committee on Aging, Senator Collins.\n  In closing, I would say that we really have a broad array of folks \nsupporting us on this legislation: the National Health Care Anti-Fraud \nAssociation, America's Health Insurance Plans, Blue Cross and Blue \nShield Association, the National Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, the \nNational Insurance Crime Bureau, and Humana Insurance Company. They are \nall supporters of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I await the comments of my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my friend, the \nchairman of the Senate Committee on Aging, Senator Nelson, in \nintroducing legislation to help combat fraud in the Medicare Program. \nWe are introducing the Stop Schemes and Crimes Against Medicare and \nSeniors Act, or the Stop SCAMS Act.\n  As Senator Nelson has described, at our hearings earlier this year we \nheard absolutely appalling testimony from a woman who had to endure \npainful, 7-hour-long series of infusions for a disease she did not have \njust because her doctor was bilking the Medicare Program.\n  Imagine a physician who would do that, who would subject a vulnerable \npatient to the anxiety of thinking she had a disease she did not have \nand then treat her for a disease she did not have just to collect \nMedicare dollars. It really was appalling.\n  For decades the Government Accountability Office--GAO--has identified \nMedicare as being at high risk for improper payments, abuse, and fraud. \nIn the year 2012 Medicare reported that it had lost more than $44 \nbillion in improper payments due to waste, fraud, abuse, and \nmismanagement--and that estimate may well be too low. Think what we \ncould do with $44 billion to improve the quality of health care and the \ncoverage we are providing to our seniors or to reduce our unsustainable \nnational debt. This is simply unacceptable.\n  The loss of these funds not only compromises the financial integrity \nand increases the costs of the Medicare Program, but it also undermines \nour ability to provide needed health care services to the more than 54 \nmillion older and disabled Americans who depend on this vital program.\n  Back in the late 1990s when I was chairman of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, we held a series of hearings to examine \nfraud in\n\n[[Page S3191]]\n\nthe Medicare Program. We identified the dangerous trend of an \nincreasing number of completely bogus providers entering the system \nwith the sole and explicit purpose of robbing it. One of our witnesses \nactually testified that he went into Medicare fraud because it was \neasier and safer than dealing in drugs; he could make a lot more money \nat far less risk of being caught.\n  Our hearings led to the adoption of some safeguards and better \ninternal controls. But many years later what our continuing hearings \nhave demonstrated is that unscrupulous individuals are always adopting \nand seeking out new ways to rip off the system. They seem to be always \none step ahead of the authorities.\n  I do wish to emphasize an extremely important point; that is, the \nvast majority of medical professionals are caring, dedicated health \ncare providers whose top priority is the welfare of their patients.\n  When we were investigating Medicare fraud in the late 1990s, what we \nfound were a whole lot of individuals posing as health care providers \nwho had no medical training whatsoever. I remember one memorable case \nwhere, had there been a site visit, it would have been discovered that \nthis bogus provider had an office in the middle of the runway of the \nMiami airport. But, unfortunately, back then there were no site visits.\n  Health care providers--the true professionals--are the ones who are \nmost appalled by the unscrupulous bandits who take advantage of \nweaknesses in the Medicare Program to bleed billions of dollars from \nthe program.\n  As I indicated, we have made some progress over the years in the \nbattle against Medicare fraud since I chaired those hearings. \nUnfortunately, however, there is no line item in the budget titled \n``waste, fraud, and abuse'' that we can simply strike to eliminate this \nproblem and solve it once and for all.\n  The task of ferreting out wasteful and fraudulent spending is made \nall the more difficult by the ingenuity of the scam artists, who \ncontinually adopt new methods of ripping off both the Medicare and the \nMedicaid Programs.\n  It is clear, as my distinguished chairman indicated, that we must do \nmore than shift from a pay-and-chase strategy to combat Medicare fraud \nto one that prevents the harm from ever occurring in the first place. \nThat is what the bipartisan bill we are introducing today would do.\n  Among other provisions, our legislation would require Medicare to \nverify health care provider ownership interests using other databases \nbefore new health care providers are allowed to enroll in the program. \nThat is an upfront control that we can and should implement. Currently, \nMedicare relies on self-reported information. As a consequence, \nproviders who previously had an ownership interest in an organization \nthat defrauded Medicare can potentially get back into the program by \nsimply using different names and failing to disclose their interest in \nthe previous organization or practice.\n  Our legislation would also allow private insurers to share \ninformation about potentially fraudulent providers with Medicare and \nwith each other to prevent further health care fraud.\n  It would also allow the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission to make \nrecommendations to us regarding fraud prevention, and our bill would \nrequire the Medicare Program to develop a strategy for more accurately \nand reliably estimating how many dollars are lost each year to fraud.\n  As the chairman indicated, our legislation is endorsed by a wide \nvariety of organizations, including the National Health Care Anti-Fraud \nAssociation, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, Humana, \nAmerica's Health Insurance Plans, and the Coalition Against Insurance \nFraud.\n  I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in \ncosponsoring this important bill--legislation that I believe really can \nmake a difference. I hope this is a bill we can move quickly. It is a \ncommonsense bill. It will save taxpayer and beneficiary dollars, and it \nwill help to curb the excessive fraud, the unacceptable fraud that is \ndepleting dollars from a program--the Medicare Program--that is already \nunder financial strain.\n  So let's move this bill. Let's send it to the House and on to the \nPresident for his signature as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I again commend the Senator from Florida for his \nleadership. It has been a great pleasure to work with him on this \nimportant issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3191-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 452--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY, DOCUMENTS, AND \n          REPRESENTATION IN CITY OF LAFAYETTE V.

Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for \ntestimony in a criminal misdemeanor action pending in City Court in \nLafayette, LA. In this action, the defendant is charged with disturbing \nthe peace arising out of his appearance at Senator David Vitter's \nLafayette, LA office. A trial is scheduled for May 28, 2014.\n  The prosecution has sought testimony from two current employees of \nSenator Vitter's office, and one former employee of that office, who \nwere witnesses to the charged event. Senator Vitter would like to \ncooperate by providing relevant testimony, and, if necessary, documents \nfrom his office. This resolution would authorize those current and \nformer employees, and any other employee of the Senator's office from \nwhom relevant evidence may be necessary, to testify and produce \ndocuments in this action, with representation by the Senate Legal \nCounsel.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 452) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3193-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 2363\n\n  Mr. NELSON.

Madam President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaty transmitted to the Senate on May 20, 2014, by the President of \nthe United States: Convention on Taxes with the Republic of Poland, \nTreaty Document No. 113-5.\n  I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read for \nthe first time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to its \nratification, the Convention between the United States of America and \nthe Republic of Poland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the \nPrevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, signed on \nFebruary 13, 2013, at Warsaw (the ``proposed Convention''). I also \ntransmit for the information of the Senate the report of the Department \nof State, which includes an overview of the proposed Convention.\n  The proposed Convention replaces the existing Convention, signed in \n1974, and was negotiated to bring United States-Poland tax treaty \nrelations into closer conformity with current U.S. tax treaty policies. \nFor example, the proposed Convention contains provisions designed to \naddress ``treaty shopping,'' which is the inappropriate use of a tax \ntreaty by residents of a third country, that the existing Convention \ndoes not. Concluding the proposed Convention with Poland has been a top \npriority for the tax treaty program at the Department of the Treasury.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe proposed Convention and give its advice and consent to its \nratification.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, May 20, 2014.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/20/senate-section/article/S3193-4", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, MAY 21, 2014\n\n  Mr. NELSON.
