The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following leader remarks, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the continuing appropriations legislation. The \ntime until 11:15 a.m. today will be divided and controlled equally \nbetween the two leaders or their designees.\n  At 11:15 a.m. there will be three rollcall votes in relation to the \ncontinuing resolution: the Toomey amendment, which is a 60-vote \nthreshold; adoption of the Mikulski-Shelby substitute amendment; and a \ncloture vote on H.R. 933, the underlying bill.\n\n\n                             Budget Debate\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the last few years my Republican \ncolleagues have been hollering, yelling, and screaming that the Senate \nhas not passed a budget. They have done so in spite of the fact that \nRepublicans in both Chambers voted for the Budget Control Act which set \nspending levels for the last 2 years. It was a law. Every reasonable \npolitical observer admits that the Budget Control Act, which had the \nforce of law, was a budget, period. No, it was not a resolution. It was \na law, which is much stronger than any resolution we do here.\n  As I indicated, they have yelled and screamed. Still, Republicans \npine for the days of the so-called regular order when the Senate would \nvote on a budget resolution that would set spending priorities for the \nfiscal year. Republicans--we were told, we heard, we saw--were \ndesperate to have a budget debate. They were desperate. They have had \ncharts out here. They were desperate for an amendment. They wanted a \nvote-arama. They had charts, speeches, and demonstrations to prove it.\n  They have had press conference after press conference after press \nconference. They even had a calendar they brought out almost daily \ntallying the days since the Senate passed a budget resolution--not a \nlaw, which was already in effect, but a resolution.\n  Yesterday I was amazed, flabbergasted, and stunned when Republicans \nblocked attempts to begin debate on the budget resolution. In fact, the \nranking member of the Budget\n\n[[Page S1968]]\n\nCommittee said: Let's put it off for a while. Let's wait until after \nEaster.\n  Can you imagine that? They have been pining for regular order, and we \nnow have a chance to have a debate. They said: No, we can't do that. \nCan't do it. There was a chance, and they were not interested in doing \nit.\n  My friend, the junior Senator from Kansas, objected to a request \ndebating the budget unless we vote on his proposed amendment to the \ncontinuing resolution. He is concerned about air traffic towers in \nKansas because of these across-the-board cuts.\n  I say to all of my colleagues--I say to the Senator from Kansas--we \nare all concerned about the impact of these budget cuts. They are \nsenseless, they are ridiculous, and we should do away with them. We \nhave already cut $2.5 trillion from the debt. We can continue to do it \nbut do it in a responsible and reasonable way, not a meat-cleaver way.\n  More than 100 families in Nevada--almost immediately--are going to \nlose access to low-income housing because of the sequester. I met with \nthe housing authority people yesterday. Some might say: Oh, that is not \nsuch a big deal. It is a big deal for those 100 families. Nationwide, \n70,000 little boys and girls are going to lose their ability to go to \nHead Start. Some may ask: What is that? Head Start will allow them to \nget started in life.\n  These cuts--and I have only mentioned a few of them--are painful for \nmillions of Americans, and it is only going to get worse. They are \narbitrary.\n  We are all concerned. The concern for the sequester is not focused on \nthe Senate delegation from Kansas, it is all over. Instead of whining \nabout it, let's do something about it. Let's get rid of it. That is why \nthe Senate Democratic budget proposal actually reverses the sequester. \nThat is one way of doing it, but there are other ways.\n  The policy outlined in Senator Murray's budget will save hundreds of \nthousands of jobs, safeguard communities by keeping police, air traffic \ncontrollers, and meat inspectors on the job. Reversing the sequester \nwould alleviate Senator Moran's concern about air traffic controllers \nin Kansas. The Senate cannot debate a thoughtful way to replace the \nsequester if the Republicans will not even let us debate our budget \nproposal.\n  We know Republicans and Democrats will not agree on every aspect of \nthe budget which sets priorities for how the government spends money \nand how it saves money. Republicans have one plan for Medicare. Their \nplan is to turn it into a voucher program which will change Medicare \nforever. Democrats have another plan. The Democrats' plan is to \npreserve and protect Medicare for our children and grandchildren.\n  Republicans have a plan for taxes. Listen to this one: They want to \nlower taxes for the rich and let the middle class foot the bill. \nDemocrats have another plan. We believe the wealthiest individuals and \ncorporations should contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. \nSurprisingly, the intelligent American people agree with us--Democrats, \nIndependents, and Republicans--by almost a 60-percent margin. The only \nRepublicans in America who disagree are those who serve in Congress.\n  Republicans have one plan to reduce the deficit which will rely on \nharsh austerity that shortchanges the elderly, veterans, middle class, \npoor, and others. The Democrats have another plan. We have a balanced \napproach that couples smart spending cuts with new revenue from closing \nloopholes that benefit the wealthiest Americans.\n  We have our differences, and that is fine. But Democrats are willing \nto discuss these differences; we are willing to debate the issues. \nLet's debate the issues. The Republicans have said for months and \nmonths: Let's debate the budget. Why can't we debate the budget? \nBecause they will not let us.\n  This is senseless. We have 60 hours of doing nothing--nothing. The \nAmerican people are on our side. This is a debate we can win, but at \nleast let's have the debate.\n  Will the Chair announce the business of the day.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 11:15 a.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are not in a quorum call, are we?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are not.\n  Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, the time will be divided equally.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time during the quorum call be equally \ndivided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I wish to discuss with my colleagues here \nin the Senate an amendment I have filed to the continuing resolution \nthat is now pending before the Senate. It is amendment No. 55. I have \nspoken about this issue on the floor previously this week but want to \nreiterate the merits of this amendment and ask my colleagues for their \nsupport.\n  Amendment No. 55 deals with this issue of air traffic control towers. \nUnder the administration's plan in implementing sequestration, the plan \nis to close, on April 7--just a few days from now--173 air traffic \ncontrol towers across the country. The amendment I wish to offer avoids \nthat. The administration would no longer be able to do that. I believe \nthey should not for numerous reasons, but what we do, in order to \naccomplish that, is to transfer $50 million from two accounts, one \ndealing with research at the Department of Transportation and one \ndealing with unencumbered balances.\n  This is an example of what we have talked about before: that we can \nmake better decisions than across-the-board cuts. In fact, the \namendment I wish to offer deals with an issue that is not even an \nacross-the-board cut.\n  In closing the contract towers, in eliminating the Contract Tower \nProgram, the administration is cutting that program 75 percent. \nSequestration is described to us as, in most circumstances, an across-\nthe-board 5-percent cut. The amendment I wish to offer continues the 5-\npercent cut. That would occur for the air traffic Contract Tower \nProgram, so that they would be treated like other programs at the \nDepartment of Transportation and throughout government, that they are \nnot singled out for elimination of a program, resulting in a 75-percent \nreduction in that program's funding, not just the more minor 5 percent. \nSo the administration's decision to close contract towers is far from \nbalanced, and in choosing this program, in my view, has taken the \nopportunity to damage the safety and security of the flying public of \nAmerica.\n  I want to talk about that in a moment. But there was also the \nsuggestion that this is a provincial argument on my part, that it is \nsomething I care specifically about for Kansas, my home State. \nCertainly there is not anything wrong with caring about our home \nStates. That is what we do here, and it is part of our responsibility. \nBut this is far from just being a Kansas issue. Many States and Members \nof the Senate are more greatly affected by this cut, this elimination, \nthan my home State.\n  In fact, this amendment has the sponsorship of 26 Republican and \nDemocratic cosponsors. More Democratic Senators here are cosponsors of \nthis amendment than Republican Senators. It is Senators Roberts, \nInhofe, Blumenthal, Blunt, Johanns, Kirk, Manchin, Hagan, Klobuchar, \nBaucus, Tester, Enzi, Vitter, Boozman, Pryor, Merkley, Wyden, Kaine, \nWarner, Ayotte, Shaheen, Risch, Crapo, Murphy, Rockefeller, and Wicker.\n  It does not sound very provincial to me. In fact, 42 States will have \ntheir air traffic control towers eliminated. This amendment is broadly \nsupported by the aviation industry. If there is an aspect of this that \nis unique to Kansas, it is that we manufacture many general aviation \naircraft. We are the air capital of the world. But this amendment, \nwhile being supported by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, by \nNational Business Aviation\n\n[[Page S1969]]\n\nAssociation, the National Air Transportation Association, is also \nsupported by the American Association of Airport Executives and the \nNational Air Traffic Controllers Association.\n  Again, it is not a very provincial amendment when sponsored by so \nmany of my colleagues, affecting 40-some--43 States of the United \nStates, and broadly supported by the aviation industry as a reasonable, \ncommonsense solution to a problem we face.\n  I have been adamant about bringing this amendment to the floor. I am \na member of the Appropriations Committee. I will have the opportunity--\nin fact, I serve on the subcommittee that deals with the Department of \nTransportation. I should and hope to have the opportunity to deal with \nthis and other issues related to the Department of Transportation in \nthe normal appropriations process that, hopefully, will follow the \npassage of a budget. So I ought to be in a position to be helpful to \nthe cause I believe in at a point later in time.\n  But here is the problem: The air traffic control towers will close on \nApril 7. We will never get to an appropriations process between now, \nhere at the end of March, and April 7. So the Appropriations Committee \nand, ultimately, the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the \nPresident will never have the ability to restore a program that is gone \nApril 7.\n  So while I have tried to put myself in a position to be helpful to \nthe cause in the long run, there is no long-run battle to be fought \nbecause the control towers are gone in just a matter of a few short \ndays.\n  This amendment matters. This is my last opportunity. If and when \ncloture is invoked later today on the underlying bill, there is no \nopportunity for amendments to be considered. So my colleagues who \nindicate to me so strongly that they support my amendment, this is the \nonly opportunity we have to have success.\n  This clearly is not about my success in an amendment. Although I \nwould love to have the opportunity for this amendment to be voted on, \nit may or may not pass. But the Senate ought to work its will in making \nthat determination. With the broad support of the industry, with the \nbroad support of my colleagues here in the Senate, one would think this \nis an amendment which is at least worthy of a vote. That has not been \nthe case.\n  So it is important for me to again reiterate to my colleagues that if \nyou invoke cloture this afternoon or later this morning, if you invoke \ncloture, there is no other opportunity for us to address this issue, \nthis problem. So let me again request the opportunity.\n  I lay awake last night from 3:30 on trying to figure out what it is I \ncan say to my colleagues to get their attention about why this is so \nimportant. There are lots of things that can be said. We have so little \ntime before this is either a program that existed in the past and will \nno longer exist in the future--the consequences are so dramatic that I \nwould again ask my colleagues for their assistance in at least bringing \nthe amendment to the floor so that the Senate can make a decision, yes \nor no, about the merits of the amendment.\n  This is about safety. There was an article I just happened to read \ntoday in reading my clips from Kansas. This is in a Kansas paper, but \nit is an AP story from Chicago. The article is entitled ``Trouble in \nthe Air,'' and here is what the AP reporter writes about the planned \nshutdown. The article says:\n\n       The planned shutdown of nearly 240 air traffic control \n     towers across the country under federal budget cuts will \n     strip away an extra layer of safety during takeoffs and \n     landings, leaving pilots to manage the most critical stages \n     of flight on their own.\n       But airport directors and pilots say there is little doubt \n     that the removal of this second pair of eyes on the ground \n     increases risk and will slow the progress that has made the \n     U.S. air system the safest in the world.\n       It's not just private pilots in small planes who stand to \n     be affected. Many of the airports in question are serviced by \n     major airlines, and the cuts could leave towers unmanned \n     during overnight hours that some big-city airports such as \n     Chicago's Midway and General Mitchell Airport in Milwaukee. \n     The plans have prompted airlines to review whether the \n     changes might pose problems for commercial service that could \n     mean canceling or rescheduling flights.\n       Without the help of controllers, risk ``goes up \n     exponentially,'' said Mark Hanna, director of the Abraham \n     Lincoln Capital Airport in Springfield, Ill., which could see \n     its tower close.\n       But many in the aviation sector are frustrated by the \n     political brinkmanship in Washington that has affected such a \n     sensitive area of aviation. Jim Montman, manager of the Santa \n     Fe Municipal Airport, which is on the list for tower \n     closures, said the absence of controllers raised the risk of \n     midair collisions ``or some sort of incident where somebody \n     lands on the wrong runway. . . . That critical link is \n     gone.''\n       Pilots are trained to watch for other aircraft and announce \n     their position over the radio during approaches, landings and \n     takeoffs. But past crashes, however rare, have exposed \n     weaknesses in that system. On November 19, 1996, a 19-seat \n     United Express flight landing in Quincy, Ill., collided with \n     another twin-engine turboprop that was taking off. They \n     slammed into each other at the intersection of two runways, \n     killing all 14 people aboard the two planes. The National \n     Transportation Safety Board concluded the probable cause was \n     a failure of the pilot in the outbound flight to monitor the \n     radio frequency for air traffic and to properly scan for \n     other planes. ``If a tower was there, it's highly likely that \n     the accident would have been prevented,'' said Hanna, who \n     became the director of the Quincy airport about two years \n     after the crash.\n       The 238 air traffic control facilities that could be closed \n     were chosen because they are at airports with fewer than \n     150,000 flight operations per year. They are located in every \n     state.\n\n  Again, the point of this amendment is not whether or not I find the \nright words to convince my colleagues to allow this amendment to come \nto a vote. As much as I struggled through the morning hours trying to \nfigure out what those might be, the real issue is not about my words or \nmy personal success in getting this amendment considered, but it is \nabout the safety of Americans.\n  I cannot figure out why this amendment cannot be made in order. \nAgain, broad support--broad support with Republicans and Democrats. I \nhave had many Senators, including very senior Senators from the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, come to me and express amazement that \nthis amendment, so broadly supported, so important, cannot be \nconsidered. I cannot come up with an explanation. I do not know why \nthis is the case.\n  Every Senator I have talked to about this amendment tells me they do \nnot oppose it, it ought to be voted on, they support it. Yet for some \nreason the Senate is incapable of agreeing to even a vote on an \nimportant and critical amendment that promotes the safety of the \nAmerican people. I can only guess--and it is always difficult to \nattribute motives, but as I talk to my colleagues, the only explanation \nI ever get that has any semblance of truth is that there is a point to \nbe made here. By denying the amendment's passage, we prove that \nsequestration cannot work; we cannot cut money from budgets.\n  Again, I did not vote for sequestration. So when the majority leader \nsays this morning about the hatchet being taken to programs and it is \nall bad--I did not vote for sequestration. I believe in the \nappropriations process that allows us to make these decisions to \nincrease funding for some things, decrease funding for other things, \nand eliminate programs. Yet sequestration, in my view, has an effect \nupon all programs equally, whether they are effective or ineffective, \nwhether they are valuable or invaluable. We treat them the same.\n  So I am not here on the cause of sequestration, but apparently there \nare those in this city, in Washington, DC, who want to make the point \nthat if the air traffic control towers are eliminated, it will \ndemonstrate once and for all--I don't know; to Republican Senators, to \nSenators in general, to Congress, to the American people--that there is \nno opportunity to cut budgets.\n  If people want to make that point and if they can convince people \nthat it is true that there is no opportunity to eliminate $85 billion \nin spending, that is fine with me. That is what this place exists for, \nis for us to have the debate about whether we can reduce spending, \nincrease spending, what our Tax Code ought to be, what the value is of \ngovernment services and programs and how they ought to be funded. But \nif it is true that the reason this amendment is not being considered is \nbecause we want to prove a point--that there is no money to be cut, \nthat sequestration is a bad idea, that reducing spending is a bad idea, \nthat we have to raise taxes--if that is the point that is trying to be \nmade here in the process of denying this amendment's consideration, \nthen\n\n[[Page S1970]]\n\nit is a very dangerous way to try to prove a point.\n\n  Prove your point in argument and debate about the merits of spending, \nabout the merits of the program. Prove your point in the Appropriations \nCommittee, in which we take testimony and hear from people about what \nis important to them, priorities, what their needs are, what their \nwants are, what has value, what does not. But do not try to make the \npolitical point about this topic by reducing the safety of people who \nfly in and out of communities across the country. As the article said, \nthis reduces the nature of our air traveling safety from the best in \nthe world to something less than that.\n  So make the point. Have the debate and argument about the value of \nsequestration, about the value of what money we spend and do not spend. \nBut let's not try to prove the point by reducing the chances that the \nAmerican people, when they travel, are safe and secure in our airways.\n  I do not know, and I hope this is never the case--this point may \nnever be proven about the safety, but once there is an accident and \nsomeone dies and a plane crashes, the question will always be, what if \nthere had been an air traffic control tower there? What if we had left \nthe program in place?\n  These communities that have the air traffic control towers have spent \nyears in developing a plan to put them in place, have worked with the \nFAA and the Department of Transportation over decades to bring their \nairports and airport safety, flying safety to high standards. An issue \nhere is that this is going to disappear overnight. So you can be an \nairport manager, an airport authority, a member of an airport board \nanyplace in the country with 200-plus air traffic control towers, and \nyou have worked hard over years, decades, to get the standards in place \nand to have the air traffic control process at your airport. In one \nday, April 7, one night, the lights go off in the tower. They no longer \nexist. All the work you have tried to accomplish on behalf of your \ncommunity and those who fly in and out of your airport disappears in \none stroke.\n  So I speak with a level of passion about this issue, for really the \npurpose of which I think we are here to do, which is to advance the \ncommon good of the American people. It is not a provincial amendment. \nIt is not something that just Moran and Kansas need. There are many \nStates much more affected by this. But the truth is that every \nAmerican, every person who flies will have less safety and security in \nthe skies as a result of this issue, as a result of the decision made \nby the Department of Transportation to eliminate this program.\n  So, once again, I intend to ask later in the morning, when our \nleaders are on the floor, for unanimous consent to bring this amendment \nforward before the time expires. In my time in Congress--I have only \nbeen in the Senate a little more than 2 years--I have not been trying \nto be obstreperous. I have not tried to be difficult to deal with. I \nbelieve in the opportunity to reach out and work together. I followed \nthe rules. I did what everybody tells me to do: Go find people who \nsupport this amendment who are Democrats and Republicans, bring them \ntogether.\n  And as the leader said earlier in the week--I guess it is now last \nweek--earlier last week about how we are going to get back to regular \norder, we are going to have amendments offered, I hope we can dispose \nof them quickly, we have an opportunity to do that with this amendment. \nIt is not controversial. It is not partisan. It is about something that \nought to be of importance to all Americans, certainly to every Senator.\n  Later in the morning when the leaders are present, I will ask \nunanimous consent once again that we consider this amendment. I know \nthere are others who want to offer amendments. I see my colleagues from \nArkansas and Missouri on the floor. I know they have an amendment--I \nthink it is No. 82--with which they want to offer the opportunity to \naddress a problem by taking money from one account and putting it in \nanother account in order to keep meatpacking plants operational, that \nwe have the meat inspectors present at the plants. Boy, that is an \nimportant issue too. That is about the safety and security of \nAmericans. It is about food safety. I hope no one objects to the \namendment Senators Pryor and Blunt are going to offer this morning. \nThat is another amendment which is very similar in nature, about \ndeciding that we are smarter to spend money here than here.\n  As the Pryor-Blunt amendment comes before the floor, I would ask my \ncolleagues, just as I would ask them to grant unanimous consent, I hope \nno one objects to their request for unanimous consent that their \namendment be considered. I would ask that no one object to the \namendment I intend to offer. I certainly will not object to the Blunt-\nPryor amendment. I wish it was leverage to get my amendment considered, \nbut it is too dangerous to play that game. That is what we do here in \nWashington, DC, is strike a deal. In this case, when we strike that \ndeal, we are leaving people behind whose lives are going to be \nadversely affected.\n  I certainly will not stand in the way of people who work in the \nmeatpacking industry and the consumers of meat products across our \ncountry, in the way of trying to solve a problem that is clearly there. \nI hope their amendment receives unanimous consent, and I hope it passes \nby this Senate's will. I would ask the same thing. When the appropriate \ntime comes, I will ask for the same thing on an amendment that is about \nthe safety and security of American people.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his indulgence and at least his \nappearance of listening to me.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the next quorum \ncall be equally divided between the Republicans and Democrats, the \nmajority and the minority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  MS. AYOTTE. Madam President, I come to the floor to speak about an \namendment I made to the continuing resolution. This is a continuing \nresolution for appropriations bills which are pending on the floor \nright now, and we are spending over $1 trillion.\n  I filed an amendment, amendment No. 127, which would have struck the \nfunding of $380 million for a missile to nowhere. This is funding for a \nprogram called the Medium Extended Air Defense System, otherwise known \nas MEADS. Up to this time, we have expended $3 billion for this system. \nYet we will never receive a result our Army or our military can use. \nThis is why it is a missile to nowhere.\n  The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Carl \nLevin, has said of the funding for this MEADS program: With regard to \nthe committee, we feel strongly that it is a waste of money.\n  In the 2012 Defense authorization, the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee made very clear this was going to be the last appropriation \nfor this missile to nowhere. In the 2013 authorization, on a unanimous \nbipartisan basis before the Senate Armed Services Committee, the \ncommittee voted to say no more money for a missile to nowhere.\n  Right now, our military is facing great challenges with \nsequestration. We have heard this from our military leaders. These are \ndifficult choices they must make to cut training for our troops and cut \nneeded flying hours when our troops absolutely need to be prepared and \nready. For equipment, an announcement was made we were going to \nwithdraw a carrier, which sends the wrong message to Iran.\n  Despite all this, the continuing resolution, which is on the floor \nwith the appropriations bill attached, contains $380 million for a \nmissile to nowhere. This is something our military will\n\n[[Page S1971]]\n\nnever be able to use. And why is it there? It is there because people \nare worried about their parochial interests, that their State builds \npart of this, and also because, apparently, they want to provide \nemployment to the Germans and the Italians, because they are getting a \nsubstantial amount of this money. Yet we will never see anything our \ntroops can use from it.\n\n  My amendment was very straightforward. The amendment would do this: \nIt would take the $380 million and strike it from the MEADS Program, \nthen take those resources and, instead of spending the $380 million on \nthe MEADS Program, it would go to the operations and maintenance fund \nfor our troops for real needs they have on the ground--whether it is \nequipment or training--rather than for a missile to nowhere that they \ndo not need and don't want.\n  It seems to me we owe it to our troops to make sure our taxpayer \ndollars don't continue to be wasted on funding a MEADS Program we will \nnever get a result from. In fact, we have had large unanimous agreement \non a bipartisan basis about striking this MEADS Program. In fact, I \nmentioned the Senate Armed Services Committee has said we should \nprohibit funding for it. The House Armed Services Committee did the \nsame thing and said we should prohibit funding for it, and the House \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee zeroed out funding for MEADS. The \nonly committee that allocated funding for it was the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee. Talk about a waste of money.\n  It is shocking to me, by the way, that this amendment makes so much \nsense, that it has bipartisan support, and yet I can't get a vote on \nthe floor of the Senate to strike the money for this missile to nowhere \nand to apply the funds to where our troops need them so the funds can \nactually be used to make sure they have what they need to be prepared. \nIt is appalling that I am being denied the right to offer this \namendment, to bring it to the floor, to let people vote on it. At a \ntime when we face great fiscal challenges, it is absolutely appalling \nto me that here in the Senate we can't strike $380 million in funding \nfor a missile to nowhere when we are almost $17 trillion in debt. This \nis what is wrong with Washington. It is appalling we cannot be in a \nposition to get a vote that is germane to fund a program that the \nConcerned Veterans for America has said is wasteful, in support of my \namendment; that the Citizens Against Government Waste agrees as well \nand supports my amendment; and that I have bipartisan support for my \namendment. In fact, Senators Begich and Shaheen are cosponsors of my \namendment. So this is not a partisan issue, this is about not wasting \ntaxpayer dollars. I can tell you this sort of thing is what is \nappalling to the American people, that we cannot and we will not strike \nwasteful spending. We can't even get a vote on it here in the Senate.\n  I am going to continue to fight to end the funding for this program \nand other wasteful spending programs and to make sure the money we have \nand the taxpayer dollars, particularly in the Pentagon but in every \narea of government, go for what they are intended--for things our \ntroops need, and not a missile to nowhere where we are protecting, \napparently, parochial interests that people are worried about more than \nthey are worried about the overall fiscal state of the country.\n  This is something that has been very disappointing to me. I think it \nis appalling we wouldn't allow a vote on such a relevant, germane \namendment on a bill in which we are going to spend over $1 trillion. I \ndon't know why we continue to fund things such as the missile to \nnowhere when there are real needs our troops have. I know this \namendment had bipartisan support in the past. Both sides of the aisle \ndo not want to spend money on a missile to nowhere when there are real \nneeds our troops have.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this issue on the floor \ntoday.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, it took 4 years to get a budget from \nthe Senate majority--4 long years.\n  As the days go by, it has become increasingly clear why it took so \nlong; their budget is so extreme and so unbalanced. That is why they \nare having such a hard time selling it to the American people and why \nthey have had to fall back on some tired talking points to defend it, \nclaiming their budget would, for instance, grow the economy from the \nmiddle class out. That is a clever sound bite, but it doesn't describe \nthe Senate Democratic budget at all.\n  Maybe a better way to put it is that the Democratic budget would grow \nthe bureaucracy from the pockets of the middle class out. That is \nbecause it would increase Federal spending by almost two-thirds by \nimposing a massive tax hike that could cost the average middle-class \nfamily literally thousands.\n  The Democrats like to say the up to $1.5 trillion tax increase \nauthorized in their budget--the largest tax hike in American history, \nby the way--would be funded by closing loopholes for millionaires and \nbillionaires, but the math simply doesn't add up. They will have to \ncome after the middle class to fund this spending spree.\n  There is something else. The Senate Democratic budget wouldn't \nbalance ever--not in 2013, not in 2023, not in 2023, not ever. It \nwouldn't balance in any of our lifetimes. It wouldn't balance in the \nlifetimes of our children or our grandchildren. It would simply never \nbalance.\n  Think about it. That means a child born today would grow up knowing \nnothing but massive deficits their entire life. That means trillions \nupon trillions in more debt and an economy that would never ever reach \nits full potential. That is simply not right, but it is what we would \nget with the Senate Democratic plan. It is an extreme approach that is \nmore than just fiscally reckless; it is deeply irresponsible.\n  That is why so many middle-class families agree with Republicans that \nwe should be growing the economy, not the government. They know we need \nto control Washington spending and balance the budget in order to kick-\nstart economic growth and to create American jobs. They are so tired of \nthe Obama economy.\n  They are tired of the endless pivots to jobs that never result in the \nkind of sustained job creation we need. They are tired of the sluggish \ngrowth, of always looking to the future with anxiety or worrying \nwhether Medicare will even be there when they retire.\n  They are tired of the ideological DC Democratic extremism that got us \nhere: knee-jerk, tax-first solutions to almost every single problem, \nmassive overspending, steadfast opposition to reforms that would make \ngovernment programs more efficient, effective, and sustainable.\n  So my friends across the aisle shouldn't be surprised their budget is \ngetting such a rough ride. It contains up to $1.5 trillion in new \ntaxes. This would be the largest tax hike in American history. It \ncontains $\\1/2\\ trillion more in spending, money that could be siphoned \nout of the economy and into the hands of politicians and bureaucrats.\n  It lacks meaningful reforms to save and strengthen Medicare, allowing \nit to go bankrupt in just a few years, and it enshrines massive \ndeficits into law, ensuring they continue forever and ever without end.\n  The Senate Democratic budget is nothing more than a rehash of the \nsame tired politics that continue to pummel the middle class. It is \ntime to move beyond this failed extremist approach and try a new one. \nInstead of expanding the power of the bureaucratic elite at the expense \nof hardworking taxpayers, I would urge Washington to change course. \nLet's focus on growing the economy, not the government.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  I would also like to discuss ObamaCare for a moment.\n  As I just stated, Senate Republicans want policies to grow the \neconomy, not the government. Yet ObamaCare is a law that grows the \ngovernment and will slow our economy. On Saturday, we will mark the \nthird anniversary of its passage into law.\n  Republicans have long warned that ObamaCare would have a devastating\n\n[[Page S1972]]\n\nimpact on our country. I have spoken about 100 times on the Senate \nfloor against ObamaCare and I have warned about its consequences: \nincreased premiums, lost jobs, and higher taxes.\n  Unfortunately, many of those things have already started happening. \nIt is not just off in the future. It has already happened, and the \nFederal Government has only just begun implementing the law.\n  Instead of premiums going down $2,500, as President Obama promised, \nthey have actually gone up by about the same amount, $2,500. Congress's \nown nonpartisan budget experts tell us the premiums will increase by \nabout $2,100 after more rules, more taxes, and more mandates take \neffect.\n  The Federal Reserve also came out with a report that confirmed \nsomething else Americans already know: ObamaCare is costing us jobs. By \nsome estimates, it could end up costing 800,000 jobs at a time when we \ndesperately need more of them.\n  Members of the President's own party have begun sounding the alarm \nabout the law's tax hike, including its tax on medical devices.\n  His union allies are concerned the law will make them less \ncompetitive too. Of course it will. Perhaps some of the union bosses \nshould have more thoroughly considered the well-being of their members \nbefore supporting ObamaCare's passage in the first place.\n  ObamaCare has already become a regulatory nightmare. I would call the \nattention of my colleagues to this chart. This is the ObamaCare law, \nhundreds of pages in itself. But these are the regulations so far: 7 \nfeet tall, almost 20,000 pages of ObamaCare regulations so far.\n  The law itself is not small, hundreds and hundreds of pages. But \nnearly 20,000 new pages of regulations, 7 feet tall, and they are just \ngetting started. This monster of a bill, as I indicated, was hundreds \nof pages long itself, but that is actually nothing compared to the \nregulations it has spawned.\n  This more than 7-foot stack of paper next to me is what has become \nknown as the redtape tower--the redtape tower, almost 20,000 pages of \nObamaCare regulations so far. It is nearly 20,000 pages' worth of \ncomplexity. That is just what the bureaucracy has dreamed of so far, \nand we can only imagine how much more is yet to come.\n  Do we expect small businesses to be able to cope with all the rules \nin this tower? If you were a small business owner, how could you? Would \nyou even be able to read through all of them and figure out which ones \napplied to you? I doubt it. I don't expect the average American to have \nmuch luck either.\n  The administration released a draft ObamaCare application last week. \nIt is 21 pages long. Unbelievable. If you like doing your taxes, you \nare going to love applying for the ObamaCare exchanges.\n  So Washington Democrats may pop the champagne this Saturday to \ncelebrate the law's third anniversary, but more Americans and small \nbusiness owners will be reaching for an aspirin once they are forced to \nstart navigating this bureaucratic nightmare.\n  In my view, ObamaCare is a colossal mistake for our country. There is \nno way to fix this thing. It needs to be pulled out by its roots, and \nwe need to start all over. This bill needs to be repealed and it needs \nto be replaced, not with another unreadable law or another 20,000 pages \nof regulations but with commonsense reforms that actually lower health \ncare costs.\n  Anyone who thinks we have given up this fight is dead wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, in a few seconds I will be propounding \na unanimous consent request. We were originally scheduled to have a \nseries of votes at 11:15. We think we have a way of working out some of \nour concerns if we just take a little bit of a breather and do the kind \nof negotiation based on the civility and common sense that we have been \nusing during this deliberation.\n  Therefore, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the previous order, all postcloture time be considered \nexpired at 2 p.m., with the time until 2 p.m. to be equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees, with all other provisions \nof the previous order remaining in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, just to give everybody the lay of the \nland, it means we are working through our legislative issues, and at 2 \no'clock we will then proceed to a series of votes which will be \nannounced in plenty of time for people to know what is happening.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the quorum calls be equally divided, and \nI thank the able floor staff for giving me advice. There are days when \nI think it is an opera and they are calling out the arias we need to \nsing. But we are moving, and I thank Senator Shelby for consulting with \nhis side of the aisle.\n  At 2 o'clock we are going to have a series of amendments, and I think \nthe Senate will feel very solid about the direction in which we are \ngoing.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, in a minute I am going to call up an \namendment that I was speaking about on the floor of the Senate over the \nlast few days. Essentially, this is an amendment that is pending to the \nbill--the continuing resolution and appropriations bills--that would \nstrike $380 million of spending for the MEADS program. It is \nessentially a missile to nowhere that our troops will never be able to \nuse in theater. We want to transfer that money to the operations and \nmaintenance funding for the troops so we can make sure there are \nresources they can use to, obviously, make sure they have what they \nneed for the very best equipment and training--particularly in light of \nsequestration and what we are facing. I know there is an agreement that \nis being worked out, and I hope my amendment is included in that \nagreement.\n  At this time I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment so I may call up my amendment, amendment No. 127.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I \nhave listened to most of her speeches, and she has been very \narticulate. I appreciate how she feels. There are some Democrats who \nagree with her, but the problem is it is hard to arrive at a list of \namendments. I appreciate her intensity, and I certainly do not in any \nway denigrate what she has been trying to do, but this is the situation \nin which we find ourselves.\n  I reluctantly object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I too have an amendment that I have been \nattempting for a number of days to have made in order. This is the \namendment that deals with the air traffic control towers. It is an \namendment that very directly and simply transfers money from two \naccounts that have lots of money in them--the unencumbered balances of \nthe Department of Transportation as well as a research fund--transfers \n$50 million from those two accounts to the air traffic control program. \nIf we do that, we can at least avert--at least what the Department of \nTransportation says is necessary to eliminate that program--closing \nmore than 170 air traffic control towers on April 7.\n  I spoke earlier this morning, and I intend to speak before the vote \noccurs. I\n\n[[Page S1973]]\n\nwill not repeat myself at this point in time, but this morning I \noutlined--and I hope my colleagues were listening--the importance of \nthis amendment to the safety of the traveling public. The modest nature \nof what we are trying to accomplish has the bipartisan support, as well \nas the wide range of support, from groups outside the Congress that \nsupport this amendment.\n  I again ask unanimous consent to amend the previous order and bring \nup my amendment. It is amendment No. 55, that 10 minutes be equally \ndivided, and we proceed immediately to a vote on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MORAN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I withdraw that. My understanding is the \nSenator from Montana has a brief statement to make regarding a big \nevent in Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is basically correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask to speak as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Baucus are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, at an appropriate time I will ask for \nsome consideration of an amendment of mine, amendment No. 6. My \namendment would hold the Obama administration accountable for its \nrecent decision to release more than 2,000 undocumented immigrants from \ndetention centers across the country in the past month. U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement claimed they were releasing these \npeople because they needed to reduce their average daily detention \npopulation of about 34,000 people--a congressionally mandated \nrequirement. They claimed they had to reduce the detention population \nfor budgetary reasons. Week after week, agents were tasked to release \nso many individuals.\n  At first the Department of Homeland Security claimed it only released \na few hundred people. However, last week the Director of Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement admitted that the administration had misled the \nAmerican people by confessing that over 2,200 aliens were actually \nreleased. They continue to stand by the excuse that budget cuts were \nthe reason for releasing these individuals.\n  Simply blaming budget reduction as a means to turn a blind eye toward \nthe national security of the American people is a very dangerous plan \nand one that calls into question the Department's preparation for \nsequestration, particularly when we consider that months before \nsequestration the Office of Management and Budget put out an order to \nall departments that national security, law enforcement, and safety and \nhealth should be a top priority. So if keeping criminals off the \nstreets of the United States shouldn't be a top priority--as per the \norder from the Office of Management and Budget--I don't know what \nshould be. So I want an accounting for it, and that is what my \namendment does--requests a simple accounting for why they were released \nand what it was all about. What is even more disturbing is the fact \nthat the Department had billions of unobligated funds from the past 2 \nyears that could have been put into protecting the American people.\n  On February 27 I sent a request to Secretary Napolitano questioning \nthe decisions of the Department. The letter, cosigned by Chairman \nGoodlatte of the House Judiciary Committee, was an attempt to better \nunderstand--just a simple understanding--how the Department will better \nconfront sequestration and reduce operational challenges that could \naffect the life, safety, and health of the American people--the same \nlife, health, and safety of the American people evidenced by this very \nadministration's directive going out from the Office of Management and \nBudget of the priorities that ought to be established during \nsequestration.\n  Now, you know what. So often what we find from this administration--\nand have even found in previous Republican administrations--is that \nletters that are embarrassing go unanswered. Unfortunately, this is not \nunusual. About a dozen of my letters to the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity on just the immigration issue have gone unanswered. There is \nno respect for congressional oversight. It is very frustrating.\n  We are on the cusp of undertaking a massive reform of our immigration \nsystem. Yet getting answers to the most basic questions seems to be an \nimpossible operation. Time and again, we have seen this administration \nrefuse to be held accountable, and what we want is just information. It \nis not as though we are saying that what the administration has done--\neven if we disagree with it--can't be done or shouldn't be done. But \nshouldn't the people know about who is being turned out in the streets \nwhen they have been held in confinement for a long period of time? I \nfear what will become of the President's promise of transparency if and \nwhen we do pass an immigration bill. And this is an example of things \nto fear in the future. Enacting a bill is one part of the process, and \nimplementing the law is another part of the process. If we don't have \nfaith in this administration now, what about trust for the future?\n  So my amendment would require U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement to submit weekly reports--just submit reports--to the House \nand Senate Committees on Appropriations and the Judiciary. The reports \nwill be required to contain detailed budgets on how ICE will maintain \nthe 34,000 detention bed occupancy levels authorized by Congress. It \nalso requires ICE to provide the number of aliens released from \ndetention as well as the following information on aliens released for \nbudget-related purposes: the conviction or charge for which they were \ndetained, fugitive status, existence of a prior deportation order, and \nthe terms of release.\n  My amendment happens to be cosponsored by Senators Inhofe, Vitter, \nBoozman, Roberts, Coats, McConnell, and Collins.\n  Within the last few days, we have had the Director of ICE, Mr. \nMorton, testify--well, it was just yesterday in the House. Chairman \nGoodlatte said his testimony raised more questions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na press release that expresses the testimony of Director Morton.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    U.S. House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                          Judiciary Committee,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 2013.\n\n               Director Morton's Testimony Doesn't Add Up\n\n       Washington, D.C.--Today, U.S. Immigration and Customs \n     Enforcement (ICE) Director John Morton testified before the \n     House Judiciary Committee regarding criminal and illegal \n     immigrants who are priorities for removal but were released \n     by the agency, which claimed release was necessary due to \n     sequestration. However, several of the claims made by \n     Director Morton do not match the facts and here's why:\n       At today's hearing, Director Morton blamed the release of \n     criminal and illegal immigrants on the lack of funding in the \n     Continuing Resolution (CR) and the sequester. But the CR \n     funded ICE above their budgetary request and provided the \n     required funding to maintain detention beds at their average \n     daily requirement of 34,000 through the end of March. \n     Meanwhile, an internal ICE document shows that the agency \n     began releasing detainees on February 15 and had already \n     released thousands of criminal and illegal immigrants ahead \n     of sequestration.\n       In addition, while the sequester cuts the agency's funding \n     by 5%, the savings resulting from the decision to mass \n     release criminal and illegal immigrants into the population \n     goes well above 5%. A 5% reduction of 34,000 detention beds \n     is about 1,700, but ICE has already released over 2,200 \n     criminal and illegal immigrants and the plan was to reduce \n     the daily population by 5,000.\n       Furthermore, Director Morton today acknowledged that he \n     could have made a reprogramming request to Congress or could\n\n[[Page S1974]]\n\n     have used other funds to keep criminals off of our streets. \n     However, he did not provide any reasoning as to why he did \n     not make such a request.\n       House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) \n     released the statement below regarding these inconsistencies.\n       Chairman Goodlatte: ``Director Morton's testimony given to \n     the House Judiciary Committee today doesn't add up. U.S. \n     Immigration and Customs Enforcement had more than enough \n     money to continue detaining criminal and illegal immigrants \n     that are priorities for removal and could have made a \n     reprogramming request to Congress if the money ran out. But \n     Director Morton never made such a request nor provided any \n     rationale as to what is more important than keeping criminal \n     immigrants off of our streets.\n       ``In addition, the sequester mandated a 5% cut at ICE but \n     the agency released more than 5% of detained criminal and \n     illegal immigrants. These facts make it appear that the \n     decision to release more than 600 convicted criminals and \n     others facing charges into our communities was more of a \n     political calculation than a budgetary necessity. This \n     decision not only undermines ICE's credibility but also \n     undercuts the American people's trust in this \n     Administration's ability to enforce our immigration laws.''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Last week Mr. Morton said they released 10 level 1 \noffenders. These are people convicted of violent crimes. They are \nrepeat drunk drivers, as an example. Yesterday he said they only \nreleased eight, but he also said they were trying to relocate them and \nbring them back in. Well, if you have these dangerous people out on the \nstreets, the public ought to know about it.\n  So I suspect that when I ask unanimous consent now, the other side \nwill object to my amendment. And I don't know why they want to go to \nsuch lengths to protect this administration when all we want is simple \ninformation--just simple information. We aren't saying that the \ndecisions made--even though we disagree with them--ought to be changed. \nWe are just saying that the public ought to know when we put violent \npeople out on the streets, and when we put people out on the streets \nwho shouldn't be out on the streets, we ought to know where they are, \nwhy they were put out there, and what it is all about.\n  I think the objection to allowing this amendment to have a vote--as I \npresume it will be objected to--is indefensible, but at this point I \ncall up for consideration my amendment No. 76, and I ask for just 10 \nminutes of debate and a vote on my amendment. I ask unanimous consent \nto do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I understand how the Senator \nfeels. Over the years I have served with him, he has always made his \nopinions very clear. We had his amendment in the list of amendments we \nwere going to do before, with some modifications that my friend \nwouldn't agree to. So I understand his feelings about this, but the \ngood news is that within the very near, foreseeable future--hopefully, \nI can start it in the next work period--we are going to start \nimmigration legislation here on the floor. We are finally going to be \nable to move to something that will include issues people have wanted \nto deal with for a long time.\n  So I say to my friend, I object, but I understand how he feels about \nthe issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding \ncloture having been invoked, the following amendments be in order to \nthe Mikulski-Shelby substitute: Coburn No. 69; Coburn No. 93; Coburn \nNo. 65, as modified; Coburn No. 70, as modified; Inhofe-Hagan No. 72, \nas modified; Mikulski-Shelby No. 98, as modified with changes that are \nat the desk; Leahy No. 129, as modified with changes that are at the \ndesk; and Pryor-Blunt No. 82; that no other first-degree amendments to \nthe substitute or the underlying bill be in order; that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order to any of the amendments listed above \nprior to the votes; that the time until 2:15 p.m. be equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees, with 30 minutes of \nRepublican time under the control of Senator Moran prior to votes in \nrelation to the amendments in the order listed; that upon disposition \nof the Pryor-Blunt amendment No. 82, the Durbin second-degree amendment \nto the Toomey amendment No. 115 be withdrawn; that it be in order for \nthe Toomey amendment to be modified with the changes that are at the \ndesk; that the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Toomey \namendment No. 115, as modified; that upon disposition of the Toomey \namendment, the Senate proceed to vote on the Mikulski-Shelby substitute \namendment, as amended; that all amendments, with the exception of the \nMikulski-Shelby substitute, be subject to a 60-affirmative-vote \nthreshold; that upon disposition of the substitute amendment, as \namended, the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on \nthe underlying bill; that if cloture is invoked on H.R. 933, as \namended, all postcloture time be yielded back and the Senate proceed to \nvote on passage of H.R. 933, as amended; and, finally, that all votes \nafter the first vote be 10-minute votes and there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided in the usual form between the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate everyone's understanding on \nboth sides. This is going to allow us to get to the issue at hand very \nsoon, and that is the budget, with Senators Murray and Sessions leading \nus on that issue.\n  Also, we were able to get a number of these amendments that people \nhave been wanting very badly to get. So I appreciate everything people \nhave done to this point.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 72\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport an amendment to H.R. 933 requiring the military services to \nresume their tuition assistance programs, which are so vital to our \nmilitary's professional and educational development.\n  On March 5, 2013, the Department of Defense Comptroller Robert Hale \nsent a letter to the services to provide ``additional guidance for \nhandling budgetary uncertainty in fiscal year 2013.'' In his letter, \nSecretary Hale said that ``all services should consider significant \nreductions in funding new tuition assistance applications.''\n  Three days later, on March 8, the Army suspended tuition assistance \nfor all its soldiers--Guard and Reserve--and as a result, more than one \nmillion Army soldiers immediately lost this important education \nbenefit. There was not a single exception, not one, not even for troops \nwounded in combat.\n  The Air Force, Coast Guard, and Marines also suspended their tuition \nassistance programs.\n  This matter concerns me greatly, and I hope it does my colleagues as \nwell. I understand the difficult fiscal decisions facing our military \nas a result of the sequester, but I object to the way they are handling \ntuition assistance with what amounts to blunt force policy making.\n  I want to reexamine the exact wording of Secretary Hale's letter. He \nstated that the military services ``should consider significant \nreductions in the tuition program.'' I want to repeat, he said to \n``consider significant reductions.'' Although his guidance was non-\nspecific in terms of what amounts to ``significant,'' four of our five \nmilitary services followed with the most extreme reduction possible--\nthey suspended all tuition assistance, indefinitely.\n  This decision affects lives, real lives of one of our nation's \ngreatest treasures--the less than 1 percent of our fellow citizens who \nare willing to volunteer and serve in our Armed Forces, regardless of \nthe dangers they are likely to face in the defense of freedom.\n  I want to highlight one example of the thousands of lives now \naffected--a young soldier who recently enlisted in the National Guard. \nHis personal story reflects the negative impact the tuition assistance \ncuts are going to have on our Armed Forces.\n  I saw him interviewed by a news station. He is 19, but with his new \nbuzz cut, he looked much younger. His military mannerisms were \nunmistakable he gave short responses, always beginning with a ``Sir'' \nor ``Ma'am.''\n  When asked how the decision to suspend tuition assistance affected \nhim, he said, politely, ``I was really counting'' on tuition assistance \nfor college.\n  You see, this young man does not have any comparable education \nbenefits to fall back on. He is only 19, as I said, and just back from \ntraining. As a Guardsman, he would need to deploy at\n\n[[Page S1975]]\n\nleast once to receive some of the new GI Bill benefits.\n  What do you think he will tell his friends about the military as a \nresult of this experience? What will his family say? And how much \nwarning did we give this young man that he could no longer count on \n$4,500 per year in tuition assistance?\n  As I said, this young man was 19 years old. Last month the veterans' \nunemployment rate for those ages 18 to 24 rose again. It is now a very \ntroubling 36.2 percent. We are in the midst of a grave unemployment \ncrisis and now is the time to invest--not divest--in continuing \neducation for our military.\n  This is not the way we should treat our service men and women. We \nshould keep our commitments, especially those we have made to those who \nare willing to sacrifice everything for their fellow Americans and the \nNation.\n  I urge my friends and colleagues to support our amendment to require \nthe services to resume tuition assistance the minute this bill passes. \nIt is sponsored by Senators Inhofe and Hagan, and it is a necessary \nresponse to an unnecessarily harsh and short-sighted policy decision.\n  The sequester is not a thoughtful or balanced approach to cutting \nspending, and we should find an alternative. But, until that moment \noccurs, everyone, especially the military services, must reject the \nimpulse to ``grab low hanging fruit,'' and cut it down, in its \nentirety, simply because it is more convenient.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I commend the chairwoman and vice \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senators Mikulski and Shelby, \non crafting a strong bill to close out the remaining 6 months of the \nfiscal year. This bill was developed under difficult circumstances and \ntime constraints, and I really feel they have done a good job of \nreturning some semblance of regular order to this process. I am hopeful \nthis progress will continue in the coming fiscal year.\n  One of my disappointments with this legislation, however, is that we \nare not able to fund any new Army Corps of Engineers projects.\n  The lack of new starts in the Corps is of particular concern to my \nState, as it impedes progress on the flood control project in Hamilton \nCity, CA. It is a project that could potentially serve as a model for \nCorp projects throughout the Nation. More importantly, the construction \nof a new levee is critical for the protection of Hamilton City and \nGlenn County from catastrophic flooding. The project has been ready for \nconstruction for several years now but has been entangled in the new \nstarts prohibition.\n  It is my hope and intention that for fiscal year 2014 we will have \nregular order in appropriations, and I will work to support this \nproject moving forward.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I met with FAA Administrator Michael \nHuerta last week to discuss sequestration and how it will affect our \nnational aviation network. Sequestration will reduce the FAA's budget \nby approximately $600 million in the middle of this fiscal year. The \nAdministrator told me this swift and sudden reduction in funding will \nhave serious consequences to the efficiency of our national aviation \nsystem, especially in Illinois. Airport managers throughout the State \nof Illinois have also registered their serious concerns about the \nsequestration impact on commercial and general aviation.\n  The FAA will have to severely reduce service or completely close \napproximately 180 air traffic control towers across the country. Nine \nair traffic control towers in Illinois will have their service either \neliminated or severely reduced: Alton, Aurora, Bloomington-Normal, \nDecatur, DuPage, Carbondale, Marion, Springfield and Waukegan. The FAA \nhas also said that overnight air traffic control service at Peoria and \nMidway airports could be eliminated. These are serious steps that will \nincrease delays, reduce capacity and potentially compromise the safety \nof the airspace in the areas surrounding these airports.\n  I will continue to monitor this situation and will work with the FAA \nand airport managers throughout the State of Illinois to address \naviation safety and air traffic delays.\n  However, the aviation system is not the only harm sequestration will \nhave on this country. The White House estimates sequestration will \nreduce the readiness of our troops; put up to 10,000 veterans at \nsubstantial risk of becoming homeless; drop 70,000 children from Head \nStart, including 2,700 from Illinois; take nutritional assistance away \nfrom 600,000 families because of cuts to WIC; and reduce foreclosure \nprevention and other counseling to 75,000 fewer households.\n  Many Republicans have said they are comfortable with allowing \nsequestration to continue. They think no one will notice what \nsequestration does to the country. I disagree. These sequestration cuts \nwill have real impact on real people in Illinois. We need to stop \nsequestration with a balanced solution of budget cuts and revenue. I am \npleased we will soon start debating the budget resolution. Budget \nChairwoman Patty Murray has produced a budget that will stop \nsequestration and the negative impacts it will have on our economy, our \ntroops and working families across America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/20/senate-section/article/S1975-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1975-S1990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS, AND \n             FULL-YEAR CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2013\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote for the bill before us because \nit ensures the continued operation of government. The overall spending \nin the bill conforms to the Budget Control Act yet provides needed \nflexibility for agencies to operate as best they can while under \nsequestration.\n  I will continue to seek a comprehensive, bipartisan approach to avoid \nthe harmful effects of sequestration. Any compromise to do so will \nrequire both prudent spending cuts and additional revenues. Considering \nthat revenues are necessary as part of the way to alleviate the \nnegative effects of the sequester, this bill is not the appropriate \nvehicle to address our current budgetary situation. I am hopeful that \nby passing this bill and ensuring no government shutdown occurs, we can \nwork in a bipartisan and responsible manner to undo sequestration.\n  This bill does contain important funding for Michigan, including \n$210.5 million for Army research on combat vehicle and automotive \ntechnologies through the Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development \nand Engineering Center, TARDEC, in Warren. TARDEC is the Department of \nDefense's leading laboratory for research and development of advanced \nmilitary vehicle technologies, including efforts to protect Army \nvehicles against rocket propelled grenades, improvised explosive \ndevices and explosively formed projectiles; advanced materials for \ntactical vehicle armor; more efficient engines; fuel cell and hybrid \nelectric vehicles; unmanned ground vehicles; computer simulations for \nvehicle design and training of Army personnel; and technology \npartnerships with the automotive industry.\n  The bill also includes funding for the programs of the Army's TACOM \nLife Cycle Management Command, LCMC, in Warren. TACOM LCMC is the \nArmy's lead organization for the development and acquisition of ground \nvehicle combat, automotive and armaments technologies and systems. \nTACOM LCMC-managed systems include the Abrams main battle tank, Bradley \nFighting Vehicle, Stryker Armored Vehicle, Mine Resistant Ambush \nProtected vehicle, and all Army tactical vehicles, such as the HMMWV \nand Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles.\n  The bill provides full funding for transportation programs authorized \nunder MAP-21, the 2-year transportation bill signed into law in July \nthat provides critically needed funding for our Nation's roads and \nbridges. This is a victory because the CR for the first half of the \nyear, and the House-passed CR, do not include the full funding levels \nauthorized in MAP 21.\n  The bill also provides needed support for American manufacturing. The \nHollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program, MEP, receives \nlevel funding at $128.5 million. It is the only Federal program \ndedicated to providing technical support and services to small and \nmedium-sized manufacturers. MEP is a nationwide network of proven \nresources that enables manufacturers to compete globally, supports \ngreater supply chain integration, and provides access to information, \ntraining and technologies that improve efficiency, productivity, and \nprofitability.\n\n[[Page S1976]]\n\nThis program has been used extensively in my home State by the Michigan \nManufacturing Technology Center, which operates the Michigan's \nManufacturing Extension Partnership Program. MMTC works with \nmanufacturers around the State of Michigan to innovate so they can \nbecome more efficient and profitable in order to grow and create jobs.\n  The bill protects the life and safety of boaters on the Great Lakes \nby including a provision that denies the administration request to \nclose the U.S. Coast Guard Seasonal Air Facilities in Muskegon. Closing \nthe station would put at risk the large number of boaters on Lake \nMichigan during the summer. The Muskegon facility has been in place \nsince 1997 and provides an important safety presence during the boating \nseason on Lake Michigan.\n  During the course of consideration of the Continuing Resolution, the \nSenate adopted by voice vote an amendment offered by Senators Coburn \nand McCain that will limit the use of funds of the National Science \nFoundation for political science research. The amendment was modified \nbefore it was adopted under an agreement between the sponsors and \nChairman Mikulski and represented a significant improvement over the \noriginal amendment. The amendment as modified allows for political \nscience research projects to be conducted when the Director of the \nNational Science Foundation certifies those projects as promoting the \neconomic interests or national security of the United States. I am \nconcerned that this amendment will restrict high quality research in \ncritical areas beyond our national security and economic interests and \ncreates a threshold for certifying eligible political science research \nprojects that could eliminate very worthy projects, if it is not \napplied wisely and thoughtfully. I hope that a broad interpretation \nwill avoid unnecessary restrictions of legitimate research.\n  I am disappointed that the continuing resolution does not provide for \nadequate funding for our financial markets regulators, the Securities \nand Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. I \nworked with a number of my colleagues on an amendment to improve their \nfunding to ensure they have the resources they need to police the \nmarkets. Unfortunately that was not adopted.\n  On balance, while the bill does not contain sufficient funding for \nmany programs, it also contains funding important to Michigan and \nensures the continued operation of government. For this reason, I will \nvote for it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask \nthe time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to comment a minute, before I talk \nabout the individual amendments, on the process we have seen.\n  We are going to have several amendments, and this is well in excess \nof $1 trillion in spending. We have had four amendments voted on, and I \nthink unanimous consent will give us seven or eight more. So we are \ngoing to have a total of 12 amendments. All but the first one were not \ntabled, but we are at 60-vote margins, which is fine. But for a bill \nthat spends $1 trillion, to choke down the Senate in a way that does \nnot allow either side the appropriate opportunity to impact $1 trillion \nworth of spending doesn't fit with either the culture or the history of \nthe Senate, and certainly doesn't fit with the agreement going forward \nand the rules changes we had this year.\n  On a bill that has $1 trillion worth of spending, in past history--if \nyou look at the 104th, the 105th, the 103rd Congress--bills of that \nsize would have 70 or 80 amendments, and we are going to choke down to \n11 or 12 amendments on this. The question is, Why would we do that? Why \nwould we limit the discussion and the division of thought, manifested \nthrough votes, for the American people to actually see what we are \ndoing? There are only two reasons why this is happening. One is--and \nfrom a phone call with the President, in his own words, he wants \nsequester to hurt.\n  Now, think about that for a minute. And he is my friend. I challenged \nhim on that when he said it to me. But there is a philosophical divide \nin this country. The Federal Government over the last 10 years has \ngrown 89 percent, while the average median income has declined 5 \npercent. The reason my colleagues want sequester to hurt and be painful \nis they want to rationalize that bigger government is better, that we \ncannot afford to cut a penny out of the Federal budget. So what we do \nis the Federal Government is doing less with more money while every \nAmerican is doing more with less money. That goes against the greatest \ntradition of our country. It is also a prescription for failure for our \ncountry when we are willing to sacrifice, in the short term, direct \nbenefits to major segments of our population for a political point.\n\n  Nobody has done more oversight on the Federal Government than I have \nin the last 8 years, and I will tell you, conservatively, out of the \ndiscretionary budget, $250 billion a year is spent that does not \npositively impact this country in any way. Yet we cannot get up \namendments to demonstrate that.\n  Not only can we not have an amendment up, we cannot even spend the \ntime on it to have a real debate about it. That is because they really \ndo not want to debate these issues of waste, duplication, fraud, and \ninefficiency.\n  Then the second reason we are not having amendments, or we are having \namendments at 60 votes, is to provide the political cover. Our country \nis in so much trouble it should not matter what party you are in. What \nshould matter is if we are fixing the long-term problems of our country \nin such a way as to secure the future of our country.\n  What we have seen through this process last week and this week is a \nfocus on the short term, a focus on the politically expedient, a focus \non the parochial--and from both sides of the aisle. This is not just \nDemocrats, this is Republicans too. Senator Ayotte can't even get an \namendment to eliminate spending for a missile program that is never \ngoing to be built. It is never going to be built, but we are going to \nspend $360 million on it next year because it is a parochial prize to a \nmember of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Washington is not sick because it is partisan. Washington is sick \nbecause it is political, and it is short term in its thinking. Nobody \nin their right mind, no matter how much it benefits their State, would \nsay they want to spend $380 million or $360 million--I am not sure of \nthe exact amount of money--on a program that is never going to come \ninto fruition unless they are thinking about them and not our country \nand not the families of our country and not the programs that have to \nbe reformed to save them. Nobody would do that. Yet we have 60 votes on \nall these amendments we are going to offer because they are going to \noffer protection for people to vote on them to know that they will not \neven pass, but they can still get the cover for a vote. They can say: I \nvoted for it but it didn't pass because it has to have 60 votes.\n  That is the smallest part of the problem. To have to go through what \nwe have gone through over the last 5 or 6 days and only have had four \nvotes says something about this place. I would just proffer that I bet \nhad we had an open amendment process we would have been finished with \nthis bill yesterday.\n  When I came here, for the first 2 years you could offer an amendment \nfor anything at any time at a 51-vote threshold. So all this time we \nhave wasted in quorum calls or on speaking on issues that have nothing \nto do with the bill in front of us is because we really do not want to \ngovern. What we want is we do not want the body to do its work and have \nthe input of both sides into a bill--other than in the committee. What \nwe want is a fixed outcome that will allow the administration to make \nsequester as painful as it can be.\n  So when you shut down packing plants, when the USDA says they cannot \nhave food inspectors there at the same time the USDA is advertising for \nsocial service workers and event planners--which, if you did not hire \nthem, could at least give you 52 people not being furloughed for a \nweek. What is happening to America today is we are focused inward on \nthe politics rather than our country. We are focused on gaming the \nsystem rather than governing. We are focused on all the wrong things \nbecause it is all about the next election.\n  We have our eyes so far off the ball that now every bill that comes \nto the floor has to have essentially a rules committee of one, which is \nthe majority leader, deciding whether he wants his members to vote on a \nbill. That doesn't have anything to connect with the history of the \nSenate. This is no longer the greatest deliberative body in the world \nbecause we do not deliberate; we do not have an open amendment process; \nwe are too afraid of our own shadows to cast a vote and think we might \nhave to defend it.\n  If you cannot defend any and every vote in this body, you do not have \nany business being here. To stifle debate and to limit amendments in \nthe way this bill has done certainly will not breed any goodwill going \nforward and certainly does not do service that the American citizens \nare due.\n  Mr. President, I will now take some time to talk about the various \namendments I have called up. Amendment No. 69 is the first amendment I \ncalled up. As the ranking member on Homeland Security and the ranking \nmember on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, what we know is \nHomeland Security, in its grants program, through what is called the \nUrban Area Security Initiative, is out of control. They have not \nprioritized their funding. They have not put metrics on their funding. \nThey have not controlled their funding.\n  We put out a report in December 2012 called Safety At Any Price, and \nwe highlighted the problems with this particular grant program. No \nclear goals, DHS has not established any clear goals for how the funds \nshould be used to improve national security. The 9/11 Commission warned \nagainst DHS spending becoming pork spending. UASI, this Urban Area \nSecurity Initiative, has become another porkbarrel program providing \npublic safety subsidies to cities such as in my home State, Tulsa.\n  No. 3, what we found is a tremendous amount of waste in these grants. \nThe lack of clear goals has led States and cities to use this funding \non wasteful projects, including paying for overtime for employees; \npurchasing computers, printers, televisions, underwater robots, \nbearcats--all the things that do not really connect to national \nsecurity and the prevention of terrorism.\n  This amendment prohibits $500 million allocated for the UASI grant \nprogram that has been wasted on items that do not relate to homeland \nsecurity. It prohibits the use of funds on overtime, backpay--backfill \npay, security at Major League baseball parks, spring training camps, \nattendance at conferences, and the purchase of flat-screen TVs.\n  The other thing we found in our report is the Department of Homeland\n\n[[Page S1978]]\n\nSecurity doesn't know what this money was spent on. Not only do they \nnot have goals and metrics for what the money is supposed to be spent \non, they cannot tell us what the money was spent on because they don't \nactually have any record of it. We have spent $35 billion in total on \nall DH grant programs since 2003. We have spent $7.1 billion on this \nprogram.\n\n  What I can tell you is it has helped some communities, I don't doubt \nthat, especially during our tough times. It has filled in. But if we \nare ever going to get out of the problem we are in as a country in \nterms of our debt and deficits, we have to have programs that have \nmetrics on them that have to be followed up. The grants have to be \nfollowed, and they need to be held to account.\n  My colleagues, I have no hopes of this passing because most of my \ncolleagues will not look at the research done on this, will not look at \nthe ineffectiveness of it, will not look at the waste, and will vote a \nparty-line vote to defeat this amendment. We will get 45 or 50 votes or \n51 or 52, but it will go down. So, consequently, real problems that \nhave been oversighted by the Permanent Committee on Investigations--\nreally oversighted by the Department of Homeland Security--the real \nsolutions to problems will not happen because of the way this place is \nbeing run.\n  Next, I would like to talk about amendment No. 93. Amendment No. 93 \nfollows a recommendation of the President. It is not my recommendation, \nit is the President's recommendation. What this amendment would do is \nactually take money that has been directed for expired heritage area \nauthorizations that were not any recommendations of the President--\nactually the President's recommendation was to cut this money in half--\nand we are going to do exactly that with this amendment. We are going \nto cut it by $8.1 million.\n  What heritage areas are, when we started them--the 12 heritage areas \nthis is about are at least 16 years old. One of them is 25 years old. \nThe whole idea behind heritage areas was to fund them with a grant \nprogram to get them started and then let them run on their own with \nState and local funds. They have become a dependency program.\n  The OMB and the President's budget said we ought to eliminate the \ndependency of these by trimming back the amount of money. Instead of \nbecoming temporary programs directed toward self-sufficiency as \noriginally intended, these national heritage areas have turned into \npermanent entities that continue to grow in number and funding amount--\ntotally opposite the original authorization intent. In other words, \nthey are parochial based.\n  As a matter of fact, one of them, the John Chaffee Blackstone River \nNational Heritage, has existed for more than 25 years. They actually \nthought the funding might get cut, so they created another way to pay \nfor it, just as the government had intended for them to do, and they \nraised the money for it this year. But we are going to fund them anyway \nin this appropriations package, this Omnibus appropriations package. It \nis not really a CR, it is an Omnibus appropriations. Of these, 12 have \nalready received $112 million, more than half the total ever spent on \nnational heritage areas.\n  So they have been in existence at least 16 years. They should have \nbecome self-sufficient. They need to become self-sufficient, and we \nshould not be spending the money. What will we do with the money that \nwill amount to about $16 million? We will turn that money into opening \nthe tours at the White House, opening Yellowstone National Park and the \nrest of the parks. In terms of the way that money is spent out, we will \nbe able to take $6 million or $7 million of that money and the national \nparks will open on time.\n  Most of you haven't heard about this, but in Jackson Hole, WY, and \nCody, WY, the citizens of that State are raising private money to plow \nthe snow so Yellowstone National Park can open on time. I want you to \nsee the contrast because it is important to their livelihood and their \ncommerce. They are going to sacrifice personally to get that park open \non time. At the same time we are going to send money to 12 national \nheritage areas that have been dependent on the Federal Government for \n16 years.\n  Tell me what is wrong with that picture. We are going to create a \ndependency, and then we are going to indirectly tax the people of \nWyoming--one of their great areas of commerce, a place where visitors \ncome to Wyoming to see Yellowstone Park--and have them use their own \npost-tax money to pay for that. That cannot fit with the vision of \nAmerica that almost everybody else in this country believes in. It \ndoesn't fit.\n  Other national parks have reported campgrounds that are going to be \nclosed to reduce maintenance. So we are going to take this $6 million, \nand we are going to use it to help open these parks and allow the Park \nService to have the parks open on time. In the original authorization, \nit was not supposed to get any money. They should not have been getting \nmoney for the last 10 years. Instead of creating a dependency in the \nprogram, we are going to take that money and do something for the \nAmerican people.\n  The next amendment is amendment No. 65, as modified. And this is one \nthat really gets my goat. The National Science Foundation funds lots of \ngreat scientific endeavors in this country. As a matter of fact, they \nhave about four times as many applications for grants as they have \nmoney to give out. But they spend a considerable amount of money doing \nsuch things as funding ``research in political science.'' In 2008 they \nspent $8.6 million funding research in political science, $10.9 million \nin 2009, $11 million in 2010, $10.8 million in 2011, and $10.1 million \nin 2012. What this amendment does is prohibit the National Science \nFoundation from wasting Federal resources on political science projects \nand redirects that to other areas within NSF that are going to give the \nAmerican people a much greater return on their investment.\n  Let me give some examples of what they fund: campaigns and elections, \ncitizen support, and emerging and established democracies, bargaining \nprocesses, electoral choice, democratization, political change in \nregimes, transitions. Those are all important things if we were not in \na budget and spending crisis. Tell me whether it would be better to \nhave the next new computer chip generation developed through a grant at \nthe National Science Foundation or if the actions of a filibuster in \nthe Senate are more important to the American people. Which one is a \ngreater priority? Which one is more important to the further \nadvancement of this country? I guarantee it is the former and not the \nlatter.\n  In the years hence, we are going to be making a lot of choices about \npriorities, and every amendment I am putting out here today is about \npriorities. Do we fund things that do not adequately or accurately help \nus in the short term in creating jobs, in being wise and prudent \nspenders of taxpayers' money, or do we fund things that are a low \npriority and let things that are high priority suffer? That is \nbasically what this amendment does. It says: Until we get out of this \npinch, we should not be spending money to--for example, the $251,000 \nused to study Americans' attitudes toward the Senate. We spent a \nquarter of a million dollars last year studying Americans' attitude \ntoward the Senate; $106,000 was spent to study the rise of candidate-\ncentered elections over those dominated by political parties; $47,000 \nwas spent to study the President's level of cooperation with Congress \nwhen they utilize Executive orders; $28,000 was spent to examine the \nprohibition movement. It has been a long time since we had prohibition \nin this country. That has to be a priority for us. How about a quarter \nof a million dollars to investigate how people perceive the political \nattitudes of others? That has to be important right now. It has to be a \npriority right now for our country. We spent $144,000 to track how \npoliticians change their Web sites over time. Who cares? That money--\n$144,000--will keep a whole bunch of meat inspectors at meat plants. \nThere will not be any furloughs if we get rid of this kind of stuff. I \ncould go on.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nwhat I consider nonpriority studies that the NFS has funded.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Taxpayers would have realized a better return on their \n     investment in biomedical research than in political science.\n\n[[Page S1979]]\n\n       While political sciences studies may be interesting to the \n     investigators, as investment in this studies will not yield \n     the same return on investment or benefit to Americans as \n     biomedical research.\n       Consider what grants NIH may have been able to award in \n     lieu of these ongoing political science investigations:\n       $251,525 used to study Americans' attitudes towards the \n     U.S. Senate filibuster from survey results\n       $106,868 to study the rise of candidate-centered elections \n     over those dominated by political parties\n       $47,783 to study American Presidents' level of cooperation \n     with Congress when they utilize executive orders\n       $28,356 to examine the Prohibition movement, in part to \n     help lobbying organizations better understand how to \n     influence policy debates\n       $250,000 to investigate how people perceive the political \n     attitudes of others and operate with group-centered \n     mentalities\n       $144,609 to track how politicians change their websites \n     over time\n       $20,862 to answer the question, ``What makes politics \n     interesting?'' and to analyze how individuals process \n     messages distributed by mass media\n       $259,231 to execute a national survey on ``the role of \n     optimism and pessimism in shaping the political beliefs and \n     behavior of Americans''\n       $91,016 to study which legislation gets roll call votes and \n     to guess the outcome when bills do\n       $23,233 to administer an Internet survey of 1000 people \n     about ``how citizens react to public political \n     disagreements''\n       $236,422 to study how lobbying campaigns, logrolling and \n     other trades affect bill development over time\n       These surveys and models are receiving millions of NSF \n     dollars every year, while groundbreaking biomedical science \n     falls to the ground. Why should taxpayers have to contribute \n     to studies of questionable value when so many worthwhile \n     biomedical research projects go unfunded? NCI received 4,143 \n     applications in 2012 for major R01 grants, and only funded \n     618 of them, leaving thousands of promising ideas unfunded.\n       Much of political science's studies have not even generated \n     useful data. Political science often involves finding a \n     situation for which researchers can develop a clean model to \n     predict future outcomes. However, yet one Northwestern \n     University political scientist famously noted in the New York \n     Times these models are typically inaccurate.\n       ``It's an open secret in my discipline,'' wrote Jacqueline \n     Stevens, ``in terms of accurate political predictions (the \n     field's benchmark for what counts as science), my colleagues \n     have failed spectacularly and waste colossal amounts of time \n     and money.''\n       Increasing funding for the National Science Foundation has \n     been promoted as a way to bolster our economy, preserve \n     national security, protect the environment, and educate our \n     youth. As a result, the agency has enjoyed strong bipartisan \n     support.\n       By no longer funding political science and increasing NCI's \n     budget, Congress has an opportunity to continue improving the \n     nation's health and to steward more wisely federal resources.\n  Mr. COBURN. This is where we should be doing our work. We should be \nmaking choices for the American people. We should be making the hard \nchoices that say this is more important than this. We don't have enough \nmoney. We are borrowing $40 million a second, and we are going to fund \nthese kinds of political studies that have no benefit except to the \npoliticians and the political science professors because they are the \nones who will read them. The average American doesn't care. But they do \ncare whether their meat is going to be safe and whether they are going \nto get meat.\n  Mark my words, this amendment will go down. It won't be passed \nbecause we don't have the courage to make priority choices in the \nSenate. We don't have the courage to allow the number of amendments, \nsuch as this--there should have been 30 or 40 such as this--on the \nfloor to make those choices.\n  Finally, I will talk about amendment No. 70. This amendment has been \nmodified. The appropriators have requested that Homeland Security-\nrelated reports--which are demanded in this bill--come to them. They do \nappropriate for Homeland Security, but there is an authorizing \ncommittee. It happens to be the Homeland Security and Government \nAffairs Committee. What this amendment says is: If you are going to \ngive information from the administration to appropriations, you might \nwant to think about giving it to the actual committee that has the \nauthority to authorize and change the program.\n  I hope this will be accepted. We are going to get it 14 days after \nthe appropriators. I don't know what that is all about, but I am \nwilling to concede. I think Senator Carper and myself ought to see what \nthe administration is saying to the appropriators about programs that \nare run through the Department of Homeland Security. So of all the \namendments we have, I think this is the only one that has any \npossibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, when I was on the floor this morning, I \noutlined the merits of an amendment I tried to have to this continuing \nresolution. It is amendment No. 55. It is an amendment that deals with \nthe air traffic Control Tower Program that the Obama administration has \nindicated will be terminated on April 7. I don't want to go over all \nthe things I talked about this morning, but I do want to talk about how \nwe got to the point we are today in which apparently this amendment is \nnot going to be considered by the Senate.\n  This morning I indicated how, in my view, important this amendment \nis. I read from an AP story from Chicago about how air safety was in \njeopardy. There were indications that a plane crash which occurred \npreviously would not have occurred if there had been an air traffic \ncontrol tower present. The complaint by Americans is that our aviation \nsector is so frustrated by the political brinkmanship which goes on in \nWashington, DC.\n  Again, this is an important amendment that is about the safety and \nsecurity of the American people--particularly those who fly. It is \namazing to me that despite the continued efforts to bring this \namendment to the floor for consideration--not that I expect any \nguarantee. There is no such thing as a guarantee that this amendment \nwould pass. But the inability to have it even considered is very \ntroubling and surprising to me.\n  Last week when we started on the continuing resolution, I was pleased \nto hear what the majority leader said about the process on the CR. This \nwas not stated years ago or months ago, it was just last week. The \nmajority leader said, when he was talking about the continuing \nresolution: There will be amendments offered. We are working on a \nprocess to consider those amendments. This week we will be off to \nanother opportunity for the Senate to return to regular order, an \nopportunity for this body to legislate through cooperation, through \ncompromise, as we used to do. This legislation will be a test of the \nSenate's goodwill. We are anxious to move forward and start doing some \nlegislating. We are going to take all amendments and try to work \nthrough them as quickly as we can. I hope we can move forward and set \nup votes on every one of them.\n  That is the announcement that was made as we started the continuing \nresolution. As the majority leader indicated, this legislation will be \na test of the Senate's goodwill. I think the Senate has clearly failed \nthe test of goodwill. But more than goodwill, we are failing the \nAmerican people in taking the steps necessary to secure their safety.\n  This is not an amendment about me or an amendment about Kansas. \nCertainly, I am talking about my home State. There is nothing wrong \nwith representing our home State which is affected by the loss of these \ncontrol towers. There are 43 States--almost all of us--that have \ncontrol towers. On April 7, they no longer will be operating.\n  I indicated this previously, that one of the reasons why I thought \nthis amendment, perhaps above others, should be considered is because \nthe Control Tower Program will be eliminated April 7. I am a member of \nthe Appropriations Committee. I am a member of the Subcommittee on \nTransportation. I will work to see that these programs are continued \nonce we get to the regular appropriation process when the CR is behind \nus. My colleagues and I will never have the chance to do that because \nin a matter of just a few short days the control towers will be gone. \nThey will be closed. The lights will be turned off.\n  So my role as an appropriator and as a Member of the Senate--which I \nshare with 99 other Senators--and the idea that we would then come back \nand restart a program that has disappeared is not going to happen. In \nthe absence of\n\n[[Page S1980]]\n\nthis amendment passing--in the absence of this amendment being \nconsidered and passing--the ability for me to do my job on behalf of a \nprogram that I think matters to the American people disappears.\n  I have never tried to be a difficult Member. I believe in \ncollegiality. I believe in the goodwill the majority leader talks \nabout. But I cannot imagine what I was supposed to have done. It is an \namendment that is germane. I am not here trying to offer an amendment \nthat doesn't matter to the bill at hand. I am not trying to score \npolitical points, I am not trying to put Democrats on the line for \ncasting a vote that the voters might object to. There is nothing here \nthat is political or partisan in nature. I did what I thought I was \nsupposed to do.\n  There are 26 cosponsors of this amendment. More than half are \nDemocrats. The Senators include Inhofe, Roberts, Blumenthal, Blunt, \nJohanns, Kirk, Manchin, Hagan, Klobuchar, Baucus, Tester, Enzi, Vitter, \nBoozman, Pryor, Merkley, Wyden, Kaine, Warner, Ayotte, Shaheen, Risch, \nCrapo, Murphy, Rockefeller, and Wicker. If 26 of us in that group can \nagree upon the value of an amendment, why is it the Senate cannot even \ntake a vote on a germane amendment that is broadly supported? It is \nbroadly supported outside the Chamber of this Senate. The Aircraft \nOwners and Pilots Association, the National Business Aviation \nAssociation, National Air Transport Association, Association of Air \nMedical Services--they believe this is important for the ability of \nLifeWatch patients--NATCA, the National Air Traffic Controllers \nAssociation, and the American Association of Airport Executives.\n  This is not a provincial issue that Moran is all about trying to take \ncare of something for himself, nor is it about trying to create \npolitical difficulties for anybody. We broadly agree on a bipartisan \nbasis that this amendment should be made in order.\n  I have been in the Senate for a little more than 2 years. I served \nfor a number of years in the House of Representatives. One of the \nthings I thought was true and why I sought the opportunity to serve in \nthe Senate is that it would be different from the House. Any Member of \nthe Senate ought to be here--whether Republican or Democrat--on behalf \nof their ability to offer amendments.\n  We had a debate about changing the rules and the proffer was made \nthat if we would agree to change the rules, amendments would be made in \norder. I thought that was a positive development.\n\n  Now, it seems to me, while I left the House in hopes of having the \nopportunity to represent my constituents as best as I know how and to \nrepresent America as best I know how, somebody stands in my way. I \ncan't find out who that is. I have not talked to a Senator who is not \nsupportive of my amendment. Every conversation I have is, well, I think \nit is a good idea. I don't know why it is not being made in order. \nThere is no good explanation.\n  Who sits down and develops the list and decides which amendment is \nimportant and which one isn't? This ought to be something that is not \nturned over to a one-person Rules Committee.\n  Again, the House and Senate are structured differently. This is a \nhistoric body with a legacy of allowing debate, discussion, and \namendment. And, again, not for purposes outside even the nature of the \nbill we are talking about, how can it be controversial to transfer $50 \nmillion in a bill that has more than $1 trillion of funding, of \nspending? How can it be so difficult to transfer $50 million from two \naccounts--unencumbered balances and a research account--to save air \ntraffic control towers, leave them in place until I at least get the \nopportunity to work with my colleagues to extend their life through the \nappropriations and legislative process into the future.\n  So for a Senator such as myself--I lay awake last night from, I don't \nknow, 3:15 to 4:30 trying to figure out what I could say that would \nconvince my colleagues to support this amendment or to allow whoever is \nmaking the decision that it can't even be debated and heard and voted \non--I don't know that there are any magic words. It does concern me. It \nbothers me greatly.\n  We ought to all be here protecting the rights of each and every other \nSenator. This is important to us as a legislative body, not to us and \nour egos as Senators. It is not the sense that we have the right to say \neverything--we are Senators, we are important and powerful people--it \nis that on behalf of the American people, a person such as myself who \nrepresents 2\\1/2\\ million Kansans ought to have the ability to bring a \ngermane amendment to a bill on the Senate floor.\n  Had we brought these amendments forward, had we agreed to debate and \npass my amendment, we wouldn't be here today still stalled on moving \nforward to conclude this business and move to the budget. We could have \ndebated the amendments and voted on the germane amendments days ago. \nBut for some reason we once again get bogged down in somebody deciding \nthat this amendment qualifies to be considered and this one doesn't.\n  So this is another example of where--again, I guess if we were to \ntell the story to the American people, it would be that today we are \ngoing to pass a bill that spends $1.1 trillion, and we have had four or \nfive amendments offered and perhaps approved, maybe a couple more \ntoday.\n  This bill has not worked its way through the Appropriations \nCommittee. It comes from the House. We take it up immediately. It is \nwritten so perfectly that only three or four individual Senators have \nthe opportunity to alter the bill--not the guarantee to change the bill \nbut the opportunity to suggest to our colleagues whether it makes sense \nand then cast a vote, yes or no, based upon whether what I am saying \nhas merit. We can't get to the point at which I am given the \nopportunity to explain on the Senate floor why this amendment is \nsomething that is important.\n  I came to the Senate from the U.S. House of Representatives in hopes \nthat the Senate was different, where individual Members have value \nunrelated to their relationship with the Speaker or the minority leader \nof the House, unrelated to my relationship with the members of the \nRules Committee. I have not always been the most perfect follower of my \npolitical party. I have tried to do what I think is right, and \ntherefore I have not always developed the relationship I needed in the \nHouse to be able to get my amendments considered on the House floor.\n  The Rules Committee is there for a purpose. It is a very unwieldy \nbody, the U.S. House of Representatives, of 435 Members. Here we have \n100. Surely, based upon the history, the legacy, the rules of the \nSenate, we have the ability as Senators, whether we are in favor or \ndisfavor and whether our amendment meets with a person's satisfaction \non behalf of the American people, we have the right to represent their \ninterests and have votes taken.\n  The majority leader said the other day that I am an obstructionist. I \nlay awake last night thinking, I am not an obstructionist. I am \nfollowing the rules. The majority leader said this morning that we need \nto show that sequestration is damaging to the country. I didn't even \nvote for sequestration, and yet I can't fix a problem that is caused by \nsomebody else's vote. Again, it is so baffling to me how this works.\n  I finally found somebody who would tell me they oppose my amendment. \nToday I talked to the Secretary of Transportation, who said: The \nadministration opposes your amendment. So maybe that is the \nexplanation. I have asked my colleagues on both sides of the aisle why \nI can't--a person who followed the rules, who did what one would think \none should do to get an amendment made in order--why can't this \namendment be heard?\n  The only explanation that I guess makes sense is that there are those \nin Washington, DC, who want to prove we cannot cut spending without \nconsequences that are dramatic. OK, prove that point. Come to the \nfloor. Have the debate about spending, about budgets, about taxes. Have \nthis conversation about whether we can afford to cut spending. Prove it \nto us. Take the votes. Demonstrate that it can't be done. But to use \nsequestration as the example for why we can never cut any money from \nany program, particularly on the amendment I am offering, is dangerous. \nWhat it says is, we want to make a political point, as compared to\n\n[[Page S1981]]\n\nworrying about the lives of the American people who fly.\n  So this circumstance in which I find myself--again this morning I lay \nin bed realizing that the radicalization of Senator Moran is occurring. \nThe only way, apparently, to get an amendment heard is to be difficult. \nIt is not my personality. It is not my nature. But on behalf of Kansans \nand Americans, if what it takes is for me to become more difficult to \ndeal with so my amendments are considered--it is not about me \npersonally--so amendments that matter to my constituents and, at least \nin my view, to America can be heard--you have to make yourself a pain \naround here if that is what is required in the Senate. I hope that is \nnot the case.\n\n  I hope the majority leader is right that this is the path by which we \nare going to get back to regular order. I want to be a member of the \nAppropriations Committee that works, debates, and discusses, we listen \nto witnesses and figure out that we can spend more here, but we have to \nspend less money here; this program matters, and this one is \ninefficient.\n  I voted against sequestration because I don't believe across-the-\nboard cuts are responsible. What that means is that everything deserves \nthe same reduction. There are things that we do well and that are \nappropriate for the government to be involved in, and there are things \nthat we do poorly and that the government shouldn't be involved in. Yet \nwe treat them all the same. I want to be a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee that says: We are going to evaluate each one of these \nprograms and make decisions about spending, and we are going to choose \nto spend money here and not here, or the decision will be made by the \nSenate and the House and the President that we are going to raise \nrevenues so we can spend more money.\n  But that is not a reason to block this amendment. It is not a reason \nto say that those people who are going to be traveling out of 179 \nairports that have control towers--that their lives are going to be \nless safe and secure and run the potential of loss of life and injury \nas a result of us trying to prove the point that we apparently can't \ncut budgets around here because we want to show there is damage to be \ndone when that occurs. That is a very dangerous political point.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MORAN. I yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, as a cosponsor of the amendment, I am glad \nthe Senator is getting around to the merits. Yes, it is a great \ninjustice the Senator is going through right now, not getting his \namendment heard. I have to say, though, as probably the only active \ncommercial pilot in here, I jumped on this bill because a lot of people \ndon't realize that the contract towers are just as in need of control \nas the noncontract towers.\n  The Senator is aware that the University of Oklahoma in northern \nOklahoma is contracted out. I have gone in there before where they are \nusing all three runways at the same time. It is a huge issue.\n  But what I want to ask the Senator is, why is it that when the \nbureaucracy is opposed to something they, No. 1, won't tell you about \nit; No. 2, they go whispering to the President; No. 3, they go \nwhispering to other people around here?\n  I went through this same thing, I suggest to my friend from Kansas, \nwhen I passed the Pilot's Bill of Rights. I had 67 cosponsors in the \nSenate, and they wouldn't bring it up. For an entire year they never \nwould bring it up, and we had to rule XIV it on the floor. That is what \nis wrong. When we have something everybody is for, it is a good thing, \nbut somehow--in this case, I know what it is: the same thing that \nhappened to me. I got mine passed. It took me a year to do it.\n  Best of luck to the Senator from Kansas. I would only say to him that \nthis is a time to stay in there and fight for this because this is a \ngreat example to use. Everything that is being cut in government right \nnow--all of these people who had to wait in line to get in here, there \nis no reason to do that. Everything people really want and the things \nthat are popular, this is what they cut. So the Senator from Kansas is \na victim of that. Just hang in there and try to make it happen.\n  Mr. MORAN. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I know he has great \nexpertise on the topic of aviation and airports and airplanes.\n  Again, I am here to decry a system that is failing. And while it is \npersonally troublesome to me--it bothers me--it is embarrassing not to \nbe able to accomplish what seems so straightforward and simple. We all \nlike to have victories, but it is not really about me. Every Member of \nthe Senate ought to have the opportunity to present germane amendments \nand let the will of the Senate--let those 99 other people, as well as \nme, make a decision based upon the merits, however we all make \ndecisions around here or whether we vote for or against something. This \nis not about my right as an individual Senator as much as it is about \nthe rights of all of us on behalf of the American people, on behalf of \nour home State and constituencies, to be able to do our jobs.\n  If there is a political game afloat that is preventing this amendment \nfrom being considered, then I would suggest we have transversed that \nplane in which we no longer are caring for Americans but we are caring \nabout our own political skills, our own political reelection as \ncompared to what we are here to do.\n  This place is way too political. This is not a political amendment. \nIt ought to be made in order. Yet, despite all the efforts, it has not \noccurred.\n  I hope, in the few minutes that remains, there is still a chance that \nmy unanimous consent request will be agreed to. I appreciate that \nothers were able--a handful of folks were able to offer their \namendments. I think we ought to have more of that, not less. It is \nabout the Senate doing its job; it is not just about Senator Moran not \nbeing able to accomplish his on this particular day.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues.\n  I yield for the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 115\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss briefly an amendment I \nhave that is going to be voted on later today, but I wish to begin by \ncompletely agreeing with the Senator from Kansas. It is extremely \nunfortunate, to say the very least, that the majority party is so \nafraid of casting votes, they are now disallowing the most ordinary, \nsensible, germane amendments that transfer modest sums of money from \none account to another account. I am not suggesting that everybody \nneeds to agree with it. I am not sure I agree with the amendment of the \nSenator from Kansas. But the idea that an amendment such as that \nshouldn't even have an opportunity to be debated on the Senate floor is \namazing.\n\n  Let me address the amendment I have introduced. I will start by \nobserving that the bill under consideration today significantly \nunderfunds the Defense Department's operations and maintenance \naccounts. The Army's subset of this category of funding is underfunded \nby $2 billion. That is just the Army alone. This has implications for \nthe safety and readiness of our troops. I am not suggesting that my \namendment solves that whole problem--it doesn't, but it makes a modest \nstep in the right direction.\n  Just quickly, some of the things the operations and maintenance \naccount funds--it is a lot. It is maintenance of ships and tanks and \naircrafts. It is avionics and engines and navigation systems. It is \nartillery. It is all kinds of things our service men and women use to \nfight and to win and to protect themselves. It gets funded through the \noperations and maintenance account, and it is not only maintenance of \nthis important equipment, it is also training--training such as unit \ntraining when an Army battalion, for instance, trains in an exercise \nagainst an opposition force that is modeled after a real-world \npotential enemy. That kind of training is very important. It gets \nfunded out of this account, the operations and maintenance account, and \nthat account is underfunded. So I would suggest that this is a very \nimportant account, and I think there is almost universal acknowledgment \nthat it is being underfunded.\n  Meanwhile, in the same bill, while we are underfunding our operations \nand maintenance account, we have a bill that would spend $60 million \nforcing the Defense Department to build\n\n[[Page S1982]]\n\nbiofuels refineries. This forces our Defense Department to build these \nexpensive refineries to make very expensive fuel. How do we know it \nwill be very expensive fuel? How many of us fill up our gas tanks with \nbiofuels? The component we are forced to buy--the ethanol--is part of \nwhat drives up the cost of gasoline. The fact is that conventional fuel \nis much cheaper than these biofuels, but we are going to force the \nDefense Department to spend a whole lot of money building a refinery, \nthe purpose of which is to produce extremely expensive and inefficient \nfuel. I would suggest that is a waste of precious resources we can't \nafford to waste.\n  Now, the House Defense appropriations bill did not include this, and \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee--these are our experts who analyze \nthis--opposed wasting money this way when they reported the bill out of \ncommittee. Unfortunately, when it got to the floor, it got put in, and \nthis is our opportunity to correct it.\n  Now, some have suggested these biofuel refineries are somehow a \nsolution to the expensive cost of moving fuel to combat zones. The only \nproblem is this item is going to fund the construction of refineries in \nthe United States. They are not going to be in combat zones. So that is \njust not true.\n  I would suggest if anyone thinks this is a good idea--to force \ntaxpayers to build expensive, inefficient refineries to produce very \nexpensive fuel--shouldn't it at least happen through the Department of \nEnergy or some other experimental research-oriented institution?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I know something about this being the ranking member of \nthe Armed Services Committee. We went through this.\n  Is the Senator aware that in one purchase the administration--now, I \nam talking about the White House--forced the Navy to buy 450,000 \ngallons of fuel at $29 a gallon? You can buy it on the open market for \n$3 a gallon.\n  Secondly, I think the Senator does know this because I heard him \nmention the Department of Energy, when we formed the Department of \nEnergy, they were supposed to do all this stuff.\n  But I would have to make one observation. We have a President, an \nadministration, that has been cutting dramatically, and we are all \nconcerned about what has happened to our military, our ability to \ndefend ourselves. They do it in three ways. No. 1, they cut; No. 2, \nthey delay; but, No. 3--and this is what we are getting to now--they \ntake the agenda, and in this case this green agenda, and put it not \nwhere it should be but under the defense budget. So for every dollar \nthat goes to the green energy programs, the Senator and I would like--\nsince I am cosponsoring the Senator's amendment--every dollar is \nsomething we cannot spend for our fighters in the field.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Well, reclaiming my time, I completely agree with the \nSenator from Oklahoma. We already force our Defense Department to waste \nenormous amounts of money purchasing fuel that is much more expensive \nthan readily available alternatives. I think that is a very bad idea. \nAnd I think it is a bad idea to do even more of that in the form of \nbuilding these biofuel refinery plants that would further propagate \nthis ill-conceived process.\n  If you think it is somehow a good idea to do this then, as the \nSenator from Oklahoma suggests, wouldn't it make sense to at least do \nthis in the Department of Energy rather than wasting precious Defense \nDepartment resources at a time when we know we are underfunding the \noperations and maintenance account? This is the reason for my \namendment.\n  My amendment transfers $60 million out of the biofuel refinery \naccount in the Defense Department appropriations bill and moves money--\nthe amount permissible under the budget rules--into the operations and \nmaintenance account. This is not a complete solution, I understand \nthat, but it is a modest step in the right direction of providing a \nlittle bit more resources to an area that is badly underfunded.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I just would briefly say that I believe \nSenator Moran, Senator Ayotte, and maybe others have good amendments on \nwhich they are seeking to vote. I am aware that Senator Moran's \namendment, I believe, has 28 cosponsors--a large number of Democratic \ncosponsors. Virtually no one seems to be opposed to it, but somehow a \ndecision has been made by the majority leader to not let him have a \nvote.\n  I believe we need to understand something very fundamental in the \nSenate, and we are heading to a crisis on this issue; that is, a duly \nelected Senator who serves in this body should be able to bring up an \namendment that is reasonable, that is germane, and get a vote on it. It \nis amazing to me that it seems to be now accepted that the majority \nleader picks and chooses the people who get their amendments.\n  I think the Moran amendment, from what I have seen and heard about \nit, would pass. So it is not going to pass. It is going to fail because \nsomeone, presumably the leader, has decided they will not get a vote, \nand it has been killed in that fashion. That is not the tradition of \nthe Senate. I am worried about that. We cannot continue that way.\n  To our new Senators--Republicans and Democrats--you need to \nunderstand that as a Senator, you have a right to have votes that are \nlegitimate on bills that are legitimately amended. That is where we \nare, and I am disappointed those votes have not been allowed.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his suggestion?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I withhold my suggestion of the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise today in vigorous opposition, \nand with very deep concern, to an amendment offered by the Senator from \nOklahoma that would prohibit Urban Areas Security Initiative, or UASI, \nfunds from being used to be able to pay local public safety employees \novertime and backfill pay.\n  I share the Senator's commitment to ensuring that homeland security \nfunds are spent wisely. I believe his efforts are in good faith, and I \nam eager to work with him toward this goal. However, as the threat from \nal-Qaida has metastasized to the Arabian Peninsula and elsewhere, there \nare still terrorists whose objective is to inflict wide-scale harm to \nAmericans on our homeland.\n  New York City remains the No. 1 target for terrorists around the \nworld who want to do us harm. Therefore, we must remain vigilant and \ncontinue to provide local law enforcement with all the tools necessary \nto keep us safe. So as well-intentioned as this amendment may be, law \nenforcement organizations across the country have been loud and clear: \nThis is simply the wrong prescription at the wrong time.\n  This amendment is opposed by a range of law enforcement and first \nresponder organizations, including the International Association of \nFire Chiefs, the International Association of Firefighters, Major \nCities Chiefs Association, Major County Sheriffs' Association, the \nNational Fusion Center Association, the National Homeland Security \nCoalition, and the U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n  In fact, I have a letter from our Commissioner Kelly that I ask \nunanimous consent be printed in the Record, along with another letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      The Police Commissioner,\n\n                                     New York, NY, March 15, 2013.\n     Hon. Thomas Coburn,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Homeland Security and \n         Governmental Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coburn: I am writing to express my concern \n     about an element of your proposed amendment, Number 69, to \n     the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act \n     for FY 2013. This amendment would\n\n[[Page S1983]]\n\n     prohibit Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) grant funds \n     from being used to pay local public safety employees overtime \n     and backfill. Such a restriction would jeopardize our \n     collective efforts to safeguard New York City, which has been \n     the target of 16 publicized terrorist plots since September \n     11, 2001.\n       The New York City Police Department (NYPD) uses UASI \n     funding to pay for, among other things: overtime expenses \n     associated with members of the Joint Terrorist Task Force \n     working on major terrorism investigations with the FBI; and \n     backfill expenses incurred by sending members of the service \n     to critical counterterrorism training courses, including a \n     course on active shooter response, which they cannot attend \n     during their normal shifts because of regular job \n     responsibilities.\n       At times of fiscal constraint, it is essential to direct \n     the limited homeland security grant funds available to the \n     programs that are most effective. Without a doubt, the \n     overtime and backfill funding that the NYPD uses to support \n     investigations, training, and deployments are essential to \n     the NYPD's layered approach to security. I appreciate your \n     attention to this matter and the Homeland Security \n     Committee's ongoing efforts to ensure that New York City will \n     continue to benefit from the most robust counterterrorism \n     program possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Raymond W. Kelly,\n     Police Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 14, 2013.\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     Chairwoman,\n     Hon. Richard Shelby, \n     Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Chairwoman,\n     Hon. Dan Coats, \n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Homeland Security, Committee \n         on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Mikulski, Shelby, Landrieu, and Coats: We are \n     writing on behalf of local elected officials, major city \n     police chiefs, sheriffs, intelligence professionals, and \n     major fire service organizations to express our strong \n     opposition to the Coburn amendment to the Consolidated and \n     Further Continuing Appropriations Act for FY 2013. This \n     amendment would prohibit, among other things, Urban Areas \n     Security Initiative (UASI) grant funds from being used to pay \n     local public safety employee overtime or backfill. Such a \n     restriction would overturn over a decade's worth of policy \n     and inhibit local security operations at high risk critical \n     infrastructure sites, major events, and along the border. The \n     amendment would also prevent first responders from training \n     and exercising to prevent or respond to terrorist attacks and \n     other major disasters.\n       Urban areas use UASI grants to pay overtime to local \n     personnel to be operationally ready to respond to a potential \n     terrorist incident and to provide extra security in a \n     heightened threat environment, often based on federal \n     intelligence and at the request of federal officials. This \n     includes protecting critical infrastructure such as nuclear \n     power plants, chemical facilities, public arenas, and water \n     treatment plants during high threat periods.\n       In addition to protecting critical infrastructure, UASI \n     funded overtime is often used to help pay local responders to \n     secure major events, including National Special Security \n     Events such as the G-8 summit, as well as border security \n     operations at both the northern and southern border. In these \n     high threat environments, additional local responders \n     coordinate with and support the Department of Homeland \n     Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and other \n     federal agency officials. This amendment would hamper this \n     federal, state and local coordination that is vitally \n     important to protecting our homeland.\n       Prohibiting the use of UASI funds for employee overtime or \n     backfill pay would eliminate critical training and exercises \n     for many urban area first responders. The UASI grants enable \n     first responders, intelligence analysts, and emergency \n     managers to receive the latest training and test their \n     capabilities in exercises by paying for overtime and backfill \n     costs associated with attending the training and exercises. \n     Personnel who would be negatively impacted by a change to \n     this policy include fire fighters, public safety bomb squad \n     members, urban search and rescue team members, intelligence \n     analysts, special weapons and tactics (SWAT) team members, \n     and hazardous materials response team members, among others. \n     With so many public safety agencies short staffed, sending \n     personnel to training and exercises during overtime is often \n     the only option. Ending this ability will directly undermine \n     the Nation's readiness to prevent and respond to the next \n     major terrorist attack, hurricane, or cyber attack.\n       If we can provide any further information, please contact \n     us through the National Homeland Security Coalition Chair Bob \n     Nations at (901) 222-6702 or bob.nations@shelbycountytn.gov.\n           Sincerely,\n         Congressional Fire Services Institute; International \n           Association of Fire Chiefs; International Association \n           of Fire Fighters; Major Cities Chiefs Association; \n           Major County Sheriffs' Association; National Fusion \n           Center Association; National Homeland Security \n           Coalition; The United States Conference of Mayors.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 26\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Under the leadership of New York City Police \nCommissioner Raymond Kelly, 16 publicly known terrorist attacks on our \ncity have been thwarted since 9/11. Our local law enforcement must \ncontinue to have every tool available to them to remain one step ahead \nof terrorists at every single turn. Even at a time of fiscal restraint \nin Washington, protecting our families from the unimaginable should not \nbe a place where we make cuts.\n  According to Police Commissioner Kelly, this amendment would \n``jeopardize our collective efforts to safeguard New York City . . . '' \nand that ``without a doubt, the overtime and backfill funding that the \nNYPD uses to support investigations, training and deployments is \nessential to the NYPD's layered approach to security.''\n  I ask my colleagues to stand with local law enforcement officials, to \nstand with the American public who have given us the duty to protect \nthem. I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment because, if passed, this \namendment will put the training and security deployments needed to keep \nus safe in jeopardy. These are not esoteric programs. We are talking \nabout programs that include counterterrorism training, region-wide \nplanning exercises designed to prepare emergency responses to large and \ncatastrophic events, and boots-on-the-ground security measures, \nincluding heavy weapons training and intelligence sharing.\n  These overtime funds actually reduce costs. If the NYPD needed to \nhire full-time officers or assign current full-time efforts to the \nspecialized patrol and intelligence duties described, they could not \nafford to do so.\n  So while I commend my colleagues for attempting to be good stewards \nof the taxpayers' money, these are cuts that our families cannot \nafford. We have a solemn duty to protect the American people. That \nshould be our first priority in this body. I ask each and every Member \nof this body to ask themselves how history will judge them if we fail \nto live up to that duty.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Coburn amendment \nNo. 26 which deals----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n2 minutes to address this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Coburn amendment \nNo. 26. What it does is prevent certain types of funding to be given to \nUASI, which is the lifeblood of New York's antiterror programs. It has \ngotten rave reviews from people. The person in charge is Ray Kelly, who \nis very much in the mainstream, right in the center of our fight \nagainst terrorism, not only in New York but in the country.\n  As you know, New York City has more than 100 police officers devoted \nexclusively to antiterrorism. They work very closely with FBI \ntaskforces and others. Some of this amendment is befuddling. To say \nthat UASI, our antiterror division of the New York City Police \nDepartment, could not buy computers, flat screens makes no sense.\n  The Lower Manhattan Security Initiative is an antiterrorism computer \nsystem. It is one of the mainstays of preventing terror. How do we \nfight modern 21st century terrorism and say they cannot use computers. \nThat makes no since whatsoever. Make no mistake, if this amendment \npasses, New York City training and security deployments would be in \njeopardy.\n  Another aspect is we often need to use overtime in our antiterrorism \nunits. For instance, we have to guard bridges and tunnels, particularly \nwhen there are threats against them. To have officers constantly \nchanging because of time commitments and time limitations makes no \nsense whatsoever.\n\n[[Page S1984]]\n\n  The bottom line is simply New York had a terrible tragedy on 9/11/\n2001. America rallied to New York's side, of which we are very \nappreciative. One of the ways, one of the most material and important \nways was this U.S. grant. It has been used well. It has received \nplaudits from around the country. To tie the hands of the very people \nwho are leading the fight on terror and saying they can do this but not \nthis, they can do this but not this, this is the kind of micromanaging \nfor which I think most people in America resent Washington.\n  I urge that this amendment be roundly defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                        Vote on Amendment No. 69\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to Amendment \nNo. 69 offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

On this vote, the yeas are 48, the nays are \n51. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of \nthis amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 93\n\n  Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 93 offered by the \nSenator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the amendment, but \nI see the sponsor is here. If he has no objection, I will speak, then \nask for a vote.\n  The Coburn amendment proposes to reduce funding for 49 national \nheritage areas by $8 million and redirect $6 million to park \noperations. It also strikes the reauthorization of 12 areas located \nacross the country, including one in my State of Rhode Island but also \nin Tennessee, South Carolina, and Georgia, among other States.\n  The amendment doesn't provide a real fix for the problems with \nrespect to national park funding. Moving $6 million is not going to \nmake up for the $134 million cut we have had to impose upon the Park \nService.\n  In addition, there has been some suggestion this would help restore \nWhite House tours. Those tours are governed by the Secret Service \nbudget, which is not part of this amendment. So that would not be \naffected.\n  These heritage areas are private-public partnerships. They are not \nnational parks. They provide huge economic development. They are \nlocated across the country. It is something we should restore, \nmaintain, and not cut.\n  With that, I would simply add the National Park Conservation \nAssociation opposes the amendment, and I ask my colleagues to oppose \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the average age of the heritage areas in \nthis bill is 16 years. If you look at the original authorization, none \nof them was supposed to get any Federal money now. As a matter of fact, \nthe Senator's heritage area has planned and raised the money for his \narea and had an alternative plan to do it.\n  The fact is, the national parks will open with this amount of money \non time this year, so it will make a big difference in Yellowstone and \nall the rest of the national parks. The National Park Service does have \nsomething to do with the White House tours because they can take this \nmoney and allocate that. It is not a Secret Service problem, it is a \nnational park problem.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The good news is \nthat the Senator and I have reached an agreement.\n  There is an acceptable modification. I didn't know if the Senator \nwanted to speak on this amendment. May I continue.\n  This amendment ensures that the NSF funding for political science \nresearch is widely used focusing on national security and economic \ninterests. I, therefore, believe we can agree to this amendment with a \nvoice vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the 60-vote threshold be waived for this \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there further debate?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I request a voice vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 65) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider that vote.\n\n[[Page S1985]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

The next amendment is Coburn \namendment No. 70, as modified.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am happy to tell our colleagues we \nhave also worked this out and can take this by voice vote.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of the Senator from Oklahoma. We have no \nobjection to providing the reports to the committee which he has \nrequested, reports to Homeland Security. However, many of these reports \nare expenditure plans, and all we ask is that the Appropriations \nCommittee receive them 2 weeks in advance. The Senator has agreed to \nthat, and we have no objection to taking this by voice vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I believe we can agree to this amendment with a voice \nvote, so I ask unanimous consent that the 60-vote threshold be waived \nfor the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 70) was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 72 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], for himself and \n     Mrs. Hagan, proposes an amendment numbered 72, as modified, \n     to amendment No. 26.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to waive the \nreading of the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require the continuation of tuition assistance programs \n for members of the Armed Forces for the remainder of fiscal year 2013)\n\n       At the end of title VIII of division C, add the following:\n       Sec. 8131. (a) Requirement To Continue Provision of Tuition \n     Assistance for Members of the Armed Forces.--The Secretaries \n     of the military departments shall carry out tuition \n     assistance programs for members of the Armed Forces during \n     the remainder of fiscal year 2013 using amounts specified in \n     subsection (b).\n       (b) Amounts.--The minimum amount used by the Secretary of a \n     military department for tuition assistance for members of an \n     Armed Force under the jurisdiction of that Secretary pursuant \n     to subsection (a) shall be not less than--\n       (1) the amount appropriated or otherwise made available by \n     this Act for tuition assistance programs for members of that \n     Armed Force, minus\n       (2) an amount that is not more than the percentage of the \n     reduction required to the Operation and Maintenance account \n     for that Armed Force for fiscal year 2013 by the budget \n     sequester required by section 251A of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am perfectly willing and I know some of \nthe Democratic sponsors of the bill, Senator Hagan and others, would be \nin agreement to go ahead and accept this by voice vote.\n  What this does is reverse the decision from the Department of Defense \nthat took away some of the abilities our troops, when they are brought \ninto service, have in terms of subsidizing their tuition. So this would \nreturn it to the way it was before.\n  I have to say quickly and briefly, this is something I have talked \nabout to our troops in the field. Many of them were so alarmed that it \nwas even suggested they would take away the very thing that caused them \nto enlist in the first place.\n  I think this is one that is going to enjoy wide bipartisan support \nfor a voice vote, and I ask for its adoption.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I would like to speak on this amendment. I think it is a \nvery good amendment. We have 100,000 servicemembers in our Active-Duty \nmilitary who actually utilized this last year, and 50,000 of them \nreceived diplomas, certificates, and licenses. It truly does help \nprepare our servicemembers for a successful transition into the \ncivilian workforce when they choose to leave the military.\n  This is good news for a recruitment tool and it is good news as a \nretention tool and I think it is imperative that we continue to offer \nthis tuition assistance benefit to our members.\n  I certainly want to thank Senator Inhofe for working with me on this \nissue. I think it is a very good amendment. I also want to thank \nSenators Mikulski, Shelby, Durbin, and Cochran for helping us reach an \nagreement and move this amendment forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, thanks to the excellent work of both \nSenators Inhofe and Hagan, who reached an agreement on this, I believe \nwe can agree to this amendment with another voice vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back and that a 60-\nvote threshold be waived for this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 72), as modified was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 98, as Modified, to Amendment No. 26\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I now call up the Mikulski-Shelby \namendment No. 98, as modified.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for herself and \n     Mr. Shelby, proposes an amendment numbered 98, as modified, \n     to amendment No. 26.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 378, line 3, strike ``a grant for''.\n       On page 580, line 22, strike ``0.092 percent'' and insert \n     ``0.1 percent''.\n       On page 585, line 11, strike ``through C'' and insert \n     ``through F''.\n       On page 586, line 16, strike ``division C'' and insert \n     ``division F''.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this amendment makes technical changes \nto citations, bill language related to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and an adjustment resulting from a CBO scoring.\n  I believe we can agree to this amendment with a voice vote, so I ask \nunanimous consent that the 60-vote threshold be waived for the \namendment. I want to thank Senator Shelby for the excellent work he and \nhis staff have done in cleaning up this bill for the technical aspects.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 98), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 129, as Modified, to Amendment No. 26\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 129, as \nmodified.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself, Ms. \n     Mikulski and Mr. Shelby, proposes an amendment numbered 129, \n     as modified.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S1986]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following: \n     ``Notwithstanding section 1101, section 7054(b) in division I \n     of Public Law 112-74 shall be applied for purposes of this \n     division by inserting before the period in paragraph (2) `; \n     or (3) such assistance, license, sale, or transfer is for the \n     purpose of demilitarizing or disposing of such cluster \n     munitions'.''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is a technical correction amendment. \nCurrent law prohibits transfers of U.S. cluster munitions that do not \nmeet certain reliability requirements.\n  Years ago Japan purchased U.S. cluster munitions that do not meet \nsuch requirements, and that Japan now wants to dispose of. Japan has \ncontracted with a company in Germany to do this. But transferring the \ncluster munitions to Germany violates the law.\n  Section 1706(c) of the continuing resolution provides an exception to \nthe prohibition on transfers if the purpose is to dispose of the \ncluster munitions.\n  The Leahy amendment #129, which is supported by Senator Graham, fixes \na minor drafting error. It is a purely technical amendment which does \nnot affect the substance of section 1706(c).\n  Mr. President, I suggest we dispose of this amendment by voice vote. \nIt should not be controversial.\n  I yield back all time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this too is an amendment I believe we \ncan agree to with a voice vote. Again, I wish to thank Senator Leahy \nfor the excellent job he did.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back and the 60-vote \nthreshold be waived for this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 129), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 82 to Amendment No. 26\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 82.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 82 to amendment No. 26.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 84, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n       Sec. 74__.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act--\n       (1) the amount made available for buildings operations and \n     maintenance expenses in the matter before the first proviso \n     under the heading ``Agriculture Buildings and Facilities and \n     Rental Payments'' under the heading ``AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS'' \n     in title I shall be $52,169,000;\n       (2) the amount made available for necessary expenses to \n     carry out services authorized by the Federal Meat Inspection \n     Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, and the Egg \n     Products Inspection Act in the matter before the first \n     proviso under the heading ``Food Safety and Inspection \n     Service'' under the heading ``AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS'' in \n     title I shall be $1,056,427,000; and\n       (3) the amount made available to provide competitive grants \n     to State agencies in the second proviso under the heading \n     ``child nutrition programs'' under the heading ``Food and \n     Nutrition Service'' under the heading ``DOMESTIC FOOD \n     PROGRAMS'' in title IV shall be $10,000,000.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. I believe this has been basically agreed to by both sides. \nI do not think we will require a rollcall vote. I believe we can go by \nvoice vote. I thank my cosponsors. We have had several Senators working \non this: Senator Coons, Senator Carper, Senator Hoeven--I appreciate \nhis great leadership--Senator Moran, who relented earlier and said he \nwould not object to this, and also Senator Blunt. He has done a \nfantastic job of moving this through.\n  This is about the Food Safety Inspection Service. Basically this has \na very direct impact on the private sector. When these Food Safety \nInspection Service employees are furloughed, that means basically the \nprocessing plant is furloughed. They have to close for the day because \nthey have to have a food safety inspector there when they are \nproducing.\n  I think it is agreeable, and I ask unanimous consent, that we do it \nby voice vote. I thank all of my cosponsors.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 82) was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 115, As Modified, Withdrawn\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nDurbin second-degree amendment to the Toomey amendment is withdrawn.\n  There will be 2 minutes of debate on the Toomey amendment, as \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To increase by $25,000,000 the amount appropriated for \n Operation and Maintenance for the Department of Defense for programs, \n   projects, and activities in the continental United States, and to \n                           provide an offset)\n\n       At the end of title VIII of division C, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 8131. (a) Additional Amount for O for Activities in \n     CONUS.--The aggregate amount appropriated by title II of this \n     division for operation and maintenance is hereby increased by \n     $25,000,000, with the amount to be available, as determined \n     by the Secretary of Defense, for operation and maintenance \n     expenses of the Department of Defense in connection with \n     programs, projects, and activities in the continental United \n     States.\n       (b) Offset.--The amount appropriated by title III of this \n     division under the heading ``Defense Production Act \n     Purchases'' is hereby decreased by $60,000,000, with the \n     amount of the reduction to be allocated to amounts available \n     under that heading for Advanced Drop in Biofuel Production.\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to make the case for this \namendment. I think we all know that this bill funds the Defense \nOperations and Maintenance Account to a very large degree. This is a \nvery important account from which we fund the maintenance of all kinds \nof military equipment, from trains to tanks to avionics--you name it, \nit gets funded from this account. So too does a whole lot of training \ncome from this account.\n  Meanwhile, we have $60 million going to build a biorefinery that \nwould force the Defense Department to pay too much for fuel. This is \nabout priorities, and it is my suggestion and my amendment to take $60 \nmillion out of this account that would force us to build an \ninefficient, expensive refinery to make too-expensive fuel and transfer \nit into this Operations and Maintenance Account that we need.\n  I appreciate the support of the ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee for this amendment, Senator Inhofe, and I urge my colleagues \nto vote in its favor.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I know Senator Udall wanted to speak against the Toomey \namendment. In his absence, I will comment on the Toomey amendment. I \nbelieve the Senator proposes to cut $60 million from the Advanced Drop-\nIn Biofuels Production Program. He would move $25 million from these \nfunds to the Operations and Maintenance Account. The Department of \nDefense recognizes that its dependence on foreign oil supplies presents \na real risk to its ability to operate around the world. I agree. As the \nlargest single customer of oil in the world, DOD spent $17 billion in \nfiscal 2011 on oil. DOD estimates that for every 25-cent increase in \nthe price of a gallon of oil we incur over $1 billion in fuel costs. \nEvery time oil prices go up, so does the cost of running the Department \nof Defense. Imagine if our military were cut off from these supplies.\n  The Senate has made it clear that there is support for biofuels. The \nSenate has voted twice in support of the Department of Defense biofuels \nprogram during floor consideration of the Armed Services Committee \nDefense bill. The funds appropriated for this project are available \nuntil expended. When the Departments of Energy and Agriculture are able \nto meet their obligations to fund this program, as required by the \nNational Defense Act,\n\n[[Page S1987]]\n\nthe Department of Defense will have their funds ready. The Toomey \namendment would cut a modest investment to provide security \nalternatives to petroleum dependence.\n  I urge the defeat of the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this amendment could have a profound impact \non our Nation's energy security by reducing funding for efforts that \nsupport finding clean energy replacements for oil.\n  High oil prices and tensions in the Middle East could not present a \nbetter national security case for moving quickly away from our \nmilitary's overwhelming dependence on oil, especially as currently \nsupplied to critical operations and facilities in the Middle East, the \nPacific, the Indian Ocean, and elsewhere. The military's dependence on \noil is one of its most significant vulnerabilities; as a recent Army \nrelease noted, our Nation loses one soldier for every 20 convoys \ntransiting through Afghanistan; fuel comprises 50 percent of the load \ncarried by these convoys.\n  Last year, the Department of Defense used 4.3 billion gallons of \npetroleum, and spent about $20 billion on fuel. I encourage the \nDepartment of Defense to continue to support efforts that will lower \nthe risks and future costs to our armed forces by supporting \ntechnologies like solar energy at forward operating bases, the \nproduction and procurement of advanced biofuels and other clean \nalternative fuels, and improved energy performance of materials to \nlighten and improve the capability, load, and endurance of our troops.\n  I will continue to do everything that I can to help move the Nation \ntoward a safer, cleaner, and more secure energy future.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Following the statements of Senator Mikulski and Senator \nShelby, I would ask to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are now coming to a vote on final \npassage of the bill. I am going to thank all of our colleagues who \nsupported cloture to bring the debate to an end. This is indeed a very \nimportant moment, because as we moved the bill, we have shown that we \nhave done something pretty terrific in that we have continued a \nbipartisan tradition of the Appropriations Committee.\n  I cannot thank my vice chairman, Senator Shelby, and his staff enough \nfor their cooperation, as well as the Republican leader and the \nDemocratic leader, often giving very wise counsel. We had three \nprinciples in this Senate continuing resolution: The House sent us a \nbill which we felt was skimpy and spartan. We wanted to not only avoid \na government shutdown--remember, the full funding of the U.S. \nGovernment expires on March 27; we did not want brinkmanship politics; \nwe did not want ultimatum politics. We wanted to be able to move our \nbill forward protecting national security needs and meeting compelling \nhuman needs and complying with the Budget Control Act. This bill will \ncost no more than 1.3 trillion, the same as the House continuing \nresolution. It does meet the needs of our constituents.\n  This bill is co-sponsored by my Vice Chairman, Senator Shelby, and I \nam so glad he is my partner. We have worked across the aisle and across \nthe dome to improve the House bill, while at the same time we have kept \npoison pills out of the bill, in order to prevent a government \nshutdown.\n  When we began this process, I had three principles for the Senate CR. \nFirst, avoid a government shutdown, while protecting national security \nneeds and also meeting compelling human needs, such as investing in \nhuman infrastructure like early childhood education and in research and \ninnovation, so that we can create jobs today and jobs tomorrow. Not \nshutting down the government allows us to protect the middle class and \nour fragile economic recovery. Second, comply with the Budget Control \nAct. The Senate CR provides $1.043 trillion, the same as the House CR. \nThird, establish a path to return to regular order for our fiscal year \n2014 bills.\n  This bill meets all three of these principles. We will avoid a \nshutdown. We are at $1.043 trillion in total budget authority, as \nrequired by the Budget Control Act. We have shown that we can work in a \nbipartisan manner, to move this bill to final passage.\n  The bill we will vote on today is five full appropriations bills: \nAgriculture; Commerce, Justice, Science; Homeland Security; Defense; \nand Military Construction and Veterans Affairs.\n  The remaining seven bills are in the CR: Energy and Water; Financial \nServices; Interior and Environment; Labor-HHS; State-Foreign \nOperations; Transportation-HUD; and the Legislative Branch. This means \nthey are provided current funding levels and policies, with some \nlimited changes to fix pressing problems.\n  This bill has been on the Senate floor for a week. The Senate has \ndebated and voted on amendments to eliminate funding for the Affordable \nCare Act, cut defense funding for projects in Guam, and cut funding for \ndefense biofuels programs, among others. This afternoon, we accepted a \nnumber of amendments by voice vote, again, in a very bipartisan \nfashion.\n  I will be the first to admit that this bill is not perfect, but it is \nthe bill that we need right now. I wanted an omnibus to provide \ncomplete bills for all the departments and agencies of the government, \nand not just some. I regret that the bill could not include a \\1/2\\ \npercent pay raise for Federal workers, who now face a third year \nwithout a pay increase.\n  This bipartisan bill keeps Americans safe in their communities. The \nSenate bill provides more than the House CR for State and local first \nresponder grants, providing a $208 million increase above the House CR, \nand for fire grants, providing a $33 million increase above the House \nCR. The Senate provides more for COPS grants, an $18 million increase \nabove the House CR, to put a total of 1,400 new police officers on the \nbeat.\n  When it comes to infrastructure, this bipartisan bill fully funds \nhighways, transit, and road safety programs at the authorized levels, a \ndifference of almost $700 million above the House CR.\n  This bipartisan bill also supports the innovation needed to grow the \neconomy and to create jobs today and tomorrow. The Senate bill includes \n$174 million more than the House CR for National Science Foundation \nbasic research. That means 400 more grants supporting 5,000 scientists, \nteachers, students, all of them focused on making new discoveries \nleading to new products, new companies, and new jobs. For the National \nInstitutes of Health, the Senate contains $75 million more than the \nHouse CR for research on cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and other \ndevastating diseases\n  The Senate bill meets compelling human needs. It includes $33.5 \nmillion more than the House CR for Head Start, to help them to \nimplement reforms and improve quality. The Senate bill includes $250 \nmillion more than the House CR for the Women, Infants and Children, a \nprogram that provides basic nutrition support for low-income mothers \nand their children. For homeless assistance grants, the Senate bill \ncontains $147 million more than the House CR for shelter and housing \nsupport for 28,000 more homeless people.\n\n[[Page S1989]]\n\n  This legislation will put us on the road to a return to regular order \nfor our appropriations bills. I am so proud that we have reached across \nthe aisle and across the dome to come to a bipartisan solution to \nfunding the government for the next 6 months. I thank my Vice Chairman, \nSenator Shelby, for his support, in making this possible.\n  As we start our work on fiscal year 2014 bills, this process should \nserve as a model, showing that the Congress can get its work done, and \ncan exercise the power of the purse in a bipartisan way.\n  My vice chairman and I have worked very hard to get to this point to \nprovide a bill that Democrats and Republicans can support. I hope they \nwill join with us to vote for final passage of the Senate CR, and \nreturn it to the House, so it can be considered and sent to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  I urge adoption of this bill and thank everyone for their \ncooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. We know we are ready to vote. I urge everyone to support \nthis bill. It needs to go to the House. The House, I think, is ready to \nact on it. This will fund the government through September 30. It is \nthe first big step toward regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the week before last, the House of \nRepresentatives sent us this important bill to prevent a government \nshutdown, to fund the government for the next 6 months. I have said it \nbefore, I say it again: I commend Speaker Boehner for giving this bill \nto us at a time where we could do some constructive work on it. The \nHouse did their work on time. We are going to do our work on time.\n  I applaud and commend my counterpart, Senator McConnell. When that \nbill came from the House, he sat down with me and the two managers of \nthis bill. He said: The House did their work, now we need to do ours. \nWe could not do all the remaining 10 appropriations bills, but we added \nthree. That was good. It would not have happened but for Senator \nMcConnell acknowledging that we needed to get some of this work done. \nIt could not have happened even though Senator McConnell and I thought \nit was a good idea but for the work of Senator Mikulski and Senator \nShelby. They are veteran legislators. They are people who believe in \nthis institution. They know this institution needs to get back where we \nare doing things the way we used to. The way we used to do things was \nfund the government in a timely fashion. We have the opportunity to do \nthat now. We are taking care of the next 6 months.\n  During this 6 months, the government will be functioning because of \nwhat we have done here. They will work on having 12 appropriations \nbills that we will bring to the floor. Everyone should know we are not \ngoing to be able to spend a week on every appropriations bill, but we \nneed to do all 12 appropriations bills. That is our goal. It is the \ngoal of the two managers of this bill, it is the goal of the Republican \nleader, and it is my goal. We need to do this.\n  I so appreciate--I say it again--the work done by the two managers of \nthis bill. They worked in good faith. They both gave up things they \nbelieved in for the greater good. They produced a substitute amendment. \nWe had added a few things to it. I know people are disappointed because \nthey wanted to rearrange things differently. I would like to have \nrearranged things differently. There are things that are happening in \nNevada because of the sequester that I would like to have taken out of \nthis bill. They are not good things that are happening either.\n  I hope this practical, commonsense leadership will be a good sign for \nour regular appropriations bills and other work in the future. The work \ndone by these two managers should be and is exemplary for what needs to \nfollow. And what is going to follow immediately is our budget. We are \ngoing to have a budget debate. It is going to be a good debate.\n  We have two differently opposed views as to what should happen to \nthis country economically. But that is what the Senate is all about, to \nallow us to do that. So I say to Senator Murray--everyone has heard me \ntalk about how good she is, and I really do believe that--I hope she \nand Senator Sessions are looking at what was done by these two \nSenators. Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby have totally different \nviews about how government should operate, but they also have views as \nto how the legislative process should operate. Legislation is the art \nof compromise. Everybody here has to understand, you are not going to \nget everything you want. You cannot throw a monkey wrench into \neverything just because you do not get what you want on one issue.\n  We are going to move to the budget. There will be no votes tonight. \nWe have a lot of debate time on this bill, and the two managers are \ngoing to determine when the votes will start.\n  Again, this is a very good day for the Senate. I am very happy we \nreached this point.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the bill having been \nread the third time, the question is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

During these 90 days, with \nSenator Shelby and his staff and the help and support of many people on \nboth sides of the aisle, we were able to pass the Sandy urgent \nsupplemental and we were able to pass the continuing funding \nresolution. This is pretty good. It shows we can work on a bipartisan \nbasis; that we can actually govern and that we can conduct ourselves \nwith decorum.\n  I think for all, as they watched the debate that occurred during this \nlast week, they saw civility, they saw sensibility, they saw, yes, \ndiffering ideas, but at the end of the day, I think we all agreed on \nour goal--we want to keep America moving. So I am glad we have moved \nthis bill to the House and we are going to keep our government \nfunctioning and keep America moving forward.\n\n[[Page S1990]]\n\n  Again, I wish to thank everyone for what they have done, and I look \nforward to moving the other 12 appropriations bills on a regular basis, \nworking, again, on a bipartisan basis across the aisle and across the \ndome.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are now on the floor of the Senate \nwith the budget, and I wish to start by thanking my counterpart, \nSenator Sessions, for all his work and his staff's work--and all our \nstaff--to get us to this point this evening that we are debating this \nbill and this amendment. Senator Sessions has been very gracious in \nworking with us. We have gotten to this. We obviously have differences \nof opinion, but I wish to commend him for the tremendous amount of work \nhe has put into this. It is going to be great to be working with him on \nthe floor.\n  When I go back home to Washington State, my constituents tell me they \nare sick and tired of the gridlock and dysfunction in Washington, DC. \nThey can see that our economy is slowly getting back on its feet and \nbusinesses are beginning to hire more workers, but my constituents--and \npeople across the country--are very frustrated that the constant \npolitical crises are holding our recovery back right when we need to be \ndoing everything possible to support it.\n  After 2 years of debate about fiscal and economic policy and an \nelection in which voters spoke loudly and clearly, the American people \nwant their elected representatives to stop arguing and reach some \nsolutions. I come to the floor to discuss a budget plan that meets this \nchallenge.\n  The Senate budget that passed through the Budget Committee last week, \nwith the strong support of all 10 Democrats and 2 Independents, is a \nresponsible and balanced plan that puts the economy first and tackles \nour deficit and debt responsibly and credibly. I am hopeful that after \nit passes the Senate, the House of Representatives stands ready to \ncompromise as well, and we can come together around a balanced and \nbipartisan deal that the American people expect and deserve.\n  The budget debate is too often discussed in terms of abstract numbers \nand political winners and losers. But the truth is that budgets are \nabout far more than that. They are about our values and our priorities. \nThey are about our visions for how government should be serving its \ncitizens today and for generations to come, and, most of all, they are \nabout the people across the country whose lives are impacted by the \ndecisions we make.\n  The budget we will be debating on the floor this week puts those \npeople first. It reflects the progrowth, pro-middle-class agenda that \nthe American people went to the polls in support of last election. I \nbelieve it is a strong and responsible vision for building a foundation \nfor growth and restoring the promise of American opportunity.\n  Our budget is built on three principles. No. 1, we need to protect \nour fragile economic recovery. We need to create jobs and invest in \nlong-term growth. No. 2, we need to tackle our deficit and our debt \nfairly and responsibly. No. 3, we need to keep the promises we have \nmade as a nation to our seniors and our families and our communities.\n  The highest priority of our budget is to create the conditions for \njob creation, economic growth, and prosperity built from the middle \nout, not the top down. We believe that with the unemployment rate that \nremains stubbornly high and a middle class that has seen their wages \nstagnate for far too long, we simply cannot afford any threats to our \nfragile recovery. So this budget fully replaces the cuts from \nsequestration that threatens 750,000 jobs this year alone and economic \ngrowth for years to come, as well as our national security, and the \nprograms families and communities depend on. It replaces those \nautomatic cuts in a fair and responsible way following the precedent \nthat was set in the year-end deal.\n  Half of the new deficit reduction to replace sequestration comes from \nresponsible spending cuts across the Federal budget and half comes from \nnew savings found through closing loopholes and cutting wasteful \nspending in the Tax Code that benefits the wealthiest Americans and \nbiggest corporations.\n  In addition to replacing sequestration with deficit reduction that is \nfar more responsible, our budget follows the advice of experts and \neconomists across the political spectrum who say it makes sense to \ninvest in job creation in the short term while putting ourselves on a \nstrong path to responsible and sustainable deficit and debt reduction \nover the medium and long term.\n  We believe that in order to truly tackle our economic and fiscal \nchallenges in the real world and not just make them disappear on paper, \nwe need a strong foundation for growth built from the middle out. So \nthis budget invests in a $100 billion economic recovery protection plan \nto put workers back on the job repairing our Nation's highest priority \ndeteriorating infrastructure and fixing our crumbling schools and \ninstalling critical educational technology such as broadband that our \nstudents need to succeed.\n  This plan creates an infrastructure bank to leverage public funds \nwith private investment. It invests in our workers by making sure they \nhave the skills and training they need to move into the 3.6 million \njobs businesses across the country are trying to fill, and it is fully \npaid for by closing loopholes and cutting unfair spending in the Tax \nCode that mainly benefit the well-off and well-connected.\n  Our budget also makes sure we are not reducing our fiscal deficit \nwhile increasing our deficits in education and skills and \ninfrastructure and innovation. While cutting spending responsibly \noverall, it protects our investments in national, middle-class, and \neconomic priorities, such as our\n\n[[Page S1991]]\n\nschools and our roads and bridges and our clean energy and \nmanufacturing industries.\n  This budget puts jobs first and our economy first and foremost, but \nit also builds on the work we have done over the last 2 years to tackle \nour deficit and debt responsibly.\n  In 2010, President Obama established the National Commission on \nFiscal Responsibility and Reform--commonly referred to as Simpson-\nBowles. That bipartisan group came back with a report recommending \napproximately $4 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years from a \nbalanced combination of spending cuts and new revenue. The report \npointed out that this level of deficit reduction is more than any \neffort in our Nation's history. Other bipartisan groups, including \nDomenici-Rivlin and the Senate's Gang of 6, as well as economists \nacross the political spectrum, agreed that $4 trillion over 10 years \nwas a reasonable and responsible goal. Since that time, Congress and \nthe administration have worked together to reduce the deficit by $2.4 \ntrillion--$1.8 trillion coming from spending cuts, $600 billion from \nallowing tax rates to rise on the wealthiest Americans in the year-end \ndeal.\n\n  The Senate budget takes us the rest of the way to the $4 trillion \ngoal and beyond. It builds on that $2.4 trillion in deficit reduction \nalready done with an additional $1.85 trillion in new deficit \nreduction, for a total of $4.25 trillion in deficit reduction since the \nSimpson-Bowles report. It reduces the deficit to below 3 percent of GDP \nby 2015 and keeps it well below that level for the rest of the 10-year \nwindow in a responsible way and it pushes our debt as a percentage of \nthe economy down, moving it in the right direction.\n  Our budget tackles this issue the way the American people have \nconsistently said they want it done--with an equal mix of responsible \nspending cuts made across the Federal budget and new revenue raised by \nclosing loopholes and cutting wasteful breaks that primarily benefit \nthe rich.\n  This budget cuts spending responsibly by $975 billion, and we make \nsome tough choices to get there. We think every program--including the \nones we know are important--need to be wringing out waste, trimming \nfat, and reducing costs to taxpayers. So $500 billion of our deficit \nreduction comes from responsible savings on the domestic spending side, \nincluding $275 billion in health care savings made in a way that \ndoesn't harm our seniors or our families. We believe everything should \nbe put on the table, but we do it in a responsible way that preserves, \nprotects, and strengthens programs such as Medicare and Medicaid that \nthe American people strongly support.\n  This budget saves $240 billion by carefully and responsibly reducing \ndefense spending while giving the Pentagon enough time to plan and \nalign those savings. We all know this involves some tough decisions, \nbut it is a responsible path that is nothing like the across-the-board \ncuts from sequestration which would be devastating to defense programs \nand jobs if they weren't replaced.\n  This budget takes a balanced approach to deficit reduction, and it \nmatches the responsible cuts with $975 billion in new revenue which is \nraised by closing loopholes and cutting wasteful spending in the Tax \nCode for those who need it the least, while locking in tax cuts for the \nmiddle class and low-income working families and protecting them from \npaying a penny more.\n  This shouldn't be controversial. There is bipartisan support for \nmaking the Tax Code more fair and more efficient. We just think that \ninstead of that savings going toward more tax cuts for the rich, that \nsavings ought to be used to reduce the deficit and invest in our middle \nclass.\n  If this budget were to be enacted, the total deficit reduction since \nthe Simpson-Bowles report would consist of 64 percent spending cuts, 14 \npercent tax rate increases on the rich, and 22 percent new revenue \nraised by closing loopholes and cutting wasteful spending in the Tax \nCode for the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations. That is a \nresponsible approach. It is a balanced and fair approach. It is the one \nthat is endorsed by bipartisan groups and experts, and it is the one \nsupported by the vast majority of the American people.\n  In addition to investing in jobs and economic growth and tackling our \ndeficit and debt responsibly, this budget also keeps the promises we \nhave made to our seniors, to our families, to our veterans, and to our \ncommunities. We think Medicare should be protected and preserved for \nour children and our grandchildren, and we absolutely reject calls to \ndismantle or privatize Medicare by voucherizing it.\n  The House Republican budget being considered this week could also \nrepeal the health care law and increase the cost of care to our \nseniors, throw students off their parents' plans, cause tens of \nmillions more Americans to be uninsured, and put the insurance \ncompanies back in charge of patients' care. Our budget rejects that \napproach, and it builds on the health care law to continue reducing \ncosts responsibly, increasing efficiencies, and improving care.\n  Our budget also maintains the key principle that every other \nbipartisan group has maintained but that has been rejected by the House \nRepublicans. We don't think the burden of deficit reduction should be \nunfairly borne by the most vulnerable children and families who have \nalready sacrificed so much. Everyone in America needs to be a part of \nthis solution, but the House Republican approach would shred the safety \nnet that has offered a hand up to millions of families across America, \nincluding my own when we needed it, and we reject that approach.\n  The budget we are considering this week also makes the investments we \nneed to keep our military strong, to protect our communities and \nenvironment, and uphold the sacred commitment we have made to our \nveterans. I believe our budget reflects the values and priorities of \nthe vast majority of families across our country. It is a responsible \nand credible approach, and it offers a clear path to a balanced and \nbipartisan deal.\n  House Republicans are debating a very different approach this week. \nThe proposal that passed through their Budget Committee would be \ndevastating for our economic recovery and threaten millions of jobs. It \nwould make extreme cuts to the investments in infrastructure and \neducation and innovation that we need right now to lay down a strong \nfoundation for broad-based economic growth. It would dismantle Medicare \nand would cut off programs that support the middle class and the most \nvulnerable families. It would do all that while refusing to ask the \nwealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to even contribute their \nfair share.\n  The American people are going to have an opportunity to examine these \nbudgets side by side over the coming weeks. They are going to be able \nto decide which approach is best for our economy, best for jobs, and \nbest for the middle class. They are also going to have a chance to \nweigh in.\n  After the Senate passes our budget and the House passes theirs, I am \nhopeful we can work together, listen to the American people, and come \nto the balanced and bipartisan deal this country desperately needs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Murray for her good \nwork. It has been 4 years since we have had a budget in the Senate. \nThis is her first year as chair of the committee, and we have gotten a \nbudget moved forward to the Senate floor. I congratulate her on that.\n  I note Senator Conrad, her predecessor, would have loved to have \nmoved a budget forward, but the leadership somehow decided that was not \nthe right thing to do. Indeed, they said it would be foolish to have a \nbudget. So this is progress, and although we would have liked to have \nhad more time in committee, Chairman Murray set up this system in a way \nthat she was clear about, and gave us full time all day Thursday of \nlast week to debate and make the points we believed were important, and \nso did our Democratic colleagues. They got to speak out. I thank her \nfor having an open hearing and being respectful of those of us who had \ndifferent views and were anxious to share them.\n  My colleague uses the phrase ``responsible and balanced.'' But what \nyou have to know, I say to colleagues and\n\n[[Page S1992]]\n\nfriends and Americans, is that this budget is anything but balanced. It \nnever comes close to balancing. It never balances over the entire \nlifetime. It does not put us on a trajectory that would ever balance. \nIt is not a budget that in any sense balances the amount of money \ncoming in with the amount of money going out. It just does not. And we \nneed to talk about that.\n  I think the American people want a balanced budget. I believe they \nasked for that. I think they expect that of us, and will be \ndisappointed to find out that the leadership in the Senate, unlike the \nleadership in the House, does not produce a budget that is balanced.\n  Today we begin debate on the budget resolution. This is the first \nbudget resolution on the Senate floor in 4 years, crafted by our \nDemocratic majority. We are required to produce a budget, but over the \nlast 4 years, in violation of plain statutory law in the United States \nCode that requires the passage of a budget by April 15--by April 1 it \nshould be produced in committee, we have not acted. It has been \ndisappointing. I have had many of my constituents say: How can they not \nproduce a budget when the law says you should have one?\n  Senator Reid said it would be foolish to have a budget. That was his \nexcuse or reason for not bringing up one--foolish to have a budget when \nwe have the largest deficit this Nation has ever seen, and we face the \ngreatest systemic debt threat we have ever seen.\n  I do not think we can have a greater symbol of an arrogance of power \nthan the refusal to produce a budget resolution over the last 4 years. \nIt was a decision to place--as I have said before, and I have been \nclear on this--political ideas and values over the American interests.\n  Our friends in the majority speak of their deep concern for \nstruggling Americans. Yet year after year there has been no plan \nproduced that will actually help them. America has never been in a more \nperilous fiscal condition, never needed a sound budget plan more than \ntoday. So what has changed? Why are we moving forward? The answer is a \nsimple one. The House of Representatives passed legislation. It said: \nNo budget, no pay. So now we have a budget. Hopefully, we would have \nhad one anyway, but I am glad that one is moving. Our colleagues \nprobably like to get paid.\n  Today we know the Senate majority resisted offering a plan for these \nyears. The budget before us today is a bankrupt vision that will \nbankrupt the country. It is a jaded tax-and-spend budget that surges \nthe Nation's debt and achieves no reduction in our annual deficits. It \nis a budget that never balances--never.\n  I think this quote sums it up well:\n\n       In short, this document gives the voters no reason to \n     believe that the Democrats have a viable plan for or even a \n     responsible public assessment of the country's long-term \n     fiscal predicament.\n\n  That is not my analysis but I agree with it. That comes from an \neditorial of the Washington Post after this budget was produced.\n  Senate Democrats have made no attempt to make the government leaner \nor more productive. Their proposal goes to extraordinary lengths to \nshield failing government programs from reform. Just add more money. It \ngrows the government at the expense of growing the economy. It enriches \nthe bureaucracy at the expense of the people. It has no plan to help \ndiscouraged workers move from dependency on the government to \nindependence. Its surging debt and taxes will crush American workers, \nclose American factories, and depress American wages.\n  I ask the American people to answer this question: Do you believe the \ngovernment is wasteful; that it needs to do a better job of saving your \nmoney? If your answer to that question is yes, then consider this: The \nDemocratic budget does not achieve a single penny in net savings. After \n4 years they have failed to identify any way to save money through real \nreform of government spending, not a solitary cent.\n  So any Senator who votes for this budget apparently believes the \nbudget is perfect and needs no reform. Any Senator who votes for this \nbudget is saying to the American people: Washington is not the problem, \nyou are the problem. They are saying: We have managed your money well, \nwe have done it all right, we did nothing wrong. The problem, see, is \nyou. You have not sent us enough money. In fact, this budget says: \nSend us another $1.5 trillion in more taxes. Send more money.\n\n  They also say: But don't worry, you will not have to pay those taxes. \nWe are just closing loopholes. But closing loopholes does not come \nclose to getting this many taxpayer dollars--it just does not. When \nthey talk about the closing of loopholes, what that really means is it \nis slashing popular deductions to pay for more Washington spending--\ncharitable deductions, home mortgage, or other exemptions. That is \nwhere the money is in the deductions. You will not raise much money \nwith loopholes.\n  Let's take a moment to look at the numbers in this budget and what it \nclaims to do. First, I would like to examine the claim that this budget \nreduces the deficit by $1.85 trillion. That is a significant sum of \nmoney. It is not nearly enough to balance our budget, but it is a \nsignificant sum of money--over 10 years, the claim is. When many \nAmericans hear this they might think it means the budget authors are \nproposing to reduce America's debt by $1.85 trillion. Not so.\n  According to their own budget tables our Nation's debt will climb \nanother $7.3 trillion over 10 years, passing the $24 trillion in total \nFederal gross debt that our Nation has accumulated. It does not reduce \nthe debt, not even close. The Nation's debt grows by $7.3 trillion.\n  Their promotional materials, however, claim $1.85 trillion in deficit \nreduction--they claim that. This claim refers to an alleged reduction \nin the size of the projected debt increase. So the debt is going to \nincrease, but we are going to reduce the increased rate of the debt--\nthat is what we are going to do--by almost $2 trillion. But even that \n$1.85 trillion claim is totally false. It just is. It is a fabrication. \nIt is not so. Several accounting tricks are used to create this number.\n  The biggest of these tricks is that their budget completely \neliminates the savings that have been placed in law by the sequester, \nbut it fails to count the elimination of the reduction in spending in \nthe sequester as a spending increase. We voted 20 months ago--Congress \ndid, August 2011--to reduce the growth of spending $2.1 trillion in \norder to obtain a raising of the debt limit by $2.1 trillion over 10 \nyears. That is what it would be. And 60 percent of that $2.1 trillion--\n$1.2 trillion--is the sequester. They would eliminate the sequester but \nnot count the fact that they have increased spending of the current law \nthat is in place, and it is not going to be changed except to be \nmodified so it is more rational in where the cuts fall. But they would \nwipe it out and not count that as increasing spending.\n  This is how the country goes broke. This is how America confuses what \nit is doing--I would say deliberately--to try to convince the American \npeople they are acting responsibly when we are acting irresponsibly.\n  I asked Chairman Murray's fine staff about this at the hearing. They \ndidn't want to talk about it, I have to say. But when pressed, like \ngood staff people do, and the question was put to them plainly, they \ngave an answer--the correct answer, I think.\n\n       Sessions: Relative to current law, under your plan if it is \n     enacted, how much deficit reduction will occur?\n\n  The staff answer:\n\n       Again, if you want to go straight to CBO baseline that we \n     started when I was talking to Mr. Johnson it would be about \n     $1.75 trillion. If you want to make the adjustments and take \n     out the sequester--\n\n  And of course we should--and the disaster, yes, obviously it's much \nless. I think the total deficit reduction is about $700 billion in the \nplan.\n  Mr. President, $1.85 trillion claimed in reduction. If you count the \nsequester you are at $700 billion. $1.2 from $1.9 leaves $700 billion. \nBut there are more gimmicks than that which take us down to zero \ndeficit reduction, really.\n  So I asked this question again to the staff of the majority in the \ncommittee:\n\n       Can you honestly say that under this budget you can achieve \n     $1.85 trillion in deficit reduction and eliminate the \n     sequester with only $975 billion [you claim] in new taxes?\n\n  And the answer was, ``No.''\n  Of course you cannot, but that is basically what they were saying. \nThat is what they said in their promotion of this budget, that it \nachieves $1.85 trillion in deficit reduction. Any American\n\n[[Page S1993]]\n\nwho heard that would assume it means we are going to reduce the amount \nof deficit being added by $1.85 trillion, relative to current law.\n  Once again, we have this obsession, it seems, in Congress. We are \ntrying to maneuver numbers around so we can spend more money while \nclaiming we are not. They claim they are reducing the growth in our \ndebt by almost $2 trillion, but it is not so. It does not happen under \nthis budget. If anyone wishes to know more details, we will share those \nas time goes by.\n\n  There are other gimmicks in this budget too. The budget fails to \naccount for the cost of continuing the stimulus tax credits and fails \nto offset the doc fix, as well as the physician payment fix, which we \nhave to do just like we do every year. It should be scored. We know we \nare going to have to make that expenditure.\n  Chairman Murray's budget, which the committee voted on and passed, \nonly includes $75 billion to fund the war on terror for 10 years. How \nmuch did President Obama say the War on Terror, when he submitted his \nlast budget, would cost over 10 years? He said it would cost $494 \nbillion. So they just waltz in and say: We will spend $75 billion in \nthe first 2 years and zero on the War on Terror over the next 10 years.\n  The Ambassador was in my office this week. He negotiated an agreement \nfor a reduction of forces in Afghanistan. We are planning to be there \nfor years. We have drone attacks going on. We have special forces \naround the world fighting al-Qaida, with whom we are at war, and that \nis what has been funding that--this account--and they assume it is \ngoing to end. It is not going to end. But if we assume it is going to \nend, we save, according to the President's projection, some $400 \nbillion. They can claim to save $400 billion by assuming we are not \ngoing to spend money that we are going to spend.\n  So if we add up all of these items--not scoring the sequester, the \ndoc fix, the new stimulus money, the manipulation of the war costs--\nthen there is zero deficit reduction. We raise $1.5 trillion in new \ntaxes, and there is a zero-deficit reduction because spending has \nincreased. So this budget also means there is a net spending increase \nabove the projected growth of spending. We are on track to increase \nspending every year even with the Budget Control Act and the \nsequester--that is going up every year--but they want to spend even \nmore than that. They want to increase the unsustainable debt course we \nare on now more than the current law calls for.\n  This budget breaks the spending limits we just signed into law with \nthe Budget Control Act. We told the American people, who were reluctant \nto raise the debt ceiling--and a lot of Members of Congress were \nreluctant to raise the debt ceiling--because we were so irresponsible \naround this place. But an agreement was reached recognizing that it \nwould be disruptive, to a significant degree, to raise the debt ceiling \n$2.1 trillion, that we would reduce spending over 10 years by $2.1 \ntrillion.\n  We have already run up another $2.1 trillion in debt. We already hit \nthat. In his budget last January, the President--less than 6 months \nafter he signed the Budget Control Act and eliminated a little bit of \nthe growth in spending--is proposing to eliminate the sequester part of \nit, which is $1.2 trillion, or 60 percent.\n  Here are some other figures the American people should know about \nthis budget. It has a 60-percent spending increase over 10 years, which \nwould increase spending by over 60 percent. It has over a $162 billion \nincrease in spending next year--another stimulus bill. There will be \n$7.3 trillion in new Federal debt that will be added under this budget \nover the next 10 years; a $1.5 trillion tax increase; an 80-percent \nincrease in Federal welfare and means-tested poverty spending. All the \npoverty programs--means-tested programs--would increase 80 percent. \nThere is no reform for those programs, but a big increase.\n  So the question of whether to balance the budget is one of the \ncentral features of this debate that we are having now. If the American \npeople take nothing else away from this debate, it should be that the \nparty running the Senate--the Democratic Party--is spending taxpayers' \ndollars and refusing to ever balance the Federal budget.\n  By contrast, the Republican-led House, with Senator Paul Ryan and his \nteam, has a plan that they will vote on today which will balance the \nbudget. They have passed a budget every year. Our colleagues in the \nSenate, while refusing to pass a budget, have delighted in complaining \nabout the leadership and the responsible action of the House by blaming \neverything they can think of, and more, on unkind Paul Ryan who wants \nto push the old folks off the cliff, and that is not true. He has good \nplans; he has growth plans. What I would say to everyone is: This \nSenate has done nothing by being critical of everyone else. We have had \nseveral budgets come up, and I voted for several of them. My Democratic \ncolleagues have voted for not one. They voted against the Ryan budget, \nthey voted against the President's budget, they voted against the \nToomey budget, and they voted against the Rand Paul budget. They voted \nagainst them all. Yet, they don't seem to be the least bit hesitant to \nattack everybody else.\n  I think we have a moral duty to balance the budget. It is not right \nto continue to spend and enjoy borrowed money today that someone else \nwill have to repay tomorrow. We also have an economic duty to balance \nthe budget, and I wish to talk about that. We need to balance the \nbudget to prevent a future financial crisis, as Erskine Bowles and Alan \nSimpson told the Budget Committee a couple of years ago. We are facing \nthe most predictable financial crisis in our Nation's history if we \ndon't get off this debt path. We need to act now to deal with the \npresent danger that is occurring to our economy.\n  Our massive public gross debt is hurting growth today. Our economy \ntoday is being damaged by it. It is destroying jobs today. Massive \nFederal debt is creating poverty and joblessness right now. The debt is \npulling down economic growth right now--not tomorrow, now. People are \nnot getting jobs today because of this debt. People are not getting \npromotions, bonuses, and wage increases as a result of this debt that \nis hanging over the country.\n  Well, some might say: How do you prove that? The famed economists \nRogoff and Reinhart testified before the Budget Committee a year or two \nago. They released a paper last April that concludes when gross debt--\nnot public debt, which is somewhat less--the $16-plus trillion that we \nsee on the debt clock in public--reaches 90 percent of GDP, then the \neconomy slows between 1 percent and 2 percent. The economy begins to \nslow. Our gross debt is now 103 percent of GDP. Some may not be aware--\nand my colleagues need to know this--that the International Monetary \nFund, the Bank for International Settlements, and the European Central \nBank have all independently done studies of this kind and reached very \nsimilar conclusions.\n  The other studies with different approaches all find that our current \ndebt load in the United States--which is now almost $17 trillion--is \ncausing a drag on our economy. A 1-percent decline in growth costs 1 \nmillion jobs, according to Christina Romer, who worked in the Obama \nWhite House as a top economic adviser.\n\n  We know that for the past 3 years, growth in America has fallen well \nbelow what our experts, the Congressional Budget Office, have \npredicted. These studies show our debt is hurting the economy now and \nthat increased spending and more debt must end now. It cannot be \ncontended any longer that it is good for America to borrow more and \nspend more. We cannot borrow more to spend more. Somebody compared that \nto taking a bucket in the deep end of the swimming pool, filling it up, \nand going to the shallow end and pouring it in. If truth be known, when \nyou borrow to spend, you drop some along the way. We must grow the \neconomy, not keep growing the government, and certainly not keep \ngrowing the debt.\n  I believe we all know this. I think the American people know it, and \nwe in Congress have a responsibility to honestly confront this \nchallenge and put our country on the right path. As we learned, we \nactually don't have to cut spending. All we really need to do is allow \nthe spending to increase, but allow it to increase each year at 3.4 \npercent and not 5.4 percent. If we increase it at 3.4 percent, as \nCongressman Ryan has done in his budget, the\n\n[[Page S1994]]\n\nbudget balances in 10 years. We don't have to slash spending. We can \neven allow spending to increase, but we have to manage the growth of \nit. We can do this.\n  The recovery we are seeing from the 2007 recession is the slowest \nsince the end of World War II and slow growth is expected to continue. \nThe Commerce Department reported last month that the economy barely \ngrew in the fourth quarter of 2012. We had virtually zero growth in the \nfourth quarter. That was a surprise. CBO expects the U.S. economy to \nlimp along in 2013 at about 1.4 percent after inflation is taken out. \nThat is a muddled, slow-growth, economy well below what they were \npredicting 2 years ago, which was a growth of about 4.6 percent, as I \nrecall, for 2013. So no one disputes that this is the slowest recovery \nsince 1945.\n  Why is it so slow? It certainly is not because the government has \nspent too little of the taxpayers' money. It is certainly not because \nwe borrowed too little and spent too little. Total Federal spending has \ngone up 30 percent since 2007, and our annual deficit today is 7 times \ngreater than the annual deficit was just 5 years ago. So as a \nconsequence of huge annual deficits, our debt has grown by 73 percent \nsince the beginning of the recession, over which time we added $6.6 \ntrillion in new debt.\n  It seems quite clear that a substantial reason our recovery is slow \nis because of the depressing effect of high debt, big spending, a \nburdensome tax code, and regulations that are unnecessary. But every \ntime Republicans have tried to reform the government, they meet the \nsame response from our Democratic leaders--from the President to \nSenator Reid to Chairman Murray--attack the reformers.\n  Majority Leader Reid said of one Republican reform effort that it was \n``a mean-spirited bill that would cut the heart out of the recovery we \nhave in America today . . . it goes after little children, poor little \nboys and girls.''\n  I think that is an unkind thing to say. I don't think anybody \nproposed any legislation that would have that effect or ability or \nintent to do anything like that.\n  Chairman Murray said:\n\n       I will not agree to a deal that throws middle-class \n     families under the bus . . .\n\n  Well, we are not throwing middle-class families under the bus. We \nwant economic growth. We want prosperity. The real truth is that the \ndebt increases borrowing, and spending has not worked. The debt is \nalready so high and we have irresponsibly run up so much that it is \npulling down the economy because it is over 100 percent of GDP. We \ndon't need to be attacking people who disagree over solutions in harsh \npersonal terms, but we do need people to focus honestly on the \ndisagreements and the challenges we face.\n\n  The real victims we are seeing here today are the millions of people \ntrapped in poverty by failed government programs. The real victims are \nAmericans who are being denied help by those who would defend the \nWashington establishment at all costs and won't reform. The real \nvictims of the left's rhetorical assaults are the communities out there \nthat are thirsting for growth and opportunity but denied any policies \nthat would create more jobs and actually create better and rising \nwages. The real victims are the millions who lost or can't get jobs, \nand they are out there--we have fewer working today than we had in \n2000--or those who didn't get a pay raise because the debt has pulled \ndown economic growth.\n  So I think this budget shows no really effective concern for \nAmericans living in poverty, struggling to work, trapped in a stale \nbureaucratic welfare state. There is no reform that will actually work \nto help them. That is what I am concerned about.\n  Look at a city such as Detroit, governed by liberal policies for \ndecades--a city once rich with business and commerce and opportunity. \nMore than half of all Detroit children now live in poverty. Look at our \nNation's Capital, another major city locally governed for decades by \nvery liberal policies, a city filled with finance and deep-pocketed \nbusinesses. Washington, DC, is flowing with Federal funds. No city gets \nmore from the Federal Government than Washington. Yet, despite this \ncash, one in three youths in our Nation's Capital lives in poverty. Two \nin three live in single-parent homes--two in three.\n  So this budget perpetuates the misguided policies that are causing \nsocial and economic harm in every State, in every region, in every part \nof this country. That is my view. Others may disagree, but I am \nprepared to defend it, and I think that empirical data and observations \nshow it is correct. Compassion, if we care about people who are \nhurting, demands that we change, does it not?\n  We need to grow the economy, not the government, and do it for all \nAmericans in every State and city.\n  We need to create rising wages and better jobs without just borrowing \nmoney and handing it out through some government check. That is not \nworking. It is over. We need to understand that. We need an economic \npolicy that provides our children with more jobs, not more debt. We \nneed jobs. We don't need to be burdening our children for the rest of \ntheir lives with an unconscionable debt so we can live high today.\n  We need to reform and improve ineffective government programs so they \nhelp more Americans actually achieve their financial goals. How can we \ndo this without running up the debt? Is there something we can do? \nDon't we have to have government investments? Don't we have to borrow \nmore money? We don't have any. Any new money we spend is all borrowed. \nWe are in debt. Aren't there some things we can do? Absolutely there \nis, and they are things that do not cost money. How about this: create \na new tax reform system that creates growth, revenue-neutral but \nsimpler, more pro growth-oriented and fairer. Can we do that? Yes.\n  What about more domestic American energy production? Produce more \nenergy here instead of sending our money abroad, creating jobs here, \ncreating tax revenue for our States, cities, and counties.\n  Let's make the welfare office--which gets from the Federal Government \ntoday hundreds of billions of dollars in spending--a place that \nrestarts lives, that helps people rejoin the workforce, not trapping \nthem in government benefit programs year after year.\n  Let's defend American workers from unfair foreign trade practices--\nand there are a lot of them. It is time we stood up to it.\n  Let's make government leaner and more productive. A leaner \ngovernment, a more productive government is good for America. I don't \nsee any reform effort there.\n  Let's eliminate every burdensome Federal regulation that isn't \nneeded. Those are job-killers. If a regulation promotes safety and is \neconomically viable, that is OK, but if it is not--and many are not--\nlet's eliminate it. It is a drag on growth and prosperity.\n  Let's enforce Federal immigration laws, and let's protect American \nworkers and legal immigrants from those who care only about importing \nmore and more cheap labor.\n  Let's balance the Federal budget. As I said, balancing the budget and \nreducing the debt of America over time will get our debt down so it \nwon't be a drag on the economy.\n  The American people have heard a lot of rhetoric from their elected \nofficials and a lot of buzzwords about financial discipline this week. \nRhetoric will be matched against reality. Every Senator will have to \nstand and be counted. I encourage the American people to tune in to C-\nSPAN and see where their Senator stands on the great issues of our \ntime: Do we balance the Federal budget? Do we reform the bureaucracy or \njust keep spending more money? Do we keep sending even more money to \nWashington through more taxes? Do we embrace our great constitutional \ninheritance of freedom or do we let it slip away? These are questions \nof our time.\n  The budgets reflect where we stand on these issues. I would say the \nDemocratic budget represents more government and less commitment to \nefficiency--not the kind of change and progress we need. We need to \nhave a budget that balances, that is oriented toward growth and \nprosperity.\n  I look forward to the debate today. It will be an interesting \nchallenge throughout the next couple of days. I have been very \npassionate here today, very frank here today, but I know we have great \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  In our debate in the Budget Committee, we had some great Senators on\n\n[[Page S1995]]\n\nboth sides of the aisle who have different views and expressed them \nably. Chairman Murray is so articulate and wonderful to work with, but \nwe do disagree.\n  It is time for change in this country. It is time to understand that \nour goal must be to promote prosperity and job creation and higher \nwages, not more government. That is what the debate is about. I urge my \ncolleagues to be engaged in it, and let's begin to change the direction \nof our country and put it on the road to prosperity.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Sessions for his \nleadership.\n  I come here today as a new member of the Budget Committee, fresh from \nthe committee process with some observations and some disappointments, \nbut principally today I come to the floor to talk about the urgent need \nfor budget reform and a lasting budget that will put us on a path to \nfiscal responsibility.\n  I suppose we should be delighted at least to be on the floor with a \nbudget. After 4 years of trillion-dollar deficits and after 4 years \nwithout a budget, at least we have an opportunity as representatives of \nthe American people to debate the financial future of this country and \nan opportunity to discuss putting our Nation on a trajectory away from \nconstant debt and uncertainty and on a path toward security and \nprosperity, on a path that is designed to create better job \nopportunities for the people we represent.\n  Unfortunately, the budget our friends on the other side of the aisle \nunveiled last week ignores the spending problem that continues to drive \nthe Federal debt skyward. Don't take the word of one Senator from \nMississippi on that. Let's listen to the words of the Washington Post \neditorial board. Not exactly what one would call a center-right entity, \nthey observed on March 14--and I quote the Washington Post:\n\n       This document gives voters no reason to believe that \n     Democrats have a viable plan for--or even a responsible \n     public assessment of--the country's long-term fiscal \n     predicament.\n\n  Those are the words of the Washington Post in utter disappointment \nabout the product we will be debating on the floor for the next several \ndays.\n  Being a member of the Budget Committee and being part of the budget \nmarkup process has certainly been revealing to me as a new member of \nthe committee. We were given an opportunity before amendments were \noffered to ask technical questions--not really to debate but just to \nask technical questions of the staff members about exactly what this \nbudget does. We learned from these professionals--when we just asked \nthem the questions, we learned these facts about the Democratic \nproposal for a budget for the next 10 years: It does not balance at any \npoint during the next decade. Never in the next 10 years would this \ndocument bring the Federal budget into balance. Not only that, in \npropounding further technical questions to the staff, we learned that \nthis budget puts our country on a spending path that never comes into \nbalance. There is no plan for decades and decades to come, as far as \nthe eye can see, for this budget ever to get the Federal Government \ninto balance. Yet it was supported by friends of mine on the other side \nof the aisle who have certainly given lipservice to the idea not only \nof a balanced budget but of a balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  I am going to predict that Democratic Members of this body who come \nin here and vote for this document will have coauthored a balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment, who have actually voted for or \ncosponsored a balanced budget constitutional amendment. Yet they will \nbe voting for a document that not only doesn't balance within 10 years \nbut that never, ever comes into balance. Indeed, the document that we \nwill be asked to support and that we are trying to amend grows the \nFederal Government at 5 percent each year for the entire decade. It \nraises taxes to the tune of $1.5 trillion over the decade. And this is \nimportant for us to realize: It doesn't raise taxes on that rich guy \nbehind the tree who we think can afford it, it raises taxes on the \nmiddle class. There is no question about it. We can't get $1.5 trillion \nout of the American economy without raising taxes on the middle class, \nand that is exactly what this budget does. So it never comes into \nbalance, but it does raise a ton of taxes right out of the middle-class \neconomy of this country.\n  Now, we will have an amendment process, and there will be a number of \namendments, but it will, in essence, give us an opportunity to slow the \ntrajectory of growth of Federal spending.\n  Members of the Senate will be offered an amendment in this process to \nbalance our Federal budget by the year 2023. We will be given an \nopportunity to debate that and to visit on a plan that would get us \nthere. How does it get us there? By slashing and burning? By tough \nausterity in the budget? Absolutely not. I think it would surprise many \npeople within the sound of my voice in this city and elsewhere to know \nthat we can grow the size of Federal spending by 3.4 percent each year \nover the next 10 years and still balance the Federal budget by the year \n2023. Let me repeat that. Federal spending is not going to be actually \ncut under the Republican proposal we will present as an alternative. \nFederal spending will go up each year by an average of 3.4 percent per \nyear, and still we will be able to balance the budget by the year 2023. \nSo we need not let anyone say that we are having to slash and burn in \norder to balance the budget.\n  There will be adequate funds to perform the functions of government \nand still we will be able to balance the budget.\n  I say what so many of my colleagues have said and what our \ndistinguished ranking member from Alabama has said repeatedly: We are \nnot in this business simply to say we balanced the budget. It is not \nsome artificial goal like winning a game. We are in this process of \ntrying to save our country from a mountain of debt in order to create \njobs for the American people, in order to grow the economy, rather than \ngrowing the size of the Federal Government. We have an opportunity to \navoid the fate that is occurring to our allies in Western Europe, even \nas we speak.\n  I have heard it said recently that: Well, we don't have a debt crisis \nyet. There are some people who would dispute that. But there are people \nin this Federal Government, the President included, who say: We don't \nhave a debt crisis at this moment in the Federal Government. I ask this \nin response: Must we wait for an absolute crisis before we act? We see \nit coming. We see what has happened to our friends who have overspent \nin Greece, in Spain, in Portugal, what is happening to our allies, our \nNATO allies in France. We can avoid this fate. Must we wait until the \nabsolute last moment when people are losing their jobs and we are \nunable to perform the necessary functions of government?\n  So I say this: We need to act now. We need to act to avoid that \ncrisis which is not that far down the road, and we want to act to grow \nthe economy and create jobs.\n  I wish to mention three issues briefly, and then I notice there are \nother people who want to speak on this important issue. There is hardly \na more important issue that we could be talking about, and thank \ngoodness, for the first time in 4 years, we are going to get that \nopportunity. Let me mention Social Security, let me mention Medicaid, \nand then Medicare.\n  Social Security is a wonderful program. My dad relies on Social \nSecurity. We are going to keep the commitment that we have made to our \nsenior citizens in the form of Social Security. But everyone agrees the \nnumbers simply do not add up long term. They agree with that much, as \nPresident Ronald Reagan and Speaker Tip O'Neill agreed to the very same \nnotion back in 1982 and 1983. The numbers were not adding up long term \nfor Social Security and something had to be done and some painful \ndecisions had to be made in the early 1980s. To this day, we thank God \nfor President Ronald Reagan and Speaker Tip O'Neill for having the \nbipartisan courage to do the tough things, to make the tough decisions, \nand adjust an important program so that Social Security has been saved \nfor the past three decades.\n  We need that kind of statesmanship out of the White House today. \nFrankly, we need that kind of leadership out of the White House. We are \ncalling for bipartisan action. I think it is worth noting--and it pains \nme to say this--for\n\n[[Page S1996]]\n\nthe first time in 92 years, we are considering a budget without seeing \na plan from the President of the United States, and he announced just \nlast week that he was going to wait in sending us his budget plan. It \nwill be 2 months late by the time it arrives, according to the \nPresident's own timetable. In fact, this is the fourth time in 5 years \nthat our President, that my President, has missed this deadline. But we \nneed the same leadership out of this White House that we had out of the \nReagan White House three decades ago. We can save Social Security, but \nit will have to be a little different.\n  We can save Medicaid and make it better. We are going to have an \nopportunity, as legislators, as policymakers, to give the States an \nopportunity to design their own Medicaid Program to serve their \nindividual States better.\n  Let's give one State or let's give five volunteer States the \nopportunity to take a Medicaid block grant and see if they cannot \nprovide better health care to their underserved population with a \nMedicaid block grant. Let's give them an opportunity to do that. The \nprogram does not work very well now.\n  Then the statement was made--and correctly--by some of my Democratic \ncolleagues in the Budget Committee that Medicare is a promise we have \nmade and we ought to keep that promise. I could not agree more. There \nis not a soul in this Senate who does not want to keep the promise we \nhave made to American workers and to American retired people with \nregard to Medicare.\n  But the fact remains--and every Senator in this body understands \nthis--Medicare, as it is currently written, cannot last for many more \nyears. The numbers simply do not add up. I am glad the point is being \nmade, and it is being picked up by the mainstream media now. An \nAmerican worker pays $1 into Medicare and gets $3 back in benefits. A \nsystem like that simply cannot be sustained long term. The numbers do \nnot add up. The math does not. It is not that flexible.\n  So we need to--as Reagan and O'Neill did--as responsible custodians \nof our Federal Government, as responsible trustees of the future of \nthis country, make changes to a program that has served us well.\n  Americans are calling for leadership and bipartisan action now. There \nare hopeful signs: the National Commission on Social Security Reform, \nthe Gang of 6, the Simpson-Bowles Commission, various bipartisan groups \nthat are trying to forge an honest long-term deal to deal not only with \nour debt but these three important entitlement programs.\n  I do not see that sort of realism in the document the Democratic \nmajority has provided to us through the Budget Committee. I hope we can \namend it. Perhaps we will not in the next few days, but we are going to \nhave to in order to be the trustees of the future, to be the \nresponsible leaders that our voters demand and that the people who come \nafter us would hope we could be.\n  I look forward to the process. I look forward, cheerfully and \nrealistically, to making the case for our position that we could grow \nthe government by just a little less and balance the budget within 10 \nyears, and in so doing we can make a better life, a better future, a \nbetter ability for our people to earn a living and support their \nfamilies.\n  Thank you very much. I look forward to the debate. At this point I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will be brief because I know we have \nother speakers on the floor.\n  This is all we need to know about the budget that was voted out of \nthe Budget Committee, along party lines, with Democrats carrying the \nday: It would raise spending by about 60 percent, it would raise taxes \nby $1.5 trillion, it would increase our national debt by $7.3 trillion, \nand--this is the most important part--it would never ever, ever \nbalance.\n  That is the exact opposite of what America needs to get our economy \nmoving again and get a handle on our long-term finances. We have \nalready reached a point where the Federal spending levels are \nunsustainable. We all know that. We have already reached a point where \nour national debt is exerting a drag on our economy.\n  I read the other day the President said there is no risk of an \nimmediate debt crisis. We can debate that. But what we cannot debate is \nthat our national debt is so big that it is dragging down economic \ngrowth, crushing job creation, and resulting in a loss of hope and \ncertainly a loss of opportunity for 23 million Americans who are out of \nwork or who are working part time and who want to get back to work and \nprovide for their families.\n  We also know, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, that an \nunprecedented--or at least in the last 30 years--number of Americans \nhave just simply given up looking for work. They have been so \ndiscouraged that the labor participation rate is at a 32-year low.\n  When our colleagues across the aisle say all we need is just a little \nbit more revenue; in other words, more taxes, we have already seen \ntaxes go up by more than $1.6 trillion since President Obama became \nPresident.\n  Simply put, we cannot act as if the laws of fiscal gravity do not \napply to the Congress or the Federal Government. That is why every \nsingle Senator on this side of the aisle has cosponsored a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution, which would require the Federal \nGovernment to live within its means and require a congressional \nsupermajority to raise taxes or raise the debt ceiling.\n  I have heard colleagues across the aisle say: We can't pass a \nbalanced budget amendment. That would tie Congress's hands.\n  That is the point. It would tie Congress's hands in spending money we \ndo not have, running up these dangerous debts, and being a wet blanket \non economic growth and job creation.\n  How do we know that government can live within its means? Virtually \nevery State has some type of balanced budget requirement. Why should \nthe rules in Washington be any different?\n  Some across the aisle argue--I think they actually believe this--that \nembracing fiscal discipline will jeopardize the safety net. In fact, \nthe opposite is true. If we do not embrace sensible fiscal discipline, \nour safety net programs will eventually collapse because we will not \nhave the money to provide for the national security and we will not \nhave the money to provide the safety net programs we all agree are \nnecessary for the most vulnerable of our citizens.\n  As I have said before, if we reform some of these programs \ngradually--as the Senator from Mississippi was referring to, Medicare \nand Social Security--we could minimize the impact and protect our most \nvulnerable citizens. But if we do nothing to reform and preserve Social \nSecurity and Medicare and we experience a Greek- or Spanish-style debt \ncrisis, these programs will be slashed abruptly. The very people our \ncolleagues say they want to protect the most will be hurt the most \nbecause the cuts will be much harsher and they will be \ndisproportionately impacted.\n  One last point. By reducing the growth of Federal spending--and that \nis all we are talking about doing; we are not talking about cuts in the \nsense that anybody else in America talks about cuts; we are talking \nabout just reducing the rate of increase in Federal spending ever so \nslightly--but by reducing the growth of Federal spending, we would \nprevent the need for tax hikes in the future. Indeed, that is what I \nhear from so many people in the private sector. When we ask them: Why \nare you sitting on the sidelines with cash in the bank, and why aren't \nyou investing in either new physical structure or jobs, they say: \nBecause the debt is so high and Congress has shown a lack of \nwillingness to deal with it, all we can do is expect that taxes are \ngoing to be a whole lot higher and greater burdens placed on job \ncreators, and so we think the more prudent thing is to sit on it and \nnot invest it in new job creation.\n  But new tax hikes would increase long-term economic uncertainty, and \nthey would discourage job creation. Conversely, if we work hard to keep \ntaxes within reason and certainly not raise them any more than have \nalready been raised, this would increase long-term economic certainty \nand encourage job creation. After all, investors and business owners \nand job creators are not stupid. They understand that without real \nspending restraint and real entitlement reform, we are ultimately \nheaded for another massive tax increase.\n\n[[Page S1997]]\n\n  Indeed, that is what this budget, voted out by our Democratic \ncolleagues along party lines, promises: higher taxes and more spending. \nThat is exactly what this economy does not need for us to get back on \ntrack, to create the jobs and to create the opportunities for people to \nprovide for their families and live the American dream.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. State.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Michigan is here. I would like to ask \nher how much time she would like me to yield to her.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I believe we have other colleagues coming as well. We \nwere hoping to have 30 minutes and possibly more.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will yield to the Senator from Michigan and her \ncolleagues 30 minutes. I am happy to yield more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I look forward to colleagues who will be joining me to \nexpress strong support for the budget that has been reported out of the \nSenate Budget Committee. I first want to thank our chair, who has done \na yeoman's job in putting this together. She has had so many different \nassignments dealing with the budget and efforts to come to responsible \nreform and put our country back on the right track in order to bring \ndown the deficit and grow the economy. One more time she has stepped up \nto the job. So I want to thank our chair for all of her efforts.\n  Let me start, first of all, by saying this is very simple when we \nlook at what we are talking about in this budget. As I said also, I \nwant to thank the ranking member for his courtesy throughout the budget \nprocess. While we have very different views, this was done in a very \nprofessional and courteous way on all sides. I really appreciate that.\n  But this is a very different view, both in what we debate and how we \nview this budget, which is a values document for the country, and the \nbudget that is being debated in the House of Representatives. It comes \ndown to something very simple. Our budget strengthens the middle class. \nWe believe it is critically important that we grow the economy from the \nmiddle out. That means making sure folks who are struggling to stay in \nthe middle class have a fair shot, people trying to get in the middle \nclass have a fair shot, and that we grow the economy by understanding \nthe economic engine of America comes from having a strong middle class.\n  On the other side, the Republican budget just plain simply protects \nthe special interests, special interest deals in the Tax Code and other \nspecial interests in other kinds of policies. It is just very different \nand does not grow or support the middle class.\n  I also think it is very important that we not just talk in theory but \ntalk about what has happened in the past and what has worked and what \nhas not. We should do more of what works and less of what does not \nwork. We need to start by looking at what happened as we came into \n2001.\n  I was fortunate to be a new Member of the House of Representatives in \n1997 when, under President Clinton, we all worked together and balanced \nthe budget for the first time in 30 years.\n  I came to the Senate in 2001. We were debating the largest budget \nsurplus projected in the history of the country. That is where we were. \nThe question was, What kind of economic policies, what kinds of \napproaches will be put in place to be able to manage that fact, that we \nhad the largest budget surplus projected in the history of the country?\n  There were two proposals put forward at that time. When you look at \nthe way the debt was going from 2001, it is amazing. If we had only \ntaken a different track than what happened. I remember as a new Member, \na new Democrat, that our leader on our side of the aisle, Senator \nConrad, came forward with a proposal that I believed was eminently \nreasonable. He said: Why do we not take that budget surplus and divide \nit into thirds: one-third of it for strategic tax cuts to grow the \neconomy; one-third of it for strategic investments in education, \nscience, R, moving the economy; and one-third to prefund the \nliabilities for Social Security for the next 75 years.\n  Imagine if we had done that. Instead, what happened was the surplus \nwas put into a huge supply side tax cut, benefiting, as we know now, \nthe wealthiest in the country, adding to a situation where the wealthy \nhave gotten wealthier and wealthier in the last decade, the middle \nclass has shrunk and shrunk, and more and more people are struggling \ntoday. So it was all put into a large tax cut, and then we proceeded to \ngo into two wars that were not paid for, a Medicare prescription drug \nplan not paid for, and nothing else paid for for a decade. We ended up \nwith the largest deficit in the history of the country. That is what \nthis President walked into. That is what we have been faced with.\n  Now, when we look at where the debt has come from, and why it is \nimportant that we focus on the economy, we know the biggest piece of \nwhere the debt came from was the tax cut geared to the wealthiest \nAmericans, which has been famously called trickle down economics. The \nfolks in Michigan are still waiting for it to trickle down.\n  Then we saw the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. We are so appreciative \nof the President leading us out of the war in Iraq. We are closing down \nthe war in Afghanistan. So that piece is being addressed. We have \naddressed the tax cuts at the end of the year, to ask those at the top \nto do more of their fair share. So that is being addressed. We go on \ndown to the Recovery Act, which was so important to be able to try to \nfocus on the middle class and get things going again. We did have some \nsuccess with this. Then the other piece, the 30 percent of what is \nhappening right now is the economic downturn.\n\n  So as we go forward today, even though we have addressed the high-end \ntax cuts, the wars ending, we no longer see the rescue-and-recovery \nmeasures. The economy is still 30 percent of our deficit. Frankly, we \nwill never get out of debt with 12 million people out of work, which is \nwhy we, as Democrats, have made sure we are front and center focused on \njobs and the economy in this budget.\n  We have to create opportunities for jobs for small businesses, for \nmanufacturers, for the private sector, for entrepreneurs to be able to \nbe successful so we have strong economic growth while we are putting \nforward a balanced budget. That is what we are attempting to do. That \nimpacts what we do in this budget.\n  In fact, the efforts we put together--we know what happened when the \nPresident came in: 700,000 jobs a month being lost, the banks and \nfinancial markets in big trouble. We all know the story of what \nhappened and what the President walked into on day one. But we have \nbeen focused on supporting an economic growth structure that would \ncreate jobs, create jobs. We are seeing that turnaround from the lost \ndecade of jobs. We saw certainly in manufacturing huge job losses from \n2001 on up to 2008. We know what happened with the automobile industry, \nwhich, by the way, because of our rescue efforts and support for them, \nis roaring back now and creating jobs. By the way, tremendous private \nsector investment is coming into the city of Detroit. The private \nsector is helping us turn that around. We are very proud of that. We \nare also seeing now jobs being created. As fast as we want? No. But we \nunderstand we have to focus on these numbers, which is creating jobs, \nif we are going to, in fact, get out of the deficit hole.\n  We have to reduce the deficit if our country is going to be more \ncompetitive, and we have to grow more jobs. We have to create \nopportunities for middle-class families. We know we need progrowth \npolicies such as the ones in our budget that focus on innovation, \neducation, rebuilding America through infrastructure, whether it is our \ncourts, whether it is our roads or rails or water and sewer projects or \nwhat we do on technology. To compete we have to build, and we have to \nfocus on what will create jobs.\n  We are now at a spot where we know if we focus, as we are in our \nbudget, on growing the economy from the middle out rather than the top \ndown, based on what was done in the 1990s when we did that, when we \nbalanced the budget in the right way by investing in the future, \ninvesting in education, investing in innovation, and then also making \nsmart cuts to balance that out, we balanced the budget. We had 22 \nmillion jobs that were created.\n\n[[Page S1998]]\n\n  That is what this budget does again. It is focused on those policies \nthat worked, not just debate back and forth in theory, but policies \nthat actually worked in the 1990s to balance the budget, to grow the \neconomy. We saw the policies being advocated by our friends on the \nother side. We did that already. We did that 2001 to 2008.\n  I do not know about anybody else, but I know people in Michigan do \nnot want to relive that. That was not our idea of economic growth. It \ncertainly did not balance the budget. It put us in the largest deficit \nin the history of the country.\n  So the budget in the House says: Boy, if you liked 2001 to 2008, you \nare going to love this. Two million jobs next year alone are lost in \nthe Ryan Republican budget. And similar policies are being advocated by \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  Let me just take a moment; I see my colleague, Senator Reed from \nRhode Island, is here, who I know wants to be a part of this and is \nsuch an important voice. But let me just say a couple of things. We \nunderstand we need to make smart spending reductions in order to \nbalance the budget. In fact, we have already started doing that. One of \nthe things which is so frustrating to me is to hear colleagues talk \nabout spending cuts without acknowledging what we have done for the \nlast 2 years. So we already know we have put ourselves on a path for \n$2.4 trillion in deficit reduction. And 70 percent of that has come out \nof services for the middle class, the most vulnerable. It has been cuts \nin spending for things that would actually grow the economy, innovation \nand research.\n  I am desperately concerned as chair of the Agriculture Committee \nbecause we have seen agricultural research decimated around issues of \nfood safety and pest and disease management and other critical things, \non invasive species, that we may not feel right away but are things \nthat will affect our future. So we have already seen major cuts.\n  At the end of the year a small amount of money, 30 percent of the \ndeficit reduction, was done. We have actually been asking those at the \nvery top, who have the most benefits from the tax cuts, the most \nbenefits from the efforts to rescue Wall Street, the most benefits in \ngeneral, just to do a little bit more--30 percent of what we have \nalready done. So what we have said is that going forward, the final \namount we need to do, between the $2.4 and $4 trillion, we are \ninsisting that be done in a balanced way and not one more time to come \nback on the middle class who have already had the brunt of the \nsacrifice, the brunt of the cuts. It is not fair.\n  So we have replaced across-the-board cuts. We have had colleagues in \nthe last few days complaining about the sequester cuts. Please vote for \nthis budget. It stops those across-the-board cuts and puts something in \nthat is much more common sense.\n  Those across-the-board cuts would cut 750,000 jobs this year alone. \nWhen you add what the Ryan Republican budget would do in the House, \nthat is another 2 million jobs next year. It is a jobs killer.\n  What we are saying is replace it with a responsible, balanced \napproach. That is what we need to do, but it does it in a way that sets \npriorities.\n  The House says spending cuts again. This is predominantly education, \ninnovation, construction. They also include eliminating Medicare. There \nis no way our majority will support this policy.\n  There is a whole range of things that hit the middle class, seniors, \nveterans, and vulnerable citizens. We say our cuts will be different. \nWe are willing to make priorities and smart cuts on the direct spending \nside, but there is a whole range of things we can do in the special \ninterest deals and Tax Code for the other half.\n  I totally reject the idea which has been put forward here so far \ntoday that our budget somehow raises taxes on the middle class. That is \nabsolutely false. We have report after report after report which \nindicate by closing loopholes which are sending jobs overseas, cutting \nsubsidies that aren't needed anymore, such as the top five wealthiest \ncompanies in the world, the top five oil companies--there are trillions \nof dollars in savings. Do this by cutting things that aren't necessary \nand are special deals in the Tax Code. We say half of the amount \nneeded, yes, should come from there.\n  On the other side of the building, what we see is a very different \npicture. The Ryan Republican budget, when they look at their tax cuts, \n55 percent of what we are doing in tax cuts goes to the top 1 percent. \nI feel this is Groundhog Day over and over. It is the same thing we \nhave heard over and over. Give it to the top, it will trickle down. We \ndid that. It did not trickle down. At least it didn't hit Michigan.\n  This budget does it over and over. Two-thirds of what they do in the \nHouse goes to the top 5 percent of taxpayers. What is left for middle-\nclass families? We say something very different to grow the economy. We \nsay we need in a global economy to outeducate, outinnovate, and \noutbuild. The President has said that over and over and our budget \ninvests in those things that allow us to compete, grow the middle \nclass, and create jobs while doing what we need to do to make smart, \ncommonsense decisions on spending in the Federal Government.\n  Here is what I am worried about. Right now, when we look at U.S. \ninvesting in research and development, compared to what is happening \naround the world, the greatest country in the world, the United States \nof America, is down. We are losing ground on investments while \neverybody else races to be like America--everybody else. China wants to \nbe like us and have a middle class. They are investing in innovation. \nWe see proposal after proposal after proposal to cut our ability to \ncompete for the future. This is why the Senate budget prioritizes \nresearch and development by replacing the devastating across-the-board \ncuts with a balanced and responsible approach which preserves $10 \nbillion in R funding every year and for the future.\n  We continue support for medical research, one of the areas where we \nare the leader. We strengthen the National Institutes of Health. We \nhave increased investments in renewable energy technology. There are so \nmany opportunities for us. I am very proud today Michigan is No. 1 in \nnew clean energy patents, and new ideas are coming. It is part of the \neconomic engine which is bringing jobs back to Michigan.\n  Investing in our 21st century manufacturing sector is also here. \nSenator Baldwin put forward a proposal on manufacturing hubs which I \nstrongly support. Other colleagues, Senator Coons and others, have \nsupported the manufacturing extension partnership to help small \nmanufacturers as well.\n  We are also investing in exports and opening markets abroad. We know \nwhen American companies are able to increase their exports by $1 \nbillion, they create 5,000 new jobs.\n  In infrastructure, we need roads and bridges. The chair of our \ncommittee is a strong advocate for ports as well in the global economy, \nbeing able to export and import. That investment in rebuilding America \nis in this budget. The American Society of Civil Engineers just \nreleased their report card, and they gave America a D-plus. We are not \ngoing to outcompete the world with a D-plus on infrastructure.\n  This budget makes historic investments in our workforce. We know from \nhearing from CEOs that workforce development education is absolutely \nkey to our future.\n  Before asking my colleague from Rhode Island to join in this \ndiscussion as well on jobs--I speak as the chair of the Agriculture \nCommittee--I thank the chair for including in our efforts creating a 5-\nyear farm bill, which not only participates in deficit reduction of $23 \nbillion but is twice what we would be required to do under \nsequestration.\n  The farm bill is a jobs bill. I don't know of any other bill that has \nan impact on 16 million jobs in this country. The farm bill does. It \nsupports agriculture and rural America. The farm bill is a part of this \neffort.\n  My colleague from Rhode Island is deeply involved in efforts to \ncreate jobs, balance the budget, and reduce the deficit. I ask \nunanimous consent I be permitted to join in a colloquy with Senator \nReed at this point. He has been a champion in job creation, and I am \nvery grateful he came tonight to join us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. I want to thank the Senator from Michigan for allowing me \nto participate in this colloquy. I also\n\n[[Page S1999]]\n\ncommend her for a thoughtful, insightful, and extremely compelling \nargument about creating jobs as a way not only to give people a chance \nto rise in the middle class but also to accomplish our other objective, \nwhich is ultimately to reduce the deficit.\n  As the Senator pointed out, when I was here with her in the late \n1990s, we reached the point where we had a projected surplus of perhaps \n$5 trillion over 10 years. She has catalogued the way in which that \nsurplus has been eroded. What we need to do is focus, as she suggests, \non the urgent need to create jobs and ensure our Nation's budget makes \ninvestments in growing and strengthening the middle class. We are all \nhere as beneficiaries of the programs and policies of the 1950s, 1960s, \nand 1970s, which consciously built the middle class and invested in us. \nOur parents invested in us. We need to do the same thing. She is \nabsolutely correct, the investments we are proposing in this Democratic \nbudget will be critical not only to individual success but to our \nsuccess as an economy, and as a global competitor. I thank her for her \nwords.\n  I am here to join her to address this pressing need to create jobs, \nto strengthen the economic recovery, and to underscore the vast \ndifferences between the proposal we are making, and the budget proposed \nby the House of Representatives, by our Republican colleagues.\n  Let me state what is a very disturbing figure. There are 12 million \nunemployed Americans, with 4.8 million of these individuals unemployed \nfor more than 6 months. We are seeing unprecedented levels of long-term \nunemployment. Americans are struggling to stay in their homes, put \ntheir children through school and put food on their table.\n\n  In my State we are unfortunately among the top States in a category \nno one wants to be leading, and that is unemployment. The harsh reality \nof what we are facing in Rhode Island was brought home with a stunning \narticle in last Sunday's Washington Post. It noted some 180,000 Rhode \nIslanders, over 15 percent of our population, receive SNAP benefits, \nsupplemental nutrition assistance program benefits. Some are receiving \nSNAP because they don't have jobs, although they have looked from month \nto month to month. Some have jobs, but the pay is so little they \nqualify under the income limits of the SNAP program.\n  I want to particularly thank the Senator from Michigan for her \nvaliant efforts to increase SNAP funding. Literally we are talking \nabout putting food on people's tables. Fifteen percent of my State of \nRhode Island depends on food support to have a healthy diet for them \nand particularly for their children.\n  When we talk about what we want to do with the budget, it is about \ngetting people back to work. That is what they want. They don't want a \nSNAP benefit. They want good jobs. They want the same opportunities, \nfrom which we benefited, which helped build a strong middle class. What \nis their greatest fear? Not just falling out of the middle class, but \nthat their children won't even have a remote chance of middle-class \nincome or a middle-class lifestyle, those opportunities which we in our \nday took almost for granted. We must turn things around.\n  As the Senator pointed out, the Republican policy is focused on \ncutting taxes for the very wealthy. This policy has been demonstrated \nover the last decade to not produce good-paying jobs for middle-income \nAmericans. However, it does produce very substantial benefits for the \nwealthiest of Americans.\n\n       That is not the way to grow a country. That is not what \n     many people today and through our history have sacrificed \n     their lives for. They are not out there serving in \n     Afghanistan and other places so those who have much could \n     have more. It is so those who have very little would have a \n     chance, at least a chance. This is what we are talking about \n     behind all the numbers. We are talking about investing in \n     America. We need to make that investment.\n\n  The other side of the aisle indulges in what I believe is a fallacy: \nThe only way of fixing the economy is cutting the deficit. But, instead \nof focusing exclusively on deficit reduction in the near term, we need \nto pass legislation which will put people back to work, give them a \njob, give them hope, and give them an opportunity, give them a sense \nthey can make their lives and their children's lives much better.\n  The Democrats have proposed a series of initiatives over the last \nseveral years to do just that, such as tax incentives for small \nbusiness to hire people, repairing schools, roads, bridges, or tax \nbreaks for low- and middle-income Americans so they may have a little \nbit more in their paychecks. We have tried to pass these measures but \nhave been frustrated consistently, even though we have the majority, \nbecause of filibusters and procedural delays. The American people \nunderstand that we need to create jobs. They want us to act. They want \nus to act to their benefit, not for the very few but for the majority \nof Americans.\n  The other approach Republicans espouse is hand-in-hand with this \nnotion of tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans is that austerity \nthrough spending cuts can grow the economy. That you can cut programs, \ncut everything, and that will grow the economy.\n  That is not reality. What we see and what history suggests, when you \nare cutting during an economic recovery, you are basically \ncounteracting the recovery. You are contracting economic expansion. You \nare not adding to the momentum of growth, you are subtracting from the \ngrowth.\n  If you want a current example, look across the ocean to Europe and \nGreat Britain. They embarked upon an austerity program several years \nago. Most commentators suggest they are in worse shape today than they \nwere 3 or 4 years ago when they started this austerity program. This is \nthe result of cutting, cutting, cutting. If we proceed down that \npathway, we will be in worse shape several years from now than we are \ntoday. We can be in better shape by investing in our future and by \ncreating jobs.\n  Another aspect of this too is it is not only the question of \nfilibustering our proposals to create jobs--but that we know in August \n2011 there was a real threat to undermine the full faith and credit of \nthe United States, to refuse for the first time in modern history to \nincrease the debt ceiling, to pay the debts which we owed. And the \nmajority of those debts, at least the much of the recent ones, resulted \nfrom the previous administration. And so the debt ceiling crisis \ntriggered the whole process which has led us today to sequestration. \nNow Americans will have to suffer through sequestration. The \nCongressional Budget Office has already said if we don't reverse \nsequestration, we will lose 750,000 jobs. Those are the jobs middle-\nincome Americans are expecting and hoping for. We are losing about .6 \npercent of growth. We will be headed where our friends across the ocean \nare headed, not expanding but contracting; not increasing employment \nbut decreasing employment. We are worse off because of these austere \npolicies, not better off.\n  What the Democratic budget does--and my colleague from Michigan has \noutlined it very well and with great articulation, that the way you \nshould deal with these issues is through a balanced approach--a balance \nof revenue and spending cuts which will not harm our economy. That is \nwhat we did in 1993 and 1994 when I was a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives. President Clinton came to us and said: Here it is, we \nare going to cut spending and we are going to raise revenue. And we \npassed it by one vote in the House, one vote in the Senate--not one \nRepublican vote, but still by one vote here and one vote in the House \nof Representatives. That set the stage for the later efforts that \nfinally led not only to a balanced budget but to a surplus, and that is \nthe approach we have to adopt today. It's an approach that works.\n\n  The Republican budget calls for a total of $4.6 trillion in cuts and \nwould leave the sequester in place. So it would compound the damage of \nthe sequester. The Republican budget has also been estimated to provide \nmillionaires an average tax cut of $400,000. Once again, the big \nwinners in this proposal are the wealthiest Americans, not those who \nare struggling to put food on the table, to get a job, to see their \nchildren have a better future. And, again, the Republican budget \nrefuses to responsibly address the $1 trillion sequester. They provide \nnearly $6 trillion in tax cuts that, again, overwhelmingly benefit the \nwealthiest Americans, but don't address the $1 trillion sequester. So \nessentially their\n\n[[Page S2000]]\n\nbudget is compounding the difficulties we have in growing this economy \nand creating jobs.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I wonder if my colleague would allow me to ask a \nquestion.\n  Mr. REED. I will be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Did I hear correctly that the Republican budget would \ngive an average of $400,000 in additional tax cuts?\n  Mr. REED. Those are the estimates I have received, and I believe they \nare reliable. Many commentators have looked at the budget and concluded \nthat this represents a remarkable reduction in taxes for the wealthiest \nAmericans.\n  And once again, it shouldn't come as a surprise because, as we \nrecall--and I was here in 2001, when I voted against the Bush tax \ncuts--the mantra back then was that they are the job creators; just cut \nthose taxes and those jobs will grow. But we saw during the Bush \nadministration one of the poorest private job creation records of any \nPresident since World War II. And here Republicans are repeating the \nsame line, as they say, deja vu all over again: Cut the taxes, and \nmagically the jobs will grow. But, you grow jobs by having a balanced \napproach and through investment in human capital and physical capital, \nsuch as roads and bridges, and also by having the revenue to be \nresponsible so you pay your way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank my colleague, the distinguished Senator from \nRhode Island. When I think of him, I think of his advocacy for our men \nand women who make up our troops--and I know our budget chair as well--\nand his strong leadership on veterans issues.\n  I think about $400,000 being an average tax cut for a \nmultimillionaire under this budget versus what will happen to our \nveterans or folks coming home from the war and now trying to get a job, \ntrying to do what they need to do to get back into the community and \nsociety and so on, and I wonder--the Senator has been such a leader on \nthis and, of course, has experience with his own distinguished career \nin the military--if he might speak about those issues, his own \nexperience with people coming home. Are they getting the $400,000 tax \ncut?\n  Mr. REED. Well, no. In fact, there was a front page story today, I \nbelieve, in one of the major newspapers declaring the fact that they \nare home from the battlefront and are now in the unemployment line. So \nwe are seeing a remarkable number of veterans who are unemployed. And \nthese are men and women in their twenties. They certainly want to work. \nThey worked very hard defending this country, yet now they are coming \nhome and have significant levels of unemployment.\n  That is one of the real problems, as well as our need and our \nobligation to support veterans health care, particularly mental health \ncare, to support the Veterans' Administration.\n  The irony, of course, is that we are seeing even higher levels of \nunemployment, in some cases, among young veterans than we are in the \npopulation at large. That is particularly bitter and ironic for those \npeople who have served and sacrificed and are continuing to serve and \nsacrifice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan should be aware that \nher time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Might I ask through the Chair if we could have a few \nmore moments.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to yield more time, and I really appreciate \nboth Senators talking about one of the really important aspects of our \nbudget; that is, how critical it is to invest in jobs and the economy, \nwhich the American public knows and understands are the biggest \nchallenges facing all of us today. And you don't do that with the \npromise of just tax cuts for the wealthy.\n  We know trickle-down doesn't work. We all saw what happened from 2001 \nto 2008 when we gave away the tax cuts. Here we are today, now having \nto deal with the deficit. We all remember what happened during the \nClinton administration when we had a balanced package that had both \ninvestments and responsible revenue and what happened in that decade \nwhen our economy rebounded and we got to a surplus and people felt \nstrong again.\n  So that is what our budget is based upon, and I would be happy to \nyield additional time to both Senators to talk about this critical \naspect of our budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators from Michigan and Rhode Island \nare recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Senator.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would simply, first of all, again thank our chair, \nwho understands and gets this, not only about how to grow the economy \nand the middle class and in a commonsense way to balance the budget, \nbut she has been such a leader on veterans issues and reminds us every \nday about those coming home and what they need, as does Senator Reed as \nwell, with his own service as well as his efforts with regard to our \nveterans.\n  I would be happy to defer to Senator Reed, if he has additional \ncomments. I didn't mean to interrupt him before. If he has additional \ncomments to make, I would certainly allow for that, and then I would be \nhappy to wrap up at some point.\n  Mr. REED. I would like to reemphasize the point the Senator from \nMichigan has made and Senator Murray has made, which is that we have \nbeen down this road before. We can't simply cut taxes for the \nwealthiest Americans to magically create jobs. What it produced in \nreality was a huge deficit, along with two unfunded wars. But that \nseems to be the message again from the other side--let's just cut taxes \nand then, of course, cut spending too. That is not the balanced \napproach we need in the Nation. That is not the balanced approach that \nin the 1990s, as my colleague pointed out, got us to a surplus, got us \nto a sense that we were really moving forward and that the middle class \nhad a chance, that their children would have a better life. And that is \nwhat we have to do again.\n\n  When I look at my State of Rhode Island, I can cite a myriad of \nexamples of the harm that would be caused by the Republican budget. The \nbudget they are proposing, which leaves the sequester in place would \nresult in about a $4.5 million cut in Federal support for our public \nschools. I can tell you that every city and town in Rhode Island is \nstruggling just to keep the lights on. If they lose $4.5 million of \nFederal aid, that is going to make it even harder. And do you know what \nhappens? Well, guess what happens to property taxes. They go up. And \nnot just Rhode Island, all across the country because one of the \nironies here is that every mayor understands that ultimately they have \nto balance their budgets, and so they will raise taxes and they will \ncut spending. But they will do it, hopefully, in a balanced way, \nsimilar to what we are espousing in our approach to the budget.\n  Now, we also have a situation where, if we look at the Republican \nbudget, there are all sorts of abstract cuts--nondiscretionary domestic \nspending, et cetera--that translates into real harm, and that affects \nreal lives. For example, there is an estimated $3.3 trillion in cuts to \nprograms that benefit low- and middle-income Americans. Of that $3.3 \ntrillion, $2.6 trillion are cuts to Medicaid and subsidies that help \nmodest-income American families across the country to get health \ninsurance. As I mentioned before, there is a projection--and the \nSenator is an authorizer for this program--of $135 billion being taken \nout of the SNAP program.\n  Again, let me go back to last Sunday's Washington Post story. Fifteen \npercent of the people in Rhode Island depend on this to help them get \njust adequate nutrition including children--and we are going to cut \n$135 billion out of this? And on the other side of the spectrum, we are \ngiving a $400,000 tax cut or more to the wealthiest Americans? That is \nnot fair, and it is not good economics. We can't have a generation of \nchildren who have been deprived of good nutrition, who have been \ndeprived of good housing; if we do, we are not going to have the \nproductive workers who will lead this Nation forward in this century \nand beyond. These spending cuts and tax breaks for the wealthiest \nAmericans just do not make any sense. It doesn't balance the books, and \nit doesn't keep our obligation to the majority of Americans to give \nthem a fighting chance.\n  Our budget, in contrast, has $100 billion in projects to put \nAmericans to work and repair the worst of our crumbling bridges and \nroads. There is not\n\n[[Page S2001]]\n\none of our colleagues who can't find some 20 or even more bridges in \ntheir State that require repair right away, and that would put hundreds \nof people to work productively and would increase the economic \nefficiency of our Nation.\n  Let me give an example. We had a major portion of I-95, the north-\nsouth road in Rhode Island--north-south right past Providence-\nPawtucket, RI. for several years being rebuilt. The good news is that \nit is being rebuilt, but before we could rebuild, we had to divert \ntruck traffic, which meant they couldn't efficiently deliver their \nloads. We had to station State police 24 hours a day to prevent the \ntrucks from going there. So we had to engage all those individual law \nenforcement officers because the bridge couldn't support basic travel. \nWe are now close to completing the whole project so we should no longer \nhave to have State troopers out there 24 hours a day, and truckers no \nlonger have to take a 20-mile detour to deliver their loads. When we \ntalk about infrastructure, we are talking about economic efficiency as \nwell as putting people to work. The Democratic budget does this.\n  I think we have also made very difficult choices--tough choices--in \nmaking sure that we are paying our way, that we are paying down the \ndeficit and doing it in a way that doesn't cost us the recovery and \ncreating the jobs we need right away.\n  I commend Chairman Murray because she has done a remarkable job of \nshepherding this bill through, of balancing so many complicated issues \nand making sure we have kept faith with the Americans who sent us here. \nThey just want a chance. They just want to be able to think that their \nchild is going to have a better life than they have had. I think this \nbudget goes much further than our colleagues' to give them that chance, \nto give them that hope, and to give them that opportunity.\n  With that, I yield back to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island again for his \ncomments, his leadership, his advocacy for our military men and women \nand our veterans, and for the economy, for people who need help. As he \nsaid, there are a lot of people on the edge right now trying to just \nhold on, to stay in the middle class, or trying to get in the middle \nclass, and our budget is for them. It is about growing the economy from \nthe middle out.\n  What makes us different from other countries around the world is that \nwe don't have just a few very rich people and a lot of poor people. We \nhave had a robust middle class. People in Michigan feel that eroding \nevery day, so we need to be laser-focused on making sure we keep that \nstrong middle class that not only grows the economy but creates \nopportunity for young people to grow up and go to college, to dream big \ndreams and know that in America they can succeed and be whatever they \nwant to be, that they have a shot. That is the American dream, and that \nis what we are fighting for.\n  Our budget, bottom line, strengthens the middle class. It creates \nopportunities for people to work hard no matter where they live, what \ntheir background is, so they have a shot at making it. We believe that \nto our core.\n  The Republican budget is represented by the House budget, and the \nproposals here on the floor on the Republican side are geared to the \nwealthy and the well-connected, the special interests of this country, \nto keep their special deals going. Let's try trickle-down economics one \nmore time. It didn't work from 2001 to 2008. We lost 5 million \nmanufacturing jobs. But, hey, why not try it again? Well, we say no, \nlet's use something that has worked.\n  So let me in conclusion say again that the Republican tax cuts \nrepresented by the Ryan budget--55 percent of the benefit goes to the \ntop 1 percent. As my friend the Senator from Rhode Island indicated, \nthose at the very, very top are getting $400,000 in a tax cut, and \n$400,000 is more than the vast majority of Americans and certainly the \nvast majority of people in Michigan make in a year. Can we afford to do \nthat? Is that the right priority?\n  I find it so interesting that we had a colleague speaking \npassionately for the past couple of days now about his concern about \nclosing airports in rural areas. I have those concerns about closing \nrural airports. Well, our budget doesn't do that. Our budget invests in \ninfrastructure and keeps those open, as opposed to the across-the-board \ncuts that have been objected to by the Senators trying to make changes \nin the budget this year and the Ryan Republican budget in the House.\n  We believe strongly that we should build a budget in the future on \nwhat has worked in America, and what has worked is strengthening \nAmerica with investments so we can out-educate, out-innovate and out-\nbuild to win in a global economy. That is what this is about.\n  Our businesses tell us they are concerned about getting the right \nworkers for the right jobs. It is a major issue right now. That is \nsomething we have a responsibility to be a part of.\n\n  The Democratic budget invests in education, invests in innovation, \nand invests in building for the future. I worry every day about this \nkind of a chart that shows that the United States of America--not a \nthird world country--is investing less in research and development than \ncompetitors around the world. It makes no sense. The innovations are \nhere. The smart scientists are here. The cutting-edge technology is \nhere. And we need to keep it here. Our budget places a huge value on \nit.\n  Then, finally, it is all about jobs and making sure when we figure \nout and when we look at how to balance a budget, that we understand we \nwill never balance a budget with more than 12 million people out of \nwork. We have to focus on jobs and growing the economy. We have to.\n  Thirty percent of our deficit right now as we look at this going \nforward is in the slow economic recovery. We know it was bad prior to \n2009 when President Obama was elected. It has gotten better, but it is \nnot where it needs to be. And it won't be where it needs to be unless \nwe invest in innovation, in education, and rebuilding America's \ninfrastructure. That is what we do. This budget makes sense. This \nbudget is for middle-class families all across America.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to be with \nour colleague, Senator Stabenow, who serves on the Budget Committee.\n  Just briefly, and then I would yield to Senator Roberts, President \nObama, on March 13 of this year, said:\n\n       And so--you know, my goal is not to chase a balanced budget \n     for the sake of balance.\n\n  Now, my colleagues--and we have been counting--so far have used the \nword ``balanced'' at least 14, maybe 15 times already. They use the \nword ``balance,'' but their budget comes nowhere close to balancing. It \nnever balances. It has no potential to balance. It is focused on \nspending and more taxes, not balancing the budget.\n  Senator Reid said: We want to pay down the debt. There is no plan \nwhatsoever to get our deficit to zero so we can begin to pay down debt.\n  I believe Senator Stabenow used the phrase, ``a commonsense way to \nbalance a budget.'' There is no plan to balance the budget. Let's be \nhonest. Those words can be said repeatedly, over and over, but I really \ncan't hear them. What I hear is the budget document itself, and it \nsays: I am not balanced, I will never balance, and that is a fact.\n  It is great to have Senator Roberts of Kansas here, and I yield to \nSenator Roberts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the \nranking member of the Budget Committee, the fully declared champion of \nfiscal responsibility, defender of hard-pressed taxpayers all across \nthe country, doing a splendid job here as a Senator who actually asked \nto be on the Budget Committee to try to meet these challenges, and I \ncredit him for his leadership and example.\n  I rise today to speak on my Democratic colleagues' proposed budget \nresolution upon which they have just been waxing poetic before the \nSenate. I have mixed feelings about this budget. I have mixed feelings \neven being here on the Senate floor in that I am bereft of charts. What \non Earth am I going to do making comments about this budget\n\n[[Page S2002]]\n\nwithout the appropriate charts? Everybody has charts. Look at these \nstands around here.\n  My colleagues across the aisle--who have now left the Chamber since I \nbegan speaking--have displayed charts. I wonder if the Parliamentarian \ncould inform this speaker if we could turn off the lights and I have a \nPowerPoint and a laser pointer?\n  I will not ask that.\n  But I don't have a chart. I just have some remarks that I would like \nto put together about the challenge we all face. I am pleased, \neverybody is pleased, finally, that the Senate has again, finally, \ntaken up its constitutional responsibility to consider a budget in \nregular order--or at least some framework of regular order. However, I \nhave the temerity to suggest that after 4 years, this budget resolution \ndoes not cut the spending muster and, from a constitutional \nresponsibility, I fear it has indeed been very irresponsible.\n  At the same time, I look at this budget and I ask: Is this all we \nwaited for these past 4 years? In the words of the famous song, ``Is \nThat All There Is?'' Or better put, is this more than all there is? And \nit certainly is more.\n  There is an old saying that if you want to be remembered by your \nchildren, leave a lot of debt. Well, if this budget is passed and it \nsticks, then there are going to be a whole lot of people who vote yes \nwho will certainly be remembered.\n  The solution was, indeed, to return to regular order, return to the \nregular process: Examine the President's budget, pass a budget \nresolution, and provide clear directives to the authorizing and \nappropriations committees to develop legislation to reflect the tough \ndecisions made in the budget. A lot of words. None of it is very easy, \nbut that is called regular order. That is what we should have been \ndoing the last 4 years. We have not been doing that. We haven't been \ndoing that at all.\n  Everybody knows the process around here. What happens is we have a \nmajor bill to do, we have our obligations to do, we have our \nconstitutional responsibilities to do. We try that. We ask for \namendments; we don't get amendments. We file cloture, they don't get 60 \nvotes, and the bill fails. Or we have a continuing resolution, some \ngiant body of legislation that is the worst way to do business--or a \nsequester, the same kind of thing. And people back home scratch their \nheads. People on that side of the aisle perhaps have an issue--not a \nbill, but they might have an issue. Then the blame game starts. I think \nthe American people are tired of it.\n  None of it is easy. I understand that. But it works much better, much \nbetter than lurching from crisis to crisis as we have done and \nexperienced in the last 4 years.\n  So I am pleased that we are slowly returning to some aspects of \nregular order, but I remain deeply concerned about the daunting fiscal \nchallenges we face and the fact that we are not answering \nthese challenges. The Federal balance sheet is now truly frightening.\n\n  Today, almost 1,500 days since we last considered a budget resolution \non this Senate floor, we are fast approaching $17 trillion in debt--and \nbeyond. It is climbing. Our per-person share of that debt is now more \nthan $53,000. This is why I am so frustrated, and many of our \ncolleagues are frustrated and disappointed by the budget resolution we \nare about to consider.\n  Yes, again, we have brought this resolution through regular order. I \nappreciate that. But the recommendations fail. They fail to begin to \nmeaningfully address the key fiscal issues that we are all generally \nagreed are sustainable.\n  I don't have a chart, but I think people can understand this. The \nnumbers are startling.\n  Since 2009 we have added nearly $6 trillion to the national debt. \nUnder the proposed budget resolution, despite a massive new tax hike \nproposal, new debt will rise--since I don't have a chart, just sort of \nimagine it here--$7 trillion over 10 years. I hasten to add, that is on \na projection by the Congressional Budget Office, and I think it is \nprobably low.\n  Spending will increase another $645 billion above the projected \ngrowth over 10 years, including $162 billion in the next year alone.\n  The deficit will increase in the next fiscal year by $95 billion \nabove current forecasts.\n  I could have a chart with a big zero on it. It is not a soft drink. \nThis is something pretty serious. Zero. That is right, zero--zero real \ndeficit reduction through spending reductions. It would never and \ndoesn't pretend to try to balance the budget--precisely what the \nSenator from Alabama has been pointing out. In my view, this resolution \nwould further damage our fiscal condition over the long haul, exactly \nwhat we don't want to do.\n  We do not want to kick the can down the road any further. We can't do \nit. We have reached that point of no return. And here is the kicker for \nme. The budget resolution includes a proposed $1.5 trillion in new \ntaxes. That is on top of the $600 billion tax hike that was just \nenacted in January. This would include a $923 billion reconciliation \ninstruction to the Finance Committee. I am a member of that very \nprestigious committee. I look forward to trying to achieve tax reform, \nbut I worry about a $923 billion reconciliation despite the negative \nimpact this would have on critically needed progrowth tax reform.\n  The budget also includes about $500 billion in unspecified loophole \nclosers to increase spending on infrastructure and to replace the \ncurrent sequester.\n  Loopholes. Loophole closures. Boy, is that in the eyes of the \nbeholder. I am concerned about it. No doubt the Gatling gun kind of \ncriticisms we heard in the past campaign, singling out tax reform \ntargets--and I always want to add, you always want to worry about what \nlurks under the banner of reform of whatever banner someone is waving.\n  Time after time I heard the President talk about fat cat corporate \njets. Boy, am I tired of hearing about that. That is business aviation. \nThat is 1 million jobs. That is a great number of aircraft that is \nadding to our exports. The President has said: Let's double our \nexports, and still we hear this pejorative of fat cat corporate jets. \nAlso, oil and gas subsidies, two major industries of Kansas, even those \nare critical, successful industries with all the hallmarks we should \nwant in an industry--good, high-tech paying jobs.\n  Sure I am for tax reform, and sure I want to reach the specified \nnumbers that we could all agree on--if we could all agree on a \nspecified number. But policy counts, and you don't want to do anything \nterribly counterproductive. The call for a gigantic tax hike to pay for \nmore spending is misguided and will harm our chances for tax reform. It \nwill do little to place our budget on any sustainable path. Not only \nthat, this budget is a job killer.\n  The Tax Foundation analysis I just read today indicates the \nlegislation in its current form will result in the loss of 800,000 jobs \nover 10 years. It is a job killer.\n  Why on Earth would we be considering a budget resolution that will \nresult in the loss of 800,000 jobs? In Kansas, that hit would be about \n10,000 jobs. That is low. I have no doubt this number understates that \nproblem.\n  We all know the time is long past for us to reform our overly \ncomplex, costly, anticompetitive tax system. That is a given. We know \nthat. I might add that the Finance Committee, under the chairmanship of \nMax Baucus and the ranking member's leadership, Orrin Hatch--all of us \non the Finance Committee have been meeting as Republicans and Democrats \ntogether. We can do this job. Give us 6 months to do it right. Give us \na flashing light at the end of the room saying ``Do No Harm,'' and we \ncan get this done.\n  The current system is a drain on individual and business resources. \nIt is one of the main causes of our sluggish economic growth.\n  We need to put in place a Tax Code for the 21st century, one that \nrecognizes the nature of the international trade system in which we \ncompete--and there is competition--and one that recognizes the changes \nto our domestic business environment. We also need to lower corporate \nrates so the United States no longer has the highest rate in the \ndeveloped world.\n  It is critical that Congress encourage economic growth and private \nsector job creation by putting in place a tax system that is simpler \nand fairer to all taxpayers, a tax system that doesn't change every \nyear or two, one that provides certainty. We need to provide certainty \nby establishing a permanent\n\n[[Page S2003]]\n\nTax Code that will allow families to plan for their future and give \nbusinesses the confidence to expand and create jobs.\n  Adopting a fair and simple tax system that lowers marginal rates, \nencourages economic growth, promotes our competitiveness, and eases \ncompliance--read regulatory reform, read a Katrina of regulations that \nnow affects virtually every business endeavor in the country, read all \nthat--that is the most powerful step we can take to improve our \neconomy.\n  While I support considering a budget through regular order--thank \ngoodness we are finally achieving that--we are presented with a \nprofoundly disappointing document, a budget that includes a massive \njob-killing tax increase, increases spending, raises the deficit and \ndebt, and all but kills prospects for tax reform--just what the doctor \ndid not order.\n  After 4 years of deliberate inaction, my colleagues and I had hoped \nfor better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Kansas. He is an excellent \nmember of the Finance Committee and he is experienced on these issues. \nI appreciate his insight. I would like to ask him a question.\n  He has noted this budget never ever balances. It doesn't come close \nto balancing. It has no intention of balancing. But we have been \ncounting, I say to Senator Roberts, and our Democratic colleagues who \nhave been promoting this budget have, I said earlier, about 14 times \nused the word ``balanced.'' Actually, already tonight they have used \nthe word ``balanced'' 23 times in reference to a budget that never \nbalances and never intends to balance.\n  I wonder if you thought that might reflect a guilty conscience on the \npart of those promoting this budget?\n  I am glad you will not be arrested for that device on the floor.\n  But I think it is pretty sad that we have such a use of that word.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Let me say, if I might, and I appreciate the question \nand I have talked to the Parliamentarian, when people inadvertently \nleave their cell phones on, but the call is from their wife, that is \nall right.\n  At any rate, balance? If I heard it once, I heard it at least 10 or \n15 times since I have been here and the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama has been here. Balance--it never balances in regard to the goal \nof actually balance the budget. We are talking about balance. But we \nare actually talking about redistribution. We are talking about \nbalance, but what we are actually talking about is a certain kind of \nclass warfare. When we are talking about balance, we are talking about \nmeans testing. We are talking about somebody in Washington on this \nfloor defining who is rich or who is not or who is just a little better \noff--maybe $250,000, maybe $200,000. Guess what. These taxes are going \nto hit the middle class, and they do not think it is balanced. I don't \nthink it is balanced, and I think it is out of whack.\n  If you are going to get something in balance, you ought to take a \nlook to see can we get the budget of the United States headed toward \nbalance and not use ``balance'' as a synonym for the proposed goals of \nsocial reform or whatever it is that you would like to accomplish under \nthe banner of tax reform.\n  We should use tax reform for taxes, not for any political purpose or \nfavoring one particular segment of the industry over another or, for \nthat matter, Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, food stamps, et \ncetera. Everything has to be considered, but everything has to be \nconsidered under the auspices of when are we going to live within our \nmeans? When are we going to achieve spending reductions, quit \novertaxing people, try to spur job growth? That budget resolution they \nare talking about on that side of the aisle--and I know they are very \nsincere, apparently, in their belief--doesn't feed the bulldog. It \ndoesn't answer the problem.\n  I got a little excited about that, but I think I am due that in \nregard to all the rhetoric we have heard from the other side. I \nappreciate the Senator's question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator. I note again the President said to \nGeorge Stephanopoulos, live, on March 13, ``And, so--you know, my goal \nis not to chase--a balanced budget just for the sake of balance.''\n  I am also pleased the distinguished ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, senior, actually, member of the Budget Committee on the \nRepublican side, Senator Chuck Grassley, who has been involved in these \nissues for many years and been a leader for many years, is with us.\n  I yield to Senator Grassley of Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I say to Senator Sessions, the \ndistinguished ranking member, I am going to try to show him and other \nMembers of the Senate that the numbers that they think they can raise \nrevenue from, to $1 trillion, are not going to work. We can take \ndifferent taxes and add them up and up and it will come out to $1 \ntrillion. But I am going to show him, based upon votes that have been \ntaken on the other side of the aisle, that it is not politically \npossible for them to do it unless they are willing to vote differently \nthan they have ever voted before because they have to take on some of \nthe most popular tax credits that are in the Tax Code. That is what I \nam going to do in the few minutes the Senator has devoted to me.\n  MR. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator and ask him to take as much time as \nhe chooses. But I note, as ranking member on the Finance Committee and \nhaving been on it and having dealt with these issues for many years, \nthe Senator knows what the political situation is and he has the staff \nto help him ascertain the correct numbers. I think this will be an \nimportant bit of information to share with us, and I look forward to \nit.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, over the 10 years that I was chairman or \nranking member of the Finance Committee, I worked with several Budget \nCommittee chairmen. They were Senator Domenici, Senator Nickles, \nSenator Gregg, Senator Conrad. We did not always agree on every issue, \nbut by and large there was coordination between the Budget Committee \nand the Finance Committee. Basically, I had past chairmen, Republican \nor Democratic, come to me and say: Tell us what you can do or not do \nwithin the Finance Committee so we do not give you an impossible task \nwhen a budget resolution is adopted by the Senate. It worked very well \nbecause they respected the institutionalized knowledge within the staff \nof the Senate Finance Committee, both Republican and Democratic staffs, \nas well as the more important institutionalized information that comes \nfrom the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  As I said, we did not always agree on every issue, but by and large \nthere was that coordination. Unfortunately, the coordination receded \nsomewhat, starting somewhat in the year 2007. Since 2010, we fell into \nthis 4-year pattern of not even having a budget debate in the Senate, \neven though the law requires that the Senate adopt a budget every year.\n  Finally, getting back to abiding by the law--coordination provided \nthe means then between the budget and Finance Committee that allowed \nthe Finance Committee to realistically address the demands of the tax, \ntrade, health and welfare policies that were intended by a budget \nresolution. This usually happened in a bipartisan way, but this year is \ndifferent. This budget resolution does not realistically address the \nneeds or the capabilities of the Finance Committee. By capabilities, I \ndon't mean it is not there to get it done and people are willing to do \nit, but the possibility of doing it is very remote based upon the \nunrealistic assumptions in this document.\n  Despite claims to the contrary, this budget is not balanced unless \none believes balance is more of the same fiscal behavior of the last 4 \nyears of the Senate Democratic leadership fiscal policy. That policy \nhas resulted in higher taxes, higher spending, and yet higher debt. \nWhere there is fiscal pressure, it is placed on the Finance Committee \nby this document now before the Senate. The Finance Committee is called \nupon to do all the heavy lifting.\n  The principal lift is in the heavy tax increases. The Finance \nCommittee has reconciled under this document with\n\n[[Page S2004]]\n\nan almost $1 trillion tax increase. Reserve funds, in addition to that \n$1 trillion, reserve funds anticipate another $500 billion in tax hikes \nto pay for even more spending.\n  The task put on the Finance Committee is described as curtailing or \neliminating what is called ``spending through the Tax Code,'' and \n``loopholes.'' But if we look at the document, and particularly if we \nlook at recent history, we will find a different story that says what \nthey assume is not very realistic.\n  We will find tax increases. I wish to explain that. But first I will \naccount for revenue raisers the majority party has specified and \nsupported with votes in this Congress and the last one. What those \nvotes show, unless there is a big change of heart on the other side of \nthe aisle, is there is not going to be that revenue ever raised. So \nthat makes the document on the other side, if it is not possible, blue \nsmoke and great hope and good luck.\n  What this is going to tell us is that the unspecified and undefined \ntax increases the budget resolution is seeking, once we have the \nundefined tax increases--I am going to then define that. I will define \nit by taking the universe of tax base broadeners and working through \nthe list to explain to all the unreality. I will be able to show one of \ntwo conclusions. The first conclusion I can show, the math doesn't work \nand there are not sufficient revenue raisers to fill the revenue goal \nof my friends on the other side of the aisle or, No. 2, the budget \nresolution would need to go much further down the income scale and do \nwhat we just heard Senator Roberts say, start taxing middle-income \ntaxpayers. But it is going to be hard to get them to admit that on the \nother side because all we have to do is tax the wealthy 1 percent and \nwe can solve all our problems.\n  But we cannot only tax that 1 percent. We could confiscate--not tax \nbut confiscate the income over $200,000 and we are going to run the \nGovernment for just a very few months. But people tend to believe that. \nIt is very difficult to preach the other side, how unrealistic it is, \nbut that is a fact.\n  All of us should take a careful look at the claims of the Democratic \nleadership and see how the claims stack up to the cold, hard numbers \nthat I will give you and the analysis by the tax-writing committee \nstaff. So let's turn to those numbers. Over the 10-year budget window \ngoing out to the year 2023, the budget resolution demands revenue and \nrelated outlay savings of $975 billion. There are two reserve funds, as \nI already said, that total up to about $580 billion in tax increases if \nthat is taxed. And around here, with the ability--the willingness--to \nspend what they want to spend, they wouldn't mind tapping it, but I \nthink that is unrealistic as well.\n\n  I am going to show my colleagues this chart. The first chart is a \nwater well. Here is the top of the well, and we can see it is a long \nwell to the bottom, and there is a little bit of water in the bottom. \nBut most of the well from this point to the top is dry right now, and \nthat is what they have to fill by their budget resolution.\n  At the top of the well we will see this number, $1.503 trillion, plus \nmoney to raise money for the reserve fund. That is what it takes to go \nfrom here to here to fill it.\n  If we want to put this another way, this budget puts the burden on \nthe Finance Committee to come up with $1.5 trillion in offsets over the \nnext 10 years. This budget assumes the well of revenue raisers is full \nto the brim, but they are starting out at this point.\n  My colleagues know I am a farmer. I should say my son is a farmer; I \nam kind of like a hired man now. I think that gives me something to \nknow about wells and the predictability of well water. We on the farm \nalways hope we will get rain, and particularly now, as it is dry in the \nmiddle west. So now we get a decent level of water so we can fill up \nthe well to the top so we have plenty of reserve.\n  As a former chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee, I \nthink I can tell my colleagues something about revenue raisers. In the \npositions I held on the Finance Committee, I led efforts to identify \nand enact sensible revenue raisers aimed at closing the tax gap and \nshutting down tax shelters. And as a senior tax-writing committee \nmember, I continued to look for ways to shut off the unintended tax \nbenefits.\n  Given this experience, I know what is realistic when it comes to \nrevenue raisers. From 2001 through 2006, Congress enacted over 100 \noffsets with a combined total of not necessarily a lot of money but \nstill a lot of money compared to this stuff we are talking about here, \nbut it still scored for $1.7 billion over 1 year; over 5 years, $51.5 \nbillion; and over 10 years, $157.9 billion. That is from about 100 \noffsets.\n  What other revenue raisers have been identified and scored? The \nPresident's last budget, the one we got in February of 2012--and they \nare supposed to be out every February and we are not going to get it \nuntil April 8 now; why I don't know--but the President's budget in 2012 \ncontained a package of a lot of revenue that the Joint Committee on \nTaxation said would raise $1.4 trillion over 10 years.\n  The majority party has largely left these revenue-raising proposals \nuntouched over the last 4 years. So if we have a Democratic President \nof the United States suggesting $1.4 trillion of revenue in his budget, \nas the suggestion from the White House, and the other side here in the \nSenate wants to raise a tremendous amount of revenue and they haven't \ntouched it in the last 4 years, what makes us think they are going to \ntouch it now? Is it realistic to think all of these taxes will be \nraised if even the Democratic President asks for it and his friends on \nthe other side of the aisle--our friends as well--ignored it?\n  The majority party has, however, identified and specified and voted \nfor tax hikes that amount to $108.3 billion. That is $108.3 billion of \nidentified and scored revenue raisers. That is only about 7.8 percent \nof the amount that is needed to make this budget work. So we see how \nunrealistic this budget resolution is.\n  Based on these facts, what is the likelihood the Finance Committee \nwill be able to come up with revenue raisers of this magnitude? In my \nview, from my 10 years as chairman and ranking member, that chance is \nnot very high. If that is the case, then what will happen? The revenue \nside of the budget will be ignored, but the spending side will be \nfollowed. The net effect will be a massive tax increase, a bigger \ndeficit, or both.\n  Now back to the chart. So the revenue-raising well is about 7.8 \npercent full. We have heard a lot about tax expenditures. As I have \nsaid before, the people have been told there are trillions of dollars \nof spending through the Tax Code. I am going to look at the individual \nincome tax expenditures because the administration and the Democratic \nleadership have said they want to leave the corporate tax expenditures \nfor lowering rates.\n  Here is a little irony. The Congressional Budget Act defines \nrefundable tax credits as spending. It makes all the sense in the world \nbecause the tax benefits go to individuals who don't pay income tax. \nThese credits are actually paid out in the form of a check in excess of \nany income tax liability of that individual. However, we won't hear the \nmajority advocate reducing, let alone eliminating, any of those \nrefundable tax credits. In fact, the majority's budget would increase \nthem further. They represent even more significant tax expenditures.\n  I have another chart here based on the nonpartisan Joint Committee on \nTaxation data. Here are 10 tax expenditures. The chart shows the top 10 \nindividual income tax expenditures from this year, 2013, through the \nyear 2017. These top 10 expenditures represent 70 percent of the total \nindividual tax expenditures.\n  No. 7 is the earned income tax credit. That is a refundable tax \ncredit designed for low-income taxpayers.\n  No. 8 on the list--I won't bother to point to it--is the premium tax \ncredit enacted by ObamaCare. By 2017, this credit will actually make \nits way into the top five. Like the earned income tax credit, the \npremium credit is fully refundable.\n  No. 9 on the chart is the child tax credit which is partially \nrefundable.\n  For each of these credits, more than half of the value of the benefit \nis paid out in the form of a government check exceeding tax \nliabilities. That is direct spending through the Tax Code. Yet these \ncredits are considered off limits by the majority.\n\n[[Page S2005]]\n\n  So let's take a look at the tax expenditure No. 1. That is the tax-\nfree treatment of employer-provided health care. Americans can look \nforward to $1 trillion of health care-related taxes coming due over the \nnext 10 years. All of this tax increase is thanks to 21 tax increases \ncontained in ObamaCare. My guess is the majority doesn't want to take \non that group.\n  So No. 2 is tax-deferred retirement savings plans. It is defined \nbenefit plans and section 401(k)-type plans. To be sure, some higher \nincome taxpayers benefit. Defined benefit plans tend to dominate in the \nunionized world. Section 401(k)-type plans are more common now. Some \nhigh-income taxpayers do, in fact, benefit because they are owners of a \nbusiness and we want them to set up and maintain the plans. About 4 \npercent of this tax expenditure goes to taxpayers at $1 million or more \nof income.\n  No. 3 on the list is the preferential rate for capital gains and \ndividends. It is true that higher income taxpayers tend to have more \ncapital gains. But a few months ago the rate rose 59 percent with the \nObamaCare and fiscal cliff deal tax hikes kicking in. Do we want to \nchoke off more savings and investment?\n  No. 4 is the deduction for State and local income and real property \ntaxes. The New York Times editorial page is usually very in tune with \nthe majority. An editorial on December 6, 2012, has a title that says \nit all: ``Keep The State Tax Deduction.'' My guess is that with the \nheavy hit on heavily taxed blue State taxpayers, the majority will not \nwant to visit that deduction.\n  No. 5 concerns the American dream of home ownership. It is the home \nmortgage interest deduction. It disproportionately goes to the middle-\nincome taxpayer. Do we really want to tank the tepid housing recovery \nnow underway?\n  So look at No. 6. It is the tax benefit from the Medicare benefits \nthe Federal Government pays. We have heard a lot about the Medicare \nreforms contained in the Ryan budget from the majority. Does the \nmajority want to cut the value of Medicare benefits by taxing them?\n  I have already discussed Nos. 7, 8, and 9 on the chart which are all \nrefundable credits. They are the earned income tax credit, the premium \ntax credit, and the child tax credit. Significantly, the premium tax \ncredit makes the list while only being in effect 4 out of the 5 years \nwe have examined.\n  So how about the last one then, No. 10? It refers to the step-up in \nbasis that occurs on death time transfers. Higher end taxpayers tend to \npay the estate tax when they die. This policy ensures they don't pay a \ndouble tax on the transfer. Does the majority really want to reopen the \nestate tax debate that we all thought just ended on January 1?\n  If we were to expand on this list and look at the top 20 expenditures \ninstead of just the top 10, we would account for 90 percent of the \nindividual tax expenditures. They include such things as charitable \ndeductions, tax incentives for college, and the exclusion of capital \ngains from the sale of a home. Does the majority want to raise taxes on \nthe backs of college students or cause heartburn for middle-income \nhomeowners when they sell their home?\n  Well, let's take a step back for a minute. Where does the budget take \nus? The terms of the budget documents tell us the majority Members say \nthey want to eliminate or curtail spending through the Tax Code--$1 \ntrillion plus another $500 billion if they decide how to spend it. Yet \nthey themselves would vehemently oppose eliminating or reducing tax \nexpenditures that are defined by our budget laws as spending.\n  I challenge the budget authors to tell me which tax benefits they \nwant to curtail. Do they want to cut back the tax treatment of \nemployer-provided health insurance? Do they want to cut back defined \nbenefit plans or 401(k) plans? Do they want to increase capital gains \nand dividend rates even further than the 59 percent? Do they want to \ncut back on the State and local tax deduction? Do they want to cut back \non the mortgage interest deduction? Do they want to tax Medicare \nbenefits? Do they want to raise the tax level on death time transfers?\n  Well, I conclude: This budget represents a dramatic step backward for \nthe American taxpayer. For the first time in 4 years, thank God, we are \ndebating a budget. Yet it repeats the same fiscal pattern of the first \nterm of this Presidency. It spends too much, it taxes too much, and it \nresults in too much new debt.\n  As former chairman and ranking member--and I suppose this is the \nfourth or fifth time I have said this, so people get tired of me saying \nit--but in that former position, I am sorry to say the experience I \nhave had is that this budget doesn't even attempt to match the demands \nof the Finance Committee with the numbers in this budget.\n  I hope deficit hawks on both sides of the aisle pay close attention. \nThe only thing certain here is that new spending will occur.\n  The deficit impact of not realistically dealing with the tax, trade, \nand health policy spending priorities of the Finance Committee \ndisguises the deficit built into this budget.\n  I have many other concerns about the budget proposed by the majority. \nSimply, today, I wanted to let the Senate know how the numbers on the \nrevenue side do not work from the standpoint of the usual stands that \npeople take on closing loopholes and not closing loopholes and based \nupon what is politically feasible out of the Finance Committee.\n  As we take up amendments, I am hopeful we can make the budget mesh \nwith the Finance Committee's policy demands.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking member \nof the Finance Committee. That was a very fine presentation. I believe \nhe is absolutely accurate. It is easy to say we are going to close \nloopholes and we are going to raise a trillion dollars-plus from \nclosing loopholes. But the Senator just showed, based on the votes of \nour Democratic colleagues, and others too that it is much harder to \nharvest money from legitimate tax deductions and credits than a lot of \npeople think.\n  Would that be fair to say?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Absolutely. And based upon the experience we have had \nof actually voting on those issues in the past--or the fact that I \nstated how the President put certain things in his budget of February \n2012, and none of those ideas have ever been brought up by the majority \nparty in the period of time they have been before them. So if their own \nPresident--when I say their own President, the President of their \nparty--our President proposes that they raise revenue from those \nplaces, and they do not do it, it signals to me it is a pretty \ndifficult job to do, and it is not going to be any easier this year \nthan in past years.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Grassley so much for his insight on \nthat.\n  We also have Senator Enzi here, who is a member of the Finance \nCommittee, and is a senior member of the Budget Committee also. He \nunderstands these issues deeply.\n  I yield to Senator Enzi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to share with the American \npublic exactly what they are getting with the majority's budget for the \ncoming year. I will be blunt. It is not good news. In fact, after 4 \nyears of not bringing up a budget for consideration by the Senate, what \nthe majority has offered is a severe disappointment. We have to grow \nthe economy, not the government. But, unfortunately, the majority's \nbudget focuses on growing the government--more taxing, more spending, \nmore government.\n  During our last break, I had an opportunity to travel around Wyoming. \nI did about 2,000 miles, and I did a bunch of listening sessions. That \nis where I just take notes while people tell me what is on their mind. \nThey are not going to be pleased with this budget. In fact, they think \nthe best way to grow jobs is to cut government. And they were very \nadamant on making sure the sequester happened, which would be the first \nreal cut in government we have had in forever. They recognize that what \nwe usually call a cut is when an agency asks for a billion dollars, and \nthey only get a half a billion dollars in new money. They call that a \nhalf billion dollar cut. It is not a cut, it is an increase of half a \nbillion dollars. But around here that would be a\n\n[[Page S2006]]\n\ncut. So we do not really do cuts. Sometimes we slow the growth of \ngovernment, but we do not do cuts.\n  They actually want to see some action to cut, to balance the budget, \nand eventually to pay down the debt. They recognize that if interest \nrates go up, $16 trillion is going to be tough to pay the interest on, \nlet alone pay back any principal, let alone do any other function of \ngovernment.\n  So this is a budget that looks out over the next 10 years. It \nprovides for significant tax increases, upwards of $1.5 trillion. But \nit also provides for significant spending increases. It is not as \nthough we are increasing the revenue so that we could decrease the \ndeficit and eventually decrease the debt. It is so we can add to \nspending--$162 billion next year alone. It provides for spending \nincreases of 62 percent from today's budget levels.\n  Any savings are being claimed after the first year--after the first \nyear. We never get to the second year, so the savings never make it--\nnever pan out. It reminds me of a sign I saw on a restaurant. It said: \nFree drinks tomorrow. Of course, if you came in tomorrow, they said: \nNo, no. Read the sign. It says: Free drinks tomorrow. That is the way \nwe budget around here. We are always promising these things, but the \nreal things do not happen.\n  Our problem is not that we tax too little but that we spend too much. \nA budget should serve as the blueprint to get the revenues and the \nspending aligned. Individuals have budgets. That is what they do. They \nsee how much revenue they have coming in, and they see how much they \ncan spend. They do not see how much they can spend and then see what \nthe revenue is going to be. You cannot live in that kind of a world, \nbut we do here.\n  Unfortunately, the majority's budget fails miserably in that respect. \nIn fact, it does not balance the budget in any year over the next 10 \nyears. The budget that was offered by the House Republicans, on the \nother hand, balances the budget in 2023. And, of course, the other side \nof the aisle talks about what a terrible budget that is. But they got \nit to balance. They have even introduced and passed budgets in the \nHouse for the last several years, and that takes a lot of courage when \nyou know all that is going to happen over in this body is for it to get \nshot down by the majority. But those budgets have gotten some votes in \nfavor of them.\n  The President has presented some budgets. The last 2 years, he has \nnot gotten a single vote for his budget. I mean, he was not able to \ntalk a single Democrat into voting for his budget--not one--let alone a \nRepublican.\n  So the budget that was offered by the House Republicans balances in \n2023. I have introduced a bill. It is called the Penny Plan. That cuts \nspending by 1 percent from every dollar for each of the next 3 years. \nIf we could do that--true cuts--1 percent for each of the next 3 years, \nthe budget would balance in 2016. I really think that is where we need \nto be--not 2023--2016. And, hopefully, we would not stop the cuts of 1 \ncent for every dollar. Families across America are having to cut more \nthan that.\n  When I present this in Wyoming and other places, they say: Well, my \nwife just got laid off. We had to do a 20-percent cut, so why can't the \nFederal Government do a 1-penny-out-of-every-dollar cut? That would \nbalance it by 2016. If we kept it going a little more, we would \nactually be paying down the debt--not just reducing the deficit but \npaying down the debt.\n  Our Nation owes $16 trillion, and no one is talking about reducing \nit. We have to get to balance--the sooner the better--and start paying \ndown the debt. And do not get confused by the language the majority \nwill use. They will say that their budget takes a ``balanced \napproach.'' But it does not balance. There is a big difference. \n``Balanced approach'' to them means ``fair'' tax increases. I am not \nsure what that means, but that is what they mean by ``balance.'' And it \nis tax and spend, it is increasing deficits, and increasing debt as far \nas the eye can see. This is not the plan America needs to get its \nfiscal house in order. Next year alone, the majority wants to increase \nspending by nearly $162 billion, and the deficit next year is \nanticipated to be $152 billion above current projections. Over the next \n10 years, deficits are expected to total $5.2 trillion. If we adopt the \nmajority's budget, that is $5.2 trillion in addition to the $16 \ntrillion we already owe. That is not balancing the budget. That is not \na balanced approach.\n  None of this spending is associated with any kind of reforms to the \ndrivers of our out-of-control deficits and debt that will bankrupt--\nbankrupt--Social Security and Medicare. The majority's budget provides \nno path to save Social Security and Medicare. They are hoping the \nRepublicans will do that and take all the flak that is involved for it. \nWell, if we do it soon enough, there is not as much flak as if we do it \nlater.\n  It has been a shame that we have been years without a budget, and \nwhen the majority finally gets around to doing it they do not even \naddress the biggest driver.\n  Earlier this evening, the majority leader commented that we can learn \nfrom the bipartisanship shown by Senators Mikulski and Shelby on their \nwork on the bill that will fund the government for the rest of the \nyear. I think it was a massive opportunity and expenditure of effort \nthat they did. But what I want to point out is that they had the \nopportunity to work things out together--together. That is bipartisan. \nThat means sitting down together and figuring out what both sides think \nare the priorities, and seeing if there is not some way to put those \ninto a single budget. I know it has not been done in years, but it is \nsomething I imagine America dreams about. I wish the majority would \nhave provided that same opportunity in the Budget Committee. Maybe then \nthe majority would have brought a bipartisan budget to the Senate \nfloor. This does not have to be a shooting match. It can be a \nrealization of a way to match spending with the revenues we have.\n  I was disheartened last week when I finally received the majority's \nbudget to see that it simply continues the mantra of ``tax and spend.'' \nWe cannot tax the American people every time Congress screws up, every \ntime we overspend. And there are a lot of ways we do overspend.\n  One of the favorite things around here is to propose a grand new \nidea, and since that grand new idea would have a huge pricetag on it, \nwe reduce it by saying: We will just make it a demonstration project. \nWe will just do it in five States to start with, with a very minimal \nbudget, and that will prove the value of this project. And practically \nevery one shows they are a valuable project.\n  Well, at that point the local governments or the States are supposed \nto take them over and sell it to the rest of the country so that \neverybody winds up with this tremendous project. That is not what \nhappens. They come back the next year and they say: This worked \nphenomenally, so we need to expand it to all 50 States because \neverybody deserves a great program such as this.\n  Well, we increased it from 5 to 50, so we increased it tenfold, at \nleast. And chances are pretty good that some of those projects are done \nin small States. So when you put them into big States, they are an even \nbigger blowup of the budget. That is the way we bust the budget around \nhere--just one of many ways.\n  Rather than looking for waste and abuse and duplication in government \nspending--and we know there is some--the majority simply decided to ask \nthe hard-working American public to send in more of their hard-earned \ndollars to Washington to pay for more spending. These tax increases the \nmajority calls for will hit the middle class. They say it will not hit \nthe middle class. But we did some of the rich, and I noticed, in the \nalternative minimum tax--that is a great phrase. That sounds like \neverybody ought to be paying tax, and that is kind of an American \nprinciple, but it is not something that happens around here. Over 50 \npercent of the people do not pay any tax now. But we had this \nalternative minimum tax so that the rich would pay more. Well, \ninflation changed it so that 34 million Americans are being hit by that \nin the middle class. Consequently, we changed it. That is what we do \nwhen we try and mess around with classes of people.\n  To my constituents back home in Wyoming and fellow citizens across \nthe country, let me be clear: It is your money, not the government's \nmoney. That is what they were telling me as I traveled around Wyoming \nfor 2,000 miles and did my listening sessions.\n\n[[Page S2007]]\n\nThey say it is our money. As legislators, we have to do a better job of \ntaking care of the funds they provide us and ensuring that it is spent \nwisely.\n  The majority thinks it knows best how to spend the money the American \npeople work hard to make. The budget they have offered seeks more than \n$1 trillion--let me repeat that: more than $1 trillion--in new taxes \nover the next 10 years. And debt will still grow by $7 trillion. That \nwould be $23 trillion. That is a lot to pay interest on. Take and \nfigure that out, if you can, with all those zeros that are out there, \nhow much money that amounts to--at some moderate rate, say, 5 percent, \nbecause that is what it is anticipated to grow to in that same amount \nof time. And I think it could go well higher than that. Because if the \nrest of the world that is loaning us 40 percent of our money decides we \nare not the best place to put that money, the interest rates will have \nto go up dramatically in order to encourage the kind of money to keep \nborrowing $23 trillion--or $16 trillion; that is, if we can balance the \nbudget quickly. In fact, the majority wants to set up a fast-track \nlegislative process to get $975 billion from you as quickly as \npossible.\n  Now, we had the discussion earlier about taxes. We thought we had \nworked the tax problem for everybody and preserved people's taxes for \n99 percent of the people. We thought there were going to be some \nspending cuts coming. Somebody sent me this little chart that I have to \nshare.\n  This says ``Republican'' on it: OK. I will raise taxes if you promise \nto cut spending.\n  Well, Lucy says: It is a deal.\n  But we have been watching this cartoon for years and years. We know \nwhat happens. When we go to pick up the spending cuts, the football \nsuddenly gets lifted out of the way and we end up on our back, the \nAmerican public winds up on its back. Those are not the kinds of \nspending cuts we are looking for. We are looking for some real spending \ncuts, not just a decrease in the growth but some real spending cuts. \nThere is a way to do those.\n  Wyoming has been faced with probably an 8-percent reduction in its \nincome. How did they handle it? The Governor saw that coming, got a \nhold of every department and program and said: I need a plan from you \nfor how you would cut 2 percent, how you would cut 4 percent, how you \nwould cut 6 percent, and how you would cut 8 percent. When he got the \nfour plans from every department, he took a look at them to see if they \nwere cutting the worst first--you know, reducing the pain as much as \npossible. It worked that way. There was hardly a whimper and hardly \nanything noticeable to the customer; that is, the people who live in \nWyoming. That is good management, not an e-mail that goes out that \nsays: Make the cut as painful as possible. That is the sequester we are \ngoing through now. That should never happen in any kind of a managed \nbusiness or a managed government. I guess that would be saying it is \nnot a managed government.\n  When we took up the budget in committee last week, I offered an \namendment to strike the language that provided for the fast-track tax \nincrease process. My amendment was meant to ensure that the tax reform \nwould be conducted in a bipartisan manner, to generate a more \nefficient, fairer, and simpler Tax Code and spur economic growth rather \nthan raise revenues through legislation that can be passed with a \nsimple majority here in the Senate.\n  A simple-majority vote would ensure that the minority party's views \nwould receive little, if any, consideration. We would have no input. \nDebate time and the number of amendments that could be offered to \nimprove the legislation would also be limited. We need to have an open \nprocess where all Members can have their voices heard. We simply need \nto stop dealmaking and start legislating.\n  We have had the system around here for a while where we work from \ncontrived crises that have very specific dates at which the sky falls \nand the United States is demolished. Of course, that does generate a \nlot of publicity and all the media and everything leading up to that \ncrunch. A group goes off and makes a deal. We find out about that deal \nin the last hour. Our choice at that point is take it or leave it. \nWell, if the sky is going to fall and America is going to be destroyed, \nwhat is the choice?\n  That is not the way to do it. We have to quit dealmaking and start \nlegislating. The way you legislate is to have the chairman and the \nranking member and other interested people on the committee who have a \nvery specific interest in an issue sit down together and see if they \ncannot work out a basic package. It only has to be a basic package. It \ndoes not have to be a comprehensive package. This basic package would \nthen go to committee. That is where the people can turn in amendments \nand improve it from their viewpoint.\n  The reason we have so many people in the Senate and in the House is \nso that we can see as many unintended consequences as possible. But if \nit does not go through committee, we have turned those people off. We \nhave said: Your views do not count; your amendments do not count. \nConsequently, we do not end up with a good piece of legislation coming \nout of committee. If you get it out of committee in good shape, you can \nget it to the floor in good shape. If you get it to the floor in good \nshape, you can take additional amendments and improve it maybe more. \nThat has been my experience with this. Yes, there have to be some tough \nvotes with that. That is what we do. That is what we get paid for--\nlegislating, voting.\n  We have spent the last week working on a continuing resolution. We \ngot to vote three times. There were only requests for 11 more votes. We \ndid not get to vote on those until tonight. So they had it arranged in \na very fast process. Some of the people did not actually get their say.\n  We have to stop dealmaking and start legislating, particularly on big \nand important issues such as tax reform. We have to get back to a \nregular process so all Members can give input and improve the \nlegislation.\n  Senator Gregg and Senator Wyden worked on income taxes for a long \ntime. Then Senator Coats and Senator Wyden worked on income taxes for a \nlong time. Now I am working with Senator Wyden and Senator Coats on \nincome taxes. I think we can come up with something that will work. We \ncan do both the individual and the corporate tax rates at the same time \nbecause they are very interrelated. We would not have that big of a tax \ncode if it were not for all of the interrelationships. It is time that \nwe made it simpler and fairer. It can be done, but it is not going to \nbe done on a partisan basis in a very short period of time and get it \nright. So we have to get back to that regular process so all Members \ncan give input and improve the legislation.\n  Unfortunately, my amendment was defeated. Every Member of the \nmajority voted against it. But I will try here again on the Senate \nfloor. Senator Grassley, who was a former chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, and I have come together. We will offer an amendment to get \nrid of the fast-track process and provide for progrowth, revenue-\nneutral tax reform for corporate, business, and individual taxes.\n  I have a few other amendments I plan on filing as well to improve \nthis budget. One would provide for a phase-in or transition for any \nchanges to the Tax Code so that people and businesses can plan \naccordingly and we do not inadvertently put companies out of business \nor add people to the unemployment rolls.\n  Another amendment would require that each Federal agency identify and \nprioritize its programs, its projects, its activities so that they can \ncut the worst first, as I mentioned in the Wyoming example. That way we \nget what is the least harmful and least painful. There would be \nspending reductions. We might even get into duplication between \nagencies.\n  Senator Coburn and I did a little study of the health, education, \nlabor, and pension programs. We found there was $9 billion--$9 billion \nof duplication. You cannot get rid of all of that, but you ought to be \nable to get rid of half of it. Well, Senator Coburn got so enthused by \nit that he went and took a look at the rest of government. He found \n$900 billion a year in duplication. Now, how is that possible? Well, my \njurisdiction was rather limited, but what I have jurisdiction over is \nduplicated in almost every way. Almost every department, agency, and \nprogram has\n\n[[Page S2008]]\n\nsomething to do with financial literacy. Based on our budget process, I \nwould say that is probably failing. Maybe we ought to get rid of all \nduplication.\n\n  I will also file an amendment that would provide for protecting and \nrestoring monies in dedicated funds, such as the trust funds, so we \nwill not steal money from other areas to make up for shortfalls, as the \nmajority did with the abandoned mine land money for 10 years that was \nowed to Wyoming but instead was used to pay for a 2-year highway bill.\n  Finally, I will file an amendment reflecting the goals of the \nMarketplace Fairness Act so that we put all businesses, whether brick-\nand-mortar, online, or catalog, on a level playing field with respect \nto the collection of sales and use taxes.\n  The majority's budget would severely harm my home State of Wyoming. \nThe more than $1 trillion in tax increases would mean losses in \npersonal income, household disposable income, and job opportunities. \nOver the next 10 years, the tax increases would cut personal income in \nWyoming over $4 billion. You have to remember, we are a small State. We \nfinally got past the half-million mark in people. So $4 billion is a \nlot. It would cut household disposable income on an average of $26,000 \nper household. There would be an average of nearly 1,900 job losses. \nYou have to remember, we only have half a million people. These tax \nincreases clearly are not the recipe for fixing our ailing economy and \ncertainly not the answer for the hard-working folks back home in \nWyoming.\n  When you start with one party doing the drafting--and those who wrote \nthe budget hold the majority on the Budget Committee--you can expect \nthe bill to be one-sided. If you keep on doing what you have been \ndoing, you can expect to get the same result. Unfortunately, I believe \nthat is what we will see this week as we debate the budget on the \nSenate floor.\n  The majority kept us in the dark on the last budget until last \nWednesday evening. We had to present our opening statements in the \nBudget Committee before we even saw the budget the majority would \noffer.\n  Now, I do have to say in the defense of the majority that is the way \nit has been for several years, both when the Republicans were in charge \nand when Democrats were in charge. That does not mean it is right. If \nyou want a good budget, you have to share the information, and share it \nbefore people have to comment if you really want good comments.\n  Then we had to turn around and start voting on the amendments the \nnext morning in the Budget Committee. We were not part of that process. \nIt was on a partisan line.\n  I was particularly disheartened by one amendment that failed on a \nparty-line vote that was offered by Senator Portman from Ohio. His \namendment was simply asking the Congressional Budget Office to provide \nadditional information with the cost estimates it provides on \nlegislation affecting revenues. That is right--he was just asking for \nadditional information. Every Member of the majority voted against it. \nHow could a request for additional information be so partisan? We can \nand must do better for our constituents and our country.\n  Several weeks from now, we may see the President's budget proposal. \nOf course, he will be late to the game since the House and Senate will \nhave already acted on the budget. That would be the first time in over \n90 years that would be the case. By the way, his budget was due nearly \n2 months ago. I anticipate it will include many of the same things we \nhave here in the Senate majority's budget--more taxes, more spending, \nmore government.\n  As we are learning all too well with the majority's drive to repeal \nthe recent spending cuts called sequestration, taxes generally go on \nforever, but spending cuts seldom make it through the year. We were \npromised spending cuts, but the football is about to be jerked out. We \nhave to grow the economy, not the government. Unfortunately, the \nmajority's budget has it backward: It grows the government at the \nexpense of the economy.\n  I look forward to the debate on this budget and filing amendments to \nimprove it both for my constituents in Wyoming and my fellow citizens \nacross the country. I know the debate around here has delayed the \nbeginning of the budget process so that we are going to be under a \ncrunch. Perhaps it will go into the weekend and give us an opportunity \nto do all of the amendments rather than just trying to fatigue us on \nFriday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Enzi. Senator Enzi is an accountant, a \nbusinessman. I do not believe any Member of this body has traveled his \nState more on the ground than he in the last number of years. As a \nmatter of fact, I will say with certainty that is so. He travels \nconstantly, talks to people all over the State.\n  I just have one question of the Senator. When you talk to people in \nWyoming, real people in gas stations----\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Would the Senator yield for a second on a unanimous \nconsent?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be pleased to yield.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 933\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the title amendment for \nH.R. 933 which is at the desk be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 176) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       Amend the title to read: ``An Act making consolidated \n     appropriations and further continuing appropriations for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2013, and for other \n     purposes.''\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So I guess the President here has said: Well, so you \nknow my goal is not to chase a balanced budget just for the sake of \nbalance. But when our colleagues talk about a balanced approach and \nthey have a budget that does not actually balance--I guess what I am \nsaying is that the Senator talks to his constituents more than any \nSenator here, I am sure. Does the Senator think they really believe we \nshould have a balanced budget, revenue equaling outgo? I ask an \naccountant that question.\n  Mr. ENZI. The Wyoming people absolutely think there should be a \nbalanced budget. They do not think it ought to take 10 years to get \nthere. They know how they have to operate. These are just hard-working, \nordinary people with big hearts and an interest in jobs and their \nfamilies. They are not seeing jobs happening. They are not seeing the \neconomy improving. They are seeing taxes rising and people just talking \nabout raising taxes. That is not where they expect us to go. All of \nthem can suggest someplace within their realm of work that there ought \nto be a change.\n  Most of them say the best way to improve the economy, the best way to \ndo jobs is just to get the government out of our way. These are people \nsitting on a tractor, even working in government during the day, \nthinking of ways their job could be reinvented to maybe be a little bit \nbetter. That is how governments can improve. They come up with some \ncommonsense suggestions. I haul it back here, but commonsense doesn't \ngo very far around here. I will keep hauling it, continue talking to \npeople and continue to see what their expectations are, and hopefully \nwe can meet those expectations. It doesn't take an accountant to know \nwe are overspending.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator mentioned--which it does seem to me we are \ndoing here by this budget--if it were to pass, we don't have any plans \nto change what we are doing. The problem is that you haven't sent us \nenough money. As the Senator indicated, send us more money, and we will \nall be happy in Washington. That is not what my constituents are \ntelling me they think we should do. What are yours saying?\n  Mr. ENZI. They are saying there should be quite a changeover back \nhere until we have people who understand that you are not supposed to \nspend more than you take in. The answer is not charging them more in \ntaxes every time we can't meet that expectation. They already think \nthere are enough programs out here. Sometimes I have to agree with \nthem.\n  When I started as the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions--HELP--Committee, within my jurisdiction was preschool \nprograms. There were 119 preschool programs. We spent more on preschool \nthan we did on K-12. Senator Kennedy and I were able to get those down \nto 69 programs. People wonder why we can't get it below 69\n\n[[Page S2009]]\n\nprograms. Most of them aren't handled by the departments we work with. \nThey are handled by Agriculture, Commerce, and other agencies. We don't \nget to dabble in those. There are ways we can eliminate duplication and \nsave a little money, but we are not looking for that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Here is the GAO report I think the Senator referred to, \nthe 2012 annual report: ``Opportunities to Reduce Duplication, Overlap \nand Fragmentation, Achieve Savings, and Enhance Revenue.'' I think my \nconstituents would say this is exactly what you should do. Do yours?\n  Mr. ENZI. Absolutely. It looks like a tremendous manual. We have a \nthing called the Government Performance and Results Act, which is where \nevery agency is supposed to list what they do and how we will know they \ncompleted it. At the end of the year, they are supposed to evaluate \nthemselves to see if they did what they said they were going to do. \nMost of them don't report, and those that usually do fail, and that is \na lot of what is in that report. The agency is saying: No, we didn't do \nwhat we are supposed to do.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is. It lists here on page 51 specific examples. The \nSenator mentioned duplication. This one is employment of people with \ndisabilities--a very good goal. This is something we would like to see \nif we can facilitate and help them work. It states: ``Better \ncoordination among 50 programs in nine Federal agencies that support \nemployment of people with disabilities.'' There are 50 programs in 9 \nagencies. Does the Senator believe we could get more help for the \ndisabled if those programs were consolidated and brought together in a \nsingle or a few programs?\n  Mr. ENZI. One of the things that happen with the programs is they \nusually get named after some Senator and he is very protective of his \nparticular program. This is one of the things that make it very \ndifficult to eliminate programs. Yes, if the duplication is eliminated, \nyou may put the emphasis on the programs that are really working and \nthat should succeed. That should make a bigger difference to everybody.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is common sense. I thank the Senator so much for \nhis contributions. I do believe the American people have a right to say \nto us: You fix the duplication. You fix some of this waste. You quit \nthrowing money at Solyndras and hot tubs in Las Vegas before you ask us \nfor any more money.\n  We haven't done it.\n  I know fundamentally it is fair to say the Chief Executive of the \nUnited States is the person responsible for managing this bureaucracy. \nWe are sort of like an active board of directors that monitors this.\n  Would the Senator not expect that a really committed President, Chief \nExecutive of the United States, should be sending to us proposals on a \nregular basis that are based on reports of his Cabinet and sub-Cabinet \npeople to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse? Wouldn't that help us if \nwe had more support from the President's side?\n  Mr. ENZI. That is probably the only way it can be done, is to have \nthe President suggest this is leadership, this is management, this is \nwhat the White House is supposed to be in charge of and could do.\n  I also know that even if the President talks about eliminating a \nprogram, there will be the 10 good examples from across the United \nStates that actually work that will come in and flood us with comments \nabout how that program cannot be eliminated. This is why I have the \npenny plan--one cent of every dollar across the board. Then you don't \nrun into that problem. As I said, that would balance in 3 years, not 10 \nyears.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If we reduce by 1 percent, one penny out of every \ndollar of spending for 3 years, the budget would balance in 3 years, 4 \nyears?\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes. These are the latest figures. After the sequestration \nand after the fiscal cliff, it came down to that. Before that, it would \nhave taken us 5 years.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator for sharing that and thank him for \nsharing his thoughts with us tonight.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the ranking member for the tremendous job he has \ndone and the hours he and his staff have put into reviewing these \nthings. This is not an easy thing to follow. The book we have is an \nactual manual. The bill we receive to work from is just a bunch of \nnumbers. It is hard to put that all together, and I thank the Senator \nfor the information he has provided.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we do have some serious differences of \nopinions between the two parties when it comes to our values and our \npriorities. We believe our budget should reflect this, and we are \nhaving a good debate. Those differences will be difficult enough to \nbridge, and we should be able to at least agree on what the facts are.\n  I wish to take a moment tonight to correct an inaccuracy I have heard \na lot in the last few days, including on the floor tonight. We are \nhearing some Republicans say that the Senate budget includes a $1.5 \ntrillion tax hike. This simply is not true. Here are the facts.\n  Of the $975 billion in new revenue, which comes from those who can \nafford it the most, $480 billion is matched with responsible spending \ncuts to fully replace the sequestration, $100 billion goes toward \ntargeted high-priority infrastructure repair and job training to help \nrestore the recovery, put Americans back to work, and the rest goes to \nhelp reduce the deficit.\n  Unfortunately, rather than seriously considering the credible path we \nhave presented in our budget plan, some Republicans have decided to \nplay games with the numbers, and they are not telling the truth. \nInstead of subtracting the sequestration replacement portion and the \ninvestment package from the $975 billion in total revenue, they are \ntrying to say you should somehow add them all together. They are taking \none side of the ledger, combining it with the other side of the ledger, \nand coming to some conclusion that makes absolutely no sense to us. It \nwould be like handing over $2 to buy a cup of coffee and having someone \nsay: Well, the price was actually $2 plus the value of that coffee. It \ndoesn't make any sense.\n  You don't have to take my word for it. Fact checkers and reporters \nhave called this claim false and a step too far. The Washington Post \nFact Checker even gave it two Pinocchios.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na story from the Washington Post on this inaccurate claim.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Mitch McConnell's Claim That the Democrats Plan a $1.5 Trillion Tax \n                                  Hike\n\n                           (By Glenn Kessler)\n\n       ``Their budget will do more to harm the economy than to \n     help it, and it will let Medicare and Social Security drift \n     closer to bankruptcy. And then there's the Democrats' $1.5 \n     trillion tax hike. Trillion with a T. Let me just repeat \n     that: Any senator who votes for that budget is voting for a \n     $1.5 trillion tax hike, the largest in the history of our \n     country.''\n       --Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, speech on the \n     Senate floor, March 14, 2013\n       Shortly after McConnell (R-Ky.) made these comments, \n     Democrats cried foul. The budget plan, they said, has $975 \n     billion in higher taxes, not $1.5 trillion. They point to the \n     summary tables of the budget resolution unveiled by Sen. \n     Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who chairs the Budget Committee. Sure \n     enough, there's a line showing $975 billion in new revenue.\n       But nothing's ever easy with the budget process in \n     Washington. In fact, it's a morass, with many things open to \n     interpretation, as we discovered as we went back and forth \n     between the Democrats and Republicans--and then consulted \n     with various budget experts.\n       Let's take a tour through the numbers.\n\n\n                               The Facts\n\n       There are two key parts to this discussion--the actual text \n     of the legislation and what in effect is a glossy marketing \n     document (``Restoring the Promise of American Opportunity''). \n     The legislation does not have many numbers, whereas the \n     marketing document does.\n       In the marketing document, Murray describes how she will \n     use $480 billion of the tax revenues to reverse part of the \n     automatic spending cuts in the sequester, and another $100 \n     billion for new spending on infrastructure.\n       The text of the legislation, meanwhile, establishes a bunch \n     of ``deficit neutral reserve funds,'' including one labeled \n     as ``to replace sequestration'' and the other ``to promote \n     employment and job growth.'' But there are no numbers \n     attached to those funds. Meanwhile, the legislation also \n     includes instructions (known as ``reconciliation'') to the \n     Finance Committee to boost revenues by $975 billion.\n       Deficit neutral means you need a mix of taxes and spending \n     cuts to fulfill your goals.\n\n[[Page S2010]]\n\n     Republicans assumed that since Murray in her marketing \n     document had said she would boost revenues by $480 billion to \n     pay for the sequester and $100 billion to spend on \n     infrastructure, the language meant that those funds would \n     come from additional taxes. (Depending how you read the \n     document, the $975 billion in new revenues is also slated for \n     ``deficit reduction,'' and the same money in theory can't be \n     used twice.)\n       Thus $975 billion plus $580 billion equals more than $1.5 \n     trillion.\n       Democrats say this is ridiculous. They argue that they will \n     apply the $975 billion in new tax revenue to the goals \n     outlined in the document, including applying $480 billion to \n     replace the sequestration cuts. (Another $480 billion to \n     alter the sequester would come from spending cuts.) They cast \n     the reserve funds more as a device to avoid legislative \n     points of order, which would require a 60-vote threshold to \n     overcome, rather than just the 50 votes generally required \n     for a budget resolution.\n       The whole discussion reminded The Fact Checker of the \n     budget headaches frequently experienced when he covered the \n     budget process many years ago. Fierce battles are often waged \n     over highly arcane matters.\n       We consulted with a variety of budget experts, and things \n     became even more murky. The consensus was that Republicans \n     have a point--that this was a theoretical possibility--but it \n     was not likely.\n       G. William Hoagland, senior vice president of the \n     Bipartisan Policy Center and long-time budget sage for Senate \n     Republicans, said the GOP scenario was possible but \n     ``unlikely,'' as the Democrats have ``a clear intention to \n     raise $975 billion in revenues.'' He said that such reserve \n     funds are more to send messages to fellow party members--in \n     other words, to garner votes--as opposed to being substantive \n     items. ``It's grease to make the wheels go around,'' he said.\n       In sum, he said, he viewed the legislation's reserve-fund \n     language as ``a clumsy way to avoid directly addressing \n     offsetting the sequester.''\n       Jason Delisle, another former GOP staff member on the \n     Budget Committee now at the New America Foundation, said that \n     ``Republicans are right to say that the wiggle room means the \n     official number is not the official number--that it could be \n     higher if the reserve funds are used. Fair point.''\n       But Delisle added: ``The Republican argument rests on the \n     assumption that the Democrats bring up a tax-and-spend bill \n     in addition to a reconciliation bill for each and every \n     reserve fund in the budget resolution; thus there are more \n     tax increases in the budget resolution than what they say. I \n     think the Republicans are overstating the likelihood of that \n     scenario.''\n       Ed Lorenzen, who was a budget policy adviser for House \n     Democrats and is now at the Committee for a Responsible \n     Federal Budget, agreed with Delisle and added that he viewed \n     the reserve funds as ``primarily for procedural accounting \n     purposes to adjust internal budget allocations for points of \n     order.'' He said that ``the reserve fund doesn't require an \n     additional $100 billion in revenues to pay for the $100 \n     billion in stimulus spending; rather it allows the budget \n     committee chairman to adjust the allocations to accommodate \n     $100 billion for stimulus spending in the resolution if the \n     revenues already assumed in the resolution to offset it have \n     been adopted.''\n       Keith Hennessey, another former GOP budget expert who now \n     teaches at Stanford University, took a darker view.\n       Democrats, he said, ``want to say the budget [plan] \n     includes $100 billion in new spending for jobs and \n     infrastructure by pointing to the assumption in the non-\n     legislative document, but then say that nothing in the \n     legislative text of the budget resolution requires $100 \n     billion in extra taxes.'' He was especially suspicious of the \n     fact that reserve funds do not have limits--as is sometimes \n     the case in budget resolutions--and said it was perfectly \n     acceptable to argue that the budget ``also allows for another \n     $580 billion in tax increases to offset additional spending \n     increases she [Murray] assumes and promotes aggressively.''\n       He added: ``If anything I'd argue that even the $1.5 \n     trillion number understates the tax increases allowed by the \n     Murray budget resolution. She's requiring $975 billion in tax \n     increases to reduce future deficits, and allowing for \n     unlimited amounts more to pay for new spending. I find that \n     terrifying.''\n\n\n                           The Pinocchio Test\n\n       Clearly, we're in a bit of an expert muddle here, with even \n     Republican-leaning budget wonks lacking a consensus. But \n     let's step back a moment and look at the big picture.\n       Democrats have repeatedly said they plan to seek $975 \n     billion in additional revenue and would task the Finance \n     Committee to come up with the precise closing of loopholes \n     and such. There may be something vague and suspicious about \n     the reserve funds, but under the GOP scenario, Democrats \n     would also have to vote for even more taxes--which isn't very \n     likely.\n       Budget resolutions, after all, are basically like a \n     blueprint for a house, with the details filled in later. Both \n     sides try to score political points with the votes that are \n     cast on such documents, but in sum, many of these votes are \n     relatively meaningless.\n       McConnell could have raised serious questions about what \n     Democrats intended to do with these reserve funds and how \n     they intended to fund them. But instead he has taken a \n     theoretical possibility and turned it into a hard fact: ``Any \n     senator who votes for that budget is voting for a $1.5 \n     trillion tax hike, the largest in the history of our \n     country.''\n       That's going a step too far.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. We are having an important conversation about the \ndirection of our country, what kind of Nation we want to leave to our \nchildren and grandchildren. It will not be easy to reach a deal. We are \nworking very hard to get a budget passed out of the Senate and to move \nforward from there. This is what the American people expect. It is what \nthey deserve.\n  I hope our colleagues will stick to the facts and not try to muddy \nthe water and help us focus on the urgent task at hand.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, another thing that I think is important \nand that we do agree on is the concept that our plan should be to \ncreate growth, jobs, and prosperity. A budget-balancing exercise must \nbe a part of that whole vision of how we make America a better, more \nprosperous place. What we are learning is that we can't borrow our way \nto prosperity.\n  I will never forget being in Evergreen, AL, a few years ago at a \ntownhall meeting when a nice African-American gentleman stood up. He \nsaid, ``My daddy always told me you can't borrow your way out of \ndebt.''\n  If you think about it, that is basically what we are saying we are \ngoing to do. We are saying it is not a spending problem. This is not \nthe problem we have. The problem we have is that we don't have enough \nmoney.\n  We have two solutions: One is to borrow more money, and the other is \nto tax more, taking money from people who otherwise would use it in the \neconomy to invest, expand businesses and the like, or raise--increase \nspending or borrow the money, adding to our debt.\n  Debt accumulates over time. Each billion dollars, trillion dollars \nthat is added to the debt, we pay interest on. People lend us that \nmoney. A lot of people haven't thought about it much, but we have to \npay interest on it. It is projected by the budget before us today that \nin 10 years we will be paying $800 billion--virtually $800 billion a \nyear in interest. Think about this. Interest on our debt will be almost \n$800 billion a year. Under the CBO current baseline it is a similar \nnumber. The Defense Department budget, which is actually being \nreduced--one of our largest--is $500 billion, Social Security is about \n$750 billion, and Medicare is about the same or a little smaller. It \nwould exceed every other budget item in our budget--interest on the \ndebt--every year.\n  We have been wrestling, nickeling and diming, cobbling together money \nfor a budget for our highways--$40 billion or so we could put together \nand have a program that doesn't cut our highway funding. We have more \nefficient cars, people are not buying as much gas, and taxes aren't as \nmuch as we projected they would be a number of years ago. It is getting \nto be a tight budget. We spend about $40 billion--maybe a little more \nnow--on the highway budget every year. This is maybe 1.1 percent of the \ntotal Federal Government budget.\n  We will be spending $800 billion on interest each year. The money we \nspend on interest produces us nothing. All it does is help remind us of \nthe good old high time we had back in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, \n2013, when we were spending and borrowing. We can think back: Wasn't \nthat a great time when interest rates were unbelievably, artificially \nlow. They will not stay at that rate; they are going up. We have had a \ngreat time, but the piper is going to demand his due as the years go \nby. It is just a fact.\n  This is how countries get in trouble. Greece and all of those \ncountries in trouble in Europe, their debt became so high, their \ninterest rates started going up. People were afraid to lend them money, \nand they wouldn't lend them more money unless there was more interest. \nAll of a sudden, their interest payments were so large that their whole \neconomy and governments were threatened. I think this is a big deal.\n  We keep hearing that spending is not the problem. I would like to \ntalk about this a little bit because it is very important.\n  Nancy Pelosi, minority leader in the House, said this earlier this \nyear: ``So\n\n[[Page S2011]]\n\nit is almost a false argument to say we have a spending problem.''\n  We don't have a spending problem. The American people need to send us \nmore money, I guess is what she would say. No, don't look at these \nduplicative programs; don't look where we are wasting money. It is \nimportant. You can't have austerity and actually cancel a worthless \ngovernment program. They somehow might lose their job and the country \nwill sink into the ocean. America will be better, our economy will be \nstronger, if we are leaner and more productive as a government. Surely, \nwe can agree on that. Surely, we can't maintain, as Paul Krugman did \nthe other day--unless he is advising the Democratic majority in the \nSenate--that even wasteful Defense Department spending shouldn't be cut \nbecause we want to stimulate the economy with borrowed money, throwing \nmoney at programs that are no good. That is no way to do business.\n\n  Steny Hoyer, one of the Democratic leaders in the House, says: Does \nthe country have a spending problem? The country has a paying-for \nproblem. We don't pay enough, Mr. Hoyer says. Mr. Hoyer says we need to \npay more to Washington so Washington can keep spending.\n  We are not changing. It is the American people's fault. Don't you \nknow, we are investing for you. Give us more money so we can invest. \nDon't you think all these programs work? Aren't they doing great? No, \nwe are not going to reform them. We can't cut a single one--children \nwill be thrown into the streets; old people won't have drugs for their \nhealth care. And all of this because of a modest reduction in the \ngrowth of spending?\n  Congressman Ryan has demonstrated, and the numbers are absolutely \nclear, that we can increase spending by 3.4 percent a year, and the \nbudget will balance in 10 years. We don't even have to cut spending. We \nhave to reduce the rate of growth in spending from around 5.4 percent \nto 3.4 percent and the budget balances. But President Obama says he is \nnot interested in balancing the budget. My goal is not to chase a \nbalanced budget, he says.\n  I know my colleagues have used the word ``balanced.'' I said earlier \nthey used the word ``balanced'' tonight 14 times, but I have been \ncorrected. It is 24 times already tonight that my colleagues have used \nthe word ``balanced'' in relation to this budget that never balances \nand never will balance because they are not concerned about balancing \nthe budget. That is not what it is about with them. They think bringing \nthe budget into balance, as most States have to do, as all cities and \ncounties have to do, is austerity. Oh, we can't have austerity. That \nmight hurt the government. Somebody might lose their job. They no \nlonger would be paid to do some worthless job that doesn't produce \nanything. We have to keep paying them anyway because it would be \naustere to cut that out.\n  Senator Harkin said in February: We have the richest Nation in the \nworld. If we are so rich, why are we so broke? Is it a spending \nproblem? No, it's because we have a misallocation of capital, a \nmisallocation of wealth. If we are so rich, why are we broke, he says. \nIs it a spending problem? No, it is because we have a misallocation of \ncapital, a misallocation of wealth.\n  What he means is the government hasn't taken enough wealth from the \nAmerican people who worked hard and earned it, so they can distribute \nit around. That is what he means; that we are entitled to more of it \nfrom the economy, and we can extract more of it and then we can pass it \nout and we can tell all the people who get our checks how much we did \nfor them. By the way, we ask them to vote for us while we are at it. \nSee what I sent you? I need your vote now. By the way, these awful \nRepublicans, they are talking about taking those checks away. You might \nnot get all that money now, or you might get $98 instead of $100, and I \nam going to protect you.\n  So this is the politics of this thing. It is clear we have a \nmentality around here that is not healthy, and the mentality is that it \nis not a spending problem and we don't have to cut spending and the \nDemocratic budget increases spending over the baseline we are on. It \nraises taxes. We will submit a document for the record that we think \nshows we have $1.5 trillion in tax increases in this bill. But whether \nit is $1.5 trillion or $1 trillion, the deal is that spending goes up, \nand there is virtually no alteration in the debt course of America over \nthe next 10 years.\n  So why is it that it is a spending problem? Let me explain it. It \nactually came to me more clearly during a hearing recently where Mr. \nElmendorf, who is the Director of CBO, the Congressional Budget \nOffice--and a very smart man and a decent individual--was talking about \nthe growth in spending and taxes and the tax increases that just \noccurred and that sort of thing. This is the story.\n  I asked him this: If we raised enough taxes to balance the budget \ntoday, and if the economy is growing at 2 percent, would the taxes grow \nat about 2 percent a year?\n  He said: Yes. They work hard to figure out what kind of tax growth it \nis, but taxes basically grow with the economy. As more people are \nworking, the economy grows, and they pay more taxes. If they grow at 4 \npercent, the government takes in more money than if it grows at 2 \npercent.\n  But the question was, What if spending is growing at 5 percent? Even \nif we raise enough money today to close the $1.2 billion deficit we had \nlast year to zero, and the economy is growing at 2 percent, and \nspending is growing at 5 percent, we will immediately start off on an \nunsustainable debt course.\n  So I asked him: Well, then, that is the definition of an \nunsustainable course, isn't it; that you are on a path to raise \nspending more than you are on a path to have revenue come up?\n  And that is where we are. We can't keep raising taxes and keep \nallowing our spending rate to increase beyond what the economy will \nsustain. This economy, this government, this America that has produced \nthe greatest wealth, the greatest freedom, the greatest prosperity, the \ngreatest growth, the greatest innovation the world has ever known was \nnot built on a state-dominated economy. It is not a socialist \ngovernment state; it is not a European economy. It is a growth economy. \nWe will make a mistake that we will regret, and it will be a colossal \nerror for the future of this country if we alter that great \ncharacteristic of this fabulous country of which we are a part.\n\n  We are a government of limited powers, a constitutionally controlled \ngovernment. It does not dominate our economy. It does not dominate the \npeople's lives. People are free, and they should be encouraged to be \nindependent and resourceful and to take care of themselves and their \nfamilies. When they have a hard time, we need to help them. We have \nprograms that spend $750 billion a year. I kid you not.\n  If you cobble together all the means-tested welfare programs that go \nto some--well, Medicaid. Medicaid is a free program for people whose \nincome is below a certain level. Medicaid is a means-tested welfare \nsocial program, and there are a lot of them. It is the biggest. But you \nput all those together and it amounts to $750 billion a year in \nexpenses or outflow. There are at least 83 of these programs, which are \nnot brought together. They have independence, an independent \nmanagement, different and independent departments of our government. \nThey are not coordinated.\n  What we need to do when a person is hurting and they have lost their \njob and they need food stamps and TANF and unemployment compensation \nand other benefits that they are entitled to, and will get--and will \ncontinue to get, at least that kind of compensation--we need to be \nproducing a system where these programs are brought together. We need \nto meet with that person--perhaps a single mom who has lost her job, \nmaybe a young person who hasn't been able to find work--and we need to \nuse some of those monies instead of just sending aid out and a person \ncomes in every month and signs up and gets a benefit to help that \nperson. What kind of skills do they need? Do they need an automobile to \ngo to work? How can we help them move from dependency to independence? \nHow can we help them create a healthy life for themselves, their family \nand their future? That is where we need to focus, and we are not doing \nthat. We are not even close to that.\n  The 1996 welfare reform accomplished a lot of that. The number of \nchildren in poverty dropped dramatically. They\n\n[[Page S2012]]\n\ndid a lot of reform. The welfare office became an employment office in \nmany areas of the country. It helped people move into an advanced \nlifestyle and away from dependency. But we have gradually drifted \nthrough the Bush years and into the Obama years to where those \nqualities of that program have been undermined, and President Obama is \novertly advocating relaxing some of the rules that mandate work \nrequirements for some of the people involved. He is retreating, too, \nand that is the wrong way to go.\n  We have a group of our excellent Senators--fine people--meeting in \nsecret. Maybe they are down the hall now. I don't know where they are, \nbut they are plotting right now on how to pass an immigration plan. We \njust can't wait to see what it is so we can just vote for whatever they \ndecide we ought to have. You know what they tell us? We can't get \nworkers. We have to have foreign workers. Yet we have never had more \npeople on welfare, never had more people on food stamps.\n  In 2001 we spent $20 billion on food stamps. Last year we spent $80 \nbillion on food stamps. It has gone up fourfold, but we are told there \nare not enough Americans to do work. Somehow this welfare office needs \nto be dealing with this problem, and we need to have a consolidated \nprogram. But there is no plan in this budget, and no plan that has been \noffered on the floor.\n  Any time anybody makes a suggestion that we make reform, they get \nattacked. I have been attacked. I offered an amendment when the \nAgriculture bill was moving last year and we were on track to spend \n$800 billion over 10 years on food stamps. We found there was a \ncategorical eligibility provision that was being abused substantially, \nallowing people who basically did not qualify for food stamps under the \nprogram to get the food stamps. So I proposed to close it. It would \nhave saved $10 billion. We would spend $790 billion over 10 years \nrather than $800 billion. And I was attacked. I was kind of shocked, \nreally. It was said that I was trying to balance the budget on the \nbacks of hungry people. I wasn't trying to balance the budget on hungry \npeople, I was trying to close an abuse of the program and, actually, \nthankfully, would have saved $10 billion--$1 billion a year over 10 \nyears.\n  So this is where we are. We have a firm resistance to reform \nthroughout the system, and it is not a little bit of money. These 80-\nsome-odd welfare programs--hold your hat--over the next 10 years are \nsupposed to grow, as predicted by the Congressional Budget Office, by \n80 percent--80 percent.\n  My fine budget staff has looked at those numbers and they have \nconcluded if we could improve those 83 programs and let them grow at 60 \npercent instead of 80 percent, we could save the taxpayers $1 trillion \nover 10 years.\n  I kid you not, $1 trillion. This goes a long way toward balancing our \nbudget and helps us in a lot of different ways. If it is done right, it \nwill be better for the people who need help than the present 83 \ndisjointed programs that have no coherence and no focus on helping poor \npeople actually improve their lives.\n  I grew up in the country. I grew up with poor people. I was poor. We \ndidn't have central heating. I have no doubt our income was below the \npoverty line most of the time I was growing up. We had a garden. My \ndaddy had a country store. We got by. But we didn't have any money. I \nremember when we got our first air conditioner--and it gets hot in \nAlabama. We moved from one room to the other when you turned it off. \nYou didn't want to pay for electricity you didn't need. We had a \nfireplace in the living room. That was the only heat we had. The \nfireplace burned in the winter all the time. We cut our own wood. I \nworked construction in the summers both summers I was going to college, \nsaving a few bucks being a carpenter's helper and working out in the \nAlabama heat. It didn't hurt me. And this idea that people aren't \nwilling to work and we have to import foreign labor and we have to give \npeople welfare because we can't find them a job, while businesses say \nwe don't have enough workers, is somehow a messed-up idea. This is not \nhelping. We have got to confront this problem. There is no plan to \nconfront this problem or talk about it in any realistic way. It is time \nfor us to be honest about this country's problems.\n  We do have a spending problem. Spending is going up faster than the \neconomy is growing, and it will always create a deficit. You can't \ncreate something out of nothing. Julie Andrews sang, ``Nothing comes \nfrom nothing. Nothing ever could.'' That is so true. So we need to have \na government that is leaner, that is more productive, that does more \nfor the American people than it is doing now for less money.\n  My office has been spending less than we are allocated every year. I \nbelieve this year the Senate has reduced its budget about 10 percent \nover the last couple of years. I am down about 20 percent. This idea \nthat you can't cut spending throughout this government is one of the \nmost ridiculous ideas that has ever been raised.\n  I was a U.S. Attorney. I managed an office of lawyers and staff. When \nRonald Reagan came in and we didn't have any money, we watched every \ndime we spent. The former Deputy Attorney General of the United States, \nLarry Thompson, was from Atlanta and I was U.S. Attorney in Alabama. We \nwere such dyed-in-the-wool frugal Reagan hawks, when we were made U.S. \nAttorney we came to a conference and we roomed together, in separate \nbeds, but we thought it was cheaper and saved money for the taxpayers. \nThis is the kind of mentality that needs to get back into what we are \ndoing, and I would say that it is time for us to confront this.\n  The vision of the Members of this side, and I think a lot of Members \nof that side, is not that far apart. But I want to be clear about a \ncouple things. This budget needs to be put on a path to balance. It can \nbe done without cutting spending in any dramatic way. All you have to \ndo is reduce the rate of growth in spending. The budget will balance in \n10 years. We need to do that. We need to plan to do that. As I \nexplained before, the debt is already pulling down economic growth in \nAmerica. It is pulling down the growth we have. The debt has reached \nsuch a level, 104 percent of GDP, that it is above the limit and the \nlevel that the International Monetary Fund, the Bank for International \nSettlements, the European Central Bank, and the Rogoff-Reinhart study \nsay begins to pull down growth. We are losing jobs, we are losing \npromotions, we are losing pay raises as a result of this debt right \nnow.\n  We share the view on both sides of the aisle that we need to be \nlooking to create growth. Our colleagues say, Let's keep doing what we \nhave been doing the last number of years. We have another stimulus \npackage, we have another $100 billion, and we are going to borrow this \nmoney because we are already in debt, and to spend an additional $100 \nbillion requires borrowing an additional $100 billion, so we are going \nto borrow $100 billion and we are going to spend it, and this is going \nto make the economy stronger. Sorry. We have been there, done that. We \nsay no. We have got to end this mentality. We need to make this \ngovernment leaner and more productive. We need to have this government \ndo things that create growth and jobs that do not add to the debt.\n  What are some of those things? Simplified taxes, eliminate \nunnecessary regulations, more American energy. Those are the kinds of \nthings we can do that don't cost money that create jobs. Complete the \nKeystone Pipeline. Don't keep sending money to Venezuela or Saudi \nArabia. Create jobs in America. Ask the people in North Dakota; they \nhave got growth and prosperity as a result of energy production. These \nare the kinds of things we can do and we believe in and will continue \nto work for.\n  I would say that maybe, even though we have a big difference--and \nthis budget will be quite different from the House budget--I don't say \nit is impossible that in conference some sort of more global agreement \ncould be reached to put America on a sound path. We will have to deal \nwith the entitlements. Entitlements represent half of the spending--\nand, with interest, more than half of the spending. Medicare, Social \nSecurity, those are growing well above the inflation rate and their \ngrowth level needs to be contained a little bit. We can make them \nsound, and people can retire and know that Medicare will be there for \nthem, it won't fail, and that Social Security\n\n[[Page S2013]]\n\nwill be there for them, it won't fail. And we are going to stop adding \nto our debt until it reaches such a level that it could not only slow \ngrowth but could cause a financial crisis, as we had in 2007, and as \nthey are having now in some of the European countries and that so many \ncountries have had over the years.\n  We are excited to have a budget on the floor for the first time in 4 \nyears. It does provide an opportunity for the American people--as our \nchair, Senator Murray, said--to compare the visions for America. It \nalso provides an opportunity for our Members to learn about what things \ncost, how much you can get through tax increases, what kind of spending \ncuts are required, whether we have to cut or how much we can grow \nspending and still balance the budget. These kinds of things are \nlearned when a bill actually goes to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, President Obama, being interviewed on \nABC by George Stephanopoulos, not only said ``my goal is not to chase--\na balanced budget'' but he also said, ``we don't have an immediate \ncrisis in terms of debt,'' and ``in fact, for the next 10 years, it's \ngonna be in a sustainable place.''\n  I would say two things about that. He appointed Mr. Erskine Bowles to \nbe chairman of the fiscal commission. They spent quite a lot of time \nworking on this debt question. They took testimony from experts, they \nexamined documents, and they did what a good, public, spirited group \nwould do. Mr. Bowles was Chief of Staff for President Clinton and a \nvery successful businessman. Alan Simpson, his Cochair, was a former \nRepublican Senator from Wyoming.\n  That is not what they told us. In the committee, 2 years ago, in the \nBudget Committee--maybe a little over 2 years now--they gave a joint \nstatement in which they said this Nation has never faced a more \npredictable financial crisis.\n  What they were saying was the level of debt we are operating on, the \nunsustainability of the debt path, was so great that we will have some \nsort of fiscal crisis.\n  I remember about that same time, the Chairman of the Fed, Mr. \nBernanke, testified that we have all these outyears and we talk about \nthe debt numbers and all that, but we don't have to worry about them. I \nam paraphrasing, but this was pretty close to what he said. I think \nthese were his exact words: But it will never happen.\n  What he basically told us was there would be a fiscal crisis before \nwe get this far down the road--the demographics, the aging population, \nfewer workers, greater debt every year--mushrooming in the outyears.\n  I am troubled the President thinks that as a matter of fact, the next \n10 years is going to be in a sustainable place. I don't believe he \nknows that. I will tell my colleagues a couple reasons why. Senator \nStabenow had a chart about how great the economy or the fiscal \nsituation of the country looked about the time President Bush took \noffice. The last month of President Clinton's term in office was \nnegative growth. I think that was the first month of negative growth in \nmaybe 8 years. In fact, when President Clinton took office, he didn't \ninherit a recession, regardless of what the myth is around here. Former \nPresident Bush did have a recession in his second year or so of his \nterm and he took action and the economy bounced back. About the time \nPresident Clinton took office, the economy was growing and it continued \nto grow through the decade. We don't know all the forces. We talk about \nit. We play politics about it. But nobody knows precisely what moves an \neconomy, whether it was something 10 years ago or something 10 months \nago that caused the difficulty. We make guesses and we do our best \njudgment.\n  So here we go. In early 2000, I am on the Budget Committee and Mr. \nGreenspan testified--the maestro, the guru, the Federal Reserve \nChairman, the greatest we had ever had; the economy had long years of \ngrowth. He told the committee we are going to have surpluses as far as \nthe eye can see. He discussed with the Budget Committee what would \nhappen when we had all these surpluses and we would pay down the entire \ndebt of the United States of America. Then he asked us what we would \ndo. What is the Federal Government going to do with the extra money? \nAre they going to buy the bonds of Venezuela? Does it buy British \nbonds? What does it do with its money? Does it buy property? This was \nthe mindset in early 2000, and he was the Federal Reserve Chairman. \nDidn't he see the demographics? Didn't he recognize--there was a little \ncaution in his statement, but he was very positive.\n  I went back and read it again recently, because it teaches me that \nthis man, at the peak of his powers--one of the greatest economic minds \nin history; at least it was so felt at that time--completely missed it, \nI have to tell my colleagues. He didn't think we had a problem in the \nfuture with debt. He didn't say by 2009 we are going to be running \ntrillion-dollar deficits, right? So this makes me a bit humble about \nour ability to predict.\n  Mr. Bowles said we are on a path to a debt crisis. That is what he \ntold us in the committee. I believe Chairman Conrad or ranking member \nJudd Gregg asked him: When?\n  He said: I think about 2 years.\n  Two years came and we didn't have a debt crisis. So now the President \nof the United States is saying we can continue for 10 years, no \nproblem, no worries. I am happy. You are happy. We don't have to cut \nspending. We need to keep borrowing. We need to keep running up debt \nbecause we absolutely don't want to have austerity. We don't want to \nhave austerity. We want to be happy and spend. So that is the deal.\n  I am telling my colleagues, nobody knows. It can happen just that \nquick. Kent Conrad told me--we were standing right over there--he said \nthe rate we are heading is coming off that wall like a rubber ball at \nwarp speed. He was on the debt commission, the fiscal commission. He \nwas worried about the fact of our unsustainability on the debt course.\n  Things look good. The Sun is shining out there today. We don't want \nto talk about that. Who wants to be negative? Who wants to be Dr. Doom? \nDo my colleagues remember Dr. Doom or Nouriel Roubini, who said: We \nwere going to have a debt crisis in 2005 or 2006. I am not sure when he \npredicted that. He said: The banks are borrowing too much money. It is \nunsustainable. We are going to have a crisis.\n  Months went by and we didn't have a crisis. One year went by, we \ndidn't have a crisis. They mocked him. They called him Dr. Gloom. After \n2007, when the bottom fell out and we had the worst recession since \nWorld War II, the reasons it happened were just what Mr. Roubini said. \nPeople said: Dr. Gloom wasn't so wrong after all. Maybe we should have \nlistened to him.\n  I am just telling my colleagues, I believe we have a responsibility \nas men and women of public service, managing the finances of the United \nStates of America, and we have a President who is in denial.\n  I think it is time for this Congress to assert itself and say we are \nnot going to risk this country. I believe our debt is already too high. \nI believe it without a doubt. It is a fact. The Rogoff and Reinhart \nstudy was based on public debt, and our public debt is now over 100 \npercent of GDP. It is greater than the entire economy. That means we \npull down and we place our country at risk because we are slowing \ngrowth, as I indicated earlier.\n  But this is what Secretary Geithner said in 2011 before the Budget \nCommittee. I asked him what did he think about the Rogoff and Reinhart \nstudy, because it was troubling to the committee. Everybody on the \ncommittee knew about it. The fiscal commission people had consulted \nabout it. We had Carmen Reinhart testify before the committee and then \nagain a little later. So I asked him about it. This was his answer to \nmy question to him, as I recall:\n\n       It's an excellent study. And you could say in some ways \n     what you summarize from it, understates the risks, because \n     it's not just that governments or countries that live with \n     very high debt-to-GDP ratios are consigned to weaker growth.\n\n\n[[Page S2014]]\n\n\n  As I have been contending throughout the day--\n\n       They're consigned to the damage that comes from periodic \n     financial crises as well.\n\n  February 17, 2011, Secretary Geithner, President Obama's own \nSecretary.\n  So he was warning us that when the debt gets this high, we are in a \ndanger zone.\n  We know there are some countries that have more difficult problems \nthan we. There was an article recently from the CATO Institute talking \nabout some of the countries in the world. Japan is one of the most \ndangerous. What if the third, fourth largest economy in the world, \nJapan--one of our key trading partners--was to have an economic \ncollapse such as Greece? Do my colleagues think it can't happen? I \ndon't think it can't happen. I don't know. They are running way too \nhigh a debt-to-GDP ratio. Their population is aging even more quickly \nthan ours.\n  Then we have France and Spain and Italy. Any one of those countries \nhad an economy so large they can't be bailed out like Greece. What \nwould happen if Europe were to go into turmoil? I am not predicting \nthat to happen, but I am telling my colleagues we are on a path where I \ndon't believe any responsible person can say it couldn't happen to us, \nand we could be embroiled in this too. The worst thing that could \nhappen to us is we have to face a fiscal crisis where we get our debt \nunder control at a time when the country is in a recession as a result \nof financial mismanagement. It would make it be an utter nightmare. As \nmany experts have said, we have shifted a lot of debt from the private \nsector to the government. The government picked up liabilities it had \nno business picking up and the result is it has increased its debt \nsubstantially.\n  I am very concerned that we not treat this lightly. I am very unhappy \nthe President of the United States who, to my knowledge, never had an \neconomics course in his entire life--a community organizer--is going on \nnational television when the needle of our debt is in the red zone, by \nany estimation, and he blithely says: We don't have an immediate crisis \nin terms of debt. In fact, for the next 10 years, it is going to be in \na sustainable place.\n  I don't believe he is correct to say that. I have not heard any \neconomists say that with full authority, certainly not a lot of them, \nand I am worried about where we are.\n  There is another chart I wanted to show about the question of taxes. \nThis is a chart that I saw in Barron's magazine just a few weeks ago. \nGene Epstein did this chart. On the cover of Barron's was a picture of \nthe President, having made his State of the Union Address, and the \ncaption on the front of the newspaper was ``The way to Greece'' or \nsomething like that, and it was a very serious analysis of the deep, \nsystemic debt problems this Nation has, and a plea for us to act, to \nmove forward and avoid the risks we are now undertaking.\n  One part of what they did was to actually analyze what we could do \nwith more taxes, particularly taxes on upper income people, and they \nran the numbers. I believe this is an accurate run of the numbers. On \nthe left side, it has the public debt as a percentage of the GDP and on \nthe right at the bottom are the years over time. Mr. Epstein ran it \nbased on increasing taxes and increasing taxes a lot.\n  His first run was the purple line, how much the debt would go up; how \nmuch the debt would go up if the current tax rate stayed in effect. \nThis is the purple line. It grows a little faster than the green line \nand the red line. It grows a little faster because the taxes are a \nlittle lower than his next two estimates.\n  Then he estimated for the wealthy people who were raised from 35 to \n40 percent, what if they were raised to 50 percent? In Alabama, it is \nabout average. We have a 5-percent income tax in our State. So for the \nwealthy, making it 50 percent, plus paying 5 percent to the State, he \nis paying a pretty big chunk of his money right off the top. But let's \nassume it went up there. It has almost no impact on the debt course of \nAmerica according to the Barron's analysis.\n  The third one, the red one is based on raising the tax rate of upper \nincome people to 50 percent and then rolling back all the tax cuts \nPresident Bush had for the lower income people, the middle-class people \nwho got substantial reductions in their rates and we have been \noperating that for about 13 years now and we made those permanent.\n  President Bush was attacked for having tax cuts, but I am pleased to \nsee my Democratic colleagues are joining with the Republicans to make \n99 percent of those tax rates permanent. It must not have been so evil \nif everybody overwhelmingly voted to make them permanent. So if we \nraised all those rates and had a 50-percent tax increase on the \nwealthy, we still hadn't changed the debt course of America.\n  What does that say? It says the debt problem in America is a spending \nproblem, and a big part of that spending problem is the huge mandatory \nprograms we have.\n  I am a lawyer. What is a mandatory program? It means when you reach \n66, 67, you walk in and ask for your Social Security check and they \nhave to pay you whether there is any money in the bank or not, whether \nthe government has any money or not. The government has to borrow the \nmoney and pay your check because you are entitled to it as a matter of \nlaw at a certain age you qualify. Many of our entitlement programs are \nbased on income. If your income is below a certain level, you are \nentitled to the money whether Uncle Sam has it or not, and that is \nbased on law. That is based on legislation Congress passed that \nentitled people under certain circumstances to obtain Federal money and \nget it as a matter of entitlement.\n  When those programs are surging at 6 percent a year--Medicaid, the \npoor person's insurance program is projected to grow 8 percent a year \nover the next decade, 117 percent over the next 10 years--when those \nprograms are growing at that rate and the economy is growing at 2 \npercent, you have a problem. You do not have to go to the Harvard \nBusiness School to know that. You really do not have to go to Harvard \nto know that.\n\n  When I talk to the American people, they understand it fully. They \nexpect that we are going to have to make tough choices in this country \nto get the country on the right path, and they are girding themselves \nto support such tough choices, but they want them fair. They are \nwilling to tighten their belt, but they do not want somebody who never \nworks and lays around and watches TV all day, the soap operas, to have \nan advantage over people who are out working hard every day. But, \nanyway, people are prepared for that. The good news is, that as the \neconomy grows, we do not have to cut spending, we just have to reduce \nthe rate of growth in spending. This is not a myth I am talking about. \nThis is absolute fact. You can spend more. This government can spend \nmore every year. We can spend more at the rate of 3.4 percent, instead \nof increasing it at 5.4 percent, and the budget balances over 10 years. \nHow much better is that? Most people think we have to have cuts across \nthe board.\n  Now some programs are going to have to be cut. And let's be frank. \nWhat is the real challenge for us? Social Security and Medicare are \ngreat programs that our seniors depend on, and can grow steadily, can \ngrow more than 3.4 percent, really. But those programs have a double \nproblem. Not only do we want to see a cost of living occur for our \nseniors, but we have more seniors on the program every year. So this \nmakes the numbers harder to deal with.\n  So you can say: Well, Social Security is just going to grow 4 percent \ninstead of 5.5 percent and people will not lose much money. They will \nget a $4 increase instead of a $5.5 increase. No, no, it is more \ncomplicated than that because since you have more people on Social \nSecurity and Medicare, because of the age of the population that we \nhave, it will be a larger impact than that--not disastrous, \nsustainable.\n  And we can do other things. We can say: Well, we want to work a \nlittle longer. We want to change the rate of the increase, the \ninflation index that most experts tell us should be altered under a new \nsystem that would save some money on the inflation index. So that is \nthe kind of thing people have been talking about. The Gang of 6 talked \nabout it. The President talked about it. Vice President Biden talked \nabout it. The debt commission talked about it. The gang, the 12 people, \nin the\n\n[[Page S2015]]\n\nBudget Control Act, tried to talk about a serious alteration of our \nspending path in which we fix Social Security and put it on a sound \npath, we fix Medicare and put it on a sound path, and we fix the entire \nbudget of the United States in a way that is sustainable.\n  I would say people I talk to in the business community, people I talk \nto who testify before the committee, experts and just common people, \ntell me repeatedly: If you guys put this country on a sound path, so we \nknew we could see what the future is, we could plan for the future, and \nwe would know our finances are getting better and moving to a balanced \nbudget instead of getting worse. We believe people would not lose \nmoney, they would spend more money. We would have more growth. More \npeople would be working and not drawing welfare and unemployment \ninsurance, and the budget of the United States would start improving \nright there because more people would pay taxes and fewer people would \nneed help from the government.\n  That is the spiral we need to be on. We are now still muddling \nthrough with exceedingly low growth, and they are still predicting low \ninflation. So you consider Social Security, maybe increasing it 6 \npercent a year, and inflation is just 2 percent. The Congressional \nBudget Office is predicting that inflation will be 2.2 percent, I \nthink, a year, equaling almost 25 percent over 10 years. That is how \nmuch inflation will add over 10 years. Who knows? But we have kept low \nrates longer than anybody thought. The economy is not moving. If the \neconomy actually jumped 4 percent or 5 percent growth for 2 or 3 years, \nyou probably would have a jump in inflation. Obviously, CBO is not \nexpecting that. They are expecting only slow growth over the next 10 \nyears, and I think that is consistent with the consensus of independent \nanalysts. So I wanted to share that thought.\n  The question before the House is--and all our colleagues need to \nconfront it honestly--is this budget the kind of budget that puts \nAmerica on a sound path? Is it what we need to do at this moment in \nhistory to change the debt course of America, to create confidence, to \ncreate the kind of growth that will increase that 2-percent growth, to \nget it to 3, 3.5, 4 percent?\n  Just 2 years ago, the Congressional Budget Office projected growth \nfor 2013--the year we are in--would be 4.6 percent. The year before \nthat, they predicted, last year, 2012, that we would have over 3 \npercent, 3.6 percent, something like that, growth. We have fallen way \nbelow that both years. I think the reason is the debt is pulling down \ngrowth, at least that is part of the reason. But regardless, the truth \nis, we are having to adjust ourselves to what Bill Gross at PIMCO, the \nlargest bond group in the world, would call a new normal. The new \nnormal is, we are not likely to see 5, 6-percent growth even in really \ngreat times in the next 10 or 15 years--maybe the next 20 or 30 years. \nWe are just not likely to, for a lot of reasons. Of course, nobody \nknows. Mr. Greenspan thought we were going to have surpluses, and we \ndid not. And we could have growth we are not expecting. Nobody knows. \nBut we just have to make the best judgment we have, and the best \njudgment we have is that we are not on a sound path.\n  So we are responsible leaders, and we have to ask ourselves, is the \nbudget here going to do the right thing? We must remember and can never \nforget who will suffer the most if we have a fiscal crisis. Won't it be \nthe poor? Won't it be the people in the most fragile working \nenvironments? Won't it be the people with less skills? Won't they be \nthe ones who would suffer the most? Don't we have an obligation as a \nSenate to reach out to the House and say: We get it. This is dangerous. \nWe do not know for sure where we are going. But we know. Shame on us if \nwe allow decent, hard-working people--struggling to get by right now--\nto get hammered by another fiscal crisis that Erskine Bowles and Alan \nSimpson virtually guaranteed was on the way?\n  I think we have a duty. I think we have a responsibility. I think \nwhen the American people find out it is not going to take massive \nslashing of spending, as our colleagues say--a lot of the programs can \nbe more efficient than they have ever been, and we get just as much \nbenefit, even if they do not get as much money. There has not been any \nreform, any management improvements in this government in decades.\n  I will just say politically, I thought that was the greatest offer \nGovernor Romney had. He was a very good manager. In my opinion, we have \nhad enough speechmakers, we have had enough war Presidents, we have had \nenough grand and glorious stuff. We need somebody to run this \ngovernment, like the Presiding Officer ran the State of Virginia. It \ntakes hard work, and you have to stay on top of it. It would have been \ngreat for us to have had a real top management, so that every Cabinet \nperson, when they are hired, understands they have a duty to produce \nmore for less for the American people, and every subcabinet and \nsubcabinet and subcabinet person, and every department head gets the \nmessage, from top leadership on down: You are expected--as Larry \nThompson and I did--to share a hotel room if need be to save running up \ndebt in the U.S. Government.\n\n  This budget does not do it. I think we quoted earlier what the \nWashington Post said on March 15:\n\n       In short, this [budget] document gives voters no reason to \n     believe that Democrats have a viable plan for--or even a \n     responsible public assessment of--the country's long-term \n     fiscal predicament.\n\n  That is a serious condemnation.\n  What about USA Today, I guess maybe the widest read publication of \nits kind in the country? A USA Today editorial:\n\n       The plan produced by the Senate Budget Committee Chairman \n     Patty Murray . . . is a disappointing document. It is a \n     namby-pamby plan that underwhelms at every turn. The Murray \n     budget neither balances the budget nor reins in entitlements \n     . . . the nation would be helped if Democrats were to embrace \n     Ryan's goal of a balanced budget.\n\n  That is USA Today. They are not a rightwing publication, but they \nhave written some good material on the budget. So has the Washington \nPost. Both of those have covered the budget situation more than most \npublications--both of them--and they have been trying to say to the \nCongress and to the President: You guys need to get together and do \nsomething. So both these editorials reflect a very informed judgment by \ntwo independent publications of national repute that the Senate--which \nthey have been watching--has failed to produce a budget that puts the \ncountry on a sound path. I just have to tell you, I think they are \ntotally correct. I wish it were not so.\n  Investor's Business Daily:\n\n       [An] IBD review of the budget data shows that the Senate \n     vastly overstates the size of its spending cuts.\n\n  Boy, that is correct. They vastly overstate how much spending is cut \nin this bill. It goes on to say:\n\n       In fact, it could be that the Senate [budget] would, if \n     enacted, increase federal spending by hundreds of billions of \n     dollars.\n\n  Was Investor's Business Daily correct? Yes. Spending increases under \nthis budget. Spending is not decreased at all under this budget, \nalthough we are told that it does. And we are told 20-some-odd times it \nis a balanced plan. They even go so far as to say it is a balanced \nbudget. They have said it is a balanced plan so much, they started \nsaying it is a balanced budget. It is nothing nowhere close to being a \nbalanced budget. What they mean by ``balanced'' is, they promised that \nthere will be $1 trillion in tax increases and $1 trillion in spending \nreductions. And it increases spending. Give me a break. There is not a \none-to-one. It increases spending. There is no cut in spending off the \ncurrent law we are now on.\n  They tried to claim credit for the Budget Control Act almost 2 years \nago. President Obama resisted that. You remember how he just threatened \nthe whole government was going to sink into the ocean? Why? Because we \nwould not raise the debt ceiling. The Republicans said: We have to have \nsome cuts, Mr. President. We have to do something about the debt \ncourse. We cannot continue. We are not going to allow you to continue \nrunning with the credit card of the people of America if you do not \nshow that you are changing your habits and you are containing some of \nyour lust to spend.\n  So, finally, an agreement. He hated it worse than anything. Finally, \nan agreement was done. He signed it. I agree if you will raise my debt \nceiling right now, for $2.1 trillion, I promise in\n\n[[Page S2016]]\n\nthe future that I will cut spending $2.1 trillion. Over 10 years. If \nyou let me do it over 10 years, OK, I will sign it. But I have to have \nmy debt ceiling now.\n  Less than 2 years later we have already increased the debt ceiling \n$2.1 trillion. We are right up there again having to raise the debt \nceiling again. It will be a matter of weeks that this has to be \nconfronted again. Well, what about the spending cuts?\n  Before the ink was dry on that agreement signed by the President \nhimself--I have the document right here. In blue ink, ``Barack Obama'' \nright there, agree to cut $2.1 trillion in spending over 10 years. This \nwas not a big cut. If spending were flat for 10 years, we would have \nspent $37 trillion. As I recall, if under the baseline then in effect \nwe were expected to grow to $49 trillion over 10 years--$49 trillion. \nThis would have reduced it to $47 trillion.\n  So we reduced the growth of spending from $37 trillion to $47 \ntrillion instead of $49 trillion. You would have thought we were \nthrowing the sink in the country into the ocean. But in January, 6 \nmonths later, he proposes a budget which wipes out 60 percent of that \nagreement, those savings. So I am just going to tell you the way I \nfelt. I have talked to my Republican colleagues. You know, we all--none \nof us are perfect. Sometimes we make improvident promises. We cannot \njust fulfill them. We cannot honor them. I try not to do that, but I \nhave done it. Any person who is honest knows they have had to face \nthose choices. But I am not voting to change the sequester. I am \nprepared to change it, and I support totally the spreading out of the \ncuts. They are too much on the Defense Department. I can explain how \nmuch it hammers the Defense Department. It is not acceptable.\n  But I am going to tell you, I told the American people that the \nCongress of the United States agreed to cut $2.1 trillion in exchange \nfor raising the debt ceiling $2.1 trillion. And 6 months later, I am \nnot changing; 18 months later, I am not changing. If we give up on \nthat, we have no credibility whatsoever. The American people should \nnever trust this Congress again. They ought to vote all of us out of \noffice.\n  That was a solemn promise made before the whole world that we would \nsustain these cuts. President Obama has not stopped trying to eliminate \nthem. This budget does just that. It eliminates 60 percent of the \nBudget Control Act cuts. It eliminates the sequester entirely. It is \nabsolutely unacceptable. It will not happen. I do not know why anybody \nwould want to vote for the budget. A vote for this budget is a vote to \ngo back on a promise that was made in August 2011 to act a little bit \nresponsibly when the debt ceiling of the country was raised.\n  The Wall Street Journal, March 15, right after the budget comes out. \nThey have been very critical. This is just one of them. Well, first, \nPolitico, March 17. A Washington beltway publication, Politico--they \nlike to dig up stuff. This is what they said, ``To win over her caucus, \nMurray begins from the left of Obama himself.''\n  Apparently, Politico's conclusion is that the budget that came \nthrough committee was driven by people to the left of President Obama. \nI know this: Last year the chairman of the Budget Committee, Kent \nConrad, was prepared to bring a budget to the floor. My staff and I \nspent weeks preparing for the markup. They met in a Democratic \nconference. Some of the more liberal members hollered they could not \naccept Kent Conrad's budget, the Democratic budget he was going to set \nforth. So they, basically, refused to let him mark up a budget in the \nBudget Committee and refused to bring it to the floor of the Senate \neven though U.S. law called for the Budget Committee to have hearings \nand called for a bill to be brought to the floor. They just refused to \ndo it in violation of plain law.\n  So the Wall Street Journal said: The bill manages the unique \nachievement of offering no net nondefense spending cuts and no \nentitlement reform worth the name, while proposing to raise $1.5 \ntrillion in new tax revenue in such a way that would ruin the prospects \nfor bipartisan tax reform.\n  Let me stop right there. Our colleagues keep saying we are going to \nclose loopholes and we are going to raise revenue and nobody is going \nto have to pay more. Well, these loopholes, as Senator Grassley showed \nus from the Finance Committee chart, these are real serious deductions. \nThey are programs that are deeply entrenched, and many of them our \nDemocratic colleagues have protected and expanded with great tenacity. \nThey will never vote to give them up probably unless some epiphany \noccurs around here. So how are we going to get tax reform?\n  Last week at the Budget Committee hearing the chief Democratic \nwitness testified that he believes the corporate tax rate in America \nwas unacceptably high, that we now have the highest corporate tax rate \nin the developed world, and that 35 percent is not acceptable. He said \nit needs to be the mid-twenties. This is not the Republican witness, \nbut the Republican witness agreed with him. Most Republicans agreed \nwith this approach. Many of the Democrats did.\n  So he said: You close loopholes on corporations, make the tax \nsimpler, more growth oriented, you can bring the tax rate down to 25 \npercent without in any way losing revenue. You can make it revenue \nneutral. So that was an interesting thing.\n  I asked him as a followup: But if you close the loopholes on \ncorporations, if you close the loopholes on corporations and raise \nrevenue, do you not need that money so you can reduce the rate from 35 \nto 25?\n  He said: Yes. All of it should be dedicated to rate reduction. We \nhave Senator Ron Wyden, a Democratic Senator, Senator Max Baucus, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, all believe this needs to be done.\n  A lot of work has been done on this for several years. The President \nhas even indicated that this is the kind of approach that is \nworthwhile. But our colleagues, claiming they are going to close \nloopholes, do not save the money for tax reduction. They want to take \nthe new revenue raised from closing loopholes and spend it. Then it is \nnot available for the bipartisan tax reform to which the Wall Street \nJournal made a reference.\n  That is when I asked the witness: Do you not have to save this money \nto reduce rates at the end of the year?\n  He said: Yes, you have to save these loopholes, these deductions--\nreally most of them are perfectly legitimate deductions that businesses \nuse. But they are going to take them away from them, in effect raising \nthe amount of taxes they pay. But they were going to bring the rates \ndown.\n\n  That is the bipartisan plan that was in the works for a long time. \nMr. Kleinbard is our witness. This is what he said: Corporate income \ntax statutory rate of 35 percent is today far outside world norms. The \nrate needs to come down. I, therefore, conceive of corporate tax reform \nas a roughly revenue-neutral undertaking in which the corporate tax \nbase will be broadened through closing business tax expenditures and \nloopholes and the resulting revenues used to pay down the corporate \nrate.\n  That was March 5 in our committee. I know a lot of Senators, \nDemocrats on the committee, agreed with that. If we look at the budget, \nthe new revenue obtained from closing loopholes, really closing \ndeductions and some tax expenditures--liberals have started calling \ndeductions tax expenditures. So if you have a charitable deduction or \nyou have an interest deduction or you have some sort of depreciation as \na business, those are not deductions anymore. They have become tax \nexpenditures. So it is like the United States Government is mad at you \nbecause you did not send enough money.\n  But the truth is, it is the corporate person's money or the \ncorporation's money or the private individual's money. When you \neliminate his deductions, you make him or her pay more taxes. So Mr. \nKleinbard was crystal clear. This is what the bipartisan discussions \nhave been. The Wall Street Journal is exactly right. If you spend that \nmoney that you raised from closing loopholes, expenditures, and \ndeductions, you do not have it to reduce rates. You cannot fix the tax \nreform.\n  The Wall Street Journal goes on to say:\n\n       As a statement of governing principles, the Senate \n     Democratic budget shows that if they get the chance, they \n     would govern like they did in 2009 and 2010. Much higher \n     taxes to fund much higher spending to finance a much bigger \n     government. It is the status quo only more so.\n\n  I have to say, I think that is correct. Hard for me to understand how \nanybody can dispute that. Next. I have\n\n[[Page S2017]]\n\nbeen saying--I have not heard much pushback--that the sequester \nelimination which allows the expenditure of $1.2 trillion more than we \nare presently on a path to extend, that this elimination of the \nsequester was not scored in the Democratic budget.\n  When I asked the staff members, he said: Well, you know, we never did \nintend to make that permanent. It was always temporary. Then he said: \nWell, we got billions of dollars in Paul Ryan's budgets over here.\n  I said: No, no. I am talking about this budget. You claim you are not \nscoring, as an increase in spending, $1.2 trillion, which you allowed \nto occur by eliminating the reduction in spending required in current \nlaw that is part of the law of the United States today and will not be \nchanged?\n  This is baloney. Surely, Congress will never change this. Surely, we \nwill not go back on the promise we made in 2011 when we raised the debt \nceiling. But, anyway, this is what the Associated Press said about it: \nBecause the Democrats want to restore $1.2 trillion in automatic \nspending cuts over the same period, cuts imposed by Washington's \nfailure to reach a broader budget pact--the committee did not reach an \nagreement, so these automatic cuts occurred--Murray's blueprint \nincreases spending slightly when compared with current policy.\n  So you take the $1.2 trillion there, and you have tax increases over \nhere, but the increases in spending are greater than the taxes. They \nconclude that it increases spending overall, increases spending \noverall.\n  The chairman, and probably the Budget Committee Members who support \nthis, want to assert somehow this is a one-for-one budget, a balanced \nplan, a balanced budget amendment. You have $1 trillion in tax \nincreases and $1 trillion in spending cuts, but they are not there.\n  This chart is a very important chart on the subject I am talking \nabout. It is, I believe, pretty much not disputable. I don't like to \nraise this, but I am not going to take it.\n  Mr. Lew came before our committee, the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, and he said our budget will not add to the debt, \nspends only money we have and puts us on a path to pay down the \ndeficit.\n  I asked Mr. Lew--he said it on national television, CNN with Candy \nCrowley. He said it with other networks too when he announced his \nbudget. Three days later, he was at the Budget Committee. I asked him \nwas that accurate. He said it was accurate.\n  It absolutely was not accurate. His budget never produced a single \nyear in which the deficit fell below $600 billion. Yet he told the \nAmerican people squarely in the eye his budget would stop adding to the \ndebt, spend only money we have, and allow us to pay down the debt.\n  This is one of the greatest misrepresentations in history. We are \nnever going to have bipartisan agreement in this Congress until we \nlearn to be honest about numbers. This budget is not honest about \nnumbers, I need to tell you.\n  They claim a big savings and big reduction in spending and totally \noverlook this. Where is the deficit? They claim they reduce the deficit \nby $ 1.85 trillion, $1.850 billion. Let's look at that number. What \nabout the sequester I have been talking about? They eliminate sequester \nand spending goes up $1.223 trillion.\n  Was this scored in their number? No. They tell us we have 1.85, and \nwe have to take off 1.2 because they didn't score the obvious increase \nin spending that their budget plan for the next 10 years includes. Take \nthat off. We have looked at it more carefully. It took us a while to \nfind this and took a while to get these in the budget numbers, but we \nhave a good staff.\n  They found out, unlike what we thought at first, there was no pay-for \nfor the doctors. For the last number of years, we found the payment \nschedule for doctors is totally inadequate based on a law passed in the \nnineties which has cut their payment to a degree that if we cut them \nanother 20-some-odd percent, they would quit taking patients. They \ncouldn't operate.\n  We put the money in every year because we need to put the money in or \nelse they will not treat our patients. They can't afford to. Everybody, \nRepublicans and Democrats, we hate it. We wish it weren't so, but it is \nevery year we need to confront this thing which should have long been \nmade a permanent fix. Every year it hasn't been, so every year we need \nto find the money.\n  We also found the 2009 stimulus extension in the bill which continued \nmore borrowing and spending for a stimulus was not accounted for. You \nadd those, and there is another $348 billion which ought to be scored. \nIt leaves us with a subtotal of $279 billion. That sounds nice, but \nthat is not correct.\n  Where are we next? Is there anything in this budget we have found \nthat is not sound, gimmicky, which misrepresents the facts? Yes, there \nis, a big one. That is the war spending.\n  President Obama has long been very late in producing his budget. It \nshould have been here in the Senate February 4, and it still hasn't \nbeen produced. It is one of the oddest things I have ever seen. He \nbasically punted to the Congress and refused to lay out the budget the \nlaw requires him to submit. He violates it all the time.\n  People ask me all the time, why does the President not follow the \nlaw? It is a very bad thing. He should follow the law. He sets a bad \nexample. Children around this country, adults around this country, when \nthey find out the President ignores law, the Senate ignores law, it is \nnot good for America. We are a nation of laws.\n  The President, the last budget he sent, last January of 1 year ago, \nhe laid out what he projected the costs would be for the war on terror. \nHe is bringing those costs down dramatically, some say too fast, some \nsay not fast enough, but they are coming down dramatically. He \nprojects, however, we are still going to have military efforts against \nour enemy with whom we are at war, al-Qaida, for the next 10 years.\n  That costs money. He projected the cost over 10 years for the war on \nterror would be $467 billion. I think that is pretty close to accurate. \nYou could give or take a little bit, but apparently we are not stopping \ndrone attacks.\n  I just met with our Ambassador who is negotiating an agreement with \nAfghanistan. We are projecting to have troops over there for a long \ntime. More and more are in the support role, but it is an expense to \nmaintain the war against terror.\n  We are free to attack al-Qaida wherever they are. We have people in \nIraq, Yemen, Mali, and different places throughout the world where our \ninterests have been threatened, and that costs money.\n  What did our good friends on the Senate Budget Committee do? They \nneeded more money in savings. They wanted to say they cut spending. \nThey came up with a clever idea; we will just cut all the war spending \nand pretend we will not spend it. That is it. OK. We will just pretend \nwe are not going to spend that much.\n  One year from that, the total amount they say we are going to spend \nover 10 years is not $467 billion, it is 75. The last 8 years will be \nzero, so we spend 75 over 2 years, and we will not spend any more \nmoney. There will be peace in the world, we will not have to chase al-\nQaida, we will not need drones, troops, and special forces operating \naround the world. We will be completely out of Iraq and Afghanistan. \nWon't that be great? Let's just play it that way.\n  I have to tell you, they know that is not going to happen. Even \nPresident Obama is projecting substantial reductions.\n  If you take that down, what we find is the budget doesn't reduce the \ndeficit at all. The budget increases the deficit based on the course we \nare on today, apples to apples, oranges to oranges.\n  We are not playing around with different baselines to gimmick it up. \nThis is the right way to analyze the situation.\n\n  I just have to say, the American people need to know the budget \nbefore us does not do what it says it will do. Even what it says it \nwill do is insufficient, but it doesn't come close to doing what it \nsays, and it is not close to doing what is needed. It will never \nbalance the budget, not in 10 years, not in any time. It makes no \nchanges, none, to the deeply troubling surging growth of our \nentitlement programs, welfare programs, of Medicaid; the 83 means-\ntested welfare programs which are expected to grow 80 percent over the \nnext 10 years, there are no changes.\n  There is no reform there we believe in. I am disappointed. \nPresumably, we\n\n[[Page S2018]]\n\nmay see it pass out of the Senate on a party-line vote, go to the \nHouse, and we will see what happens in conference. Could anything come \nout of conference? It is possible. I am not overconfident, particularly \nif we can't get Members of the Senate to lay out good numbers.\n  How can we negotiate with a person such as Paul Ryan, who absolutely \nknows what is up and what is down? There is not a person in America who \nknows the numbers better than Paul Ryan.\n  He has integrity. He works hard. He has dedicated himself to \nmastering this subject. He has mastered it, and he has laid out a plan. \nI am not saying I agree with everything in his plan. It is not before \nus. He has laid out a plan. He is prepared to negotiate, to discuss \nwith people who are willing to discuss how to reach some compromise and \nsome consensus on some of the things we need to do. It is very hard to \ndo that if you are putting up bogus numbers such as this.\n  What about The Hill, another one of the inside Washington \npublications. On March 13, The Hill reported:\n\n       Murray argues that her budget cuts $1.85 trillion from \n     deficits over 10 years. But once the sequester cuts are \n     turned off, Murray's budget appears to reduce deficits by \n     about $800 billion, using the Congressional Budget Office's \n     baseline. The Murray budget does not contain net spending \n     cuts with the sequester turned off.\n\n  We score here about 700 after you take that--645. They estimated 8, \nbut essentially they are making the same point. The budget the \nDemocrats produced did not score the sequester.\n  As we wrestle with these issues, talking about spending and how we \ncreate growth in our economy--and all of us want growth--we just \ncontend growth is better achieved through progrowth policies than by \nborrowing and spending.\n  I wish to say there is academic research which validates that \nopinion. Senator Murray's budget, the Democratic budget, proposes yet \nmore stimulus and proposes a 60-percent increase in spending over the \nnext 10 years, a $162 billion increase over next year alone.\n  This is an increase in spending next year, not a reduction, of 162 \nnext year. It is a fair criticism around here that the only budget that \ncounts is the next year. It does tend to control next year, but it \noften normally gets altered before the second, third, fourth, fifth, \nsixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth, but it doesn't tell us a \nplan.\n  I contend reducing excessive spending without increasing taxes makes \nthe economy stronger, not weaker. Let's look at this. Real evidence \nsupports this. It shows reducing spending can help an economy which has \ntoo much debt. A Harvard University study which I think all of us have \nseen, the OECD, developed nations, looked at 107 different periods of \nfiscal adjustments in these nations.\n  This is what they have found:\n\n       Spending cuts are much more effective than tax increases in \n     stabilizing the debt and avoiding economic downturn.\n\n  I believe that is accurate. If it is, that is very important for us \nto know. Many countries have reduced spending and had large increases \nin job growth thereafter.\n  You would hear our Members say: Oh, you can't cut spending; it will \nhurt job growth. You could have something in the short term, but these \ncountries have had substantial increases in job growth after cutting \nspending--Austria, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Netherlands, Norway, \nSweden. This chart gives some of that insight: ``Job Gains 5 years \nAfter Successful Spending Reductions.'' Look at these again. Japan in \n1987 had an 8.6-percent growth; Canada in 1997 had 11.1 percent; \nNetherlands in 1997, 9.5 percent; United States in 1997, after spending \nreductions, 5.2 percent. That is when we were on the path to balance \nthe budget. That was when Newt Gingrich and the House Republicans met \nwith President Clinton and negotiated and fought and wrestled and shut \nthe government down and cut spending and the economy grew. And then \nSweden, in 1998, had 6.5 percent growth. The average job growth over \nthese five countries was 8 percent after cutting spending.\n\n  One I noticed on here is really something we should consider; that \nis, the small country of Estonia, which was part of the Soviet Union, \ndominated by Russia and the Communists. It is a great little country in \nthe Baltics. I was there 2 years ago. Senator Jon Kyl took us there. \nThey had just suffered through the same financial catastrophe in 2007 \nto 2008 that we had, but it hit them worse. They had a larger drop in \nGDP than we did, and it was very damaging. They had to decide what to \ndo about it, so they began to consider what to do about it, and they \ndidn't go for this idea that they had to borrow, borrow, borrow so they \ncould keep spending because the revenue had dropped so much and they \nwere going to keep spending at the same level. That isn't what the \nEstonians decided to do. This new democracy, this free enterprise, this \nfree country, so excited about their future, do you know what they did? \nThey cut spending. They cut spending big time--big time.\n  This is what a Cabinet member told me. We had dinner, a group of us, \nand he said Cabinet people had their pay cut 40 percent. He said their \npay was cut 40 percent, and he said: But I can tell you who is really \nmad and giving me a hard time.\n  I said: Who is that?\n  He said: My wife. She is a doctor. We hammered them too.\n  So Estonia hardly had a debt increase at all. Now Estonia has been \nshowing some of the fastest growth of any country in Europe, maybe any \ncountry in the developed world. So cutting spending, making their \ngovernment leaner, more productive, and people taking pay cuts did not \ndestroy their economy. It allowed them to bounce back quite \nsuccessfully. I am so proud to see their numbers continue to be great \neconomically because they were courageous. The first thing their \nleaders did was take pay cuts themselves.\n  Other countries have not followed this path. Other countries haven't \ntightened their belts or they have relied too heavily on tax increases \nto reduce deficits. These countries have not fared as well. Greece, \nPortugal, the United Kingdom and Spain all have had big tax increases \nas part of their deficit reduction plans, and these results are \nconfirmed by studies at the International Monetary Fund, the University \nof Chicago, and the University of California.\n  So we spent $830 billion on stimulus in early 2009. That passed \nthrough here without my vote, and I opposed it at the time vigorously. \nBut it was passed, and every dime of it was borrowed. We didn't have \nthe money. We were in debt. But the geniuses said we have to stimulate \nthe economy. Oh, if we don't borrow money and spend it, we will sink \ninto oblivion. It wasn't what Estonia did, but we did that. We spent \nthe money, and we haven't seen the growth we needed. We helped surge \nour debt.\n  We continue to spend substantially. We continue to run up debt the \nlikes of which we have never seen before. I believe that debt right now \nis slowing economic growth and that debt right now could be a threat to \nour financial security in the future. It is sad to see us go in that \ndirection.\n  Spending reductions are doable. We can do this. A lot of people think \nit is not possible. They get depressed, and every time someone talks \nabout spending reductions, people start whining: It can't be done. It \ncan't be done. We will hurt the Defense Department because the cuts on \nthe Defense Department were too great.\n  But the Defense Department will still be there if we don't fix it the \nway these cuts are imposed. It will still be there--and who knows, it \ncould be stronger.\n  I am worried about it. In fact, the way the sequester was crafted, at \nthe request of the President, one-half of all the cuts in the entire \n$1.2 trillion in cuts fell on the Defense Department, which makes up \none-sixth of the Federal Government. So these cuts fell on the Defense \nDepartment disproportionately. Medicaid was increasing at 8 percent a \nyear, no cuts; food stamps had gone up from $20 billion to $80 billion \nin 11 years--fourfold--but got no cuts; and, of course, Social Security \nhad no cuts. There was a 2-percent maximum reduction trim on Medicare \nproviders, which are the doctors and hospitals. They had a minor cut. \nSo a huge portion of the budget had none, but the Defense Department \ntook a huge, huge cut. It was not smart the way we did it, but the \namount of cuts, if properly allocated across the entire government's \nspending, would have little impact on\n\n[[Page S2019]]\n\nreducing growth but would really begin to solidify public confidence \nthat we have a smart plan to get out of this debt.\n  If we just slow the spending growth to 3.4 percent a year over the \nnext 10 years, we could balance this budget without raising taxes. You \nhave heard that said. It is true. This is true. We do not have to have \nsubstantial spending cuts; we can do it and still have growth.\n  Some programs need to be cut. Some programs have to be cut. Some \nprograms are growing much faster than 3.4 percent. Medicaid is growing \nat 8 percent. It needs to be reformed. We can't sustain that kind of \nincrease year after year after year.\n  Most Americans know the old story about the rule of seven. If you \nincrease something at 7 percent a year on your savings account, it \ndoubles in 10 years. So if you have 8 percent, you are seeing a 117-\npercent increase in spending over 10 years.\n  So if we allow 3.4 percent a year in spending growth, that means we \nwould spend $11,000 per person in 2022, 10 years out--$11,000 per \nperson by the Federal Government. That is a higher rate of spending per \nperson than we had in 2007. Yet we are going broke.\n  We can reduce spending without affecting services. We can. Federal \nprograms--many of them--are very wasteful, very inefficient, \nduplicative, and subject to fraud. I just held up the GAO 2012 report \nthat listed a pile--page after page--of programs that are wasteful, \nduplicative, and so forth. We have social service, domestic disaster \nassistance, Internal Revenue Service enforcement efforts that all have \nduplicative gaps and are not properly managed. They talk about how the \nprograms are duplicative, how the programs are mismanaged, how they \nneed to be tightened up, and there is a whole list of these things. \nThere are about 50 different major programs--51--that need reform. We \nhaven't done any of that.\n  What does Congress say to the American people? Well, we don't have \ntime to execute, carry out, or study GAO's report. That is too much \nwork. Just send us more money. No, we don't have time to do this. You \ndon't understand--these little programs, they do not save much money. \nThey do not make any difference. We don't have to focus on them. Send \nus more money. You have to send us more money.\n\n  I think the American people may be getting tired of this.\n  Nine different agencies, according to GAO, run over 50 job-training \nprograms for people with disabilities. This budget proposes to create \nmore. We had an amendment offered at the Budget Committee that would \ncreate another job program. I mean, we have them all over the place. It \nsounded like a good idea. Something good happened in some State, so we \nhave a plan to offer Federal legislation to do it here or expand it.\n  Last year alone, Washington paid out $44 billion to people who, \nthrough deceit or error, did not deserve Medicare payments. Let me \nrepeat. Forty-four billion dollars was paid out to people who, through \ndeceit or error, did not deserve Medicare payments. That is more money \nthan we spend running our national parks, the FBI, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, the Army Corps of Engineers' civil works projects, and \nthe Internal Revenue Service combined. Forty-four billion is a lot. \nThat is just about what the Federal highway budget is--$44 billion. \nFraud, deceit, and error out the door in Medicare alone.\n  Well, Mr. President, we have been at it a long time. I am very \nunhappy that the budget process has been shifted to the end of the \nweek. I am very unhappy that we are at a point where we are not going \nto have as full a debate because people are going to be stressed, they \nare going to be here at night and maybe into the weekend. Somebody may \nsay: Well, Sessions, it is your fault. Why don't you just yield back \nthis time? But it would take every Senator here to yield back the time. \nAnd if I did, I am sure somebody would object. And I am not yielding \nback time now.\n  We have problems. We can yield, we can work through the night, we can \ncompromise tonight and maybe save a few hours, or we can work to be as \naccommodating to our colleagues as we can. I am willing to do that. But \nI just have to say that this budget should have been up earlier. We \nshould have reached an agreement with Senators Moran and Ayotte and \ngiven them amendments early in the week or last week, and we could have \nhad the budget up Monday. We wouldn't have had all this fuss. We would \nhave had Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and we would have had a \nfull day, completed all amendments, and been out of here. But, oh no, I \nthink there is something to the fact that it was considered to be a \ngood idea just to carry this budget over to the end of the week and \nthat Senators would want to leave and we would just wrap it all up, do \nit in the dead of night so the American people wouldn't see, perhaps, \nwhat is going to be done, wouldn't pay much attention to the votes, and \nwe could get out of here and do the least possible public discussion of \nthis bad budget that we can.\n  Now, some might say: Well, that is really not so.\n  I think it is so. We haven't had a budget on the floor for 4 years. \nWhy? Senator Reid said publicly that it is foolish to have a budget. \nWhy did he say that? He meant it was foolish politically. I have said \nthis before. He knows how I feel about it.\n  He said it was foolish--politically, basically--to have a budget. \nWhy? Because writing a budget requires a party to lay out their vision \nfor the future, to be prepared to defend it in public debate, and to \nhave amendments on it. He has been controlling this Senate to a degree \nno majority leader has ever controlled the Senate, and the one thing he \nis not able to control is the budget process: You have 50 hours and \nvirtually unlimited amendments. He didn't want to do that. So he was \nwilling to violate the law of the United States and not bring up a \nbudget so he wouldn't have to do this.\n  Finally, this year the House got fed up. They have been passing an \nhonest budget that lays out a future plan for America. They have \ndefended it publicly. They have taken unfair attacks and abuse for \ndoing their duty every year--like they are supposed to do.\n  So they sent over a bill this year. It said: No budget, no pay, \nCongress. If you don't bring up your budget, you don't get paid. So now \nwe have a budget for the first time in 4 years. Maybe the House should \nbe given a medal for that.\n  But I am not happy. I don't believe we are doing this right. I was \ndisappointed that for the first time in 3 years, when a budget was \nbrought up in the Senate committee, we had statements made one \nafternoon for a few hours before we even saw the chairman's mark. It \nwas produced after that, and we had 1 day--the next day--to offer \namendments. That wasn't a very good process, in my view.\n  If we really want to deal with the debt--the greatest danger of our \ntime--and deal with it properly, why wouldn't we want to have an open \npublic hearing? Why wouldn't we have had expert witnesses all year to \nhelp talk to us? We had a few hearings, but we could have had a lot \nmore because this has complex questions for us to decide. We should \nhave had more time in committee, and we should have had full time on \nthe floor of the Senate. So I don't make any bones about it. I wish we \nhad done it differently.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, President Obama arrived in the Middle East \ntoday. It is his first visit as President to Israel and the West Bank.\n  Some in the press have focused on the fact that the White House has \nlowered expectations for what will be accomplished in the 3 days of the \nPresident's visit. Others, including Members\n\n[[Page S2020]]\n\nof Congress, have signed letters to the President.\n  Rather than prejudge what can be achieved by this trip or try to tie \nthe President's hands concerning the Middle East, I want to simply make \na few straightforward points.\n  First, no one who knows the Middle East can honestly expect momentous \naccomplishments from a short visit like this, especially when the new \nIsraeli Government is still in the process of forming. But despite \nthat, it is very positive that the President is traveling to the \nregion, and this is as good a time as any.\n  Second, the peace process, as we have come to refer to it, between \nIsraelis and Palestinians has been stalled for a dozen years. In many \nways the prospects for an end to the conflict are worse today than in \nthe mid-1990s, and there is plenty of blame to go around. Just \ntraveling to Israel and the West Bank reaffirms this administration's \ninterest in helping the parties find ways to make progress on the key \nissues. Ultimately, however, it is up to them, not the United States, \nto resolve their differences.\n  Third, it reaffirms President Obama's longstanding support for \nIsrael. While during the Presidential campaign there were shameful \nattempts to portray the President as somehow not committed enough or \nsupportive enough of Israel, that was pure politics. The record is \nabundantly clear that he has been, is--and, there is every reason to \nbelieve, will continue to be--a strong supporter of Israel. Top Israeli \nofficials have acknowledged this.\n  That is not to say that we and the Israeli Government are going to \nagree on every issue. Israel and the United States share fundamental \ninterests, but we are different countries and sometimes our interests \ndiverge. That is to be expected.\n  Fourth, the President's visit is an opportunity for Israelis and \nPalestinians to recognize that the status quo is unsustainable. \nMaintaining this untenable limbo is neither in their interests nor in \nthe interests of our great Nation. Unilateral actions by either side \nare harmful to the peace process. Rhetoric that dehumanizes or \ndemonizes the other is harmful. Settlement construction in disputed \nterritory is harmful. Incitement to violence is harmful. Both sides \nneed to demonstrate that they want lasting peace through negotiations.\n  The President will also visit Jordan, which is facing increasing \npressure from the flood of Syrian refugees, an issue that concerns us \nall. The fiscal year 2013 continuing resolution that is expected to \npass the Senate this week includes additional assistance for Jordan and \nfor Syria's other neighbors to help address these needs.\n  And, of course, there are growing concerns about Iran's nuclear \nprogram. I believe the President has wisely proceeded with caution in \nthe way his administration has responded to this grave threat. While \nsome have urged the President to adopt a purely military policy toward \nIran, the advice of our top military leaders is restraint. We should \nexhaust other means at our disposal to try to convince Iran to abandon \nits nuclear ambitions and to avoid another war in that part of the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, I commend President Obama for traveling to the Middle \nEast. Real peace with enduring security between Israelis and \nPalestinians has long been and remains a key goal of the United States. \nIt is one toward which the Congress and the administration should work \ntogether.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/20/senate-section/article/S2020-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FREE SPEECH IN THE AMERICAS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there is much at the Organization of \nAmerican States that needs to be reformed, but the Inter-American \nCommission on Human Rights, IACHR, is not among them. Yet that is what \nthe Government of Ecuador and some other Latin American governments \npurport to be calling for when the OAS general assembly meets this \ncoming Friday.\n  In reality, it is not about reform at all but a concerted effort to \nseverely weaken the IACHR, the one institution in the Americas that has \nbeen a consistent, strong defender of free expression and other \nfundamental human rights that have been too often denied by those same \ngovernments.\n  I have spoken previously about the courageous work of Colombian \nlawyer Dr. Catalina Botero, the special rapporteur for freedom of \nexpression. I have also spoken about the efforts by Ecuador's President \nRafael Correa to intimidate and control what remains of an independent \npress in his country. So I will not repeat myself here.\n  But the United States is the largest contributor to the OAS, and we \nhave provided additional funds in recent years to support the \ncritically important work of the IACHR. I want to be sure Senators are \naware of what is happening, as it could have serious consequences for \nour future support for the OAS. I ask unanimous consent that an article \nin the Washington Post by Cesar Gaviria Trujillo, former President of \nColombia and Secretary General of the OAS, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From The Washington Post, Mar. 19, 2013]\n\n                    Muzzling a Free-Speech Champion\n\n                      (By Cesar Gaviria Trujillo)\n\n       Cesar Gaviria Trujillo is a former president of Colombia \n     and past secretary general of the Organization of American \n     States.\n       A historic showdown set to occur at Friday's meeting of the \n     general assembly of the Organization of American States could \n     determine the future of human rights protections throughout \n     the Western Hemisphere.\n       A group of nations led by Ecuador is pushing to ``reform'' \n     the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and its office \n     on freedom of expression. The purported aim of these changes \n     is to ``strengthen'' human rights protections. If \n     implemented, however, the reforms will severely weaken the \n     commission and make it easier for governments to ignore basic \n     rights and limit free speech.\n       When I served as president of Colombia from 1990 to 1994, I \n     saw how difficult it could be for national institutions to \n     evolve and change without external pressure. As secretary \n     general of the OAS between 1994 and 2004, I saw firsthand how \n     effective the Inter-American Commission could be in providing \n     this pressure when nations needed help to move forward on \n     human rights.\n       The commission has played a crucial role, particularly in \n     defending the principles of the Inter-American Democratic \n     Charter. It has pressed for transparency and fair elections, \n     and, equally important, it has intervened when governments \n     sought to undermine judicial independence or free speech. A \n     genuine democracy requires checks and balances as well as \n     freedom of the press.\n       The changes being promoted would drastically curtail the \n     autonomy that has been critical to the Inter-American \n     Commission's success. One proposal would prevent the \n     commission from obtaining funds from outside the region, \n     effectively putting a financial stranglehold on the panel. As \n     of this year, about a third of the commission's budget comes \n     from Europe.\n       This measure would have a devastating impact, especially on \n     the commission's Special Rapporteurship for Freedom of \n     Expression, which for many years has led the fight for press \n     freedoms throughout the region and has served as a constant \n     thorn in the side of governments that do not believe in free \n     speech. The office stands to lose virtually all of its \n     budget, making it easier for governments to prosecute their \n     critics, impose censorship and close independent media \n     outlets.\n       Another reform under consideration would prevent states \n     that have not ratified the American Convention on Human \n     Rights from nominating members to the commission. This \n     measure appears to be designed to limit the involvement of \n     the United States and Canada, neither of which has ratified \n     the convention though they are nonetheless subject to its \n     monitoring and, most important, are major sources of \n     financial and political support for its work.\n       Our region has made important progress on human rights \n     since the dark days of the Cold War. Nearly all of this \n     hemisphere's dictatorships have been replaced by democracies. \n     Yet these democracies have at times trampled on free speech \n     and other fundamental rights. The Inter-American human rights \n     system is the best mechanism we have for ensuring that \n     governments in the Americas do a better job of protecting \n     these rights and freedoms.\n       So far, only a handful of countries have joined Ecuador in \n     this determined effort to weaken our regional human rights \n     system. Those governments that are truly committed to human \n     rights and democracy must stand up for the commission this \n     week and put an end to this ill-conceived campaign.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/20/senate-section/article/S2020-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2020-S2021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, during the past 50 years there has been \nsignificant progress in improving living standards in developing \ncountries. Some of the successes have been particularly noteworthy: \neradicating smallpox and almost eradicating polio, stabilizing \npopulation growth rates in many areas, longer life spans, lower infant \nmortality, fewer people living in poverty, the expansion of democracy.\n\n[[Page S2021]]\n\n  Investments in international development made by government agencies, \nnonprofits, businesses, and philanthropic foundations in the United \nStates and around the world have made a difference. Our country is more \nsecure and our economy more resilient than it would otherwise be, \nthanks to these investments.\n  Yet there is plenty of room for improvement to get better value for \nour overseas investments, particularly to increase the sustainability \nof the assistance we provide. Too often we set unrealistic goals, do \nnot hold governments accountable for corruption, ignore local input, \nand channel our aid through contractors that charge high fees and put \nprofit over results.\n  There are other critical areas that have not received nearly the \nattention they deserve, either by our government or other donors, \nincluding the explosive growth of cities and the world's changing \nclimate.\n  The President mentioned the looming threat of climate change in his \ninauguration speech, and like many others I am glad he did. To date, \nour efforts to address this global challenge have been painfully slow \nand woefully inadequate. As anyone who works the land will tell you, \nthe world's climate is changing fast--spring is coming earlier, polar \nice and glaciers are melting, and storms are more violent. Scientists \nsay these changes are potentially catastrophic, and that we will \nexperience even more frequent severe weather events, shrinking water \nsupplies, more intense heat waves and droughts, the spread of disease, \nand more and more threats to food production.\n  It is the poorest people who are most vulnerable to these phenomena, \nand who are most likely to be uprooted from their homes as a result. If \nthe international community does not mobilize quickly to address this \nchallenge we risk the reversal of many or most of the international \ndevelopment gains of the last 50 years, leaving an unprecedented crisis \nfor our children and future generations.\n  Then there is the related challenge of urbanization. I am proud to \nsay that a Vermont organization called the Institute for Sustainable \nCommunities, founded by former Vermont Governor Madeleine Kunin, is \nleading an effort to accelerate climate solutions among more than 320 \nU.S. cities--and the list is growing. The institute is focusing on \ncities because it is in densely populated areas that the opportunity to \nquickly strengthen climate resilience and reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions is greatest. This work should be expanded on a global scale.\n  Currently, only a very small percentage of international development \ndollars is spent to address problems in urban areas, yet 70 percent of \nthe world's population will live in cities by 2030. The number of \npeople migrating to New Delhi, Mumbai, Dhaka, Lagos, Kinshasa, and \nKarachi each year is greater than the entire population of Europe. \nBetween now and 2030--only 17 years--the world will need to build a \ncity of 1 million people every 5 days to keep up with the urbanization \nof the developing world. That is a staggering and frightening \nstatistic.\n  Those cities are not remotely prepared to handle this flood of \ndesperate people. These are not places like Boston or London, \nWashington or Paris that expanded gradually over centuries becoming \nstronger as they grew. Cities in developing countries expand through \nshantytowns, like the vast slums of Nairobi and Lagos. And bit by bit, \nthe edges of the city creep out and suddenly the city's size has \ndoubled, or quadrupled. Closer to home, Tijuana, on the United States \nMexican border, is one of Mexico's fastest growing cities. Tijuana adds \nabout 80,000 people each year, and is projected to be the second \nlargest city in Mexico by 2030. Many of its inhabitants arrive with no \nplace to live and no job. The city's infrastructure is utterly \nunprepared to handle them. It is a recipe for crime and misery.\n  Slums are not infrastructure, and in general most infrastructure \ndecisions are not well planned. Most of the developing world does not \nhave running water or reliable electricity, and nearly 40 percent of \nthe world's population does not have access to basic sanitation, \nincluding 1 billion children. That number is likely to rise as rapidly \nexpanding cities become even less able to meet the demand for basic \nsanitation and health care.\n  This immense growth in cities is a cauldron for chaos and \ninstability. People living in cities without safe water or electricity, \nplagued by hunger, disease and unhealthy living conditions, threatened \nby rising sea levels and violent storms--these desperate conditions are \nlikely to lead to violence, displacement, and even the toppling of \ngovernments.\n  Rapid urbanization is already putting tremendous pressure on the \nenvironment and threatens productive farmland. What will happen when \nthere is not enough food or water for cities filled with millions of \npeople? What will happen if the population of Jakarta doubles without \nan improvement in living conditions?\n  Yet as cities grow we also have an opportunity to prevent chaos. \nGrowing cities are going to be constructing new buildings--let's make \nsure they are energy efficient. They are going to be creating new \ntransport systems--let's focus on low-carbon strategies that move \npeople, not just cars. They are going to need to feed hundreds of \nmillions of hungry people--let's make sure urban centers are connected \nto the rural economy in a sustainable way. And as they build new \ninfrastructure, let's make sure that it is designed to support livable \ncommunities and built in ways that are more resilient to extreme \nweather and sea level rise.\n  Investing in cities gives us economies of scale. We can accomplish a \ngreat deal through investing in efficient infrastructure, and we can \napply lessons learned all across the developing world. An estimated 60 \npercent of the infrastructure needed to keep pace with the growth in \nurban centers has not been built yet, but it will be by 2030.\n  Let's focus on helping cities build smarter. It is a lot easier and \ncheaper to build it right the first time, than to go back and fix it \nlater. And here in the United States there are companies that produce \nsome of the world's best technology and some of the world's best \nthinking about creating smart cities. Together with our international \npartners we can meet this challenge if we share our expertise.\n  International donors, led by the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment, should devote a larger portion of resources and effort to \naddressing the urgent problems of climate change and rapid \nurbanization. It is a critical investment for the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/20/senate-section/article/S2021-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2021-S2022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     VERMONTERS MAKING A DIFFERENCE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been privileged to serve Vermonters \nfor many years as a voice on foreign policy matters, and I am always \nreminded that my work is a reflection of the outward looking posture of \nthe people of my State. Vermonters have a long history of defending \nhuman rights and social justice at home and abroad. The longest \nfunctioning international exchange program is based in Vermont, and \nthere are over 3,600 nonprofits registered in Vermont that are carrying \nout programs to protect the environment, support public health, and \nmany other activities here and abroad.\n  These small businesses help bring Vermont values to such far off \nplaces as Vietnam, central Africa, the Middle East, and Central \nAmerica. One example of the far-reaching contributions Vermont small \nbusinesses make every day is the BOMA Project. Based in Manchester, VT, \nKathleen Colson started the BOMA Project in the mid-2000s as a way to \nhelp women in Kenya escape extreme poverty. Kathleen's company replaces \nloans with grants and creates opportunities for these women to start \nsmall, sustainable income-generating businesses. To date, her company \nhas launched over 1,100 micro-enterprises across northern Kenya.\n  Other examples of Vermont organizations doing innovative work to \nimprove the lives of people overseas are the Institute for Sustainable \nCommunities, Pure Water for the World, Clear Path International, the \nARAVA Institute for Environmental Studies, and World Learning. And \nthere are many others.\n  A February 10, 2013, article by the Associated Press quoted Peace \nCorps recruiter Brian Melman as he spoke about the people who work with \nthese Vermont organizations: ``These are people who are willing to \nthink big with small resources. They will go out\n\n[[Page S2022]]\n\nof their way to make relationships with anyone that they can and to \nmake believers out of all they come across because the passion is so \ngenuine.'' That article, entitled ``Vt. home to many worldwide \ndevelopment groups,'' is notable because it points out the many ways \nour small State has contributed in a big way to those less fortunate \nall across the globe. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \narticle be printed in the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n               [From the Associated Press, Feb. 10, 2013]\n\n             VT. Home to Many Worldwide Development Groups\n\n                            (By Wilson Ring)\n\n       Dorset, VT. (AP).--From a converted garage in Dorset, James \n     Hathaway helps rid Afghanistan and Vietnam of land mines. A \n     few miles away in Manchester, Kathleen Colson helps women in \n     northern Kenya start businesses.\n       They are just a few of the nonprofit, non-governmental \n     organizations that call Vermont home while doing work \n     worldwide in fields as varied as promoting democracy or clean \n     water. Besides working on development projects in some of the \n     remotest and neediest parts of the globe, the organizations \n     are also pumping millions of dollars and hundreds of jobs \n     into the Vermont economy.\n       ``These are people who are willing to think big with small \n     resources. They will go out of their way to make \n     relationships with anyone that they can and to make believers \n     out of all they come across because the passion is so \n     genuine,'' said Peace Corps recruiter Brian Melman, who \n     earned a graduate degree at the University of Vermont in \n     Burlington and has also lived in Montpelier.\n       ``There are people in Vermont who accomplish amazing things \n     with just about nothing,'' he said.\n       While many of the organizations are small, taken as a \n     whole, Vermont's international nonprofit sector appears to \n     boost the state's economy.\n       Though precise figures for international nonprofits are \n     hard to come by, a 2011 Vermont Community Foundation report \n     found that 3,626 domestic and international nonprofit \n     organizations bring $2.5 billion to the state, about 12 \n     percent of the gross state product.\n       Some groups do local fundraisers. Others attract grant \n     money from foundations while the larger ones work on \n     contracts with government agencies.\n       The Montpelier-based Institute for Sustainable Communities, \n     formed in 1991, does environmental, health care and other \n     projects in Serbia, China, India and Bangladesh. It's working \n     with Burlington's Champlain College to learn more about the \n     international organizations in Vermont.\n       ``There's a wealth of global experience hidden in our hills \n     and valleys, and most people don't know it,'' said vice \n     president Barbara McAndrew. ``Putting together a real picture \n     of Vermont's international footprint helps us build \n     connections between people working in the same regions. It \n     can raise our profile with national and international funders \n     and it helps us attract and retain talented people.''\n       Melman said that the same sense of community and the desire \n     to help that he sees in Peace Corps volunteers is what led \n     Vermonters to form nonprofits, in many cases based on work \n     they did while overseas in the Peace Corps or other service. \n     Vermont, per capita, produces more Peace Corps volunteers \n     than any other state.\n       Burlington, he said, ``was just absolutely awash with \n     nonprofits,'' Melman said. ``We used to joke that there were \n     more nonprofits than people.''\n       One of Vermont's first international NGOs was the \n     Brattleboro-based organization now known as World Learning. \n     The organization employs 185 people and does work with \n     education, exchange, and development programs in more than 60 \n     countries. It was founded in 1932.\n       ``Even back then, Vermont was attracting innovative, \n     different thinking individuals,'' said Simon Norton of World \n     Learning.\n       Norton, who lives in Nevada but travels to Vermont \n     frequently, said there are pockets across the country that \n     have ``the same vibe'' as Vermont and have many groups \n     working across the globe. He mentioned the San Francisco \n     area; parts of Seattle; Flagstaff, Ariz.; Boulder, Colo.; and \n     Asheville, N.C. In Vermont, it's statewide.\n       ``People choose to either stay or move to Vermont for those \n     small-town community values,'' he said.\n       Colson fits the profile. She said she got her first taste \n     of Africa through a program offered by her college and later \n     spent 25 years in Africa running safaris. In the mid-2000s \n     she branched out and started working on a program that helps \n     women start tiny income-generating businesses in areas where \n     opportunities are otherwise unavailable. Now her program, the \n     BOMA Project, has a staff of four.\n       A native of western New York, she and her husband moved \n     back to the U.S. to raise their children in a small town \n     similar to where she grew up.\n       Colson now spends about three months a year in Kenya where \n     she travels with an armed bodyguard.\n       ``To be able to be in that place and then come home to \n     Vermont . . . all of a sudden you are in one of the safest \n     places on the planet,'' Colson said.\n       Many of the organizations are in Vermont's larger \n     communities, but others are on back roads. Hathaway helped \n     found Clear Path International in the converted garage \n     outside his Dorset home in 2000, where he still works as its \n     communications director. The organization's main office has \n     since moved to Bainbridge Island, Wash.\n       Rutland-based Pure Water for the World, which helps provide \n     clean water to communities in Honduras and Haiti, employs \n     three people in Vermont and about 25 overseas. It has a \n     budget this year of $1.2 million, much of which comes from \n     individual donations, said the group's executive director, \n     Carolyn Crowley Meub.\n       ``I know individuals who have a small NGO they run from \n     their living room and are doing all kinds of interesting work \n     from these seemingly small, sleepy towns that are incredibly \n     connected to the world,'' said Norton.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/20/senate-section/article/S2022-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2022-S2023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BIG SKY CONFERENCE CHAMPIONS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, Johnny Wooden, the 10-time national \nchampionship winning coach of UCLA, once said: ``The main ingredient of \nstardom is the rest of the team.''\n  It takes a little star power and teamwork to win 10 championships, \nbut it takes something extra special to win the Big Sky Coach of the \nYear Award 20 times. That is Lady Griz Coach Robin Selvig.\n\n  Coach Selvig hails from Outlook, MT. He has true grit. He grew up \nnorth of the Hi-Line. I know the occupant of the chair knows where the \nHi-Line is. That is up in northern Montana. There is a Hi-Line across \nMontana that even stretches over Highway 2 over into North Dakota.\n  Under Coach Selvig's leadership, the Lady Griz have made it to the \nBig Dance 20 times in the NCAA's 32-year history. Selvig has 798 wins \nin 35 seasons.\n  I also rise to honor Montana Grizzly men's basketball coach Ben \nTinkle. Coach Tinkle was also honored this week as the Big Sky's Coach \nof the Year for the men's basketball program. Coach Tinkle is leading \nthe team to their second trip in a row to the NCAA tournament, after \nwinning a dramatic Big Sky Conference championship against Weber State. \nJordan Gregory's free throws in the final seconds of the game were \nicing on the cake that pulled the Griz ahead to win the game. The Griz \nbasketball teams have had many spectacular seasons. And the Congress, I \nmight add, could learn a lesson or two from the Big Sky Conference \nbasketball champions. Both programs join a long tradition of excellence \nand a long tradition of teamwork that makes Montana proud. That is why \nthey win games. These teams have shown a dedication to their school, \ntheir fans, their studies, and their community that is a reflection of \nour Montana values.\n  As both the Lady Griz and the Grizzly Men's basketball teams head \ninto the NCAA tournament this week, I take this opportunity to publicly \ncongratulate each player on the roster, the coaching staff, and the \nentire University of Montana community for this terrific season.

His love of country and zeal for freedom \nrepresent the very best of America. Like all the patriots before him, \nhis sacrifice has helped keep the torch of liberty burning bright. The \nUnited States of America is indeed fortunate to have a native son like \nSteven Blass, eager to serve his country and risk everything for his \nfellow citizens. We are forever in his debt.

Mr. President, this Saturday marks the third \nanniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act. At age 3, the \nlaw is protecting consumers against abusive insurance practices, \nhelping seniors by lowering prescription drug costs, and building the \ninfrastructure to expand health insurance coverage to millions of \nAmericans. For the first time, patients' interests and needs are being \nput ahead of those of the insurance and drug companies.\n  The Obama administration has worked tirelessly to implement the law, \nin the face of constant opposition. My Republican colleagues in \nCongress have voted to repeal or defund the Affordable Care Act well \nover 30 times. It is a chilling, if useless, political refrain from the \ntea party.\n  On this third anniversary, it is important not only to reflect on how \nfar we have come but to continue pressing forward on the Affordable \nCare Act's many improvements to our health care system, particularly \nthe delivery system reforms.\n  The Council of Economic Advisers' 2013 ``Economic Report of the \nPresident'' identified a number of sources of waste in our health care \nsystem, including the fragmentation of the delivery system; duplicate \ncare and overtreatment; the failure of providers to adopt best \npractices; and payment fraud. The council notes:\n\n       Taken together, [these factors] have been estimated to \n     account for between 13 and 26 percent of national health \n     expenditures in 2011. The magnitude of this waste offers an \n     equally large opportunity for spending reductions and \n     improvement in quality of care an opportunity that underpins \n     many of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n  Thankfully, we have the tools necessary to seize the opportunity \ndescribed by the Council of Economic Advisers to drive down costs and \nimprove the quality of patient care. The Affordable Care Act included \n45 provisions dedicated to improving the way we deliver health care in \n5 priority areas: payment reform, primary and preventive care, \nmeasuring and reporting quality, administrative simplification, and \nhealth information technology.\n  The effort to extract from the wasteful swamp of our health care \nbureaucracy a lean, humane, patient-centered system is vital. National \nhealth spending hit $2.7 trillion in 2011 or about 18 percent of GDP. \nThe next least efficient developed country--the Netherlands--spent 12 \npercent of its GDP on health care in 2010. Germany and France spent \n11.6 percent of their GDP on health care. If we were as efficient as \nthe Netherlands, if we merely moved from last place to second-to-last \nplace in health care efficiency, we would save over $800 billion per \nyear.\n  For all of our excess spending, one might expect that Americans live \nlonger, healthier lives. But that is not the case. The Institute of \nMedicine recently compared the United States to 17 peer countries. We \nwere worst for prevalence of diabetes among adults, worst for obesity \nacross all age groups, and worst in infant mortality. We suffer higher \ndeath rates and worse outcomes for conditions such as heart disease and \nchronic lung disease.\n  According to the Week, avoidable infections passed on due to poor \nhospital hygiene kill as many people in the United States--about \n103,000 a year--as AIDS, breast cancer, and auto accidents combined. \nThese deaths are tragic because they are largely preventable. As we \nhave shown in Rhode Island, when hospital staff follow a checklist of \nbasic instructions washing their hands with soap, cleaning a patient's \nskin with antiseptic, placing sterile drapes over the patient, etc.--\nrates of infection plummet, and the costs of treating those infections \ndisappear. The costs of treating the 100,000 who die, as well as the \nhundreds of thousands who suffer nonlethal infections, disappear.\n  Delivery system reform has real promise in improving the management \nand prevention of chronic disease. These diseases accounted for 7 out \nof 10 deaths in the United States in 2011 and at least 75 percent of \nour health care spending.\n  I am not alone in saying that a correct diagnosis of the problem will \nlead us to delivery system reform. Gail Wilensky, the former \nAdministrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services under \nPresident George H.W. Bush, said in 2011, ``If we don't redesign what \nwe are doing, we can't just cut unit reimbursement and think we are \nsomehow getting a better system.''\n  In the private sector, George Halvorson, chairman and CEO of Kaiser \nPermanente said, ``There are people right now who want to cut benefits \nand ration care and have that be the avenue to cost reduction in this \ncountry and that's wrong. It's so wrong, it's almost criminal. It's an \ninept way of thinking about health care.''\n  Saving money by reforming how we deliver health care isn't just \npossible, it is happening. At a 2011 hearing I chaired of the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Greg Poulsen of \nIntermountain Healthcare said:\n\n       Intermountain and other organizations have shown that \n     improving quality is compatible with lowering costs and, \n     indeed, high-quality care is generally less expensive than \n     substandard care.\n\n  So when Republicans say we must cut Medicare and Medicaid benefits to \nfix our deficit, that assertion is flat-out wrong.\n  Attacking Medicare and Medicaid is consistent with a particular \npolitical ideology, but it is not consistent with the facts. It ignores \nthe fact that we operate a wildly inefficient health care system and \nthat our health care spending problem is systemwide, not unique to \nFederal health programs. It is not just Medicare and Medicaid; former \nSecretary of Defense Robert Gates said of the Defense budget, ``We're \nbeing eaten alive by health care.''\n  The President's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that we could \nsave approximately $700 billion every year in our health care system \nwithout compromising health outcomes. The Institute of Medicine \nrecently put this number at $750 billion. Other groups are even more \noptimistic: The New England Healthcare Institute has reported that $850 \nbillion could be saved annually. The Lewin Group and former Bush \nTreasury Secretary Paul O'Neill have estimated annual savings of a \nstaggering $1 trillion. Most recently, the Commonwealth Fund laid out a \nset of policies that would accelerate health care delivery system \nreform and slow health spending by $2 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  These savings will have a dramatic impact on the Federal budget. The \nFederal Government spends 40 percent of\n\n[[Page S2024]]\n\nAmerica's health care expenditures. If the estimate by the Council of \nEconomic Advisers is correct, we could reduce the Federal deficit by up \nto $280 billion per year. If we achieve only one-quarter of the Council \nof Economic Advisers' estimate, the Federal savings would be $70 \nbillion annually. Over a 10-year budget period, that amounts to $700 \nbillion in Federal health care savings all without taking away any \nbenefits, all while likely improving quality of care.\n  In a report I issued last year for the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, I found that the administration has made \nconsiderable progress on implementing the 45 delivery system reform \nprovisions in the law. But more can and must be done. Specifically, I \nagain urge the administration to set a cost-savings target for health \ncare delivery system reform. A cost-savings target will focus, guide, \nand spur the administration's efforts in a manner that vague intentions \nto ``bend the health care cost curve'' will not. As the Commonwealth \nFund concluded, ``The establishment of targets can serve both as a \nmetric to guide policy development and as an incentive for all involved \nparties to act to make them effective.''\n  In 1961, President Kennedy declared that within 10 years the United \nStates would put a man on the Moon and return him safely. The message--\nand the mission outlined--was clear. The result was a vast mobilization \nof private and public resources to achieve that purpose.\n  This administration has a similar opportunity--particularly now, at \nthe height of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. We need to \nput the full force of American innovation and ingenuity into achieving \na serious cost-savings target for our Nation's health care system. But \nit is hard to do that if they won't set one.\n  I urge the administration to set a cost-savings target, with a number \nand a date. And then let's get to work to give American families the \nhealth care system they deserve.

The recognition \ncame from three organizations that are committed to music education--\nthe VH1 Save The Music Foundation, the National Association of Music \nMerchants--NAMM, and the National Association for Music Education--\nNAfME.\n  I want to extend my personal thanks to the leaders of all three \norganizations for recognizing West Virginia, for their support of our \nefforts to rebuild music programs in our State and for making a special \nday even more special--with an award ceremony today that included \nperformances by singer-songwriter Vanessa Carlton, jazz guitarist and \nformer New York Yankees champion Bernie Williams and Red Hot Chili \nPeppers drummer Chad Smith.\n  I enjoyed their performances, but I also was moved by their stories \nof personal and professional benefits from their music education. Their \nstories made clear how the opportunity to learn about the arts and to \nperform as an artist helps students' ideas and realities beyond words \nand numbers in textbooks.\n  But even more special was the fact that the Save The Music award \nceremony included a performance from a student jazz ensemble from \nShepherdstown Middle School, which received a VH1 Save The Music grant \nin 2012. I was so proud to listen to these young musicians. They are a \nwonderful example of the extraordinary way music can impact the lives \nof students, not just in West Virginia but all over the country.\n  I would like to congratulate these students on their performance \ntoday and on their many accomplishments leading up to this special \nday--and I wish them many more successes in the future. Also, I would \nlike to especially thank Shepherdstown Middle School Principal \nElizabeth Best and Shepherdstown music teacher Mrs. Chad Conant for \ntheir generous contributions and assistance.\n  On behalf of the State of West Virginia, I was honored to accept, \nalong with fellow West Virginia Senator Jay Rockefeller and Randall \nReid-Smith, Commissioner of the West Virginia Division of Culture and \nHistory, a Support Music Award from NAMM, which works in partnership \nwith the VH1 Save The Music Foundation and NAfME.\n  I deeply appreciate the acknowledgement of our efforts to support \nmusic education. And, of course, I deeply appreciate the contributions \nto music education that these organizations make in West Virginia and \nthroughout the United States.\n  The VH1 Save the Music Foundation is a nonprofit organization \ndedicated to restoring instrumental music education programs in \nAmerica's public schools, and raising awareness about the importance of \nmusic as part of each child's complete education. To date, VH1 Save the \nMusic has provided more than $49.5 million in new musical instruments \nto 1,850 public schools in more than 192 school districts around the \ncountry, impacting the lives of over 2.1 million children. Research \nsponsored by NAMM shows clearly that students participating in music \neducation do better in school and go on to college.\n  Since 2009, the VH1 Save the Music Foundation has given instrumental \nmusic education grants valued at $1.05 million to 35 schools in 30 \ncounties throughout West Virginia. And I am informed that the \nFoundation is committed to funding music education in all 55 counties \nof the Mountain State. This initiative started when I was Governor, and \nI am pleased to see it moving forward so positively.\n  This collaboration is a true example of the huge benefits of public-\nprivate partnerships. It is also a strong incentive for all of us to \nwork for more Federal and State funding to enhance music education in \nour public schools.\n  In today's global economy, creativity is essential. Consequently, \neducation in the arts is more important than ever because education in \nthe arts helps students be inventive, resourceful and imaginative. \nMusic education is not just a privilege--it is essential.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/20/senate-section/article/S2024-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2024-S2025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING VIRGINIA ``GINNY'' HILL WOOD\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Virginia \n``Ginny'' Hill Wood. On March 8, 2013, Ginny passed away at the young \nage of 95. Alaska lost a true pioneer and advocate for Alaska's \nwilderness. The Alaskan outdoors was always at the center of her life; \nshe guided her last backcountry trip at age 70, cross-country skied \ninto her mid-80s, and gardened into her early 90s.\n  Born Virginia Hill on October 24, 1917, Ginny grew up in Washington \nand Oregon, where she fell in love with the outdoors. She took her \nfirst plane ride at the early age of 4 sitting in her father's lap as \nthey flew with a barnstorming pilot. Ginny attended Washington State \nUniversity, and in 1938 she took a break when she biked through Europe \nfor a year before resuming her studies at the University of Washington. \nShe was eager to pursue her passion for flying, and joined the Civilian \nPilot Training Service in college. During World War II, she enrolled in \nthe Women Airforce Service Pilots corps, known as WASP, and ferried all \ntypes of military planes throughout the Lower 48.\n  Her flying and sense of adventure brought her north to Alaska. Ginny \nlanded, literally, in Fairbanks, AK at Weeks Field on a very cold New \nYear's Day in 1947--along with fellow pilot and great friend Celia \nHunter in a second aircraft. Her arrival in Fairbanks when the town was \njust barely out of its rough mining camp days is illustrative of her \npioneering spirit. People were not flocking to Fairbanks in January of \n1947, and it was especially rare to find a female pilot. She soon began \nflying tourists from Fairbanks to Kotzebue. In the late 1940's Ginny \ntook a bicycling tour throughout postwar Europe with Celia Hunter, and \nwhen asked where she was from, Ginny would say ``Alaska.''\n  In 1950, Ginny married Morton ``Woody'' Wood, a forest ranger at Mt. \nMcKinley National Park. On a rainy\n\n[[Page S2025]]\n\nday in the summer of 1951, Ginny, Woody, and Celia arrived near the \nnorthern boundary of Mt. McKinley National Park in search of some land \nto homestead within view of Denali. That fall, Celia Hunter homesteaded \n67 acres. Together, the founders built Camp Denali with locally-\nharvested spruce logs and reclaimed materials from the National Park \nService, often with the help of friends and visitors, who would drop in \njust to look, but would stay to help haul logs. Ginny and Celia ran \nCamp Denali for 25 years, operating the remote tourist resort, forging \nlivelihoods out of ingenuity, hospitality, and love of the land.\n  Ginny was a committed, persistent, eloquent voice for conservation \nissues in Alaska. She was not afraid to speak on behalf of her values, \nand will be remembered in part as Alaska's pioneer conservationist. Her \nindependent lifestyle, from building cabins, flying in the bush, and \nguiding in the Brooks Range and ANWR has inspired and served as an \nexample for those around her. Her service as a WASP earned her a \nCongressional Gold Medal. She also received the Alaska-Siberia Lend \nLease Award for her flying in 2002. I had the honor of presenting Ginny \nher Congressional Gold Medal at her cabin in Fairbanks in 2010 as she \nwas unable to attend the ceremony in Washington, DC. Pouring through \nher scrapbook and listening to her stories was a visit I will always \nremember.\n  Though many have noted that she served as a role model for other \nwomen, Ginny stated that ``I did what I wanted to do and I happened to \nbe a woman.'' I admired her strong commitment to protecting the beauty \nof Alaska and her zest for life.\n  I extend my sincerest condolences to Ginny's remaining family; her \ndaughter Romany Wood and son-in-law Carl Rosenberg of San Cristobal, \nNM. Alaska has lost a friend and champion. May she rest in \npeace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/20/senate-section/article/S2024-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2024-S2025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING VIRGINIA ``GINNY'' HILL WOOD\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prevent \nunjust and irrational criminal punishments; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Paul to introduce \nthe Justice Safety Valve Act of 2013, which will start to take on the \nproblem of the ever-increasing Federal prison population and spiraling \ncosts that spend more and more of our justice budget on keeping people \nin prison, thereby reducing opportunities to do more to keep our \ncommunities safe. This bill will combat injustice in Federal sentencing \nand the waste of taxpayer dollars by allowing judges appropriate \ndiscretion in sentencing.\n  As a former prosecutor, I understand that criminals must be held \naccountable and that long sentences are sometimes necessary to keep \nviolent criminals off the street and deter those who would commit \nviolent crime. I have come to believe, however, that mandatory minimum \nsentences do more harm than good. As Justice Kennedy said, ``In too \nmany cases, mandatory minimum sentences are unwise and unjust.''\n  Currently a ``safety valve'' provision allows low-level drug \noffenders to avoid mandatory minimum penalties if certain conditions \nare met. The bill we introduce today would extend that safety valve to \nall Federal crimes subject to mandatory minimum penalties, allowing a \njudge to impose a sentence other than a statutorily designated \nmandatory sentence in cases in which key factors are present. The judge \nwould be required to provide notice to the parties and to state in \nwriting the reasons justifying the alternative sentence.\n  The United States has a mass incarceration problem. Between 1970 and \n2010, the number of people incarcerated grew by 700 percent. Although \nthe United States has only 5 percent of the world's population, we \nincarcerate almost a quarter of its prisoners. At the end of 2011, 2.2 \nmillion people were in jail or prison in the United States. That means \nwe incarcerate roughly 1 in every 100 adults.\n  As of last week, the Federal prison population was over 217,000. \nAlmost half of those men and women are imprisoned on drug charges. \nCompare this with 1980, when the Federal prison population was just \n25,000. Since 2000 alone, the Federal prison population has increased \nby 55 percent.\n  As more and more people are incarcerated for longer and longer, the \nresulting costs have placed an enormous strain on the Justice \nDepartment's budget and have at the same time severely limited the \nability to enact policies that prevent crimes effectively and \nefficiently. At a time when our economy has been struggling to recover \nfrom the worst recession in the last 75 years and our budget is \nlimited, we must look at the wasteful spending that occurs with \noverincarceration.\n  At the federal level, over the last 5 years, our prison budget has \ngrown by nearly $2 billion. In 2007, we spent approximately $5.1 \nbillion on Federal prisons. Last year, the Federal Bureau of Prisons \nrequested more than $6.8 billion. That means less money for Federal law \nenforcement, less aid to State and local law enforcement, and less \nfunding for crime prevention programs and prisoner reentry programs. In \nshort, we have less to spend on the kinds of programs that evidence has \nshown work best to keep crime rates down. Building more prisons and \nlocking people up for longer and longer--especially nonviolent \noffenders--is not the best use of taxpayer money and is, in fact, an \nineffective means of keeping our communities safe.\n  The proliferation of Federal mandatory minimum sentences is not the \nonly factor driving the increase in incarceration rates, but it is an \nimportant factor. The number of mandatory minimum penalties in the \nFederal code nearly doubled from 1991 to 2011. Even those defendants \nnot subject to mandatory minimums have seen their penalties increase as \na result of mandatory penalties being incorporated into the U.S. \nsentencing guidelines.\n  In addition to driving up our prison population, mandatory minimum \npenalties can lead to terribly unjust results in individual cases. This \nis why a large majority of judges oppose mandatory minimum sentences. \nIn a 2010 survey by the U.S. Sentencing Commission of more than 600 \nFederal district court judges, nearly 70 percent agreed that the \nexisting safety valve provision should be extended to all Federal \noffenses. That is what our bill does.\n\n[[Page S2029]]\n\nJudges, who hand down sentences and can see close up when they are \nappropriate and just, overwhelmingly oppose mandatory minimum \nsentences.\n  Congress has too often moved in the wrong direction by imposing new \nmandatory minimum sentences unsupported by evidence while failing to \nreauthorize crucial programs like the Second Chance Act to rehabilitate \nprisoners who will be released to rejoin our communities. Our reliance \non mandatory minimums has been a great mistake. I am not convinced it \nhas reduced crime, but I am convinced it has imprisoned people, \nparticularly nonviolent offenders, for far longer than is just or \nbeneficial. It is time for us to let judges go back to acting as judges \nand making decisions based on the individual facts before them. A one-\nsize-fits-all approach to sentencing does not make us safer.\n  This is a bipartisan issue. Sentencing reform works. States, \nincluding very conservative States such as Texas, that have implemented \nsentencing reform have saved money and seen their crime rates drop.\n  I thank Senator Paul for his dedication to this cause and for working \nwith me on this legislation. I hope other Senators will join us in \nadvancing this legislation and ensuring that taxpayer dollars are used \nmore efficiently to better prevent crime rather than simply building \nmore prisons.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S. 620. A bill to withhold the salary of the Director of OMB upon \nfailure to submit the President's budget to Congress as required by \nsection 1105 of title 31, United States Code; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the No Budget No OMB \nPay Act of 2013.\n  The No Budget No OMB Pay Act of 2013 will prohibit paying the \nsalaries of the OMB Director, the Deputy Director of OMB, and the \nDeputy Director for Management of OMB for any period of time that the \nPresident is late in meeting his statutory requirement of submitting a \nbudget by the first Monday of February.\n  As many of my colleagues know, it has been over 1,400 days since the \nSenate has passed a budget. It is certainly progress that the Majority \nhas decided to finally put forward a budget and that the Senate will be \nable to debate and amend a budget--a budget that raises taxes by $1.5 \ntrillion, increases Washington spending by 62 percent, and fails to \nbalance the budget anytime in the next ten years.\n  Unfortunately, for the first time in recent memory, Congress is \nacting before receiving the President's budget. According to a recent \nheadline in the March 11, 2013 edition of the National Journal this is \nunprecedented and is a break from a 92-year tradition of having the \nPresident exercise leadership in the budget process.\n  Current law requires the President to send his budget by the first \nMonday of February. But President Obama has ignored this requirement. \nIn fact, he has missed the statutory deadline four out of five times. \nThis year he was required to issue his budget proposal on February 4, \n2013. But he missed this deadline. So while the Senate is finally \nacting, it has been 44 days since the President has failed to live up \nto his commitment.\n  We know that for Congress to get paid, it must live up to its \nresponsibilities and pass a budget. The OMB Director and other high-\nlevel OMB officials also have obligations to meet. After all, these \nofficials are responsible for putting together the President's budget. \nBoth the executive and legislative branch share responsibility when it \ncomes to the federal budget. But without Presidential leadership \nWashington spending will remain out of control. Taxpayers deserve \nbetter. They deserve accountability.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 620\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``No Budget, No OMB Pay Act of \n     2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DETERMINATION OF COMPLIANCE WITH STATUTORY \n                   REQUIREMENT TO SUBMIT THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET.\n\n       Not later than 3 days after the President's budget is due, \n     the Inspector General of the Office of Personnel Management \n     shall--\n       (1) make an annual determination of whether the Director of \n     the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the President \n     are in compliance with section 1105 of title 31, United \n     States Code; and\n       (2) provide a written notification of such determination to \n     the Chairpersons of the Committee on the Budget and the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the \n     Chairpersons of the Committee on the Budget and the Committee \n     on Appropriations of the House of Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 3. NO PAY UPON FAILURE TO TIMELY SUBMIT THE PRESIDENT'S \n                   BUDGET TO CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, no funds may be appropriated or otherwise be made \n     available from the United States Treasury for the pay of the \n     Director of OMB, Deputy Director of OMB, and the Deputy \n     Director for Management of OMB during any period of \n     noncompliance determined by the Inspector General of the \n     Office of Personnel Management under section 2.\n       (b) No Retroactive Pay.--The Director of OMB, Deputy \n     Director of OMB, and the Deputy Director for Management of \n     OMB may not receive pay for any period of noncompliance \n     determined by the Inspector General of the Office of \n     Personnel Management under section 2 at any time after the \n     end of that period.\n\n     SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect upon the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Casey, \n        Mr. Franken, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Murphy, Ms. Warren, Mr. Levin, \n        Mr. Durbin, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Brown, Mr. \n        Merkley, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Hirono, and Mr. \n        Cowan):\n  S. 631. A bill to allow Americans to earn paid sick time so that they \ncan address their own health needs and the health needs of their \nfamilies; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, 10 years ago, Senator Ted Kennedy first \nintroduced the Healthy Families Act. This landmark legislation \naddressed a problem that so many working families struggle with each \nand every day--how do I balance my job responsibilities with my health \nand the health of my family? The Healthy Families Act sought to make \nthat difficult juggling act a little bit easier by ensuring that \nhardworking people have access to paid sick days. At the time, \nsupporters of the bill, myself included, argued that families were \nunder increasing strain, with rising costs, stagnant wages, and \ndisappearing job security. We argued that families were forced to make \nimpossible choices between their jobs and their families. We pledged \nthat working families deserved better.\n  Today, a decade later, the circumstances facing working families are \neven more challenging: Americans are still struggling to get by. Wages \nare still stagnant, job security is even more tenuous, and too many \nworkers struggle with whether to give up a paycheck or put their jobs \nat risk whenever a child has an asthma attack or an elderly parent \ncomes down with the flu. Ten years later, working families still \ndeserve better.\n  Today, 10 years later, almost 40 percent of American workers, \nincluding \\2/3\\ of low-wage workers, don't have the ability to earn \neven a single paid sick day. For these workers, missing work due to an \nillness, injury, or doctor's appointment can mean putting their job and \ntheir family's financial security in jeopardy. As a consequence, many \nof these workers have no choice but to report to work sick or send \ntheir children to school or day care sick--which puts public health in \njeopardy as well.\n  Health officials urge people with contagious illnesses to stay home \nfrom work to avoid spreading disease. But workers in industries with \nthe most intensive contact with the public, such as food service and \nhospitality, are the least likely to have paid sick days. In 2010, \nthree-quarters of food service workers lacked paid sick days. So not \nsurprisingly, nearly two-thirds of restaurant workers have reported \ncooking or serving food while sick. Similarly, most personal care and \nservice jobs, like child care workers and elder care workers, work with \nvulnerable populations but are unable to take a sick day without \nrisking their jobs or paychecks. This has clear implications for\n\n[[Page S2030]]\n\npublic health. In fact, a recent study found that a lack of workplace \npolicies including paid sick days contributed to an additional 5 \nmillion cases of influenza-like illness during the H1N1 outbreak in \n2009.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. We can give working people the tools \nthey need to protect their families' health and economic well-being \nwhile also safeguarding the public health.\n  This is why Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro and I are reintroducing the \nHealthy Families Act, which would allow U.S. workers to earn up to \nseven paid sick days per year to recover from short-term illness, care \nfor a sick family member, seek routine medical care, or seek help if \nthey are victims of domestic violence. This important legislation will \nprovide much-needed security for hardworking families struggling to \nbalance the obligations of work and family. It will improve public \nhealth and decrease health costs by preventing the spread of disease \nand giving employees better options for obtaining preventive care and \ntreatment. It will also help victims of domestic violence to protect \ntheir families and their futures.\n  Providing paid sick days to workers will be good for working people \nand their families, and good for our businesses and our economy as \nwell. Allowing workers to attend to their own health or their families' \nhealth fosters good will and loyalty toward employers, and boosts \nmorale and productivity in the workplace. In fact, 70 percent of lost \nproductivity due to illness is not attributed to absent workers but \nrather to ``presenteeism,'' the practice of employees working while \nsick, infecting their colleagues, and being less productive themselves. \nBusinesses whose workers have paid sick days will also benefit from \nreduced turnover--and its high associated costs--when workers can hold \non to their jobs. Paid sick days can also help reduce occupational \ninjuries. In fact, a recent study found that workers with access to \npaid sick leave were 28 percent less likely than workers without paid \nsick leave to suffer nonfatal occupational injuries. Employers \nthemselves are beginning to recognize the positive effects of paid sick \ndays. Five years after paid sick days were implemented in San \nFrancisco, \\2/3\\ of employers surveyed said they were ``supportive'' of \npaid sick days, while one third said they were ``very supportive.''\n  Ensuring that workers have paid sick days will also reduce health \ncare costs, by helping ensure that workers get timely care including \npreventive care, before medical issues become acute. A 2011 study shows \nthat a universal paid sick days policy would reduce preventable visits \nto the emergency room and result in cost savings of $1.1 billion per \nyear, including $500 million in savings for public health insurance \nlike Medicaid. And a 2012 study showed that workers with paid sick \nleave were more likely to get cancer screenings, including a mammogram, \nPap test, or endoscopy, and they were more likely to have visited a \ndoctor in the previous year than workers without paid sick leave.\n  One more very important benefit; paid sick days will allow workers \npeace of mind and financial security. They won't face a lost paycheck \nor a lengthy job search each time they become ill. They won't face \nreduced income and have to cut back on their spending on food, \nmedicine, and other necessities bought in their local communities. \nWorking people will have the security of knowing that if illness \nstrikes, they will be able to tend to their families without losing \ntheir jobs or their paychecks.\n  I thank my colleagues who are joining me today as original cosponsors \nof this critically important legislation, and I encourage all Senators \nto join us in supporting the Healthy Families Act. This bill is no less \nimportant today than it was when it was first introduced by my friend, \nthe late Senator Ted Kennedy, a decade ago. Knowing that 10 years have \ngone by and workers around the country have still not secured paid sick \ndays should not discourage us. It should strengthen our resolve to see \nthis basic right afforded to all working Americans and their families.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 631\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Healthy Families Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Working Americans need time to meet their own health \n     care needs and to care for family members, including their \n     children, spouse, domestic partner, parents (including \n     parents-in-law), and other children and adults for whom they \n     are caregivers.\n       (2) Health care needs include preventive health care, \n     diagnostic procedures, medical treatment, and recovery in \n     response to short- and long-term illnesses and injuries.\n       (3) Providing employees time off to meet health care needs \n     ensures that they will be healthier in the long run. \n     Preventive care helps avoid illnesses and injuries and \n     routine medical care helps detect illnesses early and shorten \n     their duration. A 2012 study published by BioMed Central \n     Public Health of results of the National Health Interview \n     Survey found that lack of paid sick leave is a barrier to \n     receiving cancer screenings and preventive care. Workers with \n     paid sick leave were more likely to have a mammogram, Pap \n     test, or endoscopy, and were more likely to have visited a \n     doctor in the previous year, than workers without paid sick \n     leave, even when the results were adjusted for \n     sociodemographic factors.\n       (4) When parents are available to care for their children \n     who become sick, children recover faster, more serious \n     illnesses are prevented, and children's overall mental and \n     physical health improve. In a 2009 study published in the \n     American Journal of Public Health, 81 percent of parents of a \n     child with special health care needs reported that taking \n     leave from work to be with their child had a ``good'' or \n     ``very good'' effect on their child's physical health. \n     Similarly, 85 percent of parents of such a child found that \n     taking such leave had a ``good'' or ``very good'' effect on \n     their child's emotional health.\n       (5) When parents cannot afford to miss work and must send \n     children with contagious illnesses to child care centers or \n     schools, infection can spread rapidly through child care \n     centers and schools.\n       (6) Providing paid sick time improves public health by \n     reducing infectious disease. Policies that make it easier for \n     sick adults and children to be isolated at home reduce the \n     spread of infectious disease. A 2012 study published in the \n     American Journal of Public Health found that a lack of \n     workplace policies like paid sick days contributed to an \n     additional 5,000,000 cases of influenza-like illness during \n     the H1N1 pandemic of 2009.\n       (7) Routine medical care reduces medical costs by detecting \n     and treating illness and injury early, decreasing the need \n     for emergency care. These savings benefit public and private \n     payers of health insurance, including private businesses. A \n     2011 study by the Institute for Women's Policy Research found \n     that a universal paid sick days policy would reduce \n     preventable visits to the emergency room and result in cost \n     savings of $1,100,000,000 per year, including $500,000,000 in \n     savings for public health insurance like Medicaid.\n       (8) The provision of individual and family sick time by \n     large and small businesses, both here in the United States \n     and elsewhere, demonstrates that policy solutions are both \n     feasible and affordable in a competitive economy. A 2009 \n     study by the Center for Economic and Policy Research found \n     that, of 22 countries with comparable economies, the United \n     States was 1 of only 3 countries that did not provide any \n     paid time off for workers with short-term illnesses.\n       (9) Measures that ensure that employees are in good health \n     and do not need to worry about unmet family health problems \n     help businesses by promoting productivity and reducing \n     employee turnover.\n       (10) The American Productivity Audit completed in 2003 \n     found that lost productivity due to illness costs \n     $226,000,000,000 annually, and that 71 percent of that cost \n     stems from presenteeism, the practice of employees coming to \n     work despite illness. Studies in the Journal of Occupational \n     and Environmental Medicine, the Employee Benefit News, and \n     the Harvard Business Review show that presenteeism is a \n     larger productivity drain than either absenteeism or short-\n     term disability.\n       (11) Working while sick also increases a worker's \n     probability of suffering an injury on the job. A 2012 study \n     published by the American Journal of Public Health found that \n     workers with access to paid sick leave were 28 percent less \n     likely than workers without paid sick leave to suffer \n     nonfatal occupational injuries.\n       (12) The absence of paid sick time has forced Americans to \n     make untenable choices between needed income and jobs on the \n     one hand and caring for their own and their family's health \n     on the other.\n       (13) Nearly 40 percent of the private sector workforce, and \n     25 percent of the public sector workforce, lacks paid sick \n     time. Another 4,000,000 theoretically have access to sick \n     time, but have not been on the job long enough to use it. \n     Millions more lack sick time they can use to care for a sick \n     child or ill family member.\n       (14)(A) Workers' access to paid sick time varies \n     dramatically by wage level.\n\n[[Page S2031]]\n\n       (B) For private sector workers--\n       (i) for workers in the lowest quartile of earners, 71 \n     percent lack paid sick time;\n       (ii) for workers in the next 2 quartiles, 36 and 25 \n     percent, respectively, lack paid sick time; and\n       (iii) even for workers in the highest quartile, 16 percent \n     lack paid sick time.\n       (C) For public sector workers--\n       (i) for workers in the lowest quartile of earners, 25 \n     percent lack paid sick time;\n       (ii) for workers in the next 2 quartiles, 7 percent lack \n     paid sick time; and\n       (iii) for workers in the highest quartile, 2 percent lack \n     paid sick time.\n       (D) In addition, millions of workers cannot use paid sick \n     time to care for ill family members.\n       (15) Due to the roles of men and women in society, the \n     primary responsibility for family caregiving often falls on \n     women, and such responsibility affects the working lives of \n     women more than it affects the working lives of men.\n       (16) An increasing number of men are also taking on \n     caregiving obligations, and men who request paid time for \n     caregiving purposes are often denied accommodation or \n     penalized because of stereotypes that caregiving is only \n     ``women's work''.\n       (17) Employers' reliance on persistent stereotypes about \n     the ``proper'' roles of both men and women in the workplace \n     and in the home continues a cycle of discrimination and \n     fosters stereotypical views about women's commitment to work \n     and their value as employees.\n       (18) Employment standards that apply to only one gender \n     have serious potential for encouraging employers to \n     discriminate against employees and applicants for employment \n     who are of that gender.\n       (19) It is in the national interest to ensure that all \n     Americans can care for their own health and the health of \n     their families while prospering at work.\n       (20) Nearly 1 in 3 American women report physical or sexual \n     abuse by a husband or boyfriend at some point in their lives. \n     Domestic violence also affects men. Women account for about \n     85 percent of the victims of domestic violence and men \n     account for approximately 15 percent of the victims. \n     Therefore, women disproportionately need time off to care for \n     their health or to find solutions, such as obtaining a \n     restraining order or finding housing, to avoid or prevent \n     physical or sexual abuse.\n       (21) One study showed that 85 percent of domestic violence \n     victims at a women's shelter who were employed missed work \n     because of abuse. The mean number of days of paid work lost \n     by a rape victim is 8.1 days, by a victim of physical assault \n     is 7.2 days, and by a victim of stalking is 10.1 days. \n     Nationwide, domestic violence victims lose almost 8,000,000 \n     days of paid work per year.\n       (22) Without paid sick days that can be used to address the \n     effects of domestic violence, these victims are in grave \n     danger of losing their jobs. One survey found that 96 percent \n     of employed domestic violence victims experienced problems at \n     work related to the violence. The Government Accountability \n     Office similarly found that 24 to 52 percent of victims \n     report losing a job due, at least in part, to domestic \n     violence. The loss of employment can be particularly \n     devastating for victims of domestic violence, who often need \n     economic security to ensure safety.\n       (23) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \n     estimated that domestic violence costs over $700,000,000 \n     annually due to the victims' lost productivity in employment.\n       (24) Efforts to assist abused employees result in positive \n     outcomes for employers as well as employees because employers \n     can retain workers who might otherwise be compelled to leave.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure that all working Americans can address their \n     own health needs and the health needs of their families by \n     requiring employers to permit employees to earn up to 56 \n     hours of paid sick time including paid time for family care;\n       (2) to diminish public and private health care costs by \n     enabling workers to seek early and routine medical care for \n     themselves and their family members;\n       (3) to assist employees who are, or whose family members \n     are, victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or \n     stalking, by providing the employees with paid time away from \n     work to allow the victims to receive treatment and to take \n     the necessary steps to ensure their protection;\n       (4) to address the historical and persistent widespread \n     pattern of employment discrimination on the basis of gender \n     by both private and public sector employers;\n       (5) to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs (1) \n     through (4) in a manner that is feasible for employers; and\n       (6) consistent with the provision of the 14th Amendment to \n     the Constitution relating to equal protection of the laws, \n     and pursuant to Congress' power to enforce that provision \n     under section 5 of that Amendment--\n       (A) to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs (1) \n     through (4) in a manner that minimizes the potential for \n     employment discrimination on the basis of sex by ensuring \n     generally that paid sick time is available for eligible \n     medical reasons on a gender-neutral basis; and\n       (B) to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity for \n     women and men.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 82\n\n       Whereas on March 23, 1983, President Ronald Reagan \n     delivered a televised address to the Nation on the nuclear \n     and ballistic missile threat to the United States and \n     appealed to the people of the United States to support the \n     development of new technologies to counter this threat;\n       Whereas March 23, 2013, marks the 30th anniversary of this \n     landmark address;\n       Whereas President Reagan believed that United States \n     security is based on being prepared and willing to meet all \n     threats;\n       Whereas President Reagan envisioned a defensive, non-\n     nuclear capability to intercept and destroy strategic nuclear \n     missiles before they reached the United States and our \n     allies;\n       Whereas President Reagan envisioned these defenses to \n     significantly reduce any incentive an adversary may have to \n     threaten or attack the United States and our allies;\n       Whereas the proposal for these defenses, together with the \n     defenses themselves, have come to be known as the ``Strategic \n     Defense Initiative'';\n       Whereas President Reagan's vision has been inspired through \n     the efforts of dedicated Americans and allies who have \n     championed the pursuit of deterrence and protection to \n     overcome immense technical hurdles in developing ballistic \n     missile defense technologies and systems to protect the \n     United States, our allies, and our vital interests overseas;\n       Whereas on January 15, 1991, soldiers from the 11th Air \n     Defense Artillery brigade changed modern warfare forever when \n     they successfully intercepted an Al Hussein Missile launched \n     from Iraq towards Dhahran, Saudi Arabia;\n       Whereas missile defense was used in combat and was \n     successful during Operation Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom in defending the United States Armed Forces and the \n     forces of our allies;\n       Whereas the United States has achieved 58 successful \n     missile defense intercept tests since 2001;\n       Whereas the capability of United States missile defenses \n     were first successfully put on alert in response to a July \n     2006 missile launch by North Korea, and later put on alert \n     for all subsequent missile launches by North Korea (including \n     its last launch in December 2013), and was successfully \n     demonstrated on February 21, 2008, when a Standard Missile-3 \n     interceptor launched from the U.S.S. Lake Erie intercepted \n     and destroyed a disabled satellite of the National \n     Reconnaissance Office;\n       Whereas ballistic missile defense technology continues to \n     be developed, tested, and operationally deployed by the \n     United States, 21 allies and friends of the United States, \n     and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO);\n       Whereas the Missile Defense Agency and the United States \n     Armed Forces stand ever vigilant to deter aggression and \n     preserve the peace;\n       Whereas the Missile Defense Agency epicenter for test, \n     integration, and fielding United States rocket technology, \n     located in Huntsville, Alabama, is responsible for guiding \n     the programs essential to the overall success of the Missile \n     Defense Agency mission;\n       Whereas the United States Ballistic Missile Defense System \n     is intended to lead any potential adversary to conclude that \n     the risks of attacking the United States or our allies, or \n     our troops in theater, far outweigh potential gains;\n       Whereas the AEGIS Ballistic Missile Defense System \n     functions as a key, proven component of the integrated United \n     States Ballistic Missile Defense System and as the foundation \n     of sea-based ballistic missile defense for the United States, \n     Japan, Norway, the Republic of Korea, Spain, and the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization;\n       Whereas the United States Army Air Defense Artillery \n     Missile Defense Systems function as a key, proven component \n     of the integrated United States Ballistic Missile Defense \n     System and as the foundation of land-based ballistic missile \n     defense for Bahrain, Germany, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, the \n     Netherlands, Qatar, the Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, \n     Taiwan, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization;\n       Whereas the AEGIS Ballistic Missile Defense System and the \n     United States Army Air Defense Artillery Missile Defense \n     Systems effectively serve to deter aggression and devalue the \n     missiles of those who would threaten the peace and security \n     of the United States and our allies;\n       Whereas the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System and its \n     effective interceptor missiles currently deployed at Fort \n     Greely, Alaska, and Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, \n     together with the Missile Defense Integration and Operations \n     Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado, function as key \n     components of the integrated United States Ballistic Missile \n     Defense System;\n       Whereas the Ballistic Missile Defense Review of 2010 \n     concluded the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System is the \n     only system currently capable of protecting the United States \n     from an intercontinental ballistic missile;\n       Whereas the dedicated members of the Alaska National Guard \n     in the 49th Missile Battalion at Fort Greely, Alaska, stand \n     ready on a daily basis to defend and protect the Nation; and\n       Whereas the integrated ballistic missile defense system is \n     a key element of the national defense of the United States \n     and a vital capability to deter aggression and preserve \n     freedom and peace: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the vision and efforts of President Ronald \n     Reagan to promote peace and security;\n       (2) recognizes and expresses support for the refusal of the \n     people of the United States to accept United States \n     vulnerability to a ballistic missile attack on the homeland \n     or overseas; and\n       (3) commemorates the 30th anniversary of the address of \n     President Reagan to the Nation on national security and the \n     Strategic Defense Initiative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/20/senate-section/article/S2035-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2035-S2036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 83--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF MULTIPLE \n                        SCLEROSIS AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. CASEY (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Brown, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. \nBlumenthal) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe\n\n[[Page S2036]]\n\nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                               S. Res. 83\n\n       Whereas multiple sclerosis can impact men and women of all \n     ages, races, and ethnicities;\n       Whereas approximately 2,100,000 individuals worldwide have \n     been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis;\n       Whereas multiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed between \n     the ages of 20 and 50, yet it is estimated that between 8,000 \n     and 10,000 children and adolescents are living with multiple \n     sclerosis;\n       Whereas multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable neurological \n     disease that interrupts the flow of information within the \n     brain and between the brain and the rest of the body;\n       Whereas symptoms of multiple sclerosis range from numbness \n     and tingling to blindness and paralysis and the progress, \n     severity, and specific symptoms of multiple sclerosis in any \n     1 individual cannot yet be predicted;\n       Whereas there is no laboratory test available that \n     definitely defines a diagnosis for multiple sclerosis;\n       Whereas although multiple sclerosis is not directly \n     inherited, studies show that genetic factors can indicate \n     that certain individuals are susceptible to the disease;\n       Whereas the exact cause of multiple sclerosis is still \n     unknown and there is no cure;\n       Whereas in rare cases, multiple sclerosis is so progressive \n     that the disease is fatal, but most people with multiple \n     sclerosis have a normal or near-normal life expectancy;\n       Whereas severe multiple sclerosis can shorten the life span \n     of an individual;\n       Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition, an affiliation of \n     multiple sclerosis organizations dedicated to the enhancement \n     of the quality of life for all individuals affected by \n     multiple sclerosis, recognizes and supports Multiple \n     Sclerosis Awareness Week;\n       Whereas the mission of the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition is \n     to increase opportunities for cooperation and provide greater \n     opportunity to leverage the effective use of resources for \n     the benefit of the multiple sclerosis community;\n       Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition recognizes and \n     supports Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week during March of \n     every calendar year;\n       Whereas the goals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week \n     are--\n       (1) to invite individuals to join the movement to end \n     multiple sclerosis;\n       (2) to encourage individuals to demonstrate a commitment to \n     moving toward a world free of multiple sclerosis; and\n       (3) to acknowledge the individuals who have dedicated time \n     and talent to promote multiple sclerosis research and \n     programs; and\n       Whereas this year, Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week is \n     recognized during the week of March 11, 2013, through March \n     17, 2013: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of Multiple Sclerosis \n     Awareness Week;\n       (2) encourages States, territories, possessions of the \n     United States, and localities to support the goals and ideals \n     of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week by issuing proclamations \n     designating Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week;\n       (3) encourages media organizations to participate in \n     Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week and help provide education \n     to the public about multiple sclerosis;\n       (4) commends the efforts of the States, territories, and \n     possessions of the United States to support the goals and \n     ideals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week;\n       (5) recognizes and reaffirms the commitment of the United \n     States to ending multiple sclerosis by promoting--\n       (A) awareness about individuals that are affected by \n     multiple sclerosis;

which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                               S. Res. 84\n\n       Whereas the people of ancient Greece developed the concept \n     of democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested \n     in the people;\n       Whereas the founding fathers of the United States, many of \n     whom read Greek political philosophy in the original Greek \n     language, drew heavily on the political experience and \n     philosophy of ancient Greece in forming the representative \n     democracy of the United States;\n       Whereas Petros Mavromichalis, the former Commander in Chief \n     of Greece and a founder of the modern Greek state, said to \n     the citizens of the United States in 1821, ``It is in your \n     land that liberty has fixed her abode and . . . in imitating \n     you, we shall imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of \n     them if we succeed in resembling you'';\n       Whereas the Greek national anthem, the ``Hymn to Liberty'', \n     includes the words, ``most heartily was gladdened George \n     Washington's brave land'';\n       Whereas the people of the United States generously offered \n     humanitarian assistance to the people of Greece during their \n     struggle for independence;\n       Whereas Greece, in one of the most consequential ``David \n     vs. Goliath'' victories for freedom and democracy in modern \n     times, refused to surrender to the Axis forces and inflicted \n     a fatal wound at a crucial moment in World War II, forcing \n     Adolf Hitler to change his timeline and delaying the attack \n     on Russia where the Axis forces met defeat;\n       Whereas Winston Churchill said, ``if there had not been the \n     virtue and courage of the Greeks, we do not know which the \n     outcome of World War II would have been'' and ``no longer \n     will we say that Greeks fight like heroes, but that heroes \n     fight like Greeks'';\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of people of Greece were \n     killed in Greece during World War II in defense of the values \n     of the Allies;\n       Whereas, throughout the 20th century, Greece was one of a \n     few countries that allied with the United States in every \n     major international conflict;\n       Whereas Greece is a strategic partner and ally of the \n     United States in bringing political stability and economic \n     development to the volatile Balkan region, having invested \n     billions of dollars in the countries of the region, thereby \n     helping to create tens of thousands of new jobs, and having \n     contributed more than $750,000,000 in development aid for the \n     region;\n       Whereas the Government and people of Greece actively \n     participate in peacekeeping and peace-building operations \n     conducted by international organizations, including the \n     United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the \n     European Union, and the Organization for Security and Co-\n     operation in Europe, and have more recently provided critical \n     support to the operation of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization in Libya;\n       Whereas Greece received worldwide praise for its \n     extraordinary handling during the 2004 Olympic Games of more \n     than 14,000 athletes and more than 2,000,000 spectators and \n     journalists, a feat the Government and people of Greece \n     handled efficiently, securely, and with hospitality;\n       Whereas Greece, located in a region where Christianity \n     meets Islam and Judaism, maintains excellent relations with \n     Muslim countries and Israel;\n       Whereas the Government of Greece has taken important steps \n     in recent years to further cross-cultural understanding, \n     rapprochement, and cooperation in various fields with Turkey, \n     and has also improved its relations with other countries in \n     the region, including Israel, thus enhancing the stability of \n     the wider region;\n       Whereas the governments and people of Greece and the United \n     States are at the forefront of efforts to advance freedom, \n     democracy, peace, stability, and human rights;\n       Whereas those efforts and similar ideals have forged a \n     close bond between the people of Greece and the United \n     States;
