Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion \nto concur in the House message with respect to the bipartisan budget \nagreement postcloture.\n  Rollcall votes are possible throughout the day. We will notify \nSenators as soon as we know that votes will be forthcoming.\n\n\n           Measures Placed on the Calendar--S. 1845, S. 1846\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am told there are two bills at the desk \ndue for a second reading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bills by \ntitle for the second time.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       A bill (S. 1845) to provide for the extension of certain \n     unemployment benefits, and for other purposes.\n       A bill (S. 1846) to delay the implementation of certain \n     provisions of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act \n     of 2012, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would object to any further proceedings \nwith respect to these two bills.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bills will \nbe placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                          Unfinished Business\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today the Senate is debating the House-\npassed budget agreement which was an important step in avoiding another \ndangerous and costly government shutdown to our economy such as we had \nin October. Another shutdown caused by the Republicans would undercut \nthe economic progress of the last 4 years. When Republicans closed the \nFederal Government for business in October, it cost $2 billion in lost \nproductivity alone. The combined cost of the shutdown and the \nRepublican threats to force catastrophic default on the Nation's bills \ncost the economy 120,000 private sector jobs in the first 2 weeks of \nOctober alone--120,000 jobs.\n  But the agreement the Senate is considering today will help us avoid \nanother costly shutdown. The bargain rolls back the painful and \narbitrary cuts of sequester, including devastating cuts to education, \nmedical research, infrastructure investments, and defense jobs.\n  This is not a perfect bargain. No compromise is ever perfect. But the \nSenate should pass this agreement quickly so the Appropriations \nCommittee, under the leadership of Chairwoman Mikulski, can begin \ncrafting appropriations bills.\n  It is unfortunate the Republicans have forced the Senate to run out \nthe clock on this measure, even though it passed the House on an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan basis and has the support of the majority in \nthe Senate. Why are we wasting time? It is time to get back to setting \nfiscal policy through the regular order of the budget process rather \nthan the hostage taking which takes place so often here by my \nRepublican colleagues. It is time for Congress to show the American \npeople that Democrats and Republicans can compromise rather than \nlurching from crisis to crisis. Yet Republicans have insisted on \nwasting 30 hours of the Senate's time before allowing a final vote on \nthis measure, even though they know it will pass with bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I read that the Republican leadership may also force the Senate to \nwork through the weekend and next week by dragging out the \nconsideration of several important executive nominations. That would be \nunfortunate. But if it happens, it happens. The Senate could wrap up \nwork on the budget bill, pass a defense authorization legislation, and \nconfirm these nominees by tomorrow afternoon. The only thing keeping us \nhere is more Republican obstruction.\n  I was also troubled to hear the senior Senator from Kentucky say that \nthe nominations we have considered this session and those on which I \nfiled cloture yesterday are nonessential. Nonessential? How about the \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security? That is nonessential, \nthe person assigned the task of protecting us from terrorist attacks is \nnonessential? I think that is wrong.\n  Does the Republican leader consider the Secretary of the Air Force or \nthe diplomats who run the State Department nonessential? There is a \nlong list of people who have been confirmed who are essential to \nrunning this government.\n  Does the Republican leader consider the judges who try criminal and \ncivil cases in overcrowded courtrooms across the Nation nonessential? \nWe confirmed talented and dedicated individuals to all of those \nessential posts last week.\n  Does the Republican leader consider the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve who sets this Nation's monetary policy to be nonessential? We \nwill consider Janet Yellen's nomination to lead this very important \npart of our government, the Federal Reserve--we will do it this week. \nWe will also vote on a number of other nominations, including a new \nDirector of the Internal Revenue Service. Nonessential? And the Deputy \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  We will consider the nomination of Brian Davis of Florida--a perfect, \nclassic example--to fill a district court seat that has been declared a \njudicial emergency. His nomination has been pending for more than 650 \ndays. Nonessential? I do not think so.\n  On the contrary, these are absolutely essential nominees. It is their \njob to carry out justice, protect our country, and safeguard the \neconomy. It is the Senate's job to confirm them. But how long will it \ntake the Senate to complete its job? It is up to my Republican friends.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, obviously I will be brief. I was simply \ntrying to engage the majority leader in a simple question. I will lay \nout the question here. I think it deserves an answer, not for me but \nfor the American people. Last week I had written the majority leader \nnoting that several press reports have stated that he has exempted much \nof his staff, specifically leadership staff, from ObamaCare, from the \nmandate of the ObamaCare statute that we and our staffs go to the \nexchanges for our health care. He has exempted much of his staff from \nthat. So I laid out some specific and pertinent and important questions \nrelated to that in a letter to him dated December 10, last week. I have \ngotten no response. I obviously got no response this morning. In fact, \nhe would not even yield for my question.\n  I think that is unfortunate. It is unfortunate not because I \npersonally deserve an answer, it is unfortunate because this is \nimportant. I think his constituents and the American people deserve an \nanswer. So I restated those four specific questions in my letter. They \nare in my letter. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Leader Harry Reid (D-NV),\n     Office of the Senate Majority Leader,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid, It has been reported that you \n     are the only Member of top Congressional leadership--House \n     and Senate, Democrat and Republican--who has exempted some of \n     your staff from having to procure their health insurance \n     through the Obamacare Exchange as clearly required by the \n     Obamacare statute.\n       Millions of Americans are losing the health care plans and \n     doctors they wanted to keep and are facing dramatic premium \n     increases, all as Washington enjoys a special exemption. \n     Given this, I ask you to publicly and in writing answer the \n     four important questions below regarding your office's \n     exemption. I will also be on the Senate floor to discuss this \n     at approximately 4:15 pm today and invite you to join me \n     there.\n       First, how did you designate each member of your staff, \n     including your leadership staff, regarding their status as \n     ``official'' (going to the Exchange) or ``not official'' \n     (exempted from Exchange)? Did you delegate that designation \n     to the Senate Disbursing Office, which would have the effect \n     of exempting all of your leadership staff from going to the \n     Exchange?\n       Second, if any of your staff is designated as ``not \n     official'' (exempted from Exchange), are any of those staff \n     members receiving official taxpayer-funded salaries, \n     benefits, office space, office equipment, or any other \n     taxpayer support?\n       Third, if any of your staff is designated as ``not \n     official'' (exempted from Exchange), did any of these staff \n     members assist you in drafting or passing Obamacare into law? \n     If so, which staff members exactly?\n       Fourth, how are the above designations of yours consistent \n     with the clear, unequivocal statement you made on September \n     12: ``Let's stop these really juvenile political games--the \n     one dealing with health care for senators and House members \n     and our staff. We are going to be part of exchanges, that's \n     what the law says and we'll be part of that.''\n       I look forward to your clear, written responses to these \n     important questions. I also look forward to having fair, up-\n     or-down votes on the Senate floor on my ``Show Your \n     Exemptions'' and ``No Washington Exemptions'' proposals in \n     the new year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     David Vitter.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know we are going to be voting on the \nbudget that was negotiated by Senator Murray and Paul Ryan. Sixty-seven \nSenators voted for cloture on that, so we will have a vote on passage \nthis afternoon, I think about 4:30.\n  But I wanted to raise an issue that has been raised previously--\nyesterday; that is, the process by which the Senate is operating where \nno amendments are being allowed either on the budget or on the Defense \nauthorization bill, which is the next bill we will turn to by the \ndecision of the majority leader.\n  I have congratulated Senator Murray and I congratulate Congressman \nRyan for their negotiation. But I do think there is an error that has \nbeen identified that needs to be corrected in the bill and which could \neasily be corrected if the majority leader would reconsider his \ndecision not to allow any amendments. This specifically has to do with \nthe discriminatory way in which Active-Duty military pensions are being \npenalized in a unique way that not even Federal workers who are going \nto be treated differently prospectively, not even civilian Federal \nworkers, are being treated in the same way our Active-Duty military \nare.\n  Several of my colleagues came to the floor yesterday--the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, the Senator from South Carolina and others--and \npointed out the discriminatory treatment which could easily be fixed. I \ndo not have any doubt but that the Senate would--as we attempted to do \nyesterday, the Senator from Alabama offered an attempt to take down the \namendment tree the majority leader has filled.\n  For people who do not follow the minutiae and the detail of what \nhappens here in the Senate, the majority leader has basically blocked \nany opportunity to offer an amendment that would remedy this \ndiscriminatory treatment for our military servicemembers.\n  I have heard at least two of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle say: We can come back and do it next year.\n  Why do it next year if we could do it now? I believe that if the \nSenate was given an opportunity to make this correction--I don't blame \nthe Senator from Washington and Congressman Ryan in their efforts to \ncome up with a budget to do what they did. I do blame us if we don't \nfix it this week when it is within our power to do so, and it is within \nthe power of the majority leader to allow us to vote on that and to \nmake that happen.\n  I don't have any doubt whatsoever that if we were able to come up \nwith an appropriate pay-for and a substitute for this cut in military \npensions, it would pass like a hot knife through butter in the House of \nRepresentatives when they reconvene.\n  Unfortunately, this is a product of the way the majority leader has \ndecided to run the Senate. I have another example of that, which I wish \nto turn to. This has to do with an amendment that I have offered on the \nDefense authorization bill, which is a bill we will turn to after \nauthorization of the budget. The Defense appropriations bill is a very \nimportant piece of legislation, and I congratulate Senator Inhofe and \nthe House, both in the majority party and the minority party, for \ncoming up with a pretty good bill. The problem is once again the \nmajority leader has decided to transform the Senate into basically a \nrailroad and to jam this bill through this week, probably by tomorrow \nnight, without any opportunity to offer any amendments.\n  That is a terrible mistake. The last time in recent memory that the \nmajority party decided to jam through a piece of legislation was \nObamaCare. I remember voting on Christmas Eve--something I hope we \ndon't repeat this year--and that was a party-line vote in the House and \nthe Senate.\n  We are discovering, as ObamaCare is being implemented, that a lot of \nthe promises that were made to the American people, such as: If you \nlike what you have, you can keep it, and the cost of your health care \nwill go down an average $2,500 for a family of 4--all of those were \nfalse.\n  That is what happens, the kinds of mistakes that are made, when there \nare not bipartisan efforts to come up with compromise legislation. \nInstead, the majority party uses the power it has to jam things \nthrough. We make mistakes. Things aren't adequately considered.\n  I don't care who you are; we all can benefit from other people's \nideas and suggestions, and that is the genius of the checks and \nbalances under the Constitution and under our form of government. But \nthe majority leader has decided to put all of that aside.\n  I read today in Politico that he has said he doesn't care that people \nare complaining about his ``my way or the highway'' approach. But it is \nnot only about our rights as Senators to participate in the process--it \nis not only\n\n[[Page S8922]]\n\nabout the rights of the 26 million people that I represent in Texas, \nwho are essentially being shut out of the process--this is about making \nmistakes that hurt people, mistakes that we would not make if we had \ntaken the time in a bipartisan way to try to address some of these \nconcerns. This discriminatory treatment of the military pensions is one \nexample.\n  Another example is when members of Al Qaeda struck our Nation on \nSeptember 11, 2001, they made it clear they viewed the entire American \nhomeland as the battlefield.\n  We were reminded of this again about 4 years ago when a radical \njihadist, who happened to be wearing the uniform of the U.S. Army, MAJ \nNidal Hasan, opened fire at a Fort Hood Army base in Killeen, TX. That \nshooter killed 12 American soldiers, 1 civilian, and shot and injured \n30 more.\n  This is a terrible tragedy. I remember President Obama coming down \nfor the memorial service where we honored the lives of these people who \nlost their lives in this terrible attack. But no matter how we slice \nit, this was a terrorist attack on American soil, not much different--\nexcept in the means by which it was carried out--than what happened on \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  Prior to committing this terrible terrorist attack, the Fort Hood \nshooter exchanged no fewer than 20 emails with a senior Al Qaeda \noperative, al-Awlaki, who was subsequently killed by a U.S. drone \nattack in Yemen by the President of the United States.\n  The shooter, Major Hasan, had become more radicalized over time--and \nthis is a problem with our military that seemed to have turned a blind \neye. But there is also a problem when the Federal Government calls this \nworkplace violence and doesn't call it a terrorist attack, which it \nactually was. He opened fire in the name of global jihad in the hopes \nof defending the Islamic empire and supporting his Muslim brothers.\n  That is why he asked the late Mr. al-Awlaki if Islamic law justified \n``killing U.S. soldiers and officers,'' and that is why he yelled out \n``Allahu Akbar'' before committing this massacre.\n  If a U.S. soldier is killed in Afghanistan by an Al Qaeda-inspired \nterrorist alongside the Taliban, he or she will posthumously be given a \nPurple Heart award and his or her family will receive the requisite \nbenefits that go along with losing your life in service to your \ncountry.\n  Yet the U.S. Government has chosen to discriminate against these \npeople who lost their lives at Fort Hood 4 years ago at the hands of a \nterrorist, who tragically happened to be a member of the uniformed \nmilitary of the United States, MAJ Nidal Hasan, who has subsequently \nbeen convicted of these crimes.\n  Even though Major Hasan saw himself as an Islamic warrior serving the \ncause of an officially designated terrorist organization, the U.S. \nGovernment has chosen to treat this as something that it is not, which \nis an ordinary crime or, in the Orwellian use of the phrase, workplace \nviolence. It is an exercise in political correctness run amuck. But the \ngovernment's argument is that because the Fort Hood shooter was not \nacting under the direct and explicit direction of a foreign terrorist \ngroup, the victims of this terrorist attack 4 years ago were not \neligible for the Purple Heart awards or the benefits that they deserve.\n  Al Qaeda, as we know, doesn't issue business cards or staff IDs, so \nsometimes it is a little bit difficult to say which terrorists are \n``officially'' part of Al Qaeda and which ones are not, but the \ndistinction is irrelevant. The war on terrorism, as we know, has \nevolved considerably since September 11, 2001. Al Qaeda has evolved \ntoo. Whether it is in Iraq, Afghanistan, or now Yemen and in other \nplaces, Al Qaeda has morphed.\n\n  Several months ago, the group's top leader, al-Zawahiri, urged his \nfollowers to conduct exactly the kind of terrorist attack that occurred \nat Fort Hood and occurred in Boston in 2013. Zawahiri said, ``These \ndispersed strikes can be carried out by one brother, or a small number \nof brothers.''\n  Let us imagine that a radical Islamist heard these words, contacted \nan Al Qaeda cleric to ask about killing Americans, and then went on to \nslaughter a number of U.S. soldiers. It shouldn't matter where those \nkillings took place, and it shouldn't matter whether the killer had \n``formal'' ties with Al Qaeda or not. There really isn't any doubt \nabout Hasan's ties to Al Qaeda or his being inspired by someone who the \nPresident of the United States put on a kill list for a drone because \nhe knew they were recruiting and inspiring attacks against the American \npeople.\n  If it is good enough for the President of the United States to order \na drone attack on an American citizen in Yemen, it ought to be good \nenough for this body to recognize this was a terrorist attack because \nof Hasan's inspiration and communication with this very same terrorist. \nWe ought to award these families the Purple Heart awards that these \nservicemembers are entitled to and the benefits that they deserve.\n  It is clear that these casualties at Fort Hood were part of America's \nstruggle against Al Qaeda and the global war on terrorism. They were \ncasualties of a war that continues to rage in Afghanistan and that only \nrecently claimed an additional four American lives. It also extended to \nplaces such as Benghazi, Libya, where four Americans were killed.\n  Whether or not the Fort Hood shooter had Al Qaeda stamped on his \nforehead is irrelevant. He was unquestionably a disciple of Al Qaeda's \npoisonous ideology, which has fueled death and destruction around the \nglobe and here in our homeland.\n  As I have indicated at the beginning, I have sponsored legislation \nthat would make the Fort Hood victims eligible for the honors and \nbenefits available to their fellow U.S. soldiers and troops serving in \noverseas combat zones. I offered a modified version of that bill as an \namendment to the Defense authorization bill, which we will take up \nimmediately following the passage of the budget legislation this \nafternoon.\n  The majority leader has refused to allow a vote on it. We may recall, \nbefore the Thanksgiving recess, we had, I believe, two amendments to \nthe Defense authorization bill, and then the question was what other \namendments might be offered. The majority leader made clear he wasn't \ngoing to allow any other amendments--except of his own choosing--thus \ndenying the minority any opportunity to help amend and improve the \nDefense authorization bill, one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation this body takes up every year.\n  So cloture was not invoked, and now in the waning days before the \nChristmas holidays, the majority leader seeks to jam through this bill \nthat was agreed upon by basically four people behind closed doors and \ndeny me--representing 26 million Texans--and deny those of us who care \nabout calling a spade a spade when it comes to terrorism an opportunity \nto offer an amendment on the Defense authorization bill. It is a \nmistake, no less a mistake than denying an opportunity to fix the \nmistake of discriminatory treatment of our servicemembers whose \npensions are being cut as a result of the budget negotiation.\n  Not only has the majority leader refused to allow a vote on this \nPurple Heart awards amendment, he has refused to allow any other \namendments, both on this budget negotiation or on the Defense \nauthorization.\n  As I said, the budget agreement passed by the House of \nRepresentatives would slash military retirement benefits by about $6 \nbillion over the next decade. I have heard on cable TV at least two \nMembers of the other party of this body who said we need to fix that. \nThe Senator from New Hampshire has offered legislation, I believe. I \nheard the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Kaine, say we could come in and \nfix this with a scalpel after the fact.\n  We don't need to wait; we could do that today. I am confident that we \ncould reach an agreement in this body today to remove that \ndiscriminatory treatment for our active duty military contained in this \nunderlying bill, if the majority leader would only listen, listen to \nhis own Members, listen to the American people, and listen to those who \ncare about our servicemembers and want to make sure that they are not \ntreated in such an unfair and discriminatory fashion. But, instead, the \nmajority leader has decided ``it is my way or the highway.''\n\n  We know these cuts will even affect combat-wounded veterans who have \nbeen medically retired.\n  My State is the proud home to more veterans than any other State \nother\n\n[[Page S8923]]\n\nthan California, and many of my constituents are outraged that the \nmajority leader won't even allow us to vote on this issue.\n  I would tell my friends across the aisle, it is going to come up \nagain. It came up yesterday, and it will come up again. We will be \nreoffering these amendments to fix this discriminatory treatment as \nlong as we are in session, and I hope Members of both parties can put \npolitics aside for 1 minute, come together, and address the needs of \nour military families and those who have worked so hard and sacrificed \nso much to preserve our freedom.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, we are going to have a historic vote this \nafternoon--historic at least in recent history--because for the first \ntime in 3 or 4 years we are going to pass a budget--at least I \ncertainly hope so. It is historic because, while the process was not \nperfect, it is a budget that was arrived at fundamentally through \nnegotiations, through discussions, and through compromise between the \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee and the chairman of the House \nBudget Committee. We are finally talking to each other.\n  This agreement is important. This vote is important for three basic \nreasons. One is that the agreement maintains the momentum of deficit \nreduction that has been in place here since the summer of 2011 when the \nBudget Control Act was passed. In fact, rather than breaking the budget \nnumbers, it actually improves them in terms of deficit reduction by \nsome $22 billion. And it maintains, as I said, the momentum.\n  One of the points that has been lost in the discussion about the \nbudget and the budget deficit is that the Federal budget deficit has \nfallen faster in the last 2\\1/2\\ to 3 years than at any time in the \npast 40 or 50 years. It has fallen from almost 10 percent of GDP to \nunder 4 percent of GDP over the past 2\\1/2\\ years. That is progress.\n  I think one of the problems we have around here is that often we \ndon't know how to declare victory. We don't celebrate our successes. I \nam not prepared to declare victory in the fight for fiscal \nresponsibility, but I am prepared to declare progress, and I think that \nis what we have made when we have more than trillion-dollar deficits \nthat have been cut more than in half.\n  So the first reason I think this bill should be supported is that it \nis not a budget buster by any means; instead, it is a continuation of \nthe momentum toward rational fiscal policies that we have been on, and \nI think it is something we should continue.\n  No. 2, this budget bill will finally get us out of the business of \ngoverning by crisis, of lurching from crisis to crisis and threats of \nshutdown and continuing resolutions year to year, month to month, \nquarter to quarter. It will provide some certainty to the Congress, to \nthe government, and to the country about what the budget numbers are \ngoing to be.\n  I think it is important that people realize exactly what it is we are \nvoting on today. Essentially, it is one number. It is what is called a \ntop-line number. This is not the budget that embodies all the detailed \ndecisions about where those dollars go. Those decisions will be made by \nthe two Appropriations Committees of the two Houses between now and the \nmiddle of January. But by providing a number, those committees now know \nwhat their targets are. They know what their limits are. They know what \nthey have to work with. It will enable them to make the kinds of \ndecisions on priorities and spending that we should have been making \nall along.\n  By governing by continuing resolution, essentially what we are doing \nis using the priorities of last year and the year before and the year \nbefore that. And then, of course, the sequester on top of a continuing \nresolution is really a double budgetary whammy because the sequester is \na cut. That is difficult enough to deal with, but it is a cut that was \ndesigned to be stupid, and it succeeded. It was designed to be so \nunacceptable that Congress would feel they had to find an alternative. \nUnfortunately, this past March that didn't happen. So the sequester, \nwhich was across-the-board cuts by account, went into place. That meant \nthat within the military, within the Pentagon, within the Navy, within \nthe FAA, and within the Department of Transportation, each account had \nto be cut. Some accounts probably could use some cutting and other \naccounts desperately needed the funding that was made available. This \nbill relieves the irrationality of the sequester while maintaining the \nsequester's downward pressure on spending.\n  Finally, and I think most importantly, what this bill we will be \nvoting on this afternoon will do is demonstrate to the country that we \ncan do our job.\n  I was talking to people in Maine yesterday, and they said: Well, why \nshould you be puffing up your chest and pounding your chest about just \ndoing what you ought to be doing all along?\n  I couldn't really argue with that, except that we haven't been doing \nour job. And the fact that we are now at least inching toward doing it \nin the manner we are supposed to is progress--at least it is progress \nin recent history. I think that is one of the most important parts of \nthis bill. I think that is the signal it sends to the country--that we \ncan, in fact, talk to each other; we can compromise; we can make \nfinancial and fiscal arrangements around here that make sense, that are \nrational, that are prioritized, and we can do our job.\n  When I was in Maine last weekend, the most common question I got was \nthis: Why can't those people down there talk to each other? Why can't \nthey work things out? We do that in our town meetings, we do that in \nour businesses, and we do that in our families. Why can't they?\n  Well, in this case, they have. It wasn't a perfect process, but at \nleast it involved bipartisan, bicameral negotiations that get us to the \npoint where we have a budget we can vote on today. Do I like it? I \ndon't like every piece of it. I don't like the pension hit the Senator \nfrom Texas described. That wouldn't have been in my proposal. In fact, \nI made a proposal at the budget conference that was quite different \nfrom this one. It wasn't accepted. That is how this place works.\n\n  My favorite philosopher, Mick Jagger, said, ``You can't always get \nwhat you want, but if you try sometimes, you just might find you get \nwhat you need.'' What we need right now is a budget. It is something we \ncan work from that gives us some certainty.\n  I believe we can fix this pension problem. In fact, I have joined \nwith Senator Shaheen of New Hampshire on a bill that would replace the \ncuts to the military pension, dealing with some offshore tax benefits \nthat I think is a much more sensible way to fill that $6 billion gap. \nWe can do that because the pension proposal doesn't take effect for 2 \nyears--not until December 2015. So we can fix that, but we have to get \nthis budget passed now.\n  To answer the question ``Why can't they talk,'' they have talked, and \nI think that is important.\n  Now I would like to turn to a slightly different topic, but it is \nrelated to the budget. In 1997 the Congress passed something called the \nsustainable growth rate, which was designed to control reimbursement \nrates for physicians and providers under Medicare. The problem is that \nit has turned into a monster that reduces physician fees to the point \nwhere they won't serve Medicare patients unless it is fixed. Each year \nsince 2002 we have fixed it year by year, but it is always temporary. \nIt is always a patch. In fact, it has gotten its own name in the \nlexicon of Washington: the ``doc fix.'' It is something we have to do. \nEverybody knows we have to do it. But why not fix it for good?\n  The Congressional Budget Office tells us that if we fix it once and \nfor all, it would cost $116 billion over the next 10 years. That sounds \nlike a big number, but it happens that there is a place we can go to \nget that money that I think fits with it very well. In 1990, under \nPresident George H.W. Bush, the Medicaid drug program was created, and \nbecause the government was buying drugs under Medicaid in very large \nquantities, they sought a volume discount from the pharmaceutical \ncompanies--perfectly rational; any of us would ask for a volume \ndiscount if we\n\n[[Page S8924]]\n\nwere buying in large quantities--and, indeed, Medicaid-eligible \nbeneficiaries had discounts or rebates on their drugs from 1990 to \n2006.\n  In 2006, Part D of Medicare was passed. We provided a drug benefit to \nMedicare recipients. But one of the wackiest parts of that bill said \nthat the government could no longer negotiate for volume discounts. I \nhear a lot of discussion around here about private enterprise and \nbusiness and how we should run the government like a business. No \nrational business would buy any product--cars, gasoline, drugs, or \nanything else--in enormous quantities and not seek and gain from the \nsellers some kind of volume discount.\n  Senator Rockefeller has introduced S. 740, which essentially says: \nLet's return Medicaid beneficiaries--not all Medicare beneficiaries but \nMedicaid recipients--to the status of prior to 2006, where they will \nget applied to their drug purchases--or the government actually gets--\nthe same kind of rebates they got for the 16 years from 1990 to 2006. \nThis will produce $140 billion over the next 10 years. It will not cut \nexpenses to recipients; it will only save the government money.\n  It seems to me this is a sensible way to fix the doc fix once and for \nall and to do something that makes sense for the taxpayers, which is to \nacquire for them volume discounts, volume rebates that are available \ntoday for other Medicaid recipients who aren't under Medicare and for \nthe VA, and it puts them on the same status, these so-called dual-\neligibles, people who are eligible for Medicaid and Medicare. Just this \nchange would save $140 billion, and it would enable us to fix the doc \nfix permanently. It would also contribute about $30 billion to deficit \nreduction over the next 10 years.\n  I think we have a historic opportunity this afternoon to pass a \nbudget--the first budget, by the way, produced by a divided Congress, \nwhere the two Houses were in different political hands, since 1986. And \nI think that is an achievement. It is something that a month ago I \nwouldn't have bet too much on, but I am very appreciative and admiring \nof Chairman Murray and Chairman Ryan for coming together and putting \ntheir ideological issues aside and coming up with an arrangement, an \nagreement which allows us to have some certainty and which can signal \nto the country that we are, in fact, capable of doing the most \nfundamental responsibility we have, which is to pass a budget.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from Maine for his statement and \nsupport for this effort. This is a historic moment. It has been 4 or 5 \nyears since we have enacted and passed a budget agreement between the \nHouse and Senate. In a divided government, we have found many excuses \nand ways around it, but we are facing our responsibility today in the \nSenate. We are hoping that yesterday's procedural vote, with 67 \nDemocrats and Republicans joining together, is an indication of the \nsuccess we will find later today when this measure comes up for a final \nvote.\n  Before I go any further, I wish to salute my colleague, my friend, \nand my fellow leader in the Senate, Senator Patty Murray of Washington.\n  A few years ago Patty was given a tough assignment. She was given the \nassignment to chair the so-called supercommittee. I had been involved \nin a lot of deficit negotiations up to that point, and I thought, oh my \ngoodness, she is walking into a minefield. Well, she did a professional \njob, a bipartisan effort. It didn't succeed, but she learned in the \nprocess not only more about our budget challenge but also more about \nthe leaders in the budget process. And I think it was that painful \nexperience with the supercommittee that set the stage for the much more \nsuccessful negotiation over this budget agreement with Paul Ryan.\n  Paul Ryan is no stranger to those of us in Illinois. His \ncongressional district borders on our State in Wisconsin. I know Paul. \nI like him. I respect him. We disagree on a lot of substantive issues, \nbut I respect him as a person of substance and a person of values who \ntries to solve problems. He showed, with Senator Patty Murray, that \nDemocrats and Republicans can sit down in a room together, respect one \nanother's differences, and still come to an agreement. What a \nrefreshing development in this town where so many times we fall flat on \nour face trying to come up with a solution.\n  I also want to commend Paul Ryan, while I am on the subject, for his \nleadership on the immigration issue. It is not easy for him to step up \nas a conservative Republican and support comprehensive immigration \nreform, but he has done it. He came to Chicago and made that \nannouncement with Luis Gutierrez, the Congressman from the city of \nChicago who is the national leader on immigration.\n  I only say that because if we have more of that kind of dialogue, \nmore of that kind of agreement, we will have a better Congress and the \nAmerican people will know it. Right now we are languishing in approval \nratings across the country, and a lot of it has to do with the fact \nthat we spend too much time fighting and not enough time trying to find \nsolutions.\n  This budget agreement is a solution. Is it perfect? Of course not. \nThere are parts of this budget agreement I don't like at all. But I \nhave come to learn that if we are going to get anything done in \nWashington for the good of the people of this country, we have to be \nprepared to accept in an agreement some things we might not agree with. \nWe found that with comprehensive immigration reform. We will find it \ntoday with this budget agreement.\n  This plan isn't perfect, but it is going to enable us to avoid a \nshutdown of the government. Did we or did we not learn a lesson just a \nfew months ago? We shut down the government of the United States of \nAmerica for 16 days. One Senator came to the floor on the other side of \nthe aisle speaking 21 hours in an effort to inspire others to join him \nin the shutdown--and, sadly, it worked. For 16 days, 800,000 Federal \nemployees or more were sent home with the promise that eventually they \nwould be paid, and millions of Americans were denied the basic services \nof our government during that government shutdown.\n  We managed to emerge from that with the promise that we would fund \nour government with a continuing resolution until the middle of \nJanuary. But then the burden fell on Patty Murray and Paul Ryan and the \nmembers of that conference committee to come up with a solution, and \nthey did. That is what is before us today.\n  Those who are voting no don't have an alternative. They don't have a \nplan. They are just angry or upset or basically opposed, but they don't \nhave an alternative. If it means they would want another government \nshutdown, so be it. But thank goodness an overwhelming bipartisan \nmajority in the House of Representatives voted for this plan. \nYesterday, if I am not mistaken, we had 12 Republicans join us and all \n55 Democrats, so 67 voted in favor of this bipartisan budget plan.\n  What is especially important to me as a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee is not only is it avoiding another government shutdown, it is \na 2-year plan. I said to Senator Murray when she called me with the \ndetails: That is one of the strongest arguments in favor of this I can \nimagine, to think now that the Appropriations Committee can sit down \nand do its work for the rest of this year with a budget target number.\n  I have a pretty substantial responsibility on the Appropriations \nCommittee. I chair the subcommittee on defense and intelligence. In \nthat subcommittee, our bill alone is about $600 billion, or just a \nlittle south of that, and it embodies almost 60 percent of all \ndiscretionary spending of the Federal Government. We are going to get a \nchance now--and I have already sat down with Congressman Frelinghuysen \nof New Jersey, who chairs the same subcommittee in the House--to work \nout a bipartisan appropriations bill for the defense of America. Is \nthere anything more important than our national security? We have to \nstart there, and we are going to be able to do it now in a thoughtful \nway because of this budget number. Those who are voting no would cast \nus again into the darkness--a continuing resolution.\n  For those who are on the outside looking in, a continuing resolution \nis akin to saying to a family: Listen, next year we are going to give \nyou the checkbook ledger from last year. Keep writing the same checks \nfor the same amount, and we are sure everything will work out. It \ndoesn't.\n\n[[Page S8925]]\n\n  Instead, because of this budget agreement we can start looking at \nways to save money which will not harm our men and women in uniform and \nwill keep America strong and create a national defense.\n  We are going to also work in this bill to start to repair America's \nfraying social safety net--in other words, protecting the most \nvulnerable in America--because this agreement stands for the premise \nthat we are going to treat defense and nondefense spending and cuts \nequally. That was an agreement we started. It is one they honored with \nus.\n  We have made real progress in the last 4 years to cut our Federal \ndeficit in half. We are going to cut the deficit even further under \nthis bipartisan plan but in a much more thoughtful way. I am going to \nbe voting yes for the budget and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I see the Republican leader on the floor, and I know he has a very \nbusy schedule. I do want to leave with one closing thought. There is \nanother deficit in America beyond our shrinking budget deficit that is \neven more dangerous to America's future; that is, the rapidly \ndeteriorating situation many working families are facing. We have an \nopportunity deficit in America. President Obama called this opportunity \ndeficit the defining challenge of our time, and I believe he is right.\n  We don't begrudge anyone wealth and success in America. We celebrate \nit. But we also believe in fairness. We believe in the dignity of work. \nWe believe, if you work hard and follow the rules, you ought to be able \nto provide for your family with the basics of life and with the dream \nof an even better life for the next generation. That is the promise at \nthe heart of America's economy, and for too many families today, it \nfeels like a broken promise. We are losing the balance between personal \nwealth and our commonwealth to a winner-take-all ideology that is \nhurting our economy and our democracy.\n  Market capitalism has generated enormous wealth for America's \neconomy. But for more than 40 years, the benefits of economic growth in \nAmerica have gone increasingly to those at the top--while the middle \nclass shrinks and the poor slip deeper into the quicksand of \ninescapable poverty. Think about this: in 1970, the top 1 percent of \nearners took home 9 percent of America's income. Today they take home \nnearly a quarter. The top 1 percent holds more than one-third of the \nNation's overall wealth, while the bottom half of America controls less \nthan 3 percent. The richest 400 Americans--the top one-tenth of one \npercent--now own more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans \ncombined. America is the wealthiest Nation on Earth. Corporate profits \nand the stock market are hitting records highs. Yet millions of workers \nare actually making less money today in real dollars than they did 20 \nyears ago. We have more children growing up in poverty than in any \nother industrialized Nation. And our infant, maternal and child \nmortality rates are the highest among advanced Nations. Social \nmobility--the ability to work your way up the economic ladder--is now \nlower in the United States than it is in Europe.\n\n  What does that tell you about the American Dream? Income inequality \nis worse in America today than it is in Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen, the \nIvory Coast, Pakistan, and Ethiopia. And then there is this: Since the \nofficial end of the Great Recession in 2009, 95 percent of all income \ngains in the U.S. have gone to the wealthiest 1 percent. There's a \nreason the YouTube chart Wealth Inequality in America has gotten more \nthan 13 million views. The American people know that our economy isn't \nworking for average working folks. It's like a bumper sticker that \nsaid, ``The economy isn't broken, it's fixed.'' The rules have been \nrewritten over the last four decades to concentrate more and more \nwealth at the very top, at the expense of everyone else.\n  The United States is not alone in this; growing income and wealth \ninequality are global problems. But these problems are growing faster \nin America than in any Nation. We would do well to listen to Pope \nFrancis, who, in his recent ``apostolic exhortation''--a sort of open \nletter to the faithful--described trickle-down economics as a system \nthat ``has never been confirmed by the facts.'' It is created, in the \nPope's words an ``economy of exclusion and inequality'' and ``a \nglobalization of indifference.''\n  Pope Francis asks:\n\n       How can it be that it is not a news item when an elderly \n     homeless person dies of exposure, but it is news when the \n     stock market loses two points? We are thrilled if the market \n     offers us something new to purchase, in the meantime all \n     those lives stunted for lack of opportunity seem a mere \n     spectacle; they fail to move us.\n       Today everything comes under the laws of competition and \n     the survival of the fittest, where the powerful feed upon the \n     powerless. As a consequence, masses of people find themselves \n     excluded and marginalized: without work, without \n     possibilities, without any means of escape.\n\n  Economic justice must be a central concern of the Catholic Church, \nthe Pope says. But it is not the Church's responsibility alone. The \nPope writes that mere handouts are not enough. I quote:\n\n       We must work to eliminate the structural causes of poverty. \n     It is vital, that government leaders and financial leaders \n     take heed and broaden their horizons, working to ensure that \n     all citizens have dignified work, education and health care. \n     I beg the Lord to grant us more politicians who are genuinely \n     disturbed by the state of society, the people, the lives of \n     the poor.\n\n  Those who are unmoved by moral appeals might want to listen instead \nto the economic case for reducing economic inequality. America's \nwidening income and wealth inequities have recently drawn warnings from \nthe Federal Reserve Board, the Organization for Economic Cooperation \nand Development, and the IMF, the International Monetary Fund. Listen \nto this warning, from a recent IMF analysis. I quote:\n\n       Some dismiss inequality and focus instead on overall \n     growth--arguing, in effect, that a rising tide lifts all \n     boats. [But w]hen a handful of yachts become ocean liners \n     while the rest remain lowly canoes, something is seriously \n     amiss.\n\n  In countries with high levels of inequality like the United States, \nthe IMF warns, ``growth becomes more fragile,'' economic crises like \nthe Great Recession become more frequent, and economic expansions are \nshortened by as much as one-third. Slower growth leads to fewer jobs \ncreated and even greater inequality--a vicious cycle. In fact, IMF \neconomists found that inequality seems to have a stronger effect on \ngrowth than several other factors, including foreign investment, trade \nopenness, and exchange rate competitiveness. Rather than being \nconflicting goals, the IMF economists concluded, reducing inequality \nand bolstering growth, in the long run, might be ``two sides of the \nsame coin.'' That is certainly true in an economy such as ours, in \nwhich 70 percent of the U.S. economy depends on consumer spending.\n  It has taken years to reach these levels of inequality in America and \nit may take years and sustained effort by Congress to restore broad-\nbased growth to our economy, the kind of growth that benefits all \nAmericans, not just the wealthiest few.\n  The Affordable Care Act is a powerful start. No longer will tens of \nmillions of Americans--most of them working people--have to worry that \nthey are just one illness or accident away from bankruptcy. Small \nbusiness owners will be able to spend less time searching for \naffordable health plans, and more time creating jobs.\n  Next, we need to restore the bottom rung on the ladder out of poverty \nand into the middle class by raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 \nan hour. According to a Wall Street Journal/ABC News poll, 63 percent \nof Americans--two-thirds of Americans--strongly favor boosting the \nfederal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour. $7.25 an hour, 40 \nhours a week, 50 weeks a year, works out to $14,500 a year--40 percent \nbelow the poverty line. Clearly, we can't boost the American economy on \npoverty wages. Studies and our own history show that raising the \nminimum wage will create jobs--because in America, consumers are the \nbiggest job creators.\n  If you want to help poor children escape poverty, one of the best \ninvestments you can make is in effective pre-school. We know that. It's \nbeen proven. Yet, according to the OECD, the U.S. ranks 28th out of 38 \nleading economies in the proportion of four-year-olds in education. The \nbudget before the Senate restores funding so that many of\n\n[[Page S8926]]\n\nthe children kicked out of Head Start classes because of sequester cuts \nwill be able to return to school. This is still only a fraction of the \nchildren who need quality pre-school. President Obama has set universal \npre-school for every child in America. That should be our goal. Because \nthe future belongs to those who are best-educated.\n  Here's another staggering fact about the new economy: For reasons \nthat include automation, globalization and the loss of good-paying \nmanufacturing jobs, more than half of Americans will experience near-\npoverty for at least some part of their lives. More than half. Here's \nanother sobering fact: According to the National Employment Law \nProject, about two-thirds of the American jobs lost in the Great \nRecession were in middle-wage occupations--the kind of jobs that don't \nrequire a safety net. But these middle-wage occupations have accounted \nfor less than one-fourth of the job growth during the recovery. \nWeakening the social safety net at the same time America is losing \nmiddle-class jobs can only hurt families and our economy. We need to \nstrengthen America's social safety net so that temporary economic \nsetbacks don't spiral and trap families in inescapable poverty.\n  We need to invest in infrastructure.\n  And we need to restore the ability of working people to choose to \njoin or form a union so that they can bargain collectively for fair \nwages and safe working conditions. Labor and management, working \ntogether, built the American middle class. Labor and management, \nworking together, can help to restore and grow America's middle class.\n\n  Years ago, Bobby Kennedy said that America's gross national product \nmeasures a seemingly endless variety of commercial transactions. But, \nhe said, the gross national product does not measure many other things, \nsuch as ``the health of our children.''\n\n       It measures neither our wit nor our courage; neither our \n     wisdom nor our learning; neither our compassion nor our \n     devotion to our country; it measures everything, in short, \n     except that which makes life worthwhile. And it tells us \n     everything about America except why we are proud that we are \n     Americans.\n\n  For 40 years, a series of political and economic choices has widened \neconomic inequality in America. Those choices have hurt many families. \nThey have made our economy less fair, less stable, and less prosperous. \nAnd they have hammered away at one of the promises that made us most \nproud to be Americans: the promise that if you work hard, you can make \na better life for yourself and your family. This budget will help us \nredeem that promise and reclaim that pride. I ask my fellow Senators to \nvote with us for economic fairness and shared prosperity.\n  After we pass this budget, after we get our appropriation bills \nunderway, we are going to come forward and--I hope in a bipartisan \nmanner--address some of these pillars of income equality in America: an \nincrease in the minimum wage, an opportunity to make sure through the \nAffordable Care Act that every family has an opportunity for health \ninsurance in America, a press conference which I will have later today \nwith Senators Warren and Reid on the whole student loan debt crisis \nfacing so many families. We have reached a point now where the student \nloan debt in America is greater than the credit card debt. It has \ndevastating impacts on working families across America.\n  These and so many others should be part of an agenda to repair the \nopportunity deficit, and I hope Republicans will join us in a \nbipartisan effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am going to proceed on my leader \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader has that right.\n\n\n                      Pikeville Listening Session\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise to give voice to the people of \neastern Kentucky who are hurting due to this administration's war on \ncoal.\n  Recently, I traveled to Pikeville, KY, in the central Appalachian \ncoal fields to hear firsthand from coal miners, their families, those \nin the energy industry, and others about how their communities are \nbeing ravaged by EPA's excessive, overly burdensome regulations on \ncoal.\n  The EPA didn't want to listen to these folks. I tried to get the EPA \nto have a hearing in eastern Kentucky, and they refused. So I did it. I \nheld this listening session to put a human face on the suffering that \nis being felt in Appalachia due in large part to this administration's \nwar on coal. I want to share with my colleagues just a little bit of \nwhat I heard in that listening session down in Pikeville a few days \nago.\n  This is a picture of Howard Abshire. He is a former production \nforeman and a fourth-generation coal miner. In the audience during his \ntestimony was his son right behind him, right here, Griffin. He is a \nfifth-generation coal miner. What the father and son have in common is \nthey are both out of work. Both the father and the son are 2 of over \n5,000 Kentuckians who have lost their jobs in the war on coal--two of \nthe casualties of the President's war on coal, Howard and Griffin, out \nof work.\n  Howard is holding up a piece of coal in his left hand. Coal mining is \nwhat the EPA wants to stamp out, but coal is also the powerful \nsubstance which powers our homes, provides light and heat and fuels the \ncommerce of goods and services worldwide.\n  ``This is coal,'' he said. ``This keeps the lights on.'' Howard is \nonly one of many coal miners laid off for lack of coal mining work. \nThis is what he said:\n\n       Look in our schools. Look in our nursing homes. Look in our \n     pharmacies. We're hurting.\n       We need help. We don't want to be bailed out. We want to \n     work.\n\n  Howard doesn't want to be bailed out. He wants to work.\n  Seated next to Howard is Jimmy Rose. Jimmy Rose is a veteran. He \nfought in Iraq. He is a former coal miner. Jimmy was perhaps the most \nfamous attendee at the listening session because he brought attention \nto the war on coal to a national television audience on ``America's Got \nTalent.'' Jimmy is a songwriter and singer. He used his song ``Coal \nKeeps the Lights On'' in his competition in ``America's Got Talent,'' \nand it spoke directly to the hardship in his community caused largely \nby the war on coal. This is Jimmy Rose right here, and here is what he \nhad to say:\n\n       It's in our heritage, it's in our blood.\n\n  Addressing the Obama administration, Jimmy said:\n\n       Look at what you're doing, and who you're affecting . . . \n     Coal mining is a way of life, just like I say in the song. \n     Don't kill our way of life. I hope one day I can always say \n     coal kept the lights on.\n\n  I also heard from Monty Boyd, the owner of Whayne Supply Company and \nWalker Machinery, mining and construction equipment distributors that \nserve Kentucky, Indiana, West Virginia, and Ohio. The companies employ \n1,900 people and operates 25 stores.\n  Whayne Supply this year celebrated 100 years of operation. Yet this \nis what Monty had to say:\n\n       At a time when I should be excited about our future, I am \n     full of concern and uncertainty because our future outlook is \n     bleak due to the regulatory ambush on the coal industry by \n     the EPA.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Coal in Kentucky is more than just mining. It is the \n     driving force that keeps our energy rates affordable, keeps \n     our manufacturing sector competitive, and is the economic \n     life blood of eastern Kentucky.\n\n  Monty went on:\n\n       I am disheartened to continually see the federal government \n     and the EPA take such an anti-business stance that destroys \n     an industry that is vital to our regional economy. The \n     federal government appears to be choosing the winners and \n     losers in regard to the energy sector of America.\n\n  Those are strong words from someone with a good perspective on \nKentucky's coal industry.\n  I also heard from Anita Miller, over here in the photograph. She is a \nmanager of safety for Apollo Fuels in my State. She has worked in the \nindustry for more than 15 years. Here is what Anita had to say:\n\n       My son walked earlier than my daughter . . . every time she \n     would try to stand up, he would either knock her down, or put \n     his hand on her head so she couldn't stand. This is what is \n     happening to the coal industry.\n\n  Anita went on to say:\n\n       Every time we try to stand up for ourselves, someone either \n     knocks or holds us down. . . . You can't really buy anything \n     or make plans for the future because you don't know what \n     the future holds.\n\n[[Page S8927]]\n\n       My wish is that the people who are trying so hard to \n     destroy the coal industry would just stop for a minute and \n     think about the hot showers they take, the lights they turn \n     on, and that first hot cup of coffee in the morning, and \n     remember that it came from electricity powered by coal.\n\n  I couldn't agree more with what Anita says. It is apparently too easy \nfor EPA bureaucrats and the Obama administration to make decisions that \nhave a huge impact on the people of eastern Kentucky. They don't think \nabout the consequences and, I might add, without bothering to meet face \nto face with the people they hurt.\n  The EPA schedules listening sessions for its new regulations only in \ncities far away from coal country, both geographically and \nphilosophically; cities including New York, Boston, Seattle, and San \nFrancisco. They held 11 listening sessions in all, but the closest one \nto eastern Kentucky was in Atlanta, requiring Kentuckians to make a 14-\nhour round-trip drive simply to attend. So it is pretty clear from the \nlocation of all these listening sessions the EPA did not want any real \ninput.\n  That is why I convened a listening session in Pikeville that resulted \nin the powerful testimony I have shared with my colleagues today. Since \nthe Obama EPA would not come to Kentucky, I brought the voices of \nKentuckians to EPA. We held three panels composed of those in the coal \nindustry, miners and their families, and local elected officials to \nilluminate the disruption in these communities caused in large part by \nthe war on coal. Many of my constituents filled out comment cards and \nmy office delivered them yesterday to the EPA, along with the hearing \ntestimony.\n  I want to leave my colleagues with the comments of one Kentuckian, \nJustine Bradford, who is a retired teacher in Pikeville. Here is what \nJustine wrote:\n\n       Dear EPA, will you please tell Santa Claus all we want for \n     Christmas this year is to be able to work.\n\n  This is Justine Bradford: Tell EPA to tell Santa all we want for \nChristmas this year is to be able to work.\n\n       Here in eastern Kentucky we, too, are real people. Please \n     help us find a job. Come and walk in our shoes.\n\n  The people of eastern Kentucky believe in coal, and with good reason. \nThe abundance of coal in America and in Kentucky in particular is a \nGod-given resource. For decades it has powered our factories, \ntransported our goods, and warmed our homes.\n  Yes, the blessings of coal come with the responsibility to use it in \nan environmentally friendly way. But they also come with the \nresponsibility to see that hard-working Kentuckians who rely on coal \nfor an honest day's work and steady pay are given every chance to earn \nthat. And they come with the right of all Americans to take full \nadvantage of this God-given domestic resource to produce clean, cheap, \nand safe energy.\n  These things have been true for many decades. There is no reason they \nshould not still hold true now. Eastern Kentucky must look for some \neconomic opportunities beyond coal, and I support that, and I know the \npeople of the region can accomplish greatness. It is vital that we \nconsider eastern Kentucky's future. But let me make this point: It is \nequally vital that we not give up on eastern Kentucky's present. As we \nconsider eastern Kentucky's future it is important that we not give up \non eastern Kentucky's present, and coal is the key to the present in \neastern Kentucky.\n  The Obama EPA has the testimony I heard in Pikeville. Whether they \nwant it or not, they have it. Eastern Kentucky is going to continue to \npush back in this war on coal. The war is not over yet, not by a long \nshot. This President will be gone in 3 years and the coal will still be \nin the ground. The people of the region are resilient and they will \nkeep fighting.\n  I am very hopeful for a positive outcome in eastern Kentucky and the \nAppalachian region and I am going to defend them in every way I can.\n\n\n                                  NDAA\n\n  Madam President, the National Defense Authorization act is one of the \nessential pieces of legislation the Senate considers every year. This \nis legislation, obviously, that authorizes funding for our troops and \nthe equipment and the support they need to carry out their mission. \nThis is legislation that--along with the funding that follows in the \nappropriations bill--puts muscle behind America's most important \nstrategic objectives across the globe.\n  Yet, under the Democratic majority, this bill has basically \nlanguished since last summer. About 6 months--6 months--have elapsed \nsince the Armed Services Committee first reported the bill out of \ncommittee. Now, with just days to go before Christmas, after wasting \nvaluable time ramming through political appointee after political \nappointee, the majority wants to rush this crucial legislation through \nwithout the debate it deserves. They want to push it through the Senate \nwithout even giving the minority the ability to offer more than a \nsingle amendment--just one.\n  To give some perspective, 381 amendments were proposed to this bill \nlast year. We agreed on 142 of them. The year before that, hundreds \nwere again proposed and many were agreed to. That is the way the Senate \nused to operate.\n  Keep in mind that all this follows right on the heels of the \nDemocrats' ``nuclear'' power grab just a few weeks back. So this is \nwhat has become of the Senate under the current Democratic majority--\nrules and traditions of the Senate that have served us well for years \nare broken or ignored in the interests of a short-term power grab. Some \nof the most important legislation that we consider as a body is rushed \nthrough at the last minute without any real opportunity for debate or \namendment.\n  As some have suggested, the Senate has become a lot like the House \nunder the current Democratic leadership. From the standpoint of the \nminority, it is actually a lot worse. Committee chairmen have been cut \nout of the process. Senators who thought they would have an opportunity \nto legislate have been told they are basically irrelevant, and \nevidently so are the rules. Senate rules are now just as optional to \nWashington Democrats as the ObamaCare mandates they decide they do not \nlike--the Senate rules are just as optional as the ObamaCare mandates \nthey decide they do not like--all of which obviously makes a mockery of \nour institutions and our laws, and all of which suggests this is a \nmajority that has zero confidence in its own ideas. This is a majority \nthat cannot allow the minority to have a meaningful say when it comes \nto nominees. This is a majority that will not allow Members to offer \namendments when it counts.\n\n  Why? Because of a fear that the minority might actually win the \nargument and carry the day. That is exactly what we are seeing with the \nNDAA. The majority leader will not allow a robust amendment process \nbecause he cannot stomach a vote on Iran sanctions. He knows the \nadministration would lose that vote decisively, and he knows that many \nmembers of his own caucus would vote alongside the Republicans to \nstrengthen those sanctions. So, rather than allow a Democratic vote \nthat might embarrass the administration, the majority leader simply \nwill not permit that vote to happen.\n  Here is another consequence. By denying the Senate the ability to \nlegislate, debate, and amend the National Defense Authorization Act, \nthe Defense Appropriations Act and additional Iran sanctions, and by \nrefusing the Senate the ability to vote on the authorization for the \nuse of force against Syria, the majority leader has abdicated this \nChamber's constitutional role in shaping and overseeing national \nsecurity policy.\n  Without considering these matters, the Senate has been unable to \naddress the programs, policies, and weapons systems necessary to make \nthe President's strategic pivot to the Asia-Pacific theater real. Are \nthe programs in place adequate to address China's aggressive \nencroachment upon the territorial and navigational rights of other \nnations in the region? Through defense legislation have we considered \nthe necessary tradeoffs to fund adequate force structure--have we done \nthat? Can we execute this pivot and maintain adequate force structure \nin the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean? We will not have any of that \ndebate--no debate at all.\n  We have been denied the opportunity to consider additional Iran \nsanctions.\n\n[[Page S8928]]\n\nDespite the assertions of the administration that it has worked with \nCongress to craft the current sanctions regime, each time sanctions \nhave been enacted during the Obama administration these bills have \nbasically been forced upon the President. He did not want any of them. \nDespite the fact that the administration concedes that sanctions have \nbrought the Iranians to the negotiating table, it is actively working \nto forestall additional sanctions tied to the verification of the \ninterim agreement.\n  The Senate should not be denied a vote concerning Iran. The President \nretains the power to veto anything we pass. What are our policies \npreventing the ungoverned portions of Syria from becoming a terrorist \nsafe haven? Unfortunately, we will not be having that debate this \nsession of Congress. What is our policy on capturing, interrogating, \nand detaining terrorists? And if we had a coherent policy, would it \nsurvive after we draw down our forces in Afghanistan? We will not have \na chance to have that debate either.\n  This is not simply a matter of denying the minority a voice in \nshaping foreign policy; it is an erosion of the responsibility of the \nSenate. We have given President Obama a free rein in shaping these \nmatters, and our allies in Asia and the Arab world are now questioning \nour commitment to remaining forward deployed and combat ready.\n  More importantly, the courageous men and women who defend us every \nday should not have to suffer from these tactics.\n  Still, despite the egregious abuses we are seeing here of the \nlegislative process, the underlying bill is an important bill. It \ncontains the authorization needed for key military construction \nprojects on our military bases, for multiyear procurement that is more \nefficient--that actually saves taxpayers money--and for the combat pay \nand special pay our troops deserve. It also, fortunately, extends the \nprohibition on bringing Guantanamo Bay prisoners into the United \nStates, a provision that I and many other Americans strongly support. \nIt also authorizes funding for the next generation of aircraft \ncarriers, something central to the success of the President's pivot to \nthe Asian theater, something I mentioned earlier.\n  In short, there are a lot of good things in this bill, even if the \nprocess that got us here was completely unacceptable.\n  Let me be clear: The bill before us would be markedly improved if \nSenators were allowed to offer amendments and more than just a day or \ntwo to debate them. The Democrats who run the Senate need to think hard \nabout what they are doing. This is just about the only regular order \nlegislation we ever consider anymore. It is one of the only chances \nSenators can count on to offer important amendments. Now the Senate \nDemocratic majority is even trying to shut that down too. We do not \neven do Defense authorization anymore, open to amendment.\n  I remind my colleagues on the other side, one day they will find \nthemselves in the minority again. One never knows how soon that might \noccur. They should think long and hard about what they are doing to \nthis institution, because the Senate is bigger than any one party or \npresidential administration.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, \nSenator Blunt, Senator Blumenthal, and soon to be joining us Senator \nGraham, to speak about our Cybersecurity Public Awareness Act of 2013.\n  It is now broadly accepted in this body that the cyber threat posed \nby criminals, foreign intelligence, and military services, and even \nterrorists, is enormous and unrelenting. But useful information about \ncyber attacks and cyber risks still is not consistently available to \nconsumers, to businesses or to policymakers.\n  The legislation the four of us have introduced, the Cybersecurity \nPublic Awareness Act, is an important first step toward fixing this \nproblem.\n  Senator Blunt has earned a reputation for working with colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle, particularly on issues of national security. I \nwas very glad to have the opportunity to work with him last year as \npart of a bipartisan group of Senators seeking a sensible middle ground \non cyber security legislation. He has brought his keen understanding of \nnational security issues to bear on this important problem, as well as \nhis expertise on public and private collaboration. So I thank the good \nSenator from Missouri for the opportunity to work together.\n  Likewise, Senator Graham, as my colleagues know, has a long track \nrecord of bipartisan legislative accomplishments and a passion for \nissues of national security. On our Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on \nCrime and Terrorism, where together we are the chair and ranking \nmember, Senator Graham has been a worthy partner in our work to improve \nAmerica's cyber readiness, including our readiness against economic \nespionage and trade secret threat. I thank Senator Graham for his \ncontinuing leadership and partnership as we introduce this bill to \nimprove public awareness of the cyber threats facing our country.\n  I am pleased also to be joined by my colleague Senator Blumenthal. We \nwere attorneys general together. We serve on the Judiciary Committee \ntogether. We are northeasterners together. I know he brings to this \nChamber a deep understanding of the tools at the disposal of law \nenforcement, as well as the challenges of adapting to a swiftly \nevolving threat.\n  Americans' privacy is routinely violated by criminals who steal \ncredit card information and Social Security numbers or even spy on us \nthrough the webcams of our personal computers. Bank accounts and \nbusinesses, local governments and individuals have been emptied \novernight. Sensitive government networks have been compromised. The \nnetworks that run our critical infrastructure, the basics we depend on \nfor heat, for communications, for commerce, have been compromised, \nraising the prospect of a cyber attack that could bring down a portion \nof the electric grid or disrupt our financial system.\n  Even our Nation's long-term economic competitiveness is at risk. \nGeneral Keith Alexander, the head of the National Security Agency and \nCyber Command, has said, for example, that the theft of trade secrets \nthrough cyber hacks has put us on the losing end of the largest illicit \ntransfer of wealth in history. Yet most Americans are still unaware of \nthe full extent of this threat.\n  Why? Cyber threat information is often classified when it is gathered \nby the government or is held as proprietary when collected by a company \nthat has been attacked. As a result, Americans are left in the dark \nabout the frequency, extent, and intensity of these attacks. Raising \nawareness of cyber threats is an important element of Congress's work \nto improve our Nation's cyber security.\n  The Cybersecurity Public Awareness Act of 2013 takes up that \nchallenge. Building on legislation I previously introduced with Senator \nJohn Kyl, it will increase public awareness of the cyber threats \nagainst our Nation and do so in a matter that protects classified, \nbusiness-sensitive, and proprietary information.\n  The bill addresses several different elements of the cyber security \nawareness gap. It enhances public awareness of attacks on Federal \nnetworks by requiring that the Department of Homeland Security and the \nDepartment of Defense report to Congress on cyber incidents in the \n``.gov'' and ``.mil'' domains. As we work to protect the American \npeople from cyber attacks, we must first understand the nature of \nattacks on our own systems and what we can do to ensure that those \nattacks are not successful.\n  The bill tasks the Department of Justice and the FBI to report to \nCongress on their investigations and prosecutions of cyber intrusions, \ncomputer or network compromise, or other forms of illegal hacking. \nThose reports also must detail the resources they devote to fighting \ncyber crime and any legal impediments they find that frustrate \nprosecutions of cyber criminals. It is not enough just to try to stop \nhackers when they are coming after us; we must also identify and \nprosecute the people responsible for cyber crimes wherever they may be.\n  In addition, the bill requires the Securities and Exchange Commission \nto report to Congress on the corporate reporting of cyber risks and \ncyber incidents in the financial statements of publicly traded \ncompanies. The purpose of this requirement is to make\n\n[[Page S8929]]\n\nsure American businesses are adequately informing their shareholders of \nany material information shareholders should know relating to cyber \nsecurity.\n  Last, the bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to report \nto Congress on the vulnerabilities to cyber threats in each critical \ninfrastructure sector: the electric grid, the gas and oil markets, the \nbanking sector, and others. When it comes to protecting our critical \ninfrastructure from cyber attacks, there is no margin of error. Failure \nin this area could mean a blackout in a major American city or a \nserious disruption of the banking system on which our economy depends. \nThat is why we must fully understand the threats to these sectors and \ndo what we can to stop them.\n  These are ways in which the Cybersecurity Public Awareness Act will \nhelp to better inform the American people about the nature of the cyber \nthreats we face and help us in Congress make the informed decisions \nabout how to better protect against these threats.\n  We have more work to do to improve our Nation's cyber security, but a \nkey first step is to ensure that members of the public, businesses, \nshareholders, policymakers, and other cyber security stakeholders have \nan appropriate awareness of cyber vulnerabilities, threats, and \nopportunities. I look forward to working with Senator Blunt, with \nSenator Graham, and with Senator Blumenthal to get this bill passed \ninto law, and I thank them each for their helpful cooperation and their \ninsight.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I will follow up on what Senator Whitehouse \nhas been talking about. Last year he and I tried to find the middle \nground on this issue where Members of the Senate and the House would be \nwilling to move forward together to try to deal with it. Largely, the \npotential damage and the potential danger of what the cyber threat \nmeans are both unknown and, if we do know about it, we don't quite \nunderstand what we could do about it or should do about it. So we are \ncoming together here with Senator Blumenthal and Senator Graham to try \nto do what we can to have more information available as we move \nforward.\n  There is no question that cyber breaches are serious. There is no \nquestion that they are a growing threat to our country's security. In \nmy view, there is no question that it is our greatest vulnerability and \na threat we might not see coming if we don't do the right things, \nparticularly as it might relate to the critical infrastructure outside \nof what the government monitors. Cyber attacks by criminals, foreign \nintelligence, military service, and terrorists have increased in \nfrequency and increased in what we see as the sophistication of those \nattacks. These are very dangerous for our country. They are certainly \npotentially dangerous in terms of the financial infrastructure, the \ncritical infrastructure, the ability to defend the country. These \nincursions have already resulted in billions of dollars of lost \nintellectual property, millions of Americans have had their identities \nstolen, increased vulnerability to our critical infrastructure that is \nnow so dependent on the cyber network for it to function. Also, of \ncourse, what happens to that infrastructure, whether it is the \ntransportation infrastructure or the energy infrastructure or the \nutility infrastructure if they are compromised, and we don't know where \nthat attack is coming from or how to meet it or how to prevent it, that \nis what we are trying to talk about in this legislation and trying to \ndeal with.\n  As early as 2007, cyber intrusions into the U.S. Government agencies \nand departments resulted in the loss of data that would be equal to \neverything across the street in the Library of Congress. Walk through \nthe Library of Congress. Look at everything that is there. We have lost \nthat much government data since 2007. At the same time, reliable \ninformation about cyber attacks and about cyber risks remain largely \nunavailable to consumers, unavailable to businesses, and unavailable to \npolicymakers. Threat information affecting, as my friend from Rhode \nIsland said, ``.gov'' and ``.mil''--the military side of what we do in \nthe government and the nonmilitary side of what we do in the \ngovernment--is largely classified. So we, frankly, don't have much \ninformation about what they are doing every day, what they are fighting \nevery day, and what the increased threat may be.\n  There are other entities people may be familiar with, such as \n``.com,'' ``.net,'' and ``.org,'' domains that withhold information \nfrom the public because they don't want to needlessly concern their \ncustomers with using what is available or, in some cases, impact \nstockholders, if the stockholders knew how vulnerable a particular \nnetwork might be. So I am glad we are working together to try to make \nthis legislation, the Cybersecurity Public Awareness Act of 2013, just \nthat.\n  The two key words here are ``public awareness.'' We have looked at \nthis long and hard to figure out where the path is that we can move \nforward on, not just to introduce a piece of legislation but a piece of \nlegislation that our colleagues would respond to, a piece of \nlegislation our colleagues will look at and say: Of course, we need to \nknow more than we know now about this and, through us, the people we \nwork for need to know more. This gives us a greater understanding of \nthe number of threats and the tools available to repeal those threats \nwithout needlessly compromising any of those tools that would be \navailable to repel threats.\n  This bill works to provide public awareness of the danger of cyber \nattacks in our government and in private sector networks. It does that \nby instituting new reporting requirements for Federal agencies charged \nwith monitoring and responding to cyber threats. Specifically, the bill \nwould require national security and law enforcement agencies, including \nthe Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, and the \nDepartment of Justice, to submit reports to the Congress on what the \nattacks were on the Federal network and what the level of \ninvestigations are of cyber crime. What other obstacles are out there \nto appropriate public awareness of what they put on the Internet, how \nthey put it on the Internet, how vulnerable we may be to things that \nhappen now that manage so many of the daily aspects of our lives in the \ncyber world, and what we are doing about it. We want to know what the \ncyber security threats are, and we want to create an understanding so \nthat there is a way to respond, so there is a way to share information, \nand so there is a way to make this work better.\n  This bill includes provisions to enhance awareness of threats against \nour critical infrastructure. As I have said before, the critical \ninfrastructure, whether it is financial, utility infrastructure or \ntransportation infrastructure, all are things that now are so woven \ninto the cyber networks that the ability to suddenly manipulate, the \nability to infiltrate, is all there, and we want to be sure we are \nlooking at those threats in the right way. It is clearly complex. There \nis somebody out there right now thinking about things that we wouldn't \nwant them to think about as to how they can manipulate and use these \nnetworks in dangerous ways.\n  It is complex, and it is critical to our national security \nchallenges. Our response cannot and should not be to break down on \npartisan lines. It should not be a response that we decide we can't do \nanything because we can't figure out how to work together.\n  Again, I am pleased to be working with my colleagues on this issue. \nSenator Blumenthal and Senator Whitehouse both have backgrounds as \nattorneys general of their States and understand the importance of both \nhonoring and enforcing the law and protecting us in this new area of \nvulnerability.\n  We can't prevent cyber security threats, but we can respond to those \nthreats; however, in my view, we can't really respond to those \nthreats--and in the view of I think everybody who will be speaking \nabout this issue today--without public support. Having more information \nwill make a difference. Understanding how big this problem is will make \na difference. Working together to try to solve it is absolutely \nessential. I believe this is our greatest vulnerability as a society, \nand it is a vulnerability that will increase over time or decrease over \ntime, and that largely is up to how we deal with it.\n  Again, I am glad to join my colleagues, and I look forward to hearing \nwhat Senator Blumenthal has to say\n\n[[Page S8930]]\n\nabout this, and I appreciate the important background he brings to this \ndebate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I am pleased and honored to join my \ncolleagues this morning, Senators Blunt, Whitehouse, and Graham. They \nhave been leaders on issues involving national security and defense and \nparticularly in the intelligence and cyber area.\n  Senator Blunt has a long record of bipartisan leadership in this \nbody, as well as in the House of Representatives and in government \ngenerally, in addressing issues without regard to partisan \npredilections or biases. He has not only led but produced results.\n  Senator Whitehouse has tirelessly pursued this area of cyber \nsecurity. To his great credit, he has been with the movement for making \nour Nation more secure and also making the public more aware about the \nneed for action in this area.\n  In truth, there is a saying that ignorance is bliss, but in truth, in \nareas of national security, that is rarely the case. In this instance, \nignorance can do great harm and it is a source of peril. Our Nation is \nlargely ignorant about the threats posed by national security and, more \nimportantly, about the potential responses that must be mobilized to \nsecure our infrastructure, our critical innovative information, and \nmany other areas where we are at risk from a diverse source of threats. \nIt is not only foreign governments, such as China; it is teenage \nhackers in eastern European countries, it is terrorists around the \nworld who mean to do us harm and put their own movements at an \nadvantage, and it is also competitors in the private world who seek \ncompetitive advantage against our own private enterprise companies that \nhave intellectual information and assets. As a result of these cyber \nattacks, intellectual property is lost, identities are stolen, and \nAmerica is made less safe.\n  Every day, the United States is under attack--literally every minute \nof every day--by individuals wishing to steal sensitive information \nfrom our government, from our Department of Defense, and from corporate \ninformation systems as well as home networks of individual Internet \nusers. The cyber threat has become almost conventional wisdom in some \nquarters because we know that our military and intelligence communities \nare certain that this threat must be met. In fact, the next Pearl \nHarbor will come not from the sky but from a computer network that \nlinks to essential sources of intellectual assets and information in \nthis country and degrades or, in fact, destroys them.\n  Senator Whitehouse and I, along with Senators Graham and Blunt, have \nintroduced legislation that would institute new reporting requirements. \nThese requirements apply to Federal agencies charged with reviewing and \nresponding to cyber attacks. In effect, the Federal Government would \nlead by example. Leadership is important not only for State and local \ngovernments but also for the private sector. The legislation would help \nus better protect our country from hackers wishing to do harm, and it \nis based on the simple premise that we need to know about the threats \nwe face.\n  The President has taken action--and I credit him--with the Executive \norder he has instituted, but that Executive order leaves great gaps. \nThe legislation introduced by Senator Whitehouse and me--along with \nSenators Graham and Blunt--will institute new reporting requirements to \nus by our Federal agencies. This bill will require that information to \nbe submitted from a variety of agencies, such as the Department of \nHomeland Security, the Justice Department, the FBI, and--in my view, \nmost critically of all--the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  Most Americans have very little idea about what the Securities and \nExchange Commission collects by way of information, but, in fact, it is \na treasure trove, a panorama and window into the workings of corporate \nAmerica. Very importantly in this area, they can tell us what \ncorporations--big and small around the country--are doing to protect \nthemselves. It can tell shareholders what they should know. The \nshareholders, after all, are the owners of these companies, and they \nwill ultimately bear the financial burden of failures by corporate \nAmerica if they fail in their duties to protect their critical \ninfrastructure.\n  Not only are shareholders affected but neighbors living near \npowerplants, as well as customers--banking customers, for example, \nwhose critical financial information is entrusted to financial \ninstitutions. A vast variety of clients, customers, owners, and others \naffected by these corporations have a right to know from the Securities \nand Exchange Commission what is being done to protect against cyber \nattacks.\n  Senator Whitehouse and Senator Blunt have described in very powerful \nterms the advantages of this legislation, but let me say that equally \nimportant is what it does not do. We need to be mindful that 90 percent \nof our Nation's critical infrastructure--that is right, 90 percent of \nit--is owned by private companies, and those private entities have a \nresponsibility to our Nation to ensure that their security standards \nmeet the task of fending off cyber attacks.\n  This legislation should not be the only action Congress takes. In \nfact, Senator Rockefeller has championed legislation that is essential, \nand I am proud to be a supporter of it. I supported it in the Commerce \nCommittee, and I am very grateful to him for allowing me to partner \nwith him in helping to move it to the floor of the Senate.\n  This legislation is a very strong complement and supplement to that \nmeasure. In fact, that measure would require industry-driven voluntary \ncyber security standards for critical infrastructure. It would \nstrengthen cyber research and development. It would improve the cyber \nworkforce through development and education. It would increase public \nawareness of cyber risks and cyber security. I think the measure \napproved by the Commerce Committee is vital, and this measure very \nappropriately complements it.\n  America can't fully address a threat that it doesn't fully \nunderstand, and this legislation that Senator Whitehouse, Senator \nBlunt, Senator Graham, and I have introduced would increase public \nunderstanding of an issue critical not only to the Federal Government \nbut to all the American people, and it would ensure that Americans know \nhow they are safer or less safe as a result of the extraordinarily \ndangerous menace posed by a potential cyber attack.\n  I will yield the floor with a question to Senator Whitehouse \nregarding the Executive order issued by the President and ask, in light \nof that Executive order, does Senator Whitehouse still feel this \nlegislation will perform a service to protect our Nation?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank Senator Blumenthal for that question, and I \nthank him for his work in this area. For some time he, Senator Graham, \nSenator Blunt, and I were part of a group that tried to pull together a \nbipartisan compromise, a meaningful piece of cyber security \nlegislation, which, unfortunately, failed at the last minute.\n  As a result of that failure, the President began a process by \nExecutive order for bringing together the various private sector \nindustries in this country whose operations qualify as critical \ninfrastructure, and that provide the basics for your lives--the basic \nheat, electricity, financial services, and communications on which \nmodern, civilized life depends. From all the reports I have heard--and \nI have looked at it very closely--that process is actually going very \nsmoothly. As a result, the administration is comfortable with deferring \nlegislative activity in that area--in the area of trying to regulate \nand improve the cyber security of our critical infrastructure.\n  We are holding off for the time being on that, but the area of public \nawareness is still wide open. Legislative authorities are required--not \njust Executive order authorities--in many of these areas, particularly \nfor organizations, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nwhich is largely independent of direct Presidential control, because \nthey are independent agencies under our constitutional system.\n  This bill would not interfere with what is going on under the \nauthority of the Executive order. It is something we can do in a \nbipartisan way in the meantime while the Executive order process goes \nforward.\n\n[[Page S8931]]\n\n  I believe it will be very productive because, as Senator Blumenthal \nand Senator Blunt have noted, we are a better country and more \neffective legislators in the Senate when the public knows what is going \non and has had a chance to engage on an issue. For that to happen, the \npublic needs the information, and for the public to get that \ninformation, they need to have it collected by these different agencies \nand presented to them. We can't expect an average American citizen to \ngo out and try to do this research on their own if it has not been \ngathered anywhere.\n  I appreciate the question. I think what we are doing will be both \nvery productive and consistent with what the President has done under \nhis Executive order. I applaud him for picking up the baton after we \nfailed in Congress. Certainly, that failure had nothing to do with the \nenergy and determination to get something done on this issue with \nSenator Graham, who has joined us on the floor.\n  I will yield the floor so Senator Graham can offer his thoughts.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank my colleague very much.\n  My first thought is that America is not nearly as aware as we should \nbe about the threats of a cyber attack that could come from a terrorist \norganization, a nation state, or a criminal enterprise. We are a week \nbefore Christmas. We are going to be debating about how to deal with \nthe NSA program and reforms that make it more acceptable to the \nAmerican people.\n  I wish to lend my voice to the three Senators who have already spoken \nand, quite frankly, are far more knowledgeable about the technological \naspects of this.\n  But when I look out over the next decade and I try to figure, Where \nare the threats against the American people coming from--well, first it \nis our debt problem, but we are not going to get into that today--when \nyou look outside for foreign threats, obviously, radical Islam presents \na threat to us all--just remember 9/11--but this emerging cyber threat \nreally just scares the hell out of me. The FBI, the military, the CIA \nare telling us daily how the threat is growing.\n  The Congress could not get there, so the President had to take over \nby executive order. We had a couple good bipartisan proposals, \nlegislative changes. Senator Whitehouse's idea of incentivizing the \nprivate sector, creating a fort cyber where you will get rewarded, \nthere will be no limited liability if you harden your infrastructure in \nthe energy sector and other important financial sectors. Rewarding \npeople for upgrading their systems to harden them against terrorist \nattack or criminal activity I think is a smart way to go. It is a \ncomplicated area of the economy and a complicated potential enemy to \ndeal with, but this legislation I think is a good starting point.\n  I compliment Senator Whitehouse, who has been really helpful. Senator \nBlunt on the Republican side has been our leading voice, along with \nSenator Chambliss, to try to bring awareness to the body. Senator \nBlumenthal, as a former attorney general, understands very much the \nthreats we face from a criminal enterprise, but he has also been very \ngood on national security.\n  So a week before Christmas in 2013 we are trying to raise awareness \nbecause I am afraid if we do not get our house in order against cyber \nattacks, sooner rather than later, we will all regret it.\n  Thank you for allowing me to be part of this effort.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to conclude our comments--at least \nmy comments here--by saying we all believe that greater awareness of \nthe size of this problem and the effort that is being made every day to \ndeal with it will create an important set of information as we move \nforward.\n  This is a piece of legislation that is really focused on providing \ninformation, not in enough detail to weaken our efforts but enough \ninformation so people know this is not a casual conversation, that the \ncyber threat is real, that we are responding to it all the time, and, \nfrankly, Members of Congress need to have even more information than we \nhave on how much intensity, how much time, how much response is being \nmade.\n  I say to Senator Whitehouse, thanks for bringing us together.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, let me conclude for our side with the \nobservation that in this season of peace and reconciliation, perhaps \nthis is an issue where a little peace and reconciliation, a little zone \nof peace and reconciliation can emerge through all of our partisan \nrancor so we can go forward and do something that will indeed protect \nthis country that we love.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I offer my own concluding remarks by \nsaying that Senator Whitehouse earlier referred to our failure. He \ncharacterized it as a failure to accomplish legislation during the last \nsession of Congress. Senators Blunt and Graham were very instrumental \nin that effort, and I was proud to work with them. But that failure had \nconsequences in alerting the executive branch and galvanizing their \nwill to act. So I would not say it was completely without consequence \nor benefit.\n  I hope we will actually be successful during this session in passing \nlegislation that is so important to moving the Federal Government even \nfurther in a direction where it should be going.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield for a \nquestion, I might inquire of him whether it is his view that if you \nactually take a look at what is being done by the administration under \nthe executive order, it bears a considerable resemblance to the \nproposal we had worked on?\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I thank Senator Whitehouse for that question. I would \nobserve, in fact, that the executive branch, very importantly, followed \na number of the leading ideas Senator Whitehouse and our group \nfashioned. Of course, we take no pride of authorship or ownership in \nthose ideas, and many of them came from some of the best minds in the \nadministration, who are, in fact, thinking seriously about this \nproblem.\n  So I think it really has to be a partnership--not only a bipartisan \npartnership in the Senate and the Congress, but also a partnership \nbetween the executive and legislative branches.\n  I conclude with this thought: In many of the briefings we had as \nSenators, off the record or classified, I was struck by how horrified \nand at least alarmed most Americans would be if they heard some of the \nstories of how close America has come to the next Pearl Harbor, how \nclose we have come to cyber catastrophe, and how vulnerable the Nation \nstill is, despite the growing awareness in both the corporate and \nmilitary sectors of our country about this threat.\n  So when we talk about creating awareness, we are talking literally \nabout spreading information that is vital for Americans to know.\n  I will close with the thought that I hope the leaders of this country \nwho have control over classifying information would seek ways to inform \nthe American public about the risks and the dangers posed from cyber \nattack.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask if the chairperson of the Budget \nCommittee will engage in a brief dialogue, colloquy.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I would ask my friend, the chairperson \nof the Budget Committee, who has done extremely hard work on the budget \nagreement, is the Senator aware that under the Simpson-Bowles plan--\nwhich was embraced by many, many Members of this body, including on \nthis side, including on the other side, including those who have now \nannounced their opposition to the agreement, the Ryan-Murray budget--\nthat the Simpson-Bowles plan recommends scrapping COLAs, cost-of-living \nadjustments, entirely? It not just cuts them, but the Simpson-Bowles \nplan--I wonder if the\n\n[[Page S8932]]\n\nchairperson knows--eliminates COLAs entirely for working age military \nretirees?\n  The Simpson-Bowles plan, which was so embraced and everybody thought \nwas the greatest thing since sliced bread, said:\n\n       Defer Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) for retirees in the \n     current system until age 62, including for civilian and \n     military retirees who retire well before a conventional \n     retirement age. In place of annual increases, provide a one-\n     time catch-up adjustment at age 62 to increase the benefit to \n     the amount that would have been payable had full COLAS been \n     in effect.\n\n  So basically what Simpson-Bowles recommended was scrapping the cost-\nof-living adjustment for working age military retirees. Please correct \nme if I am wrong, but the provision in the Senator's bill is a 1-\npercent reduction--far, far less than scrapping it entirely, as \nSimpson-Bowles recommended.\n  I would ask again, where was the outrage, to quote my old friend Bob \nDole, where was the outrage when this provision in Simpson-Bowles was \nincluded, which would have scrapped it completely? It was not through \nthe Armed Services Committee. It was the Simpson-Bowles plan, which was \na commission. I would ask the distinguished chairperson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, the Senator from Arizona is correct. \nThe Simpson-Bowles Commission, in their report, asked for an \nelimination of the entire COLA, as the Senator outlined in his opening \nremarks today. The budget bill before us took a different approach, and \nI appreciate the Senator reminding all of us that is out there.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, could I ask the chairperson, is it not \ntrue that what you have proposed is 1-percentage point for military \nretirees--to reduce the annual cost-of-living adjustment by 1 \npercentage point for military retirees--which means, according to House \nBudget Committee staff: A person who enlisted at age 18 and retired at \n38 as a sergeant first class in the Army would see approximately a 6-\npercent overall reduction in lifetime pay because of the COLA \nreduction; that is, that person would receive about $1.626 million in \nlifetime retirement pay instead of $1.734 million.\n  So that is as compared to what Simpson-Bowles envisioned: complete \nelimination, as opposed to this 1-percent reduction.\n  I would also ask, again, to the chairperson of the Budget Committee, \nis it not true that this cost-of-living adjustment reduction, the 1 \npercent, does not kick in until 2015, the end of 2015? And is it not \ntrue that Senator Levin, and I, and all others, have committed to \nreviewing this provision, with the outlook, at least in my view, to \nrepealing it if necessary? But also there is a commission, supported by \nMembers on both sides of the aisle, which looks at this entire issue of \ncost-of-living adjustments, of retirement, of TRICARE, of all of these \nissues because of the increasing costs of these benefits--in the words \nof Secretary Gates, former Secretary of Defense, who all of us admire \nso much--that are ``eating us alive.''\n  So again, the Simpson-Bowles plan, which was embraced almost \nunanimously on both sides of the aisle, eliminates the cost-of-living \nadjustments for any retirees during their working age. This plan, which \nis met with such outrage, is only a 1-percent reduction--by the way, I \nwant revised as well--that they would receive $1.626 million instead of \n$1.734 million.\n  Finally, I would ask the distinguished chairperson, does she know of \nanother plan, another idea, another legislative proposal that will \nprevent us from shutting down the government again--something I refuse \nto inflict on the citizens of my State? I refuse to disturb their \nlifestyles, to destroy their income, to shut down essential government \nservices, the nightmare we just went through.\n  So I guess my question to the chairperson is, does the Senator know \nof another avenue between now and I believe it is January 15 when the \ngovernment would be shut down again that we could pursue that would \nprevent another government shutdown?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, the Senator from Arizona is entirely \ncorrect. There is no other legislation that can be brought before us at \nthis time to prevent a government shutdown. As we know, the House of \nRepresentatives has gone home for the year. We know without the \nbipartisan agreement before us, the impacts across the country would be \nuntenable. We have kind of been there. On top of that, if we do not \nhave this budget agreement, the military itself will take another $20 \nbillion hit, so those very military personnel whom all of us \npassionately care about would be facing layoffs, would be facing \nuncertainty, would be facing furloughs, would be facing tremendous \nhardship to themselves and to their families. So, yes, the Senator from \nArizona is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would further ask the chairperson if she has, as I \nhave, heard from every single uniformed service leader of the four \narmed services, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nthat further effects of sequestration will do unsustainable damage to \nour national security, that the pain inflicted because of the way that \nsequestration acts in 2014, the really significant effects, are that we \nwill destroy or certainly dramatically impact our ability to defend \nthis Nation? Is that not the unanimous opinion of our uniformed service \ncommanders to whom we give the responsibility to defend this Nation? I \nwould ask the chairperson if she has heard from our military leadership \nin uniform as well on this entire proposal, particularly its effect \nfrom sequestration?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, the Senator from Arizona is correct. I \nhave heard from every single branch of our military services that the \nimpact in 2014, a few weeks from now, would be devastating if the \ncurrent sequester continues to take place. I would add to the Senator \nfrom Arizona, coming from a State where we have a number of military \nbases, I have heard from the families of those soldiers and airmen and \nsailors that they are deeply worried about their loved ones and their \nlives if we do not replace the sequester.\n  I want to personally thank the Senator for his hard work and his \nsupport behind the scenes to help us get to where we are today, because \nwithout the Senator's voice in this, it would have been extremely \ndifficult. I carry his voice and many voices into that conference room \nto take some very tough choices forward so those families, all the way \nup to those top generals, do not have to enact the further cuts of \nsequestration.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I may ask the chairperson, in summary: One, there is \nno legislative proposal between now and January 15 that anyone sees \nthat could pass both Houses of Congress and be signed by the President \nof the United States that would prevent another government shutdown on \nJanuary 15. I would ask the chairman if that is true.\n  Second, is it not true that if we go through the sequestration again, \nparticularly because of the nature of the sequester legislation, that \nthere is a sharp drop in 2014, and then a sort of a restoration in \nfollowing years? In other words, the worst year of the entire \nsequestration process would be next year, unless we soften the blow. Is \nit not true that nobody cares more about those who serve in the \nmilitary than their uniformed leaders, and unanimously those uniformed \nleaders have said they support this legislation?\n  Is it not true that the chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, and the Armed Services Committee, will have an entire year, \nbecause this legislation will not take effect--this cost-of-living \nadjustment will not take effect until January 15, 2015, so we have an \nentire year of authorization committee consideration of this particular \nprovision?\n  Is it also not true that it is recognized by all members of the Armed \nServices Committee and the Appropriations Committee and the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee that we have continued increases in costs and \nbenefits forever because of our inability to fund our national \nsecurity? In other words, the dramatic increase in personnel and \nbenefit costs are such that we are not going to have money left over \nfor the mission, the equipment, and the capabilities?\n  Is it also not true--I would ask again what the obvious is: The \nSimpson-Bowles plan, which was embraced wholeheartedly by many of us, \nincluding this Senator, by the way, said to defer cost-of-living \nadjustment for retirees in all--that is all cost-of-living\n\n[[Page S8933]]\n\nadjustments for retirees in the current system until age 62.\n  Is this far more draconian, what is envisioned in Simpson-Bowles, \nthan what is before the body today? So is it hard to understand why \nsomeone would embrace Simpson-Bowles and yet find this provision as \nobjectionable as it is? I find the provision objectionable, but I have \nconfidence, and I hope the budget chairperson would agree, that it \ndeserves the review and legislating, if it needs to be fixed, because \nthe fact is that we have to look at the entire retirement and benefits \nthat are now present in the military--for example, TRICARE, where there \nhas not been an increase in premiums I believe since 1985, while the \ncost of health care has skyrocketed.\n  So, again, I would ask the chairman of the Budget Committee if that \nis true. If it is true, then does it not deserve some consideration for \nthose who care, as I do and I know the chairperson does, about the men \nand women who are serving in the military, and should we not listen to \nour military leadership who literally are saying they cannot defend \nthis Nation if this sequester continues, particularly in the fashion, \nthe meat ax fashion, with which sequestration is now impacting our \nNation's defense?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I would agree with the Senator from \nArizona. In fact, the often-touted and quoted Simpson-Bowles Commission \nreport even in this debate over the last day is much more egregious in \nwhat they are seeking.\n  Secondly, I agree with everything he said except for one thing. The \nSenator from Arizona mentioned that we have 1 year to look at the \ncommission report. It is actually 2 years before this goes into effect. \nCongress will have time to act. The Senate Armed Services Committee \nwill be looking at the commission report. We will have an opportunity \nto look at this in its entirety before it is implemented. I truly want \nto thank the Senator for speaking up for our military, because I know \nmore than any one of us on this floor that when the Senator speaks for \nthe military, he understands the consequences of not enacting \nlegislation today.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the chairperson for her hard work. I believe most \nAmericans are a bit surprised that there is any agreement. I believe \nthe chairperson would agree that this is a small step. But I think the \nchairperson should also deserve and be accorded great credit for tough \nnegotiating, for a good agreement that I think will achieve many \nthings, but, most of all, prevention of the shutdown of the government \nagain which we should not and cannot inflict on the American people.\n  I am sure the chairperson would have had different provisions in it \nif she had written it herself, just as Congressman Ryan would say the \nsame thing. But this is the essence of what we are supposed to be \ndoing. The option of shutting down the government is something I do not \nreally understand, why anybody, after what we just went through, would \nwant to have as a viable option of our failure to act.\n  Again, I thank the chairperson.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I again want to thank the Senator from \nArizona for his remarks. I appreciate his help and support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. If there is not an objection, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak for 6 to 8 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  OSHA\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas and \nthe chair of the Budget Committee. I am here on the floor today to \nvoice strong objection to a Federal agency that is disregarding the \nclear language of the law in pursuit of what has appeared time and time \nagain to be what I describe as an antiagriculture agenda with this \nadministration.\n  Let me explain. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, \nwhich is known as OSHA, is now claiming jurisdiction, of all things, of \nfamily farms. But they are doing that in defiance of Congress. For the \npast 35 years, literally 35 years, Congress has included very specific \nlanguage in appropriations bills. It prohibits OSHA from enforcement on \nsmall farms. Literally since 1976, the law has said very clearly: No \nfunds appropriated for OSHA can be used for rules or regulations that \napply to farming operations with 10 or fewer employees.\n  Clearly what Congress is trying to do is provide protection for the \nfamily farms that exist in our States across this country. Yet, lo and \nbehold, OSHA has decided it can label certain sections of the farm \nsomething else by fiat and send in their inspectors. Let me explain \nwhat has happened in Nebraska.\n  OSHA targeted a family farm in rural Nebraska. They grow corn and \nsoybeans and raise some cattle. This farm has one nonfamily employee on \nthat farm. In other words, it is a very typical Nebraska farm, just the \nkind of farm Congress envisioned in creating the exemption dating back \nto 1976.\n  OSHA ignored what Congress directed. They ignored the law exempting \nfarms and slapped this family farm with fines totaling more than \n$130,000. OSHA accused the farmer of willful violations. Let me give \nyou a couple of examples: Failure to conduct atmospheric tests in a \ngrain bin; failure to wear OSHA-approved gear when entering the grain \nbin, to name a few.\n  You cannot make this stuff up. I kid you not. The violations I listed \nwere $28,000 each, with a long list of lesser violations piled on top. \nThey threw the book at this farmer. Let me be clear that OSHA made no \nclaim that anyone had been hurt. They claimed only that the farm failed \nto comply with the OSHA manual.\n  I am sure the farmer was stunned to find OSHA inspectors on his farm \nout in the middle of Nebraska, and be told he suddenly must comply with \nOSHA regulations, knowing the law says his farm is exempt from OSHA \nregulations. I suspect he was rightly confused, angry, and frustrated.\n  OSHA claimed it was not regulating the farming operation at all; \nrather, it was only regulating the nonfarming operations. Congress had \nnot exempted the nonfarming parts of farms. Right? So what was this \nnonfarming activity that OSHA believes it can regulate? Grain storage. \nGrain storage.\n  I grew up on a farm. Every farm has grain storage. It has hay \nstorage. It has silage storage. Can they regulate the farming \noperations relative to those items? Yes. That is right. OSHA in their \nwisdom says storing grain after a harvest allows them to go in and \nregulate this farm. I am not sure how many OSHA employees have spent \nmuch time on a farm. I suspect not very many.\n  But there are not too many grain farms that do not store some of \ntheir grain. An iconic part of the agricultural landscape is grain \nbins. They are fundamental to farming and have been since I grew up on \na farm. If farmers had to sell everything at harvest, they would not \nmake much money, because that is when prices are typically the lowest. \nSo it is only responsible for a farmer in a part of the farming \noperation to have grain bins on the farm and it has been that way \nforever. OSHA's claim that the storage of grain is not part of farming \nis absolutely incredible and it is absurd.\n  It is also a blatant overreach in violation of the law, the law we \nhave been passing in Congress dating back to 1976.\n  Whenever I meet the farmers and ranchers in Nebraska, they often \nraise concern about regulatory overreach. In fact, they feel as if they \nare targeted by this administration. OSHA's distorted definition of \nfarming, in order to expand its jurisdiction, serves as evidence that \nfarmers' concerns are legitimate concerns. OSHA should never be allowed \nto end-run the law in this manner.\n  I am asking Labor Secretary Perez to rein in OSHA and send a clear \nsignal to America's farmers that they don't have a target on their \nbacks. OSHA must rescind its absurd guidance suggesting that grain \nbins, of all things, are not a part of the farming operation, and it \nmust stop sending inspectors on to family farms in violation of the \nlaw.\n  I have drafted, and I am sending a letter to Secretary Perez, a \nletter requesting that he make these changes in compliance with the \nlaw. I am inviting all of my colleagues to join me in signing that \nletter.\n  Let me conclude by saying let's stand with our Nation's family \nfarmers,\n\n[[Page S8934]]\n\nwhich we have done since 1976. Let's rein in this regulatory overreach \nand send a message that Federal agencies must abide by the clear \ndirection of Congress.\n  I thank the Senators on the floor for the courtesy, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I rise to discuss the pending budget agreement.\n  First, I wish to praise Senator Murray and Congressman Ryan for their \nhard work. I think everyone around here and everyone around the Nation \nrecognizes what they have done. Their efforts have allowed us to reach \na bipartisan and bicameral agreement. They deserve our recognition, and \nwe appreciate them for all their hard work. I am sure at times it \nseemed like endless hours of hard work, but it has definitely paid off \nwith the big votes we have seen in the House and also in the Senate.\n  As anyone in this Chamber could tell us, bipartisanship is all too \nrare in Congress these days. I can only speak for myself, but I am \ntired of the gridlock, and the American people--especially those whom I \ntalk to from Arkansas--are tired of it as well. We must work together \nto get work done and to keep our economy growing.\n  This agreement, in my view, is a positive step forward. It gives our \nbusiness community and our economy the certainty it has been looking \nfor. It also prevents the ``my way or the highway'' politics that have \nbeen so destructive and that have been practiced by an irresponsible \nfew that have seemed committed to hurt our economy. It restores \nresources to our national security interests, which I think is \nextremely important.\n  I appreciate what Senator McCain of Arizona said a few moments ago on \nthe floor. It does all this while reducing the deficit. That being \nsaid, this agreement is not perfect, especially when it comes to the \nharmful budget cuts made at the expense of our men and women in \nuniform. I will be the first to say we need to cut our spending, but we \nneed to do it in a responsible way. We need to cut waste, fraud, and \nabuse. We need to eliminate items such as unnecessary government \npurchasing and maintenance of real estate and buildings. We can end \nout-of-date and ineffective government programs, but we cannot balance \nthe budget on the backs of our hard-working military members and their \nfamilies.\n  As the Senator from Arizona said a few moments ago, he is hopeful--\nand many of us believe and agree--that we will have a chance to fix \nthis someday soon. That is why I am here, to encourage my colleagues \nfrom both sides of the aisle to support commonsense solutions, \ncommonsense provisions that will restore full retirement pay for our \nfuture military retirees and repeal section 403 of this agreement.\n  Our brave men and women in uniform have made many sacrifices for this \ncountry. When I think about their heroism and the what they have done, \nI think of a passage in the Book of Isaiah, when Isaiah is preparing to \nleave everything behind, go out, and preach the word of the Lord to the \npeople who need to hear it.\n  Isaiah 6:8 states:\n\n       And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, ``Whom shall I \n     send, and who will go for us?'' Then I said, ``Here I am! \n     Send me.''\n\n  Here I am. Send me. That is exactly what our men and women in uniform \nsay. They leave their families behind. They leave behind their homes, \ntheir jobs, and in many cases a wonderful life to go out and protect \nthe freedoms we all enjoy. So singling them out is not only unfair, it \nis also wrong. These heroes laid their lives on the line for us, and \nthey deserve for us to work to fix this provision so they can receive \nthe full benefits they have earned.\n  The good news is, as we have heard the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from Washington say a few moments ago, we can fix this and we \ncan move forward. That is the good news today. We have this bipartisan, \nbicameral budget agreement, and it does move us forward. If we can get \nthe votes necessary today to pass it, then we can swiftly move with \nanother bill at some point in the near future to protect and fix what I \nam so concerned about.\n  Back to the bipartisan agreement, the bicameral agreement that the \nchairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee reached with the chairman of \nthe House Budget Committee, this is a job well done. This is an effort. \nNone of this is easy. There are always going to be decisions that are \nhard and difficult.\n  That is why balancing the budget is so hard, because there are \npopular provisions. We have to make tough choices, but these are tough \ntimes and we need to make these tough choices.\n  I join my colleagues in the hope we get a large bipartisan vote for \nthe legislation and for the agreement Senator Murray and Congressman \nRyan reached. I also hope we very quickly will act to fix the one \nprovision that is causing so much heartburn.\n  With that, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with the Senators from Georgia, who join me on the floor \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I come today to address an unintended \ninclusion in the compromise deal that was worked out by the bipartisan \nbudget conference and that was overwhelmingly passed in the House of \nRepresentatives earlier last week.\n  As a long-time champion myself of our Nation's veterans and military \nfamilies, I want to make absolutely sure today that they know a \nprovision included in this deal which mistakenly included disabled \nretirees and survivors for changes in pension growth will be addressed \nin short order following passage of this bill. In fact, I am going to \nbe joining with the Senators from Georgia and others after passage of \nthis bill to make that technical correction in a stand-alone bill.\n  I think all of us know our disabled veterans have made tremendous \nsacrifices for our Nation and deserve the peace of mind that their \nbenefits will not be adjusted under this compromise legislation. They \ndeserve to know also that government shutdowns and the constant crises \nthat have unfortunately impacted wait times for our veterans' benefits, \nfurther growth in the disability backlog, and even jeopardizing their \nmonthly checks should be a thing of the past. That is what is at the \nheart of this bill.\n  We are working to ensure the uncertainty and fear these veterans and \nmilitary families faced last October is taken off the table for at \nleast 2 years. We are working to ensure the government they fought for \nfunctions in a way that delivers on the promise we owe all of them.\n  In furtherance of that effort, this technical error certainly can, \nshould, and will be addressed, and I join with the Senators from \nGeorgia in ensuring our disabled veterans that it absolutely will be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I wish to thank the Senator from Washington for all of \nher hard work as chairman of the Budget Committee and on this \nbipartisan compromise on the Budget Act. I want to thank my colleague, \nSenator Chambliss of Georgia, for joining me to support the chairman in \nthis effort.\n  I support the bipartisan Budget Act because, while I believe the \nreforms included in the agreement are modest, they will move America in \nthe right direction. One of the most essential components of the deal \nbetween Senators Murray and Ryan is the avoidance of another \ndevastating round of sequestration aimed squarely at the national \ndefense capabilities of our country. This agreement will help us avoid \ncuts that would have caused long-lasting damage to the readiness of our \nmilitary and will help us provide the best support and tools possible \nfor our men and women in uniform.\n  While avoiding defense sequestration was key to gaining my support \nfor this deal, I was concerned to learn that at the last minute \ndisabled retirees and survivors were mistakenly included in the \nprovision slowing the growth rate in terms of COLAs in the coming \nyears. I believe this mistake must be corrected, and my continued \nsupport for\n\n[[Page S8935]]\n\nthe budget agreement is predicated on the Chairman's commitment to \ncorrecting this mistake. I publicly thank the chairman this morning for \nmaking that commitment in this colloquy.\n  I know from my travels through the many military installations in \nGeorgia with Senator Chambliss, and through my work on the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee with Senator Murray, that both Senators \nshare my concern, and I look forward to working with the two of them to \naddress this most important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I am pleased to join Chairman Murray \nand Senator Isakson regarding our concern about the military retirement \npay provisions in this budget proposal. As I mentioned yesterday on \nthis floor, any pursuit of debt reduction should not come at the \nexpense of our service men, women, and veterans.\n  As we have discovered, these cuts will not only apply to working \nmilitary men and women but also to military widows and soldiers who \nhave been medically retired from wounds received in the line of duty.\n  I recognize that in order to truly tackle our debt and deficit it \nwill take all Americans making sacrifices, including our military. What \nwe cannot do is ask those who have been injured defending our Nation to \nbear a disproportionate burden.\n  I thank Chairman Murray again for the leadership she has shown, along \nwith Chairman Ryan, on these complex and divisive budget issues, and I \nstand with Senator Isakson and Chairman Murray in making the necessary \nchanges to this legislation to ensure our disabled retirees and \nsurvivors are taken care of.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Senators Chambliss and Isakson pertaining to the \nsubmission of S. Res. 323 are located in today's Record under \n``Submission of Concurrent and Senate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Barrasso pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1849 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I want to spend a few minutes talking \nabout the bill we are going to vote on this afternoon. I am starting my \n10th year in the Senate. During that period of time, my No. 1 goal in \ncoming to the Senate was to try to right our financial ship and almost \neverything I have done in the Senate has been related to the fiscal \nconsequences of our dereliction of duty as Members of Congress--of both \nparties. There is nothing partisan about that statement. We have seen \ndifferent Presidents and different parties control both bodies, always \nto the same result.\n  We have before us a bill today that is a purported compromise. I want \nto describe who it is a compromise for. It is a compromise for the \npoliticians. It is not a compromise for the American people because \nwhat it does is increase spending and increase taxes. The net effect, \neven if you take all the budget gimmicks that are in this bill that are \nnot actual savings, and even if you believe people 10 and 11 years from \nnow will actually hold true to what this bill pretends to have us do, \nwhich is what we are not doing--something we did 2 years ago through \nthis bill, we are still going to spend more money than we would have \nand we are going to charge people revenues, some $24 billion--$28 \nbillion, pardon me--increased revenues which we are not calling tax \nincreases but Americans are going to pay that so it is money that is \ngoing to come out of their pocket.\n  What we have before us is a bill that is a political compromise for \nthe parties in Washington to keep us from doing what we really need to \ndo--the hard things. I am going to go through some criticisms of this \nbill. It is not meant to reflect on any one individual. It will apply \njust as much to the Republicans as it does to the Democrats. But we \nhave a bill that supposedly fixes things until past the next election \nso we do not have to face these gigantic problems of ``deadlock.''\n  The other thing I would note as I go through this is it is my \ncontention we do not have a problem getting along. It is my contention \nwe get along way too well. We get along way too well; otherwise, we \nwould not have a $17.7 trillion debt. We would not have $124 trillion \nin unfunded liabilities. And we would not have debt per American in \nthis country which is now $57,000 per person and unfunded liabilities \nthat are over $1 million per household, not including that debt \nrepayment.\n  How did we do that? We had to agree to do that. Both parties had to \nagree to do that. The President had to sign it. My contention is we get \nalong way too well, when it comes to ruining the financial future of \nour country. My main criticism--I do not criticize compromise, I \ncriticize compromise that ignores the facts of our financial situation.\n  I want to make a point. I put a book out yesterday. It is called the \n``Yearly Wastebook.'' I do it every year. I do it somewhat in jest but \nto make a very real point. I outlined over $31 billion, what I think \nand I think most Democrats would agree and that the American public, 95 \npercent of them, would agree with this--that when running a $700 \nbillion deficit, maybe we should not be spending these moneys on these \nthings which go far further in actually solving our problems for \ncompromise in terms of creating a solution to the long-term problems \nand giving the American people what they want.\n  We really do have a 6-percent approval rating, right? That is true. I \nthink we have earned it. This bill, I believe, proves it because we did \nexactly the opposite of what the American people would like to see us \ndo. We solved our problem as politicians but we made their problem \nworse. We did not fix the things that are obvious to fix.\n  I was on the Simpson-Bowles Commission, I was a member of the Gang of \n6, I have worked in a bipartisan fashion with anybody who will work \nwith me to try to solve the big problems in front of our country, \nexcept we as a body, and the House, really don't want to solve them \nbecause the thing put at risk when you really solve them is political \ncareers, and as a group of politicians, the people in Washington care \nmuch more about their careers--by their actions it is proven--than they \ndo about the long-term fiscal health of this country. That applies to \nboth parties.\n  So when we have a deal brought before us that will avoid \nconfrontation come January 15 and we have all sorts of budget gimmicks \nin it that are not truthful, they are not real, in the hopes that \nsomebody will grow a backbone 9 and 10 years from now and actually keep \ntheir word to the American public--and we are demonstrating right now \nwe can't even keep our word from 2 years ago--why would we be proud to \nvote for that? Does it solve a real problem? No. It puts a real problem \noff and actually makes the problem worse to the tune of $68 billion. \nThrough this bill we will borrow an additional $68 billion, $50 billion \nof it, close to, in the next year and $20 billion some after that, and \nin the year after, and then hope and pray that Congresses that follow \nus will do what we suggested.\n  Everyone in this body knows that is not going to happen. So when you \nvote\n\n[[Page S8936]]\n\non this bill you are voting for your political career, you are voting \nfor the Washington establishment, but you are not voting for the person \nout there who now has a $57,000 debt they are servicing, and their \nfamily, $1 million per household in this country in unfunded \nliabilities.\n  It will pass. I have no doubt it will pass. I feel like John the \nBaptist in the wilderness. But mark my words. If we continue to do what \nwe are doing today, we will be remembered as the people who could have \nfixed the problem and didn't; who could have made the courageous \ndecisions and chose not to; who could have stiffened their spines and \nsaid we don't care what Republican extremists or liberal extremists \nsay, the future of our country is more important than any political \ncareer in this town. And what we have before us is just the opposite.\n  Why wasn't in part of this agreement some of the $250 billion that \nGAO has identified as waste, fraud, duplication, and mismanagement? \nThere is not one thing in this bill that addresses one thing that GAO \nhas recommended to Congress over the last 3 years--not one. So we have \nthe ``Wastebook''--$31 billion of what I would consider--and it is not \npartisan. There could be a difference in terms of agreement about what \nis important and what is not. But, again, I would say in terms of the \n``Wastebook,'' it is: Should we be spending money now when we are \nborrowing money, in light of the fiscal situation that we have, on some \nof the things that we outlined? It is a listing of 100. It has $31 \nbillion worth of savings. I will outline a few of them for you.\n  We are going to be taking up NDAA next. None of the amendments that I \noffered are in the NDAA. Every one of them was structural to the \nPentagon to make it more responsible and accountable to its \nconstitutional duty, which it has not performed, of giving account to \nCongress on how it spent its money. For example, the Army commissioned \na contract to have a warfare overseeing blimp. They spent $297 million \non that blimp. It flew for a short period of time in this country. We \nsold it back to the contractor for $300,000.\n  I have two questions: No. 1. Whoever signed that contract and made \nthat decision, did they get fired from the Federal Government? Did they \nget demoted in rank? And, No. 2, was the contract actually executed to \nthe requirements that the military set out for it?\n  It is called accountability. The answer to both of those is no. There \nis no accountability. So we are going to have an NDAA bill come through \nthat requires them to meet an audit. They have been required since 1992 \nto meet an audit. They did not do it in 2014 and they will not do it in \n2017 and they won't do it in 2018, because there is no hammer on the \nPentagon to make them do it. That is because all hammers have been \ntaken out because we don't want to force them to meet their \nconstitutional responsibility. It is too hard.\n  We never told them it was too hard to go to Iraq or Afghanistan. But \nit is too hard for them to follow their constitutional duty to report \non how they spend their money. What I would put before us is, if you \ncannot measure what you are doing, you cannot manage what you are \ndoing. What is obvious from the waste, fraud, and abuse, contract \nfailures within the Pentagon, is they have no clue on what they are \ndoing. All you have to do is take the Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier, the \nlittoral combat ships, the F-35--all of those major defense programs \nare at risk, over budget, behind schedule. I am not talking a little \nbit over budget. We did not do the oversight; we have not forced that. \nYou will never get control of those programs until you make them be \nable to account for what they are doing.\n  My first training, my first degree, is in accounting. I understand \nthe reason accounting is important is because it tells you where to go \nto manage your problems. The Pentagon cannot do that. The Pentagon \nordered--at the insistence of us, by the way--some airplanes for \nAfghanistan. Guess what we have done. We have taken delivery here and \nwe have sent them straight to the Arizona desert, just $422 million \nworth of them. By the way, the ones that did go to Afghanistan, we are \ngoing to cut up, destroy. We are not going to send them to Africa for \nrelief missions. We are not going to send them somewhere else. We are \ngoing to cut them into pieces, another $200 million worth of airplanes. \nAnd by the way, since the Afghan Air Force wants the same thing America \nhas, we have already given them two C130-Hs, and we are going to give \nthem two more. That is another $400 million. So what we have done \nthrough poor management is waste over $700 million on one item.\n  There is nothing in this bill that corrects that. Yet this bill is \ngoing to come to the floor--the NDAA--and not one of us who actually \nknows what really needs to be done in terms of changing the financial \npicture in the Pentagon is going to have an opportunity to influence \nthat bill--not one of us. It doesn't have to be that way. That bill \ncame out of committee in May of last year, but we have chosen to \noperate that way.\n  Camp Leatherneck, which is in Afghanistan, is a $34 million new camp \nfor troops, and it sits abandoned today. It has never been occupied. \nWho was the general or colonel who authorized that in anticipation of \nour drawdown? Who executed the order to build it and then ordered that \nwe abandon it? Is there any accountability in the Pentagon or in any \nother agency? Are we doing our job of holding them accountable?\n  The ``Wastebook'' is not all about the Defense Department, but I \nbrought a couple of those up just so we could see what is going on. The \n``Wastebook'' is about poor judgment across all the agencies. You may \ndisagree with me about some of what is in the ``Wastebook,'' but the \nquestion you have to ask yourself is: At a time when we have done what \nwe have done to the American people in terms of unfunded liabilities, \nin terms of individual debt--the average family now has over $220,000 \nworth of debt that they have to pay back which we borrowed--should we \nspend money the way we spend it?\n  We spent $978,000 to study romance novels. Certainly that is a \npriority right now in our government. Everybody would agree with that; \nright? Sure they would. They would agree with it. Yet we put that \ncontract out last year and spent money to study the background of \nromance novels, both on the Web and off, and why people write them. We \ndidn't just study about them here, we studied about them everywhere.\n  How about $400,000 to Yale University, by the National Science \nFoundation, to actually study whether people who align with the tea \nparty have the cognitive capability in terms of science? Guess what. We \nspent that money and the professor got the biggest surprise of his \nlife. Here is what the study said: People who are aligned with the tea \nparty have far exceptional cognitive abilities when it comes to \nscience, math, and financial aptitude. It totally surprised the \nprofessor because the whole purpose was supposed to undermine people \nwho are constitutional conservatives. Yet we spent $400,000 on that \nstudy.\n  Those are just a few of the small examples of the silliness which \ngoes on. People say: Well, $400,000 isn't much; $900,000 isn't much. \nThe State Department spent $500 million during the last week of the \nfiscal year. What did they spend it on? Does anybody know? To buy \nbrand-new crystal stemware for all the embassies throughout the world. \nWe didn't need new stemware, but we had to spend the money, so we spent \nit.\n  Just think about that. We are responsible for that. We allowed that \nto happen. There is no oversight here. There is no aggressiveness in \nterms of controlling costs, and our default position is our agreement \non this budget which doesn't address any of those problems.\n  The American people are going to be asking questions about why we get \nalong so well. The political story is not that Washington spends out of \nconflict and partisan bickering because the facts don't lie. We get \nalong way too well. We are going to get along so well that we are going \nto pass another bill that solves the problem for us, as politicians, \nbut, in fact, actually hurts the American people.\n  I am not going to be a part of that, and I am going to keep yelling \nfrom the canyons and from the mountain tops until we start doing what \nwe are supposed to do because this is not going to change.\n  It is my hope that some of us will wake up and start looking at some \nof\n\n[[Page S8937]]\n\nthe real facts. So $30 billion can make a big difference. If we just \neliminate the items in this ``Wastebook'' for next year, we would be \nable to take care of one-third of the sequester. There are just 100 \nitems here. I can give you 300 items.\n  I can give you $150 billion worth of stupidity every year, but we \nchoose not to do anything about it. We choose not to do anything about \nit because you have to be a committee chairman in order to have an \noversight committee dig into this stuff. You actually have to do the \nhard work to find out where the administration is spending the money.\n  President Obama doesn't want money to be wasted this way. He needs \nour help. Yet we will not help him. We will not help the American \npeople. Consequently, the future of our country is at risk when it \nshould be gloriously great. It is at risk not because of the American \npeople; it is at risk because of us. We ought to change that.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 7 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Mayorkas Nomination\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I appreciate the courtesies of the Senator from \nWashington, who is on the floor managing the bill. I thank her for \nallowing me to make these brief remarks regarding one of the nominees \nof President Obama--someone we will be confirming, hopefully, in the \nnext short period of time.\n  I come to the floor to give my strong and unequivocal support to \nAlejandro Mayorkas as the Deputy Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security. Before I speak about his many extraordinary \nqualifications for this job, let me say that it has been very \ndisappointing and very concerning to me that so many high-level \nleadership positions in this particular Department have gone unfilled \nfor so long.\n  It has been 6 months since Secretary Janet Napolitano stepped down, \nhaving given notice of her departure after serving with such \ndistinction and contributing so much to the strengthening of that \nagency. All agencies of the Federal Government are important and there \nare advocacy groups who argue for them, but I think everyone \nunderstands the real significance of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. It is a relatively new agency. The Department is only 10 \nyears old, but it plays a key role in the security of our homeland. \nBecause it is new, it is still struggling with how to coordinate and \nunite all of the internal parts and coordinate effectively with the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  It has new and emerging technological challenges that are extremely \ndemanding. The cyber attack which is happening daily and which is a \ngrowing threat to us is a very important part of their mission.\n  May I remind Senators that immigration, border control, and border \nsecurity are right in the middle of the mission of this Department. So \nif we want to have strong immigration policies and smart immigration \npolicies and secure our borders with smart fences, we better get \nsomebody who is experienced and smart to run the operation.\n  That is why I am here to support Alejandro Mayorkas, who has been the \nDirector of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for the last \nseveral years. He has received many compliments from both Republicans \nand Democrats in his role as our chief immigration officer. He has \nworked to secure the border and has made tremendous improvements with \nthe resources, which have been quite significant, that we have provided \nto strengthen the border. He brings tremendous experience as having run \none of the most significant agencies within the Department.\n  Today we have a chance to start filling the leadership vacuum at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security not only with visionary leaders such as \nAlejandro Mayorkas but with leaders who have practical hands-on \nexperience running the important parts of this Department.\n  As I mentioned, the nominee is the current Director of U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services, which is really how I got to meet \nhim and to know him and to work with him in such a close fashion.\n  Many of my colleagues know that I have the responsibility and \nprivilege of informally heading up our Senate adoption caucus, and I do \nsome international travel, helping to strengthen child welfare work \naround the world as well as, of course, in Louisiana and here \ndomestically in the United States. We ran into a significant problem \nseveral years ago, which we are still trying to unwind, when Guatemala \nclosed adoptions and our own State Department was a partner in that \nclosure. There might have been--might have been--some good reasons for \nclosure. The problem was that in the middle of that, there were 900 \nAmerican families from every State in the Union who were caught. They \nwere not placed on any transition list nor were they given any \nsupport--virtually no support from either our State Department or from \nthe country of Guatemala. So some of us stepped in with partners at the \nState Department and others to see what we could do to help.\n  It has been a long, hard road for many of these parents and children \nwho have now been stuck in orphanages, in group homes. They are no \nlonger infants. Some of them are 8 years old and have waited 6 years \nfor their adoption to be finalized. Some of them are 15.\n  Amidst all of the work the nominee had to do on immigration and so \nmany conflicting pressures, Alejandro Mayorkas took the time to give \nleadership and voice and help to the powerless. That speaks a lot to \nme, and it should to the members of our coalition, which is very broad \nand completely nonpartisan, when a very important person with a lot of \npower steps out of that comfort zone and helps people who have no \nlobbyists, no power. Without his help, we would not be making the \nprogress we are making. That is one example that proves to me he is the \nkind of leader we need more of, not less of, here in Washington.\n  I have full confidence that--based on my knowledge of his experience \nof running immigration and my personal knowledge of his character and \nhis integrity and his tremendous ability in terms of diplomacy and \nnegotiating, which I witnessed firsthand, working with many high-level \ngovernment officials from outside of our own government--he has the \nskills to negotiate within this agency to bring everyone to a common \ncause, a common vision, and a common plan to move this very important \nDepartment forward.\n  Prior to his directorship as immigration director for the United \nStates, he served for a good bit of time as a U.S. attorney prosecuting \ncriminal and white-collar crime and gang violence in California. He is \nknown very well to the two Senators from California. I think it was \nSenator Feinstein who recommended him to that position. She has \ntestified on his behalf and has submitted statements for the Record. \nBoth Senators from California can also vouch for his almost flawless \nrecord of service.\n  He has already been confirmed twice by the Senate. Yet, \nunfortunately, there were some political concerns that are not valid \nthat held him up. So we have moved him forward. He got a strong vote \nfrom the members of our committee who know him well and understand his \nhigh level of integrity and his proven record of service to the people \nof the United States.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a \nstrong look at this nominee, understanding that he has been confirmed \ntwice before. He is an outstanding, unblemished prosecutor of crime. He \nwould be a perfect person, with his background and experience, to serve \nas a Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. I, \nfrankly, think he is one of the most qualified people whom I have seen \nnominated.\n  Today, we have a chance to start filling the leadership vacuum at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security with visonary leaders. Ali Mayorkas--\nthe current director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services--\nis exactly\n\n[[Page S8938]]\n\nthe type of leader we need in the deputy secretary position.\n  Since his confirmation as head of USCIS by voice vote by the Senate \nin 2009, Director Mayorkas has led the effort to turn around an agency \nthat was widely considered to be foundering and helped build a \nprofessional and competent workforce.\n  Director Mayorkas brings all the right qualities for this critical \nposition; these qualities include a pushing for collaboration and \nefficiency within the workplace. As a prosecutor and a former U.S. \nattorney for California, Mr. Mayorkas demonstrated his commitment to \nenforcing the law to protect U.S. citizens.\n  As Congress and our Nation move closer to comprehensive immigration \nreform, we must have the proper leadership in place in the Department \nof Homeland Security to ensure that the laws we pass are enacted with \nthe same transparency and accountability that he brings to his current \npost. I can think of no better leader to guide DHS in this pursuit, as \nhe will do so in a way that balances the needs of our business \ncommunities and families while keeping our border safe and secure.\n  Mr. Mayorkas' previous experience provides a solid foundation for his \nfuture work and an extensive knowledge of our immigration system and \nthe overall mission of the Department of Homeland Security. As the \nchairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, I am \nkeenly aware how important it is to have strong management at the head \nof this Department and believe him to be uniquely qualified for the \njob.\n  I have every confidence in his devotion to safeguarding our Nation \nand his ability to effectively perform his duties in this new role. I \nwill be proudly casting my vote in support of his nomination as Deputy \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I yield the floor. I don't see any other Senator wishing to speak at \nthis moment, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1797\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 259, S. 1797, a \nbill to extend unemployment insurance benefits for 1 year; that the \nbill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, it is \nunfortunate that the Senate's schedule is completely full with pending \ncloture motions on controversial or completely nonurgent nominations. I \nask if the Senator would consider amending his request to withdraw all \nof the pending cloture motions on executive nominations and that the \nSenate would proceed immediately to consideration of S. 1797, the \nunemployment insurance extension, and that the majority leader and the \nminority leader would be recognized to offer amendments in an \nalternating fashion so that these important issues can be considered \nthis week. I ask the Senator to consider amending his request and \nreserve my right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so amend his request?\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I will not amend the request. I respect \nthe Senator's point, but I will not amend the request. I am here simply \nto ask for the unanimous consent as I presented it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from Texas coming \nhere, engaging, and I appreciate the fact that he is making a point. \nBut I am trying to make a point which I think is very compelling. \nWithin a few days--December 28--1.3 million Americans will lose their \nextended Federal unemployment insurance benefits. It will be a \ntremendous trauma to those families, and it will be a huge impact for \nour economy going forward.\n  I have renewed my request for a full 1-year extension, and it has \nbeen objected to. I recognize that. But, I believe it is urgent we \nextend unemployment insurance benefits.\n  I also have been working closely with my Republican colleague, \nSenator Heller, on a bipartisan basis to introduce a bill to extend \nthese benefits for 3 months, giving us the opportunity to go and take a \nmore deliberate and careful review of the program and also to provide \nfor a mechanism to extend the benefits for a full year.\n  I am very pleased we are beginning to build bipartisan support for \nthis initiative for at least 3 months. It does reflect the fact that my \ncolleagues from all across the country are recognizing the huge impact \nof this loss of benefits. This is not a problem that is restricted to a \nparticular area of the country. Nevada has the highest rate in terms of \nunemployment numbers. Rhode Island trails behind, but not by much. We \nare at over 9 percent. But you have States with high unemployment \nthroughout the country: Michigan at 9 percent, Illinois at 8.9 percent, \nKentucky at 8.4 percent, Georgia at 8.1 percent, Arizona at 8.2 \npercent. These are States that have significant issues with respect to \nunemployment and need the continuation of this program to protect their \nfamilies and also to provide stimulus for their local economies.\n  We have at this point in many of these places two unemployed workers \nfor every available job. So this is not just a question of: ``The jobs \nare there. Just go get it.'' The job is not there. Also, we recognize--\nI think we all recognize--the skill sets that are increasingly in \ndemand are some of the skill sets that mature workers--people who have \nbeen working for 20 years, who have been every day of their lives going \nto the office or going to the mill or going to the plant are now \ncompeting with 20-year-olds who have sophisticated information \ntechnology skills and other skills in a climate where manufacturing is \nbecoming sophisticated. Every sort of enterprise seems to be much more \nsophisticated and demanding a higher level of skills than years ago. So \nthis is a very difficult time for workers out of a job, and I believe \nin this difficult period of time we need to extend these benefits.\n  There is extensive research on unemployment insurance and the labor \nmarkets that also supports the point that people who are on \nunemployment insurance want to go back to work. This is a very sort of \npragmatic insight. In Rhode Island, for example, the average benefit is \n$354 a week. For most workers, that is a fraction of what they were \ngaining in their job. They would love to be called back to work. They \nwould love to find a job that fits their skills that is close to the \npay they had or maybe less. But no one is getting this help and socking \naway a lot of money on their UI benefits.\n  Indeed, a recent report by the White House Council of Economic \nAdvisers looks at the economic tradeoffs that are being faced. In their \nwords:\n\n       In choosing the optimal unemployment insurance policy, \n     policymakers must weigh competing costs and benefits. On the \n     one hand, some argue that extending benefits may dull the \n     incentives for unemployed workers to exert effort to search \n     for another job, leading to increased unemployment--the so-\n     called ``moral hazard'' effect. But on the other hand, \n     providing benefits gives families income that can in the \n     limit keep them from poverty but more generally can help them \n     to finance a longer job search that might ultimately result \n     in a job better matched with their talents, resulting in \n     higher overall labor market productivity. . . .\n\n  These are important aspects that have to be considered. I think the \nconsensus of many in Congress is that this program is not only \nnecessary and essential, but it also does not significantly inhibit the \nwillingness, the ability, the desire of people to get back to work.\n  Raj Chetty is a noted economist who studies these issues. He \nconcludes:\n\n       Nearly a dozen economic studies have analyzed this question \n     by comparing unemployment rates in states that have extended \n     unemployment benefits with those in states that do not . . . \n     . These studies have uniformly found that a 10-week extension \n     in unemployment benefits raises the average amount of time \n     people spend out of work by\n\n[[Page S8939]]\n\n     at most one week. This simple, unassailable finding implies \n     that policy makers can extend unemployment benefits to \n     provide assistance to those out of work without substantially \n     increasing unemployment rates.\n\n  That is the conclusion of a very well respected economist who has \nbeen looking at that issue for several years.\n  Once again, from the Council of Economic Advisers' report:\n\n       Finally, while economists have found only small \n     disincentive effects of UI extensions, recent research shows \n     that the effect of UI on job search behavior is even smaller \n     in recessions as the moral hazard effect shrinks when jobs \n     are scarce.\n\n  Let's get back to common sense. There are roughly two workers for \nevery job. The benefits UI beneficiaries receive are a fraction of what \nthey would get in the workplace. They want to get back into the \nworkplace. The jobs are just not there. Frankly, we have not done \nenough, I would suggest, to put those jobs in place. We have to do \nmore. But in the interim, we have to make sure these families have some \nbenefits and some protection.\n  I am quite willing to work with my colleagues if there are changes \nthat should be made, could be made. But we are facing this deadline. \nUnless we move--and I am disappointed we have not moved today--1.3 \nmillion people on December 28 lose their benefits. The checks will \ncease going out the following week, and our economy will take a hit \nnext year of 200,000 jobs, about a 0.2-percent growth shrinkage in GDP. \nWe can avoid that by moving today or moving tomorrow, certainly moving \nas soon as we get back, to make sure these benefits are in place.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, yesterday I came to the Senate floor to \ndiscuss two amendments I had filed to the budget agreement that would \nhave addressed an egregious part of this agreement, which is the cuts \nto military retiree benefits. In particular, I think the most egregious \npart of it is to those who have been disabled. We have all been to \nWalter Reed and seen and met our brave heroes, some who have lost \nlimbs, serving our country in Afghanistan and Iraq. Yet in this \nagreement we are cutting their cost-of-living increases for the \nretirement they earned on behalf of our country.\n  So yesterday I came to the floor to talk about what I think is an \nappalling part of this budget agreement, but also to say, Why can't we \namend the budget agreement and fix this now?\n  I offered two possibilities of how we could do that with two \namendments I filed on this budget agreement. I am sure others could \nfind in the trillions of dollars CBO has said we are going to spend \nover the next 10 years--$47 trillion--we can find $6 billion rather \nthan taking it from our military retirees.\n  What happened yesterday on the floor was there was a motion to take \ndown the tree so we could actually amend this budget agreement and fix \nprovisions such as that, and it was voted down. So now we have no \nability to amend this budget agreement, so I cannot bring the \namendments I talked about yesterday to help our military retirees and \nensure they do not get singled out in this agreement, which I think is \nappalling and wrong.\n  But I also cannot bring an amendment that I also filed that addresses \nan issue that is very important to the State of New Hampshire. That \ndeals with an objection I have to a particular provision in the budget \nagreement that would make it easier for the Senate to pass legislation \nrequiring online retailers to become the tax collectors for the States \nand the rest of the Nation--this so-called Marketplace Fairness Act \nthat the Senate passed earlier this year.\n  Within this budget agreement there is what is called a reserve fund \nthat allows the chairman of the Budget Committee to bypass certain \nprocedural limitations that are normally allowed and procedural \nobjections you have and all Members have to these types of \nlegislation--budgetary objections--and these procedural objections are \nwaived when these types of reserve funds are passed.\n  This provision, which I fought on the Senate floor on the Senate's \nbudget--it did eventually get passed--is included in this agreement, \neven though since this body passed the Marketplace Fairness Act, the \nHouse has refused to take it up. The House has wisely found that there \nare major objections to this piece of legislation, which would require \nbusinesses--many of these businesses around the country that we see \nthriving on the Internet--to become the tax collectors for the rest of \nthe Nation.\n  In fact, my State of New Hampshire does not have a sales tax. What it \nwould require is that businesses in New Hampshire--online businesses \nthat have written to me--it would place tremendous burdens on them. \nThey would have to become the tax collectors for nearly 10,000 tax \njurisdictions in this country, trampling on New Hampshire's choice not \nto have a sales tax, and also putting a tremendous burden on businesses \nto do the jobs of the States in becoming tax collectors for the rest of \nthe Nation.\n  This legislation is bad for the economy, and I think it is bad for \nbusinesses, and particularly businesses in my home State of New \nHampshire. So I object to the provision, the reserve fund, that is in \nthis budget. I have filed an amendment that would strike that \nprovision. But, again, no amendments are going to be heard on this \nbudget agreement because the majority leader has filled the tree and \nsaid there will be no amendments heard, no matter the merits of the \namendment, no matter how important the amendments are, including \namendments I talked about that impact and help address the real \negregious provision that impacts our military retirees.\n  This is just another example of an issue that is very important to \nthe State of New Hampshire. Were I allowed to bring my amendment \nforward, I would have again expressed my opposition to this reserve \nfund that is within this budget, that is objectionable, that makes it \neasier to pass future legislation, a future version of the Marketplace \nFairness Act, that will put a tremendous burden on businesses in New \nHampshire. It is wrong to have online businesses become the tax \ncollectors for the Nation.\n  I believe we should be allowed to amend this budget agreement, to \nvote on these amendments, and particularly on issues that are important \nto our men and women in uniform, as I have described. But not only \nthat, this issue on the remote collection of sales taxes by online \nbusinesses throughout the country is a very important issue to the \nState of New Hampshire--which does not have a sales tax--but not just \nto the State of New Hampshire, to online businesses across the country \nthat do not and should not have to be the tax collectors for States \nthroughout the Nation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I wanted to talk about some solutions to \nour health care problems that have been out there for a while. Every \ntime I hear someone say: There were no alternatives to the Affordable \nCare Act, there were no alternatives to what the President wanted to \ndo--in fact, I heard the President say that multiple times last week, \nthough it might have been multiple reportings of him saying it the same \ntime. But there is no question he said it, that there were no ideas out \nthere except his ideas.\n  That is just not accurate. We had and still have the best health care \nsystem in the world. But it was not perfect. It does not mean it could \nnot have been improved. It does not mean there were not ways to create \ngreater access. For those of us who have held concerns from the very \nfirst about the proposals we are now seeing play out in front of \nAmerican families and before the American people, before individuals \nwho thought they could get insurance but did not, before individuals \nwho had insurance that worked who are beginning to lose it--when we see \nthat play\n\n[[Page S8940]]\n\nout and hear: Well, this was the only idea out there--not the only idea \nat all.\n  At the time I was in the House of Representatives and proposed these \nto the House. They were not just bills we filed and did not talk about. \nIn fact, a lot of this was covered very widely, even on occasion we had \nto have Republican-only hearings because the other side did not want to \ntalk about these issues. They just wanted to talk about one way to \nsolve these problems that I think is more and more clear may not be \nsolving the problems nearly as well as they would have hoped for.\n  There are a number of proposals that could have created more access \nto the good health care system we had, solved problems that individuals \nhad. Bills that I introduced, that I was either the principal sponsor \nor the cosponsor of, one of those would have been to allow small \nbusinesses to band together in either what you want to call small \nbusiness health plans or association health plans where people who had \na common purpose could come together and figure out--actually in our \nState we allowed people to do it, the State of Missouri, to have those \nassociated health plans, so your small group of 5 or 10 or 15 people \ndid not become the universe of the group you were trying to insure, but \nyou would have true access to small business health plans.\n  I will be truthful. The insurance companies, for whatever reason, \nnever liked that idea very well. But association health plans or small \nbusiness health plans were one of the things--in fact, I cosponsored \nthat bill with Congressman Sam Johnson, H. Res. 2607, if anybody wants \nto look back and see just how much we talked about this issue and how \nwe dealt with it.\n  Another issue every time the President's health care plan comes up: \nWhat about coverage for young adults? I was the only person in the \nHouse, as I recall--and I have said this a number of times and have \nnever been challenged--who actually filed a bill that said: Let's let \npeople stay on their family insurance policies longer.\n  There are those out there since who have said: That expanded that too \nmuch. It was a slacker provision. It was not anything like that. It was \nan effort to take the most uninsured group in America--young, healthy \npeople--and let them stay on their parents' health care.\n  It was an effort to get--I think the number we talked about was \naround 3 million--people access to policies they did not have access to \nat some level. In virtually every State, you could stay on your family \npolicy until you were 21. In Missouri, I think the number was 23. The \nproposal I made was let's add 2 years to that and do it for the whole \ncountry. Let's say 25.\n  The President said in the Affordable Care Act, 26. I do not think I \nwould have had a big fight about whether my bill that said let's let \npeople be insured on their family policy until they are 25--if it was \nexpanded to 26, I do not think that makes that uniquely the President's \nidea. That was a bill I sponsored. It would have helped young workers, \ncollege students. These are young healthy people, generally.\n  It would not have added much. I think it is not adding much to \ninsurance costs for families or those who are otherwise insured. The \nidea that somehow we could not do that--every time this topic comes up, \nthere is somebody who will jump up and say: Do you mean you want to \ntake people who are now on their family policy and who are under 26 and \ntake them off the family policy?\n  All we had to do to prevent that is pass one piece of legislation \nthat may have been 40 words long--may have been 40 words long, may have \nbeen a couple of pages long. I know of all the ideas I introduced, the \nbiggest one was 75 pages long. It was not a 2,700-page health care \nbill. The biggest of all the bills I introduced was 75 pages long. We \ncould have done one or we could have done all of them. They would have \nworked. Some of these are on this chart right here: encourage wellness \nprograms, reform coverage for preexisting conditions. We had high-risk \npools that were working. There was a way to expand those high-risk \npools so they would work better. We proposed that in legislation.\n\n  I was on the floor the other day and talked about a young man in \nMissouri who is 20 now who has had an illness since he was 18 months \nold. He gets fluid on his brain. He had his first surgery at 18 months. \nHe went from his family policy to the high-risk pool, which worked \npretty well for him for a number of years and is working right now. But \non December 31 the high-risk pool goes away. He cannot get access to \nthe doctors he has used his entire life on any policy available to him. \nSo we have eliminated the policy he had that was serving him well and \nthe physicians group he had his entire life. We have eliminated that by \neliminating the high-risk pool.\n  Is that an improvement? Absolutely not. Could the high-risk pools \nhave been expanded? Were there ways to do that? There absolutely were. \nThose were proposed.\n  Medical liability reform was one of the things we could have done and \nproposed. In fact, even in the last Congress, I introduced in the \nSenate the Help Efficient, Accessible, Low-cost, Timely Healthcare Act, \nS. 1099. But that is very much like legislation that was available and \ncould have become part of health care reform in 2009.\n  The safety net to be sure that emergency room physicians have \nparticular protections on liability because they do not have any choice \nbut to treat people, that is another bill I introduced this year that \nwas very much in line with what we were talking about just a few years \nago.\n  Insurance flexibility. In the 111th Congress I cosponsored H.R. 3824, \nthe Expanded Health Insurance Options Act, which allowed people to buy \nacross State lines through regional compacts, allowed States, if they \nwanted, to form compacts they could be part of that again would have \nbeen part of this solution.\n  Reform coverage for preexisting conditions. Encourage wellness \nprograms. This is something that could make a big difference and is \nsomething we could have thought of ways and did think of ways to \nencourage. H. Res. 4038, the Common Sense Health Care Reform and \nAffordability Act that Representative Camp and I introduced would have \nachieved this goal of looking for new and better ways to encourage \nwellness programs.\n  I am not done yet. But I will say, every time the President or \nanybody else steps up and says there were no other ideas, that is not \ntrue. There were other ideas that I believed then and believe now would \nwork better. Every day, as the Affordable Care Act becomes more and \nmore available to us, I am more and more convinced there were better \nsolutions. I am absolutely offended by this constant discussion that \nthere were no other ideas.\n  Prevent rescissions. We talked about legislation at the time that \nwould have prevented canceling policies or prevented setting caps after \nsomebody got sick. It does not take an entire government overwhelming \nthe insurance marketplace to say here are two things you cannot do.\n  The Common Sense Health Care Reform and Accountability Act would have \nhelped achieve that goal--prevent limits on coverage, encourage health \nsavings accounts, encourage people to have a little of their money that \nis available to them to use for health care expenses. I tell you what I \nam seeing happen now. So many people are now looking at policies that \nhave these huge deductibles. For most families, it is like not having a \npolicy at all.\n  If someone has a policy similar to the one I was talking about on the \nfloor the other day, reporting about a Missouri family where they were \npaying $1,100 a month for insurance and they had a $12,000 deductible, \nis that truly insurance? For most families is that truly insurance, \n$24,000 out of their pocket before their insurance paid anything?\n  But it meets all of the better coverage supposedly that the President \nsays we now have. It met all of those standards. It could be made \navailable. But it had deductibility--as many of these policies do. We \nare going to find all of this out quickly.\n  The only thing worse than the Web site not working may be the Web \nsite working. Because when the Web site begins to work, people are \ngoing to have the facts. There is no reason to argue about the facts. \nThe President continues to say people are going to have better coverage \nfor less money. We are going to know in the next 90 days or so how true \nthat is.\n  I am sure some people are going to find better coverage for less \nmoney. I\n\n[[Page S8941]]\n\nam equally sure most people are not going to find that.\n  So health savings accounts; increased transparency--this is an idea \nwhich is actually in the bill, but they haven't pursued it, where you \ntell health care providers they have to give more information about \nwhat they charge and what their results are. This act passed 3\\1/2\\ \nyears ago, almost 4 years ago, and it says in the law that they can \nrequire providers to do that, but nobody has passed that rule or \nregulation yet. This is something that would have helped.\n  Most of the time, you go to the hospital, particularly if it is \nsomething you have scheduled, you are in the car on the way to the \nhospital, and knowing who gets the better results--or who gets the same \nresults for the lower price would be very helpful information for most \nAmericans and most American families to have.\n  Reform tax treatment. This was another idea we talked about widely. \nIf you buy your insurance on your own or you get your insurance at \nwork, there needs to be equity in that tax treatment; whether you cap \nwhat you can get at work and allow that same tax credit if you buy it \nas an individual--there are lots of ways to do this.\n  The point is that there were lots of ideas out there. I am persuaded \nthat these ideas right here, which would have cost taxpayers virtually \nnothing, would have had minimal impact on the cost of insurance but \nwould have had a lot of impact on a bigger marketplace, more choices, \nnot fewer choices, and would have been a better way to go.\n  There were ideas. At some point we may very well need to return to \nthese ideas because at some point we may decide the course we are on is \nunworkable.\n  Americans shouldn't look at that and think we have to go back to the \nold system unimproved. There are plenty of ways to improve access to \nthe best health care in the world. Diminishing that health care system \nis not one of those ways.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Missouri for his comments. Sometimes \nI think Republican Senators especially should begin and end every \nspeech with an answer to the question, What would the Senator do if he \nwere in charge? And the Senator from Missouri has said that very \neloquently. It is not the first time what Republicans would do has been \nsaid on this floor. He mentioned that the law was passed 3\\1/2\\ years \nago. We counted it one time. We mentioned 173 times on this floor the \nRepublican step-by-step proposal for a different approach to health \ncare in this country.\n  We said: Don't expect Senator McConnell or any other Republican to \ncome in with a 3,000-page Republican bill in a wheelbarrow. We don't \nbelieve in that. We believe in a different direction, a different \napproach. We don't believe we are wise enough in Washington to write \n3,000 pages of rules to govern every aspect of our health care system \nin America that takes 18 or 19 percent of the economy.\n  We live in the iPhone age, where we want to increase the personal \nfreedom of Americans to live longer, better, safer, and healthier. We \nwant people to be able to do these things for themselves. We want to \nincrease choice, competition, and in that way lower costs. If we lower \ncosts, then more people will be able to afford to buy health insurance. \nThat is the real way to expand health insurance in America--make it \nmore affordable; make it so people can afford it.\n  So I am beginning these short remarks with a salute to the Senator \nfrom Missouri for talking about what we would do if we were in charge, \nand I am going to end in that way as well.\n  For the last couple of months, we have heard countless stories from \nconstituents who are losing the health plans they purchased on the \nindividual market.\n  According to America's Health Insurance Plans, there are 19 million \nAmericans in the individual market. The Obama administration knew in \n2010 that the rules it wrote for health plans would mean that 47 to 60 \npercent of those policies could not be legally offered under ObamaCare \nby 2014. Nevertheless, the President still said, ``If you like your \nhealth insurance, you can keep it.''\n  Now we all know that wasn't true. According to news reports collected \nby my staff, at least 5 million Americans, including 82,000 \nTennesseans, will lose their individual plans starting January 1. That \nis an unwelcome Christmas present for those 82,000 Tennesseans. 16,000 \nTennesseans are losing their Cover Tennessee plans; these are people \nwho especially need help. There are also 66,000 Tennesseans who will \nlose their Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee coverage.\n  I heard from a woman named Emilie, who is from Middle Tennessee. She \nis 39 years of age and has lupus.\n  She wrote:\n\n       I cannot keep my current plan because it doesn't meet the \n     standards of coverage. This alone is a travesty. CoverTN has \n     been a lifeline. . . . With the discontinuation of CoverTN, I \n     am being forced to purchase a plan through the Exchange. . . \n     . My insurance premiums alone will increase a staggering 410 \n     percent. My out-of-pocket expense will increase by more than \n     $6,000 a year--that includes subsidies. Please help me \n     understand how this is ``affordable.''\n\n  Unfortunately, Emilie is not the only one experiencing rate shock. \nMillions of Americans are losing their insurance plans. They are being \nforced to buy new plans, many of them with higher premiums, \ndeductibles, and coinsurance.\n  According to data from the Department of Health and Human Services, \nTennesseans can expect to pay up to three times more on the exchanges \nbeing set up under ObamaCare for the health insurance they now have.\n  In 2013, a 27-year-old man in Memphis can buy a private insurance \nplan for as low as $41 a month. On the exchange, the lowest State \naverage is $119 a month--a 190-percent increase.\n  Today, a 27-year-old woman in Nashville can buy a plan for as low as \n$58 a month. On the exchange, the lowest priced plan in Nashville is \n$114 a month--a 97-percent increase. Even with a tax subsidy, if she \nmade $25,000 a year, the plan would be $104 a month--almost twice what \nshe could pay today if the $58 plan was all she felt she needed.\n  Today, women in Nashville can choose from 30 insurance plans that \ncost less than the administration says insurance plans on the exchange \nwill cost, even with the new tax subsidy.\n  In Nashville, 105 insurance plans offered today will not be available \nin the exchange.\n  According to HealthPocket Inc., a consumer-oriented health research \nfirm, the average individual deductible for a bronze plan on the \nfederally-run exchange is $5,081 a year. That is 42 percent more than \nthe average deductible of $3,500 for an individually purchased plan in \n2013. According to Deloitte, that is 348 percent more than the $1,135 \naverage deductible for an employer health plan in 2013.\n  These are a lot of numbers, but Americans--millions of them--are \ngetting familiar with these numbers because this has gone from being \npolitical to very personal.\n  According to Avalere Health, 90 percent of bronze plans require \npatients to pay 40 percent of the cost of their tier 3 and 4 drugs out \nof their own pockets, compared with 29 percent of employer-sponsored \nplans that most Americans currently use. Most silver plans also require \npatients to pay 40 percent. For cancer patients and those with chronic \nillnesses, this kind of cost sharing could mean they will pay thousands \nof dollars out-of-pocket or go without the drugs they need to stay \nhealthy.\n  Americans had to wait until the exchanges opened on October 1 to find \nout just how much they were going to have to pay for insurance in 2014. \nWith such dramatic hikes in premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, it is \nno wonder that Americans are outraged.\n  Then, just before Thanksgiving, we learned that the Obama \nadministration is delaying open enrollment for 2015 until after the \nmidterm elections in November. The only American consumers this change \nwill help are Democratic politicians who voted for ObamaCare because it \nwould delay disclosure of some of the law's most insidious effects \nuntil after the election.\n  Senators Barrasso, Enzi, and I introduced today the Premium \nDisclosure Act. We want to change the open enrollment date back to \nOctober and provide Americans notice of their premiums and cost-sharing \nrequirements\n\n[[Page S8942]]\n\n30 days in advance so that they can plan for the future knowing their \nhealth care costs for the next year. This is a commonsense proposal \nthat I hope my colleagues will support.\n  As my colleague Senator Barrasso likes to say, what we know now about \nObamaCare is just the tip of the iceberg. Much of the media attention \nhas focused on the disastrous rollout of the Web site and the 19 \nmillion Americans in the individual market. But just below the tip of \nthe iceberg are 160 million Americans--nearly 10 times more than have \nindividual policies--who the Congressional Budget Office says get their \ninsurance through the job, employer insurance.\n  Think about issues such as restrictive grandfathered plan rules, \nlimits on the number of hours employees can work and be considered part \ntime, the mandate that employers provide government-approved insurance \nor pay a fine, and the millions of dollars in new taxes on health \nplans. All of these issues will have an impact on employer-sponsored \nhealth insurance in both the public and private sector. We are already \nseeing that. Employers such as Sea World, Trader Joe's, The Home Depot, \nand other companies have publicly said they are reducing worker hours \nor dropping part-time employee health benefits. The chief executive \nofficer of Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant company, told me that the cost to \nimplement ObamaCare would be equal to the profit his company earned all \nof last year.\n  In case you think these are isolated examples, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers says that more than three-fourths of \nmanufacturers cited rising health care and insurance costs as the most \nimportant business challenge. The U.S. Chamber also has a membership \nsurvey saying that 74 percent of businesses are reporting that the \nhealth care law makes it harder for their firms to hire new workers. \nThis is at a time when jobs are supposed to be the principal concern in \nour country.\n  Many of these businesses self-insure, meaning they design and pay \ndirectly for the health plans they offer their employees. According to \nthe Kaiser Family Foundation, more than 100 million Americans currently \nhave employer-sponsored health plans that are self-insured.\n  Self-insurance is a method of providing health insurance that has \nworked well since its inception in 1974. It needs to be preserved. Last \nmonth Senators Rubio, Risch, McConnell, and I introduced a bill to make \nsure the Obama administration doesn't change that, doesn't change the \nrule that allows the companies to insure themselves against a medical \nclaim that could bankrupt them. Any effort by the Obama administration \nto change the rule on companies that self-insure will break the \nPresident's promise to millions of Americans. It won't matter if they \nlike their employers' health plans; they won't be able to keep them.\n  It is not only the private sector facing fiscal challenges because of \nObamaCare. Our Nation's schools, colleges, and universities are also \nbeing hit hard. There is no shortage of examples in my State of \nTennessee of local leaders dealing with the burdens of ObamaCare.\n  The Franklin Special School District has begun limiting substitute \nteachers to working 4 days a week in order to avoid paying between $1 \nmillion and $4.5 million more per year in health care costs.\n  Maury County Schools, south of Nashville, is also limiting its \nsubstitute teachers to no more than 28 hours a week for the same \nreason. One school board member told the local news:\n\n       Students struggle enough having one substitute teacher, but \n     then now we're going to have to possibly split the substitute \n     time between two substitute teachers. It just makes it hard \n     on the students to learn.\n\n  Wilson County Board of Education wrote to tell me that ObamaCare's \nreinsurance fee will cost the district an additional $165,000 in 2014 \nalone.\n  At least eight other Tennessee school districts are reportedly \nlimiting employee work hours or entire jobs, including Clarksville, \nRutherford County, Johnson City, Carter County, Washington County, \nOneida Special School District, Scott County, and Stewart County.\n  Cumberland University in Lebanon has adopted a new policy to limit \nadjunct faculty to no more than three courses each term, meaning they \nwon't be able to offer a course even if they are the most qualified \ninstructor available.\n  The impact of ObamaCare on education is by no means limited to \nTennessee. Investor's Business Daily has identified well over 100 \nschool districts and institutions of higher education nationwide that \nhave made cuts or limited employee work hours because of ObamaCare. \nThat number is climbing daily, again suggesting this is only the tip of \nthe iceberg.\n  Remember, what we are hearing about today are individual policies. \nWhat we are going to hear about next year are employer policies being \ncancelled, new costs, and there are 10 times as many Americans with \nemployer policies as individual policies. Who pays the price for this? \nOur children. Cash-strapped schools simply don't have the money to \nabsorb these costs, so they are forced to make difficult choices.\n\n  For these reasons--broken promises, higher costs, fewer choices--\nObamaCare was an historic mistake. It expanded a health care delivery \nsystem that already costs too much and left Americans with fewer \nchoices.\n  I said at the beginning of my remarks that I would like to end in the \nsame way, and I will do that with an answer to this question: What \nwould we do if we were in charge? What if we elected a Republican \nSenate and even a Republican President in 2016? We would replace \nObamaCare, not by moving backward, but by moving in a different \ndirection.\n  Remember, ObamaCare's real problem was it expanded a delivery system \nthat already costs too much. What we would do instead is go step by \nstep to introduce new ways to increase choices, to have more \ncompetition and to lower costs. We would make Medicare solvent, so \nseniors can depend on it. We would give Governors more flexibility with \nMedicaid so they can create programs with lower costs. We would repeal \nthe ObamaCare wellness regulation--the Senator from Missouri talked \nabout that--and replace it with one that makes it easier, not harder, \nfor employers to give employees lower health insurance costs if they \nlive a healthy lifestyle. We would let small businesses pool their \nresources and offer low-cost insurance plans for their employees. The \nCongressional Budget Office says that Senator Enzi's bill would allow \ncoverage for 750,000 more Americans at a lower cost if we did that. We \nwould allow families to purchase insurance across State lines. If there \nis a policy regulated by Kentucky that fits my needs, and I want to buy \nit, why shouldn't I be able to do it if I can afford it? We will expand \nhealth savings accounts. We would incentivize the growth of private \nhealth insurance exchanges. That is beginning to develop all across our \ncountry, giving more choices to employees. We would make it easier for \npatients to compare prices and quality of doctors and medical services. \nWe would incentivize States to reform junk lawsuits. Those are the \nsteps in the right direction where we would like to go.\n  When Irving Kristol died not long ago, James Q. Wilson wrote a \ntribute in The Wall Street Journal which struck me. He said when they \nbegan their association as neoconservatives--they were mostly \nDemocrats--he said we were policy skeptics. He said that was mainly \nwhat our common view was. By that, I think he must have meant they did \nnot believe Washington could, through a comprehensive piece of \nlegislation, fix our whole health care system; that what Washington \nshould do, particularly in this iPhone age, is to go step by step in a \ndirection that gives more personal freedom to consumers, to Americans, \nso they can live longer, live healthier, live safer, and be happier.\n  That is what we would like to do. That is how we would like to change \nObamaCare, and we would like to have that opportunity.\n  So unfortunately, an unwelcome Christmas present this year for 82,000 \nTennesseans is that they are losing their individual policies. Even \nmore unfortunately, an unhappy New Year is coming, in which hundreds of \nthousands of Tennesseans will lose their employer policies--the \npolicies they get through their employers--because of ObamaCare. We are \nready to go in a\n\n[[Page S8943]]\n\ndifferent direction and create a way for Americans to have more \nchoices, more competition, and insurance they can purchase at a lower \ncost.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first of all I want to commend my friend, \nthe Senator from Tennessee. There is no one in this body who is more \nthoughtful, works harder on issues, and has shown more willingness to \nfind common ground on a host of issues.\n  I also want to compliment the earlier speaker, the Senator from \nMissouri, who laid out a series of items that should be components of \nany kind of health care reform.\n  As somebody who is a former Governor, as is the Senator from \nTennessee, I have managed a Medicaid program. As somebody who has been \na private sector employer and managed private health insurance plans, I \nknow this is a conundrum that has to be solved.\n  What I don't hear sometimes is folks recognizing the status quo was \nleading this country down a path that was unsustainable, and I look \nforward to working with the Senator from Tennessee, the Senator from \nMissouri and others to see how we can go about fixing the challenges in \nObamaCare. I remember when I voted for what I called a very imperfect \npiece of legislation, but recognized the status quo was not a place \nthat could be maintained.\n  There are a couple of points I want to make, although I am here to \ntalk about the budget. When we talk about the very attractive \ncomponents of not discriminating against folks with preexisting \nconditions--and I say that as somebody who has a daughter with a major \npreexisting condition--and when we talk about preventive care and other \nitems that are the ``nice to have'' or ``we like'' components, those of \nus who have wrestled with health care--and I started the Virginia \nHealth Care Foundation 20 years ago--realize that when you push on one \nend of health care it pops out someplace else. It would be great to be \nable to do this in segmented parts, but I believe to get the kind of \nreform that was necessary you have to make a more extensive program.\n  As someone who stands here speaking from an IT standpoint, let us \nacknowledge the unprecedented disaster of the rollout of the Web site. \nBut what I don't hear from my colleagues is that beneath all these \nchallenges there are positive points. Look at the rise of health care \ncosts on a macro basis, back 3 years past, when Simpson-Bowles and \nthose of us involved in the budget--which is what I am here to talk \nabout--were engaged in this issue. You look at the decrease in the \namount of health care cost increase. If you look at the slope's \ndecline, it is hundreds of billions of dollars of savings in the \nprojected CBO cost of Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Look at one of the areas that was of enormous concern, one of the \nbroken parts of our health care system--hospital readmission rates. \nThose rates have dropped dramatically.\n  I hear the stories of folks who are upset with the implementation of \nObamaCare, but I also hear the stories of folks who have never had \nhealth care and who are finding it now at rates that are more \naffordable than in the past or in the past they didn't even have an \noption of getting health care. This is going to require fixes.\n  Let me comment on one of the areas most talked about--this notion of \nthe President saying if you want to keep your health care policy, you \ncan keep it. What this Senator has tried to do, as we move past the \nrhetoric into how we actually try to fix this, I have worked with our \nState insurance commissioner to take advantage of the opportunity for \nplans within the Commonwealth of Virginia to extend their coverage for \nat least 1 additional year, and we are starting to see some progress--\nnot as much as I would like but some progress.\n  Today, with a group of my colleagues, we have written the \nadministration to suggest that so there is not a gap in coverage, \nparticularly for those folks above the age of 30, because of the \ntransition, who may find themselves faced with higher costs, let's \npresent at least a catastrophic plan under the hardship exemption and \nview that in a broad way. Again, this is so that folks can find, during \nthis transition period, health care that is affordable.\n  As someone who believes we need to ensure the commitment of the \nPresident and others--I have stated it as well--that you can keep your \nhealth care plan, I have joined with Senator Landrieu for a legislative \nfix, if these other items don't go far enough.\n  As other Senators have said, there will be other issues coming up. \nWhen you are going through the reform of 17 to 18 percent of our whole \neconomy that is connected to health care, it is going to take the \nwillingness and good faith of people on both sides of the aisle to \nactually not simply relitigate the direction but to recognize how we \nmove on from here, and I would welcome any colleagues who are willing \nto engage in that kind of productive dialogue, discussion, and laying \nout of ideas.\n  But this afternoon, we actually are going to be doing something that, \nin an otherwise fairly bleak year of accomplishments and in a Congress \nthat may set record lows in terms of legislation passed and approval \nratings, will actually end the year with something we should at least \nrecognize as a step forward.\n  I remind my colleagues it was just 2 months ago we were in the midst \nof an unprecedented government shutdown, where millions of Americans \nwere furloughed; where America had furloughed three Nobel prize-winning \nphysicists who work at NASA and who were somehow deemed nonessential; \nwhere private sector folks in the tourism industry--whether in New \nMexico or Virginia--were seeing a dramatic fall-off in tourism because \nof national parks being closed; where we were inflicting upon this \neconomy somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 billion to $40 billion of \nunpredicted economic loss simply because we couldn't get a budget. But \nthis afternoon it is my hope we will at last close that chapter. My \nhope is this afternoon we will vote on a budget agreement for 2 years. \nWhile it is not as grand or as comprehensive as I would have liked, it \nwill perhaps demonstrate to the American people that although we have \nhad to crawl before we could walk, walk before we could run, we have \nput forward a bipartisan compromise.\n\n  A great deal of the credit goes to Chairman Murray and Chairman Ryan. \nThis agreement says for at least the balance of this fiscal year and \nfor the next, we will take off the table the threat of another \nshutdown, of unprecedented furloughs. It says we will not relax our \nfocus on deficit reduction, and we will not add to the debt, but we \nwill actually do a little more--about $20 billion more in deficit \nreduction--and we will demonstrate this institution can actually put \nthe country ahead of partisan interests.\n  In this compromise not everyone got what they wanted. I would have \nargued strongly that the big enchilada remains. How do we really take \non, in a major way, that $17 trillion debt that clicks up about $4 \nbillion a night? That would mean both political parties have to give on \ntheir sacred cows. It means we have to generate additional revenues \nthrough meaningful reform of a completely disastrous Tax Code, and yes, \nit means for folks on my side, we have to make sure the promise of \nMedicare and Social Security and other entitlement programs are here \nnot just for this generation but for 20 and 30 years from now.\n  Some of those challenges will have to be put off for another day, and \nthere are many in this body on both sides of the aisle who may have a \nchance to surprise some folks next year in laying out some specific \nideas on how we can move to that bigger bargain. But we should not \nunderestimate what we do today.\n  I have spent a longer time in business than I have in elective \noffice, and what this country is yearning for, what consumers are \nyearning for, what business leaders are yearning for is just a little \nbit of predictability. We have seen growth rates go up higher than \nestimated. We have seen job growth coming quicker--as monthly revisions \nare made--and going up even higher than we thought. The single best \nthing we can do is to make sure we remove the cloud of further \ndisruption caused by Washington. So what we do today with this small \nstep--but a step we shouldn't underestimate--is to get rid of that \nthreat for the next 2 years.\n\n[[Page S8944]]\n\n  So I look forward to supporting this bipartisan agreement. As I \nmentioned, it rolls back the most draconian parts of sequestration. \nSequestration was set up to be the most stupid option so that no \nrational group of people would ever agree to it. I call it stupidity on \nsteroids. So this budget agreement gets rid of the worst brunt of that \nsequestration and then gives this body and our colleagues in the House \nthe ability to actually fashion a budget for 2 years that will also \nallow them to allocate within these still historically lower numbers.\n  So I will vote for this compromise, but as with any compromise, there \nare particular provisions of this compromise I would not have agreed to \nand that I do not support. One of those provisions is a component that \nunfairly singles out our military families. Our military families over \nthe last decades-plus have fought two wars. They have made \nunprecedented sacrifices. Often they have been the only Americans \nmaking sacrifices through many of the years in the last decades.\n  Virginia is home to the Nation's largest concentration of Active-Duty \nand retired military personnel, and I consider it an honor to represent \nthem here in Congress. The component of the budget compromise that \nsingles out these military retirees for a decrease in their cost-of-\nliving increase was not an appropriate component. But rather than \nsaying let's flush the whole deal down, I will vote for this deal, with \nthe idea in mind--similar to my approach to the health care bill--that \nwe will attack this problem and fix it, and I have a fix I will propose \nto replace this component going forward.\n  I have been joined in this effort by my friend from Virginia, Senator \nKaine, and former Governor Senator Shaheen, to introduce legislation \nwhich would eliminate this close to $6 billion hit on our military \nretirees. Our legislation doesn't add to the debt or deficit but would \nreplace this unfair hit to our military retirees by closing certain \ncorporate tax loopholes, which would generate sufficient revenue to \nmake sure our military families would not be unfairly affected.\n  I know in a grander bargain all things may be on the table, but in \nthis smaller deal we should not be singling out our military families \nand those retirees for this undue burden.\n  I believe and I hope other colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as \nwe get this budget compromise passed, will join in this effort to \nsubstitute out this $6 billion provision for what I believe would be a \nmuch more readily acceptable $6 billion provision in terms of change in \nthe corporate tax law. I know the chairman of the Budget Committee from \nour side of the aisle would welcome this kind of substitution. Her job \nwas to get a deal and she did that job, she got a deal, and I look \nforward to supporting her.\n  I will close with these comments. Virginians have served with honor \nin our military for generations. I assure our service men and women \nthat because of this provision--which doesn't take effect until 2016--\nwe have ample time to make this substitution.\n  We are being joined on the floor by Senator Shaheen, the original \nsponsor of this legislation, and I remain committed to working with \nSenator Shaheen, Senator McCain, and any Member of this body from \neither party, to work on this deficit reduction package, this \nsubstitution, which would relieve this burden.\n  I hope later this afternoon we can build on the overwhelming support \nthis compromise budget measure received in the House, and believe a \nstrong bipartisan vote today--actually, yesterday, when we cleared \ncloture--is an indication it will hopefully get the same kind of vote \ntoday.\n  Regardless, I believe we will pass this budget compromise and we will \nshow this body can work, and American families can go into the holiday \nseason without the potential threat of another government shutdown \nhitting them mid-January.\n  I again thank the chairman of our Budget Committee for the enormous \namount of time she put into this effort. She had lots of folks pushing \nand pulling her from every direction. As someone who still aspires to \nbe part of a grander bargain and a bigger deal, our day will come \nagain; but in the meantime, later this afternoon we will do the \npeople's work and make sure we do our most essential requirement, which \nis to present a budget which is fiscally responsible, takes down our \ndeficit, and allows our government to move forward and our economy to \ngrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the bipartisan, \nbicameral budget agreement that is currently before the Senate.\n  This budget agreement, while far from perfect, will help move our \neconomy forward, create certainty that has been sorely lacking for far \ntoo long, and save some $23 billion over the next decade. It has been 4 \nyears since the House and Senate have reached an agreement on a budget \nthat sets priorities for Federal spending and revenues. While the 2-\nyear budget agreement worked out between Senator Murray and Congressman \nRyan is not what I would have written, it is a step in the right \ndirection. It will prevent Congress from lurching from crisis to \ncrisis, avoid most of the across-the-board, meat-ax cuts known as \nsequestration, and will allow the Appropriations Committee, of which I \nam a member, to do its job of developing bills to responsibly fund the \ngovernment within agreed to limits.\n  Over the last 9 months since sequestration went into effect, I have \nmet with countless Mainers, including shipyard workers, medical \nresearchers, educators, Border Patrol agents, small business owners \naffected by the delayed opening and shutdown of Acadia National Park, \nand nonprofit organizations providing services for the low-income and \nthe elderly. All have shared stories of their personal experiences with \nhow the indiscriminate cuts of sequestration have affected them, their \nfamilies, and those whom they serve. The sequester has had a \ndetrimental impact on Mainers and our country and is not the right \napproach to reducing our enormous debt. The $65 billion in \nsequestration relief provided by this agreement will help mitigate the \neffect on our economy moving forward and allow Congress to prioritize \nthose programs that are most effective over those that are wasteful, \nduplicative, or simply no longer necessary.\n  The agreement will spare the Department of Defense some of the \ndevastating sequestration cuts that Pentagon officials testified could \ncripple military readiness, harm our national security, and affect \nthousands of defense-related jobs that are vital to our economy in \nMaine and in the United States. It also begins to address the harmful \nimpact of indiscriminate cuts made to vital programs such as \ntransportation, education, and biomedical research.\n  It is critical that Congress continue to work to bring spending under \ncontrol. Our national debt now stands at an almost incomprehensible \n$17.2 trillion. This sum, along with rising interest payments, is our \nlegacy to future generations and simply must be responsibly addressed. \nThis agreement will save $23 billion over the next 10 years and help \nprevent government shutdowns over the next 2 years.\n  I am, however, deeply disappointed that this agreement includes a \nreduction in the annual cost of living increase for some current \nmilitary retirees. We must honor the service and sacrifice of the brave \nmen and women who served our country so that they can continue to have \naccess to the benefits they worked so hard to earn and that were \npromised to them. The significant changes to military retirement \nincluded in this budget single out current retirees and change the \nrules for them, and that is not fair.\n  In 2012, I was a member of the Armed Services Committee when we \ncreated the Military Retirement and Compensation Modernization \nCommission with the precise purpose of comprehensively examining this \nissue in a thorough way that protects current retirees and ensures that \nthe military retirement system is offering the right incentives to \nrecruit and retain the most qualified and experienced servicemembers at \na time of budget constraints.\n  I have raised my concerns with my colleagues about the military \nretirement provisions in this agreement and will work to ensure that \nthis issue is addressed before it is set to take effect in January \n2016. The chairman of the Armed Services Committee has already \ncommitted to reviewing this change at the start of next year. I intend \nto do\n\n[[Page S8945]]\n\neverything I can, in conjunction with the leadership of the Armed \nServices Committee, to identify a more reasonable approach to this \nproblem that would provide the same level of savings while protecting \ncurrent retirees.\n  The American people are weary of watching a Congress that can't work. \nWe saw the result of this dysfunction when the government shutdown in \nOctober. That is why I worked so hard to forge a compromise that helped \nget Congress functioning again. We simply must avoid another shutdown \nand put our Nation back on a sound financial footing. In my judgment, \nthis agreement takes the first steps on a responsible path forward.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I would like to join several of my \ncolleagues who have already spoken to clarify the intent of an \nimportant provision in the Bipartisan Budget Act that the Senate is \ncurrently considering.\n  Section 203 of the legislation is intended to prevent criminals from \nusing information in the Death Master File, DMF--a list of recently \ndeceased individuals that includes personal information such as Social \nSecurity numbers--to steal their identities to commit fraud.\n  At the same time, the provision is intended to allow those who must \nuse the DMF for legitimate business or official purposes, such as \npaying life insurance proceeds, preventing fraud, and addressing \nunclaimed property, to continue to have access to the information they \nneed.\n  Under this provision, the Secretary of Commerce is required to \nestablish a program that will restrict public access to an individual's \npersonal information on the DMF for a 3-year period after his or her \ndeath. The Secretary will also determine individuals certified under \nthe program who will maintain access to the Death Master File for \nlegitimate business or fraud prevention interests. These include State \nauthorities, life insurance companies, and other legitimate users.\n  To strike this balance between stopping criminals and allowing \nlegitimate users to perform their responsibilities, the provision \nintends for the Department of Commerce to follow rulemaking procedures \nallowing for sufficient notice and comment from the public and \ninterested parties. The provision is also intended to allow legitimate \ncurrent users of the Death Master File to continue accessing DMF \ninformation until the certification program is established.\n  I understand that Senator Nelson, the original author of this \nprovision, engaged in a colloquy with Chairman Murray and Senator \nCasey, clarifying its intent. I salute Senator Nelson for his \nleadership in crafting a strong and well-targeted response to the \nimportant issue of identity theft.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in comparison to recent battles this \nCongress has fought over the budget, the legislation we consider today \nrepresents progress. Instead of government by crisis and hostage-\ntaking, we have before us an agreement negotiated by the Senator \nMurray, a Democrat, and Congressman Ryan, a Republican, a negotiation \nin which neither side got all that it wanted, but both sides found \nacceptable middle ground. That is not a common event around here these \ndays. Significantly, by reaching agreement, they have offered us a way \nto avoid a potential government shutdown in 2014. And they have \nprovided a way to offer some relief from the damaging impact of \nsequestration.\n  So I will support this agreement. But I will not do so without \nreservation. Despite what it offers, this budget agreement falls short \nof what I believe we need to accomplish in three significant ways.\n  First, while the agreement provides some modest relief, it leaves \nmore than half of the irrational meat-ax cuts of sequestration in place \nover 2 years. As a result, important programs to protect and promote \nnational security, public safety, health, transportation, education, \nand the environment will remain under-funded. A balanced package that \nincluded measures I have recommended to close loopholes that allow \nprofitable corporations to avoid taxes by sending their revenue and \nassets to offshore tax havens would, if passed, do far more to address \nthese problems.\n  Second, this agreement does not include an extension of emergency \nunemployment benefits for 1.3 million people. Those benefits end in \nless than 2 weeks. Failure to extend these benefits would mean more \nthan 43,000 workers in my state of Michigan would lose unemployment \nbenefits at year's end. In the first 6 months of 2014, more than 86,000 \nadditional Michigan workers would also lose benefits if we fail to act. \nThis is both cruel and economically self-defeating. At a time when job \ncreation remains slower than any of us want, and when nationwide there \nare roughly three job seekers for every available job opening, removing \nthe safety net that keeps families from falling into despair is unjust. \nAnd the reduced economic activity that will result will cost thousands \nof jobs, making our economic recovery even slower. The Republican \nrefusal to include extended unemployment benefits in this legislation \nis deeply disappointing. Majority Leader Reid has expressed \ndetermination to take up an unemployment benefit extension bill in \nJanuary. It is essential that we do so.\n  Third, the agreement includes a provision that would reduce cost-of-\nliving adjustments for working-age military retirees. This is a \ntroubling provision because it singles out a group of veterans, and \ntherefore I have decided the Senate Armed Services Committee will \nreview the retirement benefit changes next year, before they take \neffect in 2015. This proposal is yet more evidence of the fact that the \nonly fair solution to the sequestration problem is a balanced, \ncomprehensive deficit-reduction agreement. The major impediment to such \nan agreement has been the inability of some in Congress to accept the \nnecessity of real additional revenue, such as closing tax loopholes \nused by highly profitable corporations to avoid paying taxes by \ntransferring assets and revenue to subsidiaries in offshore tax havens.\n  These shortcomings in the budget legislation before us are \nsignificant, but nonetheless this legislation does offer important \nbenefits. The sequestration relief, though smaller than many of us \nwould like, is significant. Over the course of the last year, the Armed \nServices Committee has repeatedly heard from our senior military and \ncivilian defense leaders that the rigidity and extent of the \nsequestration puts the security of our Nation and the lives of our \ntroops at risk. Sequestration has also shut Head Start classrooms, labs \nresearching cures to life-threatening diseases, and clinics providing \nhealth care to the needy and elderly, among many unwise effects.\n  Again, this legislation offers the only available way out of the \ncycle of crisis that brought us a damaging government shutdown in \nNovember. That shutdown was extraordinarily disturbing to every \nAmerican who expects Government to operate without the constant threat \nof shutting down.\n  So on balance I support this legislation because of the modest \npositive changes it makes from the status quo, and in the hope that \nthis is the first step toward a more comprehensive and more balanced \ndeficit-reduction agreement to replace the rest of sequestration. This \nagreement likely represents as much progress as we realistically can \nmake in the absence of a balanced, comprehensive budget agreement. \nAgain, the major stumbling block that prevents us from reaching such an \nagreement is the reluctance of so many Republicans to consider \nadditional revenue, particularly the substantial revenue available to \nus through closing unjustified tax loopholes. It is essential that we \nspend the coming weeks and months working toward a better, more \nbalanced, fairer, more comprehensive solution.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I support the Murray-Ryan budget \nagreement, even though I disagree with a number of provisions included \nin the bill, because it includes balanced savings to roll back \nsequestration for the next 2 years and help restore much needed \ncertainty to government agencies and our economy.\n  Sequestration is just a fancy word for cuts--mindless cuts. I \nstrongly believe we must end the mindless, across the board cuts from \nsequestration which have significantly reduced funding for a number of \nFederal programs that are critical to Massachusetts families and \nbusinesses.\n  Sequestration has also significantly cut Federal spending on the \nresearch\n\n[[Page S8946]]\n\nwhich has been critical for the development of the Massachusetts \neconomy and will damage our economy in the long-term.\n  Under the Murray-Ryan agreement, sequestration under the Budget \nControl Act would continue. However, the size of sequestration will be \nrolled back and the Appropriations Committee will have the authority to \nmake changes to existing spending rather than be required to impose an \nacross the board cut. The agreement would set overall discretionary \nspending for this year at $1.012 trillion--which is about $46 billion \nless than the Senate budget level and $45 billion above the level set \nin the Budget Control Act. Spending would increase only slightly next \nyear. Unfortunately, this legislation does not eliminate sequestration \nfrom future years, in fact the agreement extends sequestration for 2 \nadditional years (fiscal years 2022-2023).\n  The agreement includes dozens of specific deficit-reduction \nprovisions, with mandatory savings and non-tax revenue totaling \napproximately $85 billion. Those provisions include higher security \nfees for airline passengers, reduced contributions to Federal pensions, \nhigher premiums for Federal insurance for private pensions, and savings \nfrom not completely refilling the strategic petroleum reserve.\n  Finally, the agreement would reduce the deficit by between $20 and \n$23 billion. It also includes a 3 month extension of the Medicare \nSustainable Growth Rate, SGR.\n  It is unfortunate that this agreement fails to include a critical \nextension of unemployment insurance, which is a critical component of \nour ongoing recovery and a lifeline to millions of Americans seeking \nemployment. As a result of objections raised by the minority in the \nSenate, unemployment insurance will terminate just a few days after the \nholiday season ends. This action will cut off support desperately \nneeded by more than 1.3 million Americans including more than 30,000 in \nMassachusetts. The U.S. Department of Labor has found that for every $1 \nof unemployment benefits spent, $2 of economic activity are generated. \nExtending unemployment benefits would increase our Gross National \nProduct by 0.2 percent and create more than 200,000 jobs in 2014 alone. \nThese Americans need our help and deserve our best efforts to resolve \nthis issue before we adjourn for the year.\n  Before the Senate adjourns for the year, I hope that the Senate can \nact on the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act which \nwould reinstate and continue Federal support for unemployment insurance \n(UI), effective January 1, 2014, for an additional 3 months to \ntemporarily prevent the expiration of benefits for 1.3 million \nAmericans. I am a cosponsor of this legislation because it would allow \nall States to continue Federal unemployment insurance without a lapse \nfrom January 1, 2014. The bill would also allow any State whose \nagreement was previously terminated in 2013 to enter into a new \nagreement with the Department of Labor for emergency unemployment \ncompensation.\n  I have heard from a number of veterans from Massachusetts who have \nexpressed their deep concerns about a provision in the budget agreement \nthat would reduce the annual cost of living increase for military \nretirees under the age of 62. I am concerned that this provision could \nhave a serious financial impact on these patriots and their families \nwho fought to protect our freedom. The retirement compensation of \nservicemembers and Federal employees should never be reduced to lower \nour deficit especially while corporate tax loopholes and billions in \nsubsidies for oil companies remain on the books.\n  I am proud to cosponsor the Military Retirement Restoration Act. The \nbill would replace the cuts to military retiree benefits from the \nMurray-Ryan Budget Agreement by preventing companies from avoiding U.S. \ntaxes by abusing tax havens. I am hopeful that the Senate will be able \nto consider this legislation early next year. I also strongly support \nthe review of this provision by Senate Armed Services Committee \nChairman Levin before it takes effect in December 2015. Finally, I \nawait a comprehensive review of the military retirement and \ncompensation systems being conducted by the Military Retirement and \nCompensation Modernization Commission established by Congress which can \nprovide a better solution than the one included in the budget agreement \nfor military retirees.\n  I would also like to speak about another provision of the Bipartisan \nBudget Act: section 203, which limits access to the Social Security \nAdministration's Death Master File, DMF. The DMF is a little-known but \ncritically important piece of our Social Security system. It is the \nauthoritative index of all deaths reported to the Social Security \nAdministration from 1936 to the present, an index that contains over 85 \nmillion records of death. The DMF is therefore the prime tool available \nto formally confirm the death of an American citizen, and a variety of \nenterprises, from life insurers to pension funds, rely on the DMF to \nadminister benefits and premiums.\n  Under section 203 of the Bipartisan Budget Act, access to the DMF \nwill be greatly restricted. From now on, the Department of Commerce \nwill not be allowed to disclose information in the DMF with respect to \na newly deceased person for 3 years except to persons certified under a \nnew program managed by the Commerce Department. Under this new program, \nwhich has yet to be established, certification will be given only to \nthose persons who have either a legitimate business or fraud prevention \ninterest and have processes in place to safeguard the information. The \ngoal of section 203 is laudable--to prevent persons from using the DMF \nto engage in identity theft and fraud. Given the sensitive nature of \nthis information, it is good that steps are being taken to prevent the \nmisuse of this data.\n  Yet, while I support the goal of this section, I am concerned about \nhow it will be implemented. Many insurance companies and pension \nadministrators rely on the DMF to determine when benefits should be \npaid to their beneficiaries. In fact, nine States actually require that \ninsurers access the DMF prior to the payment of benefits. These \ncompanies' access to the DMF is critical to their efforts to serve \nconsumers, and their access cannot be interrupted while the Department \nof Commerce creates its new access certification program. Similarly, \nState Treasurers and Comptrollers, and their authorized personnel, also \nuse the DMF for important purposes and need continued access while the \nregulations are being developed by the Secretary of Commerce.\n  I therefore urge the Department of Commerce to take immediate \nregulatory action to ensure that insurance companies, pension plans, \nand State Treasurers and Comptrollers' access to the DMF is not \ninhibited during the initiation of the certification program and that \nall parties have an opportunity to obtain certification prior to losing \naccess to the DMF. The Department of Commerce should also ensure that \nstakeholders, both in the industry and in the beneficiary communities, \nhave an opportunity to provide input on any rulemakings regarding \neither the certification program or the access restrictions themselves.\n  Earlier this year, I released a report that outlined the damage to \nour economy caused by sequestration and proposed an alternative plan \nthat would produce the $1.2 trillion savings called for in the Budget \nControl Act without imposing the mindless, across-the-board \nsequestration cuts.\n  I strongly believe we can work together on a bipartisan effort to \nreplace these misguided cuts of sequestration with a balanced deficit \nreduction plan that includes a more progressive tax code, targeted cuts \nto defense spending and nuclear weapons, an end to unnecessary oil \nsubsidies, and the expansion of innovative programs in Medicare that \nimprove the quality of healthcare for beneficiaries.\n  At the same time, we must make smart investments now that will create \njobs and continue our country's economic recovery. We can no longer \nafford to make irresponsible across-the-board cuts that hurt middle \nclass families and hurt our still-fragile economy.\n  Our national strategy for job growth must continue to emphasize the \nareas in which Massachusetts excels: an emphasis on education; \ninvestment in our high-tech, medical, and clean energy industries; and \nstrong support for the teachers, firefighters, and police that form the \nbackbone of our communities. This approach has resulted in the Bay \nState consistently having an unemployment rate that is significantly \nlower than the rest of the Nation.\n\n[[Page S8947]]\n\n  I want to work in a bipartisan effort to fix our fiscal problems and \nI believe working together we can reach a bipartisan agreement to fix \nsequestration and maintain our fiscal discipline.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Connecticut \nto address a specific provision in the Bipartisan Budget Act. Overall, \nwhile this deal is flawed, we are heartened to see both sides coming \ntogether to put in place a workable fiscal foundation for the next 2 \nyears. But we want to make sure to clarify what we are intending to do \nwith a particular provision in this bill. Specifically, section 203 of \nthe act institutes new reforms to the Social Security Death Master \nFile, which keeps an authoritative record of deaths in this country. \nThese important reforms include a new certification process that will \nensure only those properly authorized and able to maintain the \ninformation under significant safeguards can access the information on \nthis master file on a current basis, helping prevent identity theft and \nother abuses. Release of the information to all others would be delayed \nby 3 years after an individual's death. We would like to emphasize, \nthough, that this provision was not intended to interrupt in any way \nthe legitimate use of the Death Master File in the interim. I will turn \nto my colleague to explain why we think this is so important and how we \nthink we can avoid this situation.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank my good friend, the senior Senator from \nConnecticut. Our understanding is that many States require insurers to \ncheck their policies against the master list on an ongoing basis in \norder to ensure they have accurate information about deceased \nindividuals whom they insure. Furthermore, State treasurers, State \ncomptrollers, and credit bureaus all use the Death Master File for \nimportant purposes and need continued access. We certainly do not want \nto halt these processes or stand in the way of compliance with State \nlaw. As such, I am pleased to join you in urging the Social Security \nAdministration and the Commerce Department to both work closely with \nkey stakeholders during the transition period and to use the \nflexibility we believe they already possess to ensure uninterrupted \nlegitimate access to the Death Master File. State governments, too, \nshould be flexible throughout this transition as insurers under their \njurisdictions seek to comply with these new Federal provisions.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I echo my colleague's recommendations. Overall, so \nlong as we manage the transition appropriately, my friend and fellow \nSenator from Connecticut and I believe the new system will save \nhundreds of millions of dollars and also protect the identities of \nmillions of Americans.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I will vote in favor of the \nbipartisan budget compromise put forward by Senator Murray and \nCongressman Ryan.\n  I understand some of my colleagues are not happy with this budget \ndeal. If any of them had been able to show me a better alternative that \nhad the votes to pass in both the House and the Senate and prevent a \ngovernment shutdown next month, then I would vote no on the measure \nbefore the Senate. Unfortunately, we did not have a better plan.\n  I share the concerns that many of my colleagues have with the \nprovision that slows the growth of working-aged military retirees. This \nprovision will not take effect until the end of 2015. I am confident \nthat, before then, under the leadership of the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, we will overturn this unfair \nprovision.\n  My support for this budget deal centers primarily on two very \nimportant facts. First, this agreement will prevent another government \nshutdown; we cannot put the American people and the people in my State \nof Arizona through another government shutdown. And, second, the budget \ndeal will go a long way in alleviating the devastating impact of \nsequestration on our military.\n  It is imperative that we do what is necessary to avoid sequestration \nif we are to expect our military to properly defend this Nation and \nprovide for our national security. Defense Secretary Hagel has stated \nhis support for this budget agreement, as have GEN Martin Dempsey, \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Christine Fox, Acting Deputy \nSecretary of Defense, GEN Ray Odierno, Chief of Staff of the Army, and \nGEN Mark Welsh, Chief of Staff of the Air Force.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in what I hope is a sign of things to come, \ntoday, I expect the Senate to pass the Bipartisan Budget Act. The \nresult of the long-awaited budget conference--one that had long been \nrequested by Chairwoman Murray but never agreed to by Senate \nRepublicans--the agreement has found some common ground and reflects a \nshared commitment to work for the American people--something in short \nsupply in Congress these days.\n  The budget deal we are considering today is a true compromise. I \nbelieve it would be difficult to find any Member of Congress who fully \nembraces every aspect of this agreement. In spite of that, there is \nbroad, bipartisan support for the bill, as evidenced by the \noverwhelming bipartisan vote in the House late last week and the \nbipartisan vote by which cloture was invoked here in the Senate. There \nis bipartisan support for the overall goal of ending this manufactured \nbudget stalemate that we currently face.\n  The Bipartisan Budget Act will provide us with the our top-line \nspending levels for the remainder of this fiscal year and next and, \nmost importantly, will prevent the full force of a second round of \nsequestration's indiscriminate and devastating cuts. This is welcome \nnews for nearly every American who has seen how devastating the \nsequester has been for their communities and for those who have \nanxiously awaited a second round of deeper, more painful cuts. With \nagencies facing budgets that just simply could not meet their basic \nobligations to the public and to the Nation's priorities and with their \ncoffers to insulate programs and prevent furloughs and layoffs \nexhausted, allowing the sequester to lengthen and deepen truly would \nhave been debilitating and would have stunted our ongoing economic \nrecovery.\n  While this is not the budget I would have written and while it is \npaid for in a number of ways with which I simply disagree, we are at a \njuncture at which we cannot allow the goal of perfection to bring on \nanother body blow to the Nation and to our economy. One thing I have \nheard clearly from Vermonters is that we must replace the sequester. \nWhile not perfect, this deal will in fact save jobs, reduce unnecessary \nfurloughs, and will not prioritize defense spending at the cost of our \neducation and housing programs as so many other budget proposals have \nin the past.\n  I was proud to support a Senate budget and Senate appropriations \nbills that would fully replace sequestration by closing corporate tax \nloopholes and making responsible cuts. I am disappointed that this deal \ndoes not more closely follow the framework or provide the funding \nlevels supported earlier by the Senate. As a senior member of the \nAppropriations Committee, I welcome the fact that this deal will mean \nthat we will be able to get back to the work of passing annual \nappropriations bills through regular order, ending the practice of \nputting these budget decisions on autopilot through continuing \nresolutions. The annual appropriations process provides us with the \nopportunity to make much needed adjustments to agency priorities and \nbudgets. This budget also allows a return to regular order while \nkeeping the promises we have made to seniors. It protects Social \nSecurity and Medicare benefits from the harmful cuts included in the \nearlier Ryan Budget.\n  But there certainly are areas in which this deal is lacking. I had \nhoped any budget agreement we considered would include an extension of \nunemployment insurance that will end later this month for 1.3 million \nAmericans. It is disappointing that it does not. Unemployment insurance \nis a vital component of our ongoing recovery and a lifeline to millions \nof Americans as they search for work in this challenging economy.\n  I hope the bipartisan spirit that is the basis of this agreement can \ncontinue into the new year, and I hope that when the Senate, early in \nthe new year, considers legislation to restore this lifeline of \nunemployment insurance, Senators and Representatives will support an \nextension.\n  Unfortunately, my disappointment is not reserved only for what was \nnot included in the deal but also for ways\n\n[[Page S8948]]\n\nthis budget pays to replace sequestration.\n  A provision included in this agreement could negatively impact not-\nfor-profit student loan servicers around the country by removing $3.1 \nbillion in mandatory funding and the requirement that the Department of \nEducation work with these organizations service direct Federal loans. \nThe nonprofit Vermont Student Assistance Corporation, VSAC, has been \nservicing Federal loans and chalking up high borrower satisfaction rate \nwhile doing this work. I appreciate Chairwoman Murray's clarification \nthat this provision is not aimed at ending existing contracts like \nVSAC's, but I am concerned that the funding used to service these loans \nwill now need to be found elsewhere. Our discretionary budget is \nstretched thin as it is, and this provision will arrive on the doorstep \nof an already overburdened Education Department.\n  Even though we have reduced the deficit by $2.4 trillion since the \nstart of fiscal year 2011, with nearly three-quarters of that deficit \nreduction coming from $1.8 trillion in spending, there is ongoing \npressure to find additional ways to put money toward deficit reduction. \nIt concerns me that this budget proposal will devote $23 billion toward \ndeficit reduction--barely a drop in the bucket of the larger picture--\nby forcing those who have served in our military, future Federal \nemployees, and airline passengers--but not the airlines--to pay for it.\n  Under this proposal, many Active-Duty military retirees are targeted \nfor Federal spending cuts by a reduction to their cost-of-living \nadjustment until they reach age 62. This is a bait-and-switch maneuver \nthat will cost them thousands of dollars in compensation that they were \npromised and have earned--many of them while bravely serving in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. That just doesn't sit right with me. This provision, \nwhich saves only $6 billion, is set to be phased in over several years \nuntil full implementation in 2017. Unfortunately, these pension reforms \nwill not be grandfathered in for military retirees, as will be done for \nFederal employees--the only positive component of the measure \naddressing Federal worker pensions in this legislation. It is my hope \nthat the delay of its application will give Congress the time to \nresponsibly replace the savings from these changes to military retiree \ncompensation.\n  I am disappointed that the only deal that could receive bipartisan \nsupport does not ask oil companies to sacrifice their tax breaks but \ninstead asks for sacrifices from our mititary retirees and hard-working \nFederal workforce. And instead of closing tax loopholes benefiting \nprivate jet owners and companies hiding profits overseas, we are forced \nto find savings through cuts to our conservation programs.\n  I have always believed that getting our fiscal house in order must go \nhand in hand with policies that promote economic growth, create jobs, \nand strengthen the middle class. Without this deal, sequestration would \nbring to a halt economic growth and threaten to undo the progress we \nhave made. Further sequestration undoubtedly would increase furloughs \nand eliminate jobs. Sequestration would devastate housing programs \nkeeping roofs over families this winter and gut programs supporting the \neducation of our children, lifesaving technology for law enforcers, and \nservices for crime victims. Sequestration is a blunt, harmful, and \nmindless instrument. The Bipartisan Budget Act, while not perfect, is \nthe lifeline we need to prevent that bleak sequestration future from \nbecoming a reality.\n  It is time for us to move beyond these manufactured budget crises and \nfocus on the many remaining challenges that matter most to the American \npeople.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the final 20 \nminutes before the cloture vote be equally divided, and that I control \nthe final 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, this afternoon we will vote to pass a \nbudget for the next 2 years. That sounds really good when we think \nabout actually getting a budget for the next 2 years. I support this \nbudget because I think it provides the certainty our businesses and our \neconomy need and that our families need. It replaces some of the \nreckless across-the-board cuts known as sequestration, and ensures--\nperhaps most importantly--that we won't have another government \nshutdown.\n  The alternative--allowing this budget to fail and setting up another \ngovernment shutdown--is simply unacceptable. We saw the impact the \ngovernment shutdown had on our economy, on the people who depend on \nvital services, as well as on our national defense and our military \nreadiness.\n  So while this budget is not perfect--it is not something I would have \nwritten; I am sure it is not something Senator Murray would have \nwritten. But the budget deal struck by Senator Murray, the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee in the Senate, and Congressman Paul Ryan, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee in the House, is a product of \nbipartisan compromise--something we need a whole lot more of in \nWashington these days. It represents a small but important step forward \nfor our government and for our economy.\n  While the budget we are going to vote on today is not perfect, I do \nbelieve it is a step forward. It doesn't close a single corporate \nloophole. It doesn't extend unemployment insurance, which I would like \nto have seen for people who have lost their jobs through no fault of \ntheir own. That is probably going to cost our economy about 200,000 \njobs. And there are provisions included in the bill that I think are \nmisguided and need to be fixed. But the fact is, this is a step forward \nalso in addressing sequestration in a way I think is absolutely \ncritical to anybody who does business with the Federal Government or \nwith companies and families who are dependent on services and on \ncontracts with the Federal Government.\n  I was at BAE Systems in Nashua, NH, on Monday. I heard from the \nemployees there through their leadership how important it was to have a \nbudget for 2 years to provide some certainty for the company so that \nthey knew what programs they were working on--they do defense \ncontracting--and they could count on, that would provide certainty for \nthem, which is very important. Because one of the comments we have \nheard on the defense side of the budget is that the cuts from \nsequestration were having a very detrimental impact on the readiness of \nour military, on our men and women who are serving, and on the men and \nwomen who work for the Department of Defense.\n  We have seen it in New Hampshire at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard \nwhere we saw furloughs of people at the shipyard. We saw the impact the \nuncertainty as a result of sequestration was having and has been having \non the ability to know what they are going to be working on, and to be \nassured the work will be there in the future. We have seen it with our \nNational Guard in New Hampshire, where the training they need to have \nto keep people current is being affected, where people were furloughed \nas a result of those sequestration cuts. This is legislation which will \naddress that in a way that is critical to our national security and \ncritical to the men and women who serve in our military.\n  There are provisions in the bill I think need to be fixed. I am very \nconcerned, as so many other people in this body are, with the impact of \nthe bill on military retirees. I am disappointed that Congressman Ryan \nwas so committed to including this provision in the compromise bill. \nBut one of the things I want to speak to this afternoon is an effort I \nam working on with a number of my colleagues here in the Senate to try \nand fix that provision--to try and address the negative impacts the \nbill might have on military retirees' benefits, because what the bill \ndoes is include an unnecessary reduction in benefits for military \nretirees under the age of 62. I think there are lots of other ways we \ncan find budgetary savings rather than cutting those retirement \nbenefits for the men and women who have served our Nation in uniform.\n  The good news is that this provision does not go into effect for \nanother 2 years, so we have time to fix this. We have already heard \nfrom the chairman of the Armed Services Committee that he is interested \nin trying to address this provision as we take up the Defense \nauthorization bill in the coming\n\n[[Page S8949]]\n\nyear, but I am ready to get to work right now to address the provision.\n  Yesterday I introduced legislation, the Military Retirement \nRestoration Act, with 15 of my colleagues which would replace the \nmilitary retiree benefit cuts by closing a tax loophole some \ncorporations are using to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. These \ncorporations set up shell companies in tax havens to avoid being \nconsidered an American company even though they are controlled and \noperated on American soil. I think most Americans would agree this kind \nof tax avoidance is unfair and that we should close this tax loophole \nrather than reducing military retiree benefits. This is just one idea. \nI am certainly open to other solutions. I hope we can continue the \nbipartisan work that began with Senator Murray and Congressman Ryan and \nthat we saw again in the vote to end the filibuster on this bill--that \nwe can continue to work in a bipartisan way to replace the cuts for \nmilitary retirees' benefits and we can do it in a way that is smart, \nbut that we can move forward to end the uncertainty, to get a budget in \nplace for 2 years, and to make sure we address the devastating \nsequestration impacts we have seen since March, the automatic cuts and \nthe impact they are having on the domestic side of the budget and on \nthe defense side.\n  I see Senator McCain on the floor. I know earlier on the floor he \ntalked about hearing from every single uniformed service leader of the \nfour armed services, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, about \nthe impact and further effects that sequestration would have on our \nnational security. That is testimony itself of the need to move forward \nto get this budget deal done, and to come back and revisit the concerns \nwe have about other provisions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McCAIN pertaining to the introduction of S. 1851 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today and associate \nmyself with the remarks of my colleague Senator Shaheen that she \ndelivered earlier today. She is a fierce supporter of our men and women \nin uniform, both when they serve our Nation and when they retire or \nleave the military. I am an original cosponsor of her Military \nRetirement Restoration Act, and I am also supportive of passing a \nbipartisan budget deal that prevents our government from shutting down \nand prevents our defense budget from being slashed.\n  The American people have made it crystal clear that they are tired of \ngridlock here in Washington, they are tired of partisan bickering, they \nare tired of the fact that it has led us to sequestration and the kind \nof crisis budgeting that has prevented us from getting our fiscal house \nin order.\n  Like every one of us, I do not support every provision in the \nbipartisan budget agreement, but I want to give great credit to Senator \nMurray and Congressman Ryan for their willingness to sit down together \nand negotiate in good faith and come up with a deal that moves our \ncountry forward. Let me make it clear that the budget compromise is not \nperfect, but it is far better than the alternative. Let's be clear what \nthe alternative is: A $20 billion sequester cut for the Department of \nDefense on January 15 and a much higher likelihood of a government \nshutdown. Our country simply cannot afford more ideological standoffs \nthat lead nowhere. Our men and women in uniform and our national \nsecurity cannot afford to see those catastrophic cuts.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I believe we should find an alternative \nto the decreases in the cost-of-living adjustments for working age \nmilitary retirees. That is why I am proud to cosponsor Senator \nShaheen's legislation which would do just that. I am committed to work \nwith Senator Levin and my other colleagues on the Armed Services \nCommittee to continue to find additional ways to protect the retirement \nthat our retirees and their families have earned. These proposed \nchanges do not go into effect until 2015 and that gives us some room \nand some time to get together to work on addressing these areas where \nthis bipartisan budget agreement falls short.\n  This is an important agreement. It is important to the Defense \nDepartment and to other programs like Head Start and Meals On Wheels \nthat affect Coloradans every day. It will mean more resources for \nhousing and economic development programs, for roads, small airports, \nand transit systems, for first responders and those who fight \nwildfires. The list goes on. This agreement provides predictability for \nthe individuals and organizations, cities and businesses in Colorado \nthat need to know what to expect from the Federal Government.\n  It does all of this while providing for a net reduction in the \ndeficit, something we all know must be achieved more often. For all \nthose reasons I support the partisan budget package and urge my \ncolleagues to join me and continue to find ways to keep faith with our \nmilitary retirees and their families. If you think about what we are \ndoing with the bipartisan budget agreement, we are creating more \ncertainty for our economy.\n\n\n                         Production Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. President, I want to take a few additional minutes to talk about \na driving force in our economy that is creating good-paying American \njobs, and that is our manufacturing sector.\n  The manufacturing sector right now supports about 17 million jobs in \nthe United States. Those jobs are the backbone of a strong, thriving \nmiddle class, and they prove that it is still possible to make it in \nAmerica. In Colorado, our manufacturers literally have the wind at \ntheir backs. I say that because our wind energy industry is not only a \ncritical part of Colorado's manufacturing sector, but it is also an \nessential component of our made-in-America strategy for energy \nindependence. That is why I am proud to have successfully fought to \nensure that the manufacturers who power our wind energy industry have \nthe policies they need to create jobs and thrive.\n  These policies support American workers, and they ensure that we are \ngiving a leg up to all sources of American-grown energy. I have been \nproud to lead these efforts here in the Congress, including when I \ndelivered 27 speeches on the Senate floor last year that culminated in \nthe extension of the Production Tax Credit for wind.\n  Wind energy, which is enabled by the PTC, supports thousands of \nmanufacturing jobs across this country, and that is because building a \nwind turbine takes a heck of a lot of work, involving everyone from \nsteelworkers to electricians to computer engineers. These are good-\npaying middle-class jobs that help grow our economy from the middle \nout. These are jobs that are not only not being offshored, they cannot \nbe offshored. They are staying here, in Colorado and across our great \nNation.\n  To prove that point, just look at this map of wind manufacturing \nfacilities across the United States. There are more than 550 \nmanufacturing facilities in every region of the country, spread across \n44 States involved in the wind industry.\n  I am making sure the Presiding Officer's state is represented and I \nthink it is--the great State of Delaware.\n  Here are some of the concerns all across our country. We have ZF \nWind, which is a gearbox manufacturing plant in Georgia. TPI Composites \nis a turbine plant in Rhode Island. We have the Molded Fiber Glass \nblade plant in Texas, and I have to return to Colorado, where we have \nVestas in my home State. They have a tower facility, among others. This \nall adds up to a wind industry that supports thousands of good-paying \nAmerican jobs.\n  This job-creating industry is taking off, and it could not have come \nat a better time for our manufacturing base, which, after a lot of \ntough years in the wake of the recession, is ready for resurgence in a \nbig way.\n  A lot of other companies and sectors are outsourcing American jobs. \nWhile that has been happening, the wind industry is cutting against the \ngrain and creating good-paying manufacturing jobs here in the United \nStates. In fact, more than 50 new manufacturing facilities entered the \nwind energy market in\n\n[[Page S8950]]\n\nthe last 2 years alone. That is an impressive statistic. It is an \naccomplishment of which we should all be proud.\n  The success of the wind industry is having positive ripple effects on \nother areas of American manufacturing, and that is because the industry \nis not only growing, it is doing so while also increasing its use of \nAmerican-made components.\n  This chart clearly makes my point. In 2007, 25 percent of all wind \nturbines included American-made parts. In 2012, as we can see, that \nnumber increased to more than 70 percent, and it is one of the main \nreasons for the dramatic increase of manufacturing facilities across \nour country that support this wind energy industry.\n  This is not just about the manifestations of the wind energy world \nthat we think about in blades and towers. It is about gears, nuts, \nbolts, and all the other made-in-America components that are now \nhelping to power our renewable energy future.\n  There are some worrying storm clouds on the horizon because despite \nall of this progress and despite all of the American jobs that are \nsupported by this innovative industry, we are truly, again, at a \ncrossroads for wind energy. The PTC, which I have championed, and \nothers have joined me in this Chamber, has helped keep our American \nmanufacturing sector strong, but once again it is going to expire in 20 \ndays. Previously, I joined many of my colleagues on both sides of \naisle--including Senator Chuck Grassley, the father of the PTC--to \nextend this tax credit. Now, with the clock ticking, we need to step up \nand give this industry the long-term certainty it needs to keep \ncreating jobs and working toward true energy independence.\n  In our pursuit of a balanced approach to energy security, we have \nsupported domestic energy production across the board.\n  I see my good friend from Oklahoma Senator Coburn is here.\n  We need an ``all of the above'' approach. If we let the wind PTC \nexpire, we will put one of the cleanest sources of American-made energy \nat a competitive disadvantage relative to traditional energy sources, \nand that is because even if the production tax credit for wind expires, \ntax credits will continue for traditional sources of energy, such as \noil and gas.\n  We have a choice to make: Will we act to preserve American \nmanufacturing jobs and support domestically produced clean energy or \nwill we choose to do nothing and let other countries claim our \nmanufacturing jobs and the leadership of the new energy economy?\n  These are not trivial questions. Allowing the wind PTC to expire will \ncost thousands of American jobs and billions of dollars in investment. \nAll we have to do is look at what happened to wind capacity \ninstallation over the past 15 years when the PTC has expired. Every \ntime it expires or comes close to expiring, wind installation stalls \nand American jobs are lost. We see that pattern on this chart. In the \nyear 2000 it opened, and in 2002, 2004, and now potentially again in \n2013 it will expire.\n  In my home State, one cannot talk about manufacturing without talking \nabout the wind industry. Wind manufacturing employs about 1,500 people \nin Colorado today and supports about 5,000 jobs statewide. As I alluded \nto earlier, we are home to several manufacturing jobs, including a \ntower facility, two blade plants, and a nacelle facility, which are all \noperated by the great Vestas company.\n  Last year, due to the lack of certainty about the PTC, no new orders \nwere placed for wind turbines, and Vestas was forced to let go over 600 \nemployees in Colorado alone. That hurt cities such as Pueblo and \nBrighton, whose local economies have significantly benefited from the \nmanufacturing jobs the wind PTC supports.\n  After my effort and the effort of others to extend the PTC last year, \norders started to flow again and Vestas is again hiring workers to meet \nthe market demand. That is good for Colorado. These are jobs with good \nbenefits.\n  What concerns me--and I know it concerns Vestas and other Colorado-\nbased companies--is that these jobs can vanish if we don't act. That is \nwhat this is all about. These jobs can vanish if we don't act. So I am \nback here and renewing my call from last year. We should act now to \nextend the wind production tax credit or we risk losing this industry \nand the manufacturing jobs it creates to our competitors. Where are \nthose competitors? They are in China, Europe, and elsewhere all over \nthe globe. That is the last thing our economy needs.\n  The men and women employed in manufacturing facilities across the \ncountry are calling on us again in Congress to act. Let's heed their \ncall. Let's act now. The PTC equals jobs. Let's pass it as soon as \npossible. Let's save these American jobs by extending the production \ntax credit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 944\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, I rise today to urge Senate passage of S. 944, the Veterans \nHealth and Benefits Improvement Act of 2013. This bipartisan \nlegislation is the result of months of hard work by my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle. This legislation was passed out of committee \nby voice vote. There were no objections that took place on July 24, and \nthis legislation is paid for.\n  Furthermore, this legislation is supported by nearly every major \nveteran and military service organization in our country, including the \nIraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the Military Officers \nAssociation of America, the American Legion, the Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica, the Association of the United States Navy, the Reserve \nOfficers Association, the Jewish War Veterans, the Enlisted Association \nof the National Guard of the United States, the National Association \nfor Uniformed Services, AMVETS, Gold Star Wives, and the National \nCongress of American Indians.\n  In fact, I think it would be a very good statement about what we are \ntrying do as a nation if the Senate could pass this comprehensive \nveterans bill before we adjourn so we can get about the business of \nworking with our House colleagues to get important veterans legislation \npassed by both bodies signed into law.\n  I will briefly highlight some of the key provisions of this very \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  Again, this legislation is bipartisan; it came out of the committee \nunanimously; and it has the support of virtually every veterans \norganization.\n  Ranking Member Burr and I have worked together on a provision that \nwould help servicemembers transition back into civilian life by making \nrecently separated veterans eligible for tuition at the instate rates. \nThis has been a very contentious issue, but what we do is make recently \nseparated veterans eligible for tuition at the instate rate, which is \nsomething many of the veterans organizations and people all over this \ncountry have wanted.\n  Given the nature of our Armed Forces, servicemembers have little to \nsay as to where they serve and where they reside during military \nservice. This legislation would help our brave men and women who have \nsacrificed so much in the defense of our country transition by giving \nthem a fair shot at attaining their educational goals without incurring \nan additional financial burden simply because they chose to serve their \ncountry.\n  I know this issue was discussed a great deal in the House and it was \ndiscussed here a great deal, and we have reached resolution on this \nimportant issue.\n  Further, while the Pentagon, Congress, and other stakeholders \ncontinue to work to end sexual assault within the ranks--this is an \nenormously important issue--I want to do everything within my power as \nchairman of the VA to ensure that the VA is a warm and welcoming place \nfor those survivors of military assault. That is why this legislation \ncontains important provisions that would improve the delivery of care \nand benefits to veterans who experience sexual trauma while serving in \nthe military. This was inspired by Ruth Moore, who struggled for 23 \nyears to receive VA disability compensation.\n  It would expand access to VA counseling and care to members of the \nGuard and Reserves who experience sexual assault during inactive-duty \ntraining. It also takes a number of steps to improve the adjudication \nof claims based on military sexual trauma.\n\n[[Page S8951]]\n\n  This legislation would give the VA additional tools to do all it can \nto provide victims of sexual trauma with the care and benefits they \nneed to confront the emotional and physical consequences of these \nhorrific acts. Maintaining the VA's world-class health care system \nremains a priority for this committee, and this legislation does just \nthat.\n  I am pleased we were able to respond to calls from veterans to \nincrease access to complementary and alternative medicine for the \ntreatment of chronic pain, mental health conditions, and chronic \ndisease. By expanding the availability of these treatment options, we \ncan enhance the likelihood that veterans get the treatment they need in \nways that work for them.\n  Additionally, this legislation calls for the VA to promote healthy \nweight in veterans by increasing their access to fitness facilities. A \nhealthy weight is critical to combating multiple chronic diseases, \nincluding diabetes and heart disease. By managing veterans' obesity, we \ncan both improve their overall health and reduce the costs to the \nhealth care system.\n  Every Member of this body knows all too well the challenges of the \nclaims backlog. I am pleased to see that the VA is making progress on \nthis complex issue, but much more remains to be done. This legislation \nsupports VA's ongoing efforts and would make needed improvements to the \nclaims system. Among a number of claims-related provisions, this bill, \nfor the first time, would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to \npublicly report on both claims processing goals and actual production. \nThis would allow Congress and the public to closely track and measure \nVA's progress on this difficult issue.\n  This bill also addresses a number of concerns presented to the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee by the Gold Star Wives earlier this year by \nimproving the benefits and services provided to surviving spouses.\n  The Veterans Health and Benefits Improvement Act would provide \nadditional dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving spouses \nwith children in order to provide financial support during the \ndifficult period following the loss of a loved one.\n  This bill also expands the Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry \nScholarship to include surviving spouses of members of the Armed Forces \nwho died in the line of duty.\n  The Veterans Health and Benefits Improvement Act contains provisions \nthat will improve the lives of our Nation's servicemembers, veterans, \nand their survivors. I am proud of the bipartisan manner in which the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee has conducted its business to produce this \nimportant legislation. Our veterans deserve far more help from the \nCongress than they have received.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 258, S. 944; that the committee-reported \nsubstitute amendment be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed; that the committee-reported title amendment be \nagreed to; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Well, I am disappointed that there is objection to a \nbill that came out of committee without objection, that was done in a \nbipartisan manner, that is paid for, and that has the support of \nvirtually every veterans organization.\n  I hope that even though there is an objection to the unanimous \nconsent, there would not be an objection to a rollcall vote on this \nbill.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, there will be an objection to a rollcall \nvote because the opportunity to amend this bill has not been made \navailable to Members of the Senate. I have two specific concerns with \nthe bill--I am writing my whole letter right now on this bill--and \nuntil they are addressed, I am going to hold this bill until I have an \nopportunity to make them known.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I understand the Senator's objection. I am disappointed. \nIt takes forever to get anything done in this body, and we have a \nsituation now where we have seen a process develop in the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs by which there has been bipartisan support. It is \nkind of the way things are supposed to be done. Yet because of the \nobjection, we are going to be unable to move forward in the way I think \nmost of the Members want.\n  Thank you very much. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, what I am trying to do is this: We were \ntold to come down here at 4 o'clock. I was glad to be able to discuss \nthings earlier. So what I would like to talk about, with the Chair's \npermission, is the military retiree provision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  No. 1, I wish to say to our budget chairman we had a very good \ndiscussion with Senators Chambliss and Isakson about trying to figure \nout a way to fix this provision in the budget deal. I am very \ndisappointed we can't have an amendment to fix it or amendments to do \nother things, but we are where we are.\n  So the bottom line is this has been a healthy exercise because all of \nus are now looking at the provision. This is a bipartisan product, so \nit is not about blaming Democrats or Republicans. It is a good \nexercise. How could a bill--this bill, as we all know, doesn't fund the \ngovernment. If we pass the budget--and I am sure it will pass here \neventually--it doesn't keep the government open; it sets limits on \nspending where we are increasing the amount we can spend on defense and \nnondefense, setting sequestration aside. That is a great thing. I think \nthat is going to be good. How we pay for it is the problem.\n  The question is, How did this happen? The chairman of the Senate \nBudget Committee and the chairman in the House are great folks. The \nmilitary retiree provision is a pay-for that has everybody wondering a \nbit and, upon a second evaluation, is probably certainly not the right \nthing to do.\n  In May of 2014, there will be a commission that was set up by the \nCongress to tell us how best to reform military pay and benefits, \nbecause they are unsustainable, quite frankly, in the future. But we \nput in that Commission report a requirement that any reform could not \naffect those who are in the service now; they are grandfathered. I \nthink the reason the Congress did that is we don't want to break faith \nwith those who signed up for deal A. They are doing their part of the \ndeal. They are serving. The Congress is looking for a way to make these \nprograms more sustainable by applying it in the future, which I think \nwe should do. About the civilian employee contribution to their \nretirement program, that is prospective. The one thing I was \ndisappointed about is the money doesn't go into the retirement plan to \npay for the deal.\n  I wish to acknowledge what Senator Warren has been doing with every \nGang of 6, 12, 8, 10, 14--just different numbers--trying to find a way. \nI know entitlement programs are the source of the problem for the \nNation over the long term, and military retirement programs such as \nTRICARE we have to look at as a retirement system. That is not a \nproblem. But we are in a hurry to basically pass a budget that \ngenerally I support. It gets us out of the situation of sequestration.\n  But how did this happen? How could we have picked a pay-for such as \nthis which is, to me, unacceptable. The military retirement community, \nup to the age of 62, will have their COLA reduced by 1 percent. That \ndoesn't sound like a lot, but the compounding of that goes like this: \nIf a person is a master sergeant who retires after 20 years of service \nin 2015 at, say, 42, by the time that person gets to 62, the effect of \nthis bill will cost him or her $71,000. That is the compounding effect \nof money. No one has ever suggested it should be applied to people who \nare almost at retirement or in retirement when it comes to how we \nreform benefits.\n  My good friend Senator McCain, who has earned every penny he has ever\n\n[[Page S8952]]\n\ngotten in retirement and then some, mentioned the Bowles-Simpson \nCommission. I am a general fan of Bowles-Simpson: reform entitlements \nand flatten out the Tax Code and, yes, pay down some debt. I am a \nRepublican. It would eliminate the deduction in the Tax Code and apply \nsome of the money to the debt, not put it all in tax cuts, because when \nwe are $17 trillion in debt, we have to do things we would otherwise \nnot like. I am willing to do that. But Bowles-Simpson did not, as my \nfriend Senator McCain suggests, adopt eliminating COLAs before 62 as \npart of their solution. They wanted to find $70 billion over 10 years \nfor Federal workforce entitlement reform. They created a commission, \nthe Federal Workforce Entitlement Task Force Commission, to reevaluate \ncivil service, military health and retirement programs. They did not \nsay we are going to eliminate COLAs entirely for the military and \ncivilian workers; they said, we need a commission to look are to how to \nfind $70 billion over the next 10 years. The examples they gave of what \nwe might look at is use the highest 5 years of earnings to calculate \nthe civil service pension benefits for new retirees, defer cost-of-\nliving adjustment is the second one, adjust the ratio of employer-\nemployee contributions to Federal employee pension plans to equalize \ncontributions, which saves $4 billion. These were examples.\n  They wanted a commission. Guess what. So did the Congress. In 2013--\nthis came out in 2010--the Congress said let's form a commission to \nlook at this. The problem is the Commission hasn't reported back to us. \nThey are not due to do so until May 2014. We did put a prohibition on \nthe Commission's work product: You have to grandfather existing \nservicemembers. You can't retroactively apply any of your reforms.\n  So Bowles-Simpson did not say we are going to eliminate all COLAs; \nthey said, form a commission, and that was one example of what to look \nat. The Congress did form a commission. The commission is not back yet. \nBut the Congress told the Commission to grandfather people who are in \nthe current system, but we forgot to tell ourselves that because this \npay-for is retroactive in nature and applies to all retirees, past, \npresent, and future.\n  The disability component, the people who drafted this assumed \ndisability retirees would not be included. They are. The $600 million, \nCBO says, of the $6.3 billion that this provision generates in revenue \nto help pay for the deal--$600 million comes from the disability \nretired community, and I think we all understand that is not the right \nthing to do. Someone has lost a limb in Afghanistan or Iraq who is \ndisabled, can't work, they get benefits outside of disability \nretirement, and they have earned those benefits. But reducing their \nCOLAs would add thousands of dollars, tens of thousands of dollars in \nlost benefits. Nobody wants to do that. They thought they weren't \nincluded. They are.\n  Let me just say as someone who has been around the military--I am a \nmilitary lawyer, so I am not a frontline military person by any means. \nI have tried to be the best military lawyer I can be. I have been in \nthe military for 30 years. I love the culture, love the environment, \nand I try to be part of the team. The military lawyer is part of the \nteam. The pilots who go fly and face danger, they are the heroes. The \nmaintenance guys and the guys on the frontlines in the Army, to them \ngoes the glory.\n  The bottom line is I don't think it is fair for us to consider. If \nyou are in the MRAP that didn't get hit by the IED and you made it \nthrough your tour, you have earned your retirement just as much as \nanybody else, and that disabled retiree needs the money more than \nanybody. They get things the average military retiree doesn't because \ntheir needs are greater.\n  All I am doing is begging the body: Let's not pass a budget deal with \na pay-for that violates our own Commission requirements, that in \nhindsight is not the message we want to send to those who serve now. It \nis not a good way to recruit.\n  Let's see if we can fix this. Let's see if we can fix it before it \ngets into law, because once we get something into law, we all know how \nhard it is to take it out.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, would the Senator from South Carolina \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I do. Before I do, I wish to say that the Senator from \nMississippi asked a question in our conference: Tell me what this costs \nour retirees. All of us on the Republican side looked at him, me \nincluded--me included--I didn't have a clue how to answer that, and \nwhen I found out it was $71,000, almost $72,000 for E-7, from 42 to 62, \nI about fell out of my chair. Now I know how you generate $6 billion.\n\n  As to the Senator from New Hampshire, she was the first one to take \nthis torch up and run with it, and I have been trying to help where I \ncan. But I will yield for a question.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina \nfor his leadership on this important issue. What I want to ask the \nSenator is this. Some have come to this floor and said: Pass this \nbudget agreement, and we will fix this later. Does the Senator think \nthat is a good way to solve this problem?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is a good question. The best way is to fix it before \nit passes, and we have until January 15. Nobody wants to shut the \ngovernment down. Again, the budget deal is just about numbers. We have \nto actually appropriate. But I think we could. There are so many \ndifferent ways. I have thrown out the idea of eliminating subsidies for \npeople who make over $250,000 for their Part D premiums. It is $54 \nbillion over 10 years. I am not asking my Democratic colleagues to go \nto food stamps and safety nets. I am not asking them to do that, and I \nam surely not going to ask the Republicans to raise taxes. There are \nbetter ways to do it.\n  So I could not agree more with the Senator from New Hampshire. With a \nlittle bit of effort here in the next few hours or days, we could fix \nthis in total.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Of all the people who deserve our effort, doesn't the \nSenator think we could stay here as long as we need to before the \nholidays--a little bit of inconvenience for us--to fix this? Because \none thing I see from this is we are saying to our military retirees: Do \nnot worry. Trust the politicians in Washington to fix something they \nvoted for.\n  Here we are. We know the problem is here now. People yet have not had \na final vote on this budget agreement. Yet they are still saying: Oh, \nwe know the problem is there, but we are going to vote for it anyway. I \ndo not understand this.\n  If you are someone who is serving our country, what kind of message \ndoes that send?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In all honesty, the provision does not take effect for a \nyear or two. But I think what the Senator is saying is so important. \nWhy leave any doubt in people's mind? They have enough to worry about \nalready. Life is hard for all of us. For some people life is just \nincredibly hard. I have lived a fortunate life. But for a military \nretiree who is not disabled, it matters to them.\n  So we should not create stress where none is needed. They have been \nstressed out enough. The last 10 years have been hard as hell for \nthem--multiple deployments. Senator Warner and all of us would go \noverseas. You would see the same people. I would do small Reserve tours \njust for a few days in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am seeing the same \npeople in Afghanistan who I saw in Iraq in my career field of being a \nJAG working on detention matters. I do not think the average American--\nthey appreciate but I do not think they really understand how hard this \nhas been on 1 percent of the American people.\n  So wouldn't it be nice if they did not have to worry and we could get \nthis issue behind us? Because here is the truth of the matter: It may \ncome as a shock to the body, but we are not in very good standing right \nnow. That is a bipartisan problem. Here is the concern. The main things \nthat have been fixed that are wrong? Not a whole lot. It is hard to fix \nthings.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Right.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The unraveling effect is what people worry about. If you \nfix it for the military retirees, what about the civilians? I am \nwilling to look at that. But the bottom line is they fought hard. They \nfought long. They have earned what they got. We should not \nretroactively diminish their retirement. They have worried enough. \nLet's do not give them anything to worry\n\n[[Page S8953]]\n\nabout for the holidays. Let's take this one off the table.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I could not agree with the Senator from South Carolina \nmore. I heard the chairman of the Budget Committee say the fact that \ndisabled veterans are included in this, those who have had a medical \nretirement--we have talked about them; we have been to Walter Reed; we \nhave seen those who have sacrificed so much for our country and are \ngetting a cut to their cost-of-living increase in their retirement \nunder this agreement--that this was somehow a ``technical glitch'' or \nsomething.\n  If it is a technical glitch that we know is there, why are we going \nhome before it is fixed? I do not understand it and even putting one \nshred of doubt in their minds that we stand with them, and that we know \nthis problem exists in this bill, and that it can be fixed.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Just to respond, I think this is what happens when you \nare trying to get something done late in the year. We are all adults. \nWe have had months to deal with these issues. I sort of hate the fact \nthat you are dealing with important things like the Defense \nauthorization bill a day or 2 before everybody wants to go home for \nChristmas. Eventually, that leads to $17 trillion in debt.\n  How do you get to $17 trillion in debt? It takes bipartisanship.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Right.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No one party can get you there. This is the way you have \nrun the place. What happens when you fill up the tree? You cannot fix \nthings. Here is what is wrong with that. You cannot fix the things that \npolitically are bad for you and expect the rest of us to go away \nquietly because we have something we want to do. So this filling of the \ntree process is not good for something this big, and I hope people \nwould be responsible with their amendments.\n  But, again, it goes back to how did this happen? I do not believe for \na moment that Patty Murray or Paul Ryan meant to hurt disabled \nveterans. I do not believe that. I think the whole issue was not looked \nat. These things are put together very quickly. I am on the Budget \nCommittee. The Senator from New Hampshire is on the Budget Committee. \nThe Senator from Alabama is on the Budget Committee. I had no idea. \nNobody asked me if this was a good idea. I did not even get to look at \nit. I got to read about it in the paper.\n  That is what happens when you put the deals together with just a \nhandful of people. You make mistakes, because the more eyes the better. \nYou find yourself here talking about something, quite frankly, that we \nall know is wrong.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Right.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We need to fix it. We are creating a lot of anxiety for \npeople who are going through enough anxiety. I hope we can rise to the \noccasion here at the end.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator from South Carolina \nyield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I say to Senator Graham, he has served in the House. I \nknow the powers that be would just like to see this bill rubber \nstamped, passed, done with, rah, rah, rah. But if this legislation were \nto be amended, and this problem were fixed, doesn't the Senator think \nthe House would have ample time to pass it before the January 15 date \nfor the CR, or, really, they could, as we have done many times, extend \nthe CR a week or so, if needed? But I do not really think it would be \nneeded. I think they would pass it promptly.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think the Senator is absolutely right. We have a \nlegislative process that could rise to the occasion if we would use it. \nFor 200 years we have been doing business a certain way, and the Senate \nis changing, all for the worse. Like I say, this is a bipartisan \nproblem. I am not blaming Patty Murray, the Democratic chairman. This \ngot into a bill that was bipartisan. It got 330 votes, 70 percent of \nthe Republican Conference. We all make mistakes. But how did it get \nthere? Nobody will tell me who put this in there because they do not \nknow.\n  So the Senator is right. I think our House colleagues would find the \nequities of the matter easy to resolve. They would come back and fix it \nin just no time. I think we could fix it. The offsets might be hard to \nfind in terms of our ideological differences, but I think we could find \nsome offsets to fix this pretty quickly. Yes, I say to Senator \nSessions, the House would be able to do it too.\n  One final plea. I would hope that as we go into the holiday season \nthe acrimony that has been created in this body about different aspects \nof the way we run the place--that we do not miss a chance to do the \nright thing. They come on a lot here. It is not like we do not get a \nchance to do the right thing as Republicans and Democrats. We just both \ndo not rise to the occasion enough.\n  But here is a chance to do the right thing and a very necessary \nthing. Maybe if we rose to the occasion here, it might lead to doing \nmore right things. I will leave here as an optimist and hope and pray \nwe do the right thing while we still can.\n  I yield.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Let me just say, we can do the right thing. We do not \nhave to set our expectations so low that we cannot come together and \nfind a pay-for that is acceptable to both sides of the aisle that says \nwhat we should say to our men and women in uniform; and that is: Thank \nyou. Thank you. God bless you. The first responsibility of our Nation \nis to defend our Nation and to keep it safe. Of all the things that \nwould keep us here--would keep us here till Christmas--I think this is \none of the most important things we could do for the people who go in \nthere first for us and ensure that we have the privilege of being on \nthis floor, have the privilege of going home and spending the holidays \nwith our families.\n  So of all the things, to say that this is not possible, I think it is \nvery possible, and we should have the will to do it for our men and \nwomen in uniform. We should have the will to do it for those who have \nbeen disabled because of their brave service in the line of duty for \nthis country. I would hope we would rise to the very best of this body \nand fix this and not go home for the holidays with any uncertainty for \nour military retirees or our men and women in uniform of where we \nstand, and we stand with them.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, when I first came to Washington, \nconsidering running for the Senate, I went to a Republican luncheon, \nand they asked me to say just a thing or two, not that long, and I \nsaid: I could think of no greater honor than to represent the people of \nAlabama in the greatest deliberative body in the history of the world. \nThis is a great deliberative body. That is our heritage, and it is \nbeing eroded. It is not disputable that it is being eroded. It is being \neroded in a way that is faster and more significant than any of us seem \nto understand. Like the frog in the warming water, we do not realize we \nare being cooked and that the freedoms of Americans are being cooked.\n  This bill contains another provision that constricts the ability of a \nminority in the Senate--it could be Democrats or Republicans or just a \nbipartisan group who do not represent a majority but have a concern--to \nhave those concerns heard and dealt with, and it is very significant. I \nwish it were not so.\n  I was shocked it was in the bill. I had no idea it would be in the \nbill. As Senator Graham just indicated, this started out as a \nbipartisan, bicameral conference, and Senator Ayotte and Senator Graham \nand Senator Wicker and I were members of the conference. We met and had \na couple of public meetings where everybody talked, but no legislation, \nno language was laid out. The next thing we heard: The conference \nleaders are drafting a bill--I would say affectionately, a gang of two \nthis time.\n  So this is the bill that was their product. I know they were trying \nto work out an important solution to America's financial problems. I \nknow the differences between the parties are so great that it is \ndifficult to bridge those disagreements, and we were not expecting a \ngreat solution to the long-term financial state of America--that needs \nto be dealt with, must be dealt with, and every year we wait makes it \nharder to fix that challenge we face.\n  But I did not expect some of the damage we have seen in the \nlegislation. I\n\n[[Page S8954]]\n\nhave to talk about a certain point because it changed the rules of the \nSenate. I am not sure the House Members understood how significant it \nwas. But three times I have made objections to budget violations--three \ntimes--and we contended that the bill before the Senate was spending \nand would spend more money than the Budget Control Act allowed to be \nspent. If that is so--the Budget Control Act being in law, having \ncertain limits on spending--then the Senate would have to recognize we \nwere busting the budget and we would have to have 60 votes, a super \nmajority, to approve busting the budget, a pretty good matter. It does \nnot make any difference if there are taxes and fees used to pay for \nthat. It still spends more than the amount of money we agreed to spend. \nIt allowed us to contain spending.\n  There were three different votes in the last year or so in which the \nSenate was stopped from spending more than the Budget Control Act limit \nrequired because 60 Senators would not vote for it. There were not 60 \nwho would support waiving the budget, breaking the budget, spending \nabove the budget.\n  So that is the issue at stake. I am sure the spenders were deeply \ndisappointed. They got over 50. Under this bill now, it only takes 50. \nThey got over 50, but they did not get 60, so they were not able to \ncontinue that spending.\n  This agreement, this bill that is before us today, would \nsignificantly weaken the ability of Senators in this body to enforce \nthe spending and revenue limits under our budget resolution and in \nfuture budgets.\n  The Ryan-Murray agreement that is before us today includes an \negregious number of deficit-neutral reserve funds--57, to be exact. \nOperationally a reserve fund allows the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to adjust the spending limits in a budget resolution prior to \nSenate consideration of a bill that busts the budget. This allows the \nproposed legislation to avoid most spending points of order.\n  A reserve fund can be a useful tool when used in the context of a \ntrue budget resolution, one that is properly negotiated in public by a \nconference committee rather than a backroom deal. Reserve funds can \nshepherd legislation with common policy goals through the House and \nSenate by accommodating minor differences between the budget plan and \nthe final legislation. So that makes sense. Reserve funds are not a \ntotal fraud. Congress does not want legislation they agreed to in \nconcept to get tripped by scoring differences. That is why reserve \nfunds were originally created. But there is virtually nothing \npolicywise in common between the House and Senate budget resolution \nthat we are seeing today. They are quite different.\n  The House Ryan budget is a historic budget that alters the debt \ncourse of America and puts us on a sound path. The Senate budget that \ncleared this body, over my objection, would raise taxes $1 trillion, \nbut instead of using those takes revenues to pay down the debt, it \nwould have funded $1 trillion in more spending above the Budget Control \nAct limit we agreed to in August of 2011. So that is the situation. \nThese are different budgets.\n  With 57 different reserve funds, the Murray-Ryan spending bill that \nis before us now will allow Senator Reid and Chairman Murray to bring \nto the floor a practically unlimited number of big tax-and-spend bills. \nIt will not be subject to the 60-vote limit. Normally the minority \nparty would be able to raise a point of order under section 302(f) of \nthe Budget Act. The 302(f) is known as the tax-and-spend point of \norder, because it is the one we deploy when Congress tries to spend \nmore money than it promised to spend, and offsets that new spending \nwith some fee or tax increase. It is the point of order we deploy when \nDemocrats, on these occasions I have mentioned, with some Republicans \nsupporting it, want to grow the size of government. It takes 60 votes \nto get around a 302(f) point of order and it forces colleagues to go on \nrecord and say: Yes, I know my legislation will bust the budget, but we \nask that we do it anyway.\n  What I found as we have looked at it, when you shine light on these \nvotes, and votes on the floor of the Senate, and ask: Senator, do you \nreally want to spend more than we agreed to spend? You just agreed in \nAugust of 2011 to the Budget Control Act. It said, we are not going to \nspend over this level. A bill hits the floor that spends over that \nlevel. They say: Do not worry about it, it is paid for by taxes. Do you \nreally want to do that when it is raised as a budget point of order? \nWell, Senators kind of get shy and many of them back off what they \nmight otherwise have agreed to if that issue were not raised.\n  As I said, there were three successive votes in which this Congress \nrefused to bust the budget and spend more than was agreed to. It \nrankled some of our Members who like to spend. They did not like that. \nBut the sheer number of reserve funds in the legislation before us, 57, \nwould essentially take that point of order away. There are so many \nreserve funds in this bill that Senator Reid and Chairman Murray can \nbring an endless number of tax-and-spend bills to the floor, and my \ncolleagues and I would be unable to shine light on that and be able to \nhave a clean vote on one question--not whether we favored the idea they \nwant to spend money on. That was not the question. The question, when \nyou raise a budget point of order, is: Do you believe we should break \nthe spending limits that we agreed to? If you can fund your bill and \nyour cause that you believe in by finding savings elsewhere in the \nbudget, then we might support that. But we are not going to support \nspending more than we agreed to. That is what this budget point of \norder has allowed us to do on a series of occasions.\n  I believe it is causing a lot of people to come to me and Chairman \nMurray when they offer legislation to make sure they are within the \nbudget. They go back and try to draft it in a way that does not violate \nthe budget. But eliminating this budget point of order will reduce the \nnumber of people who are concerned about that. We will see less \ndiscipline, in my opinion.\n  In summary, the reserve fund would allow the Senate majority or a \nnumber of Senators who have got legislation on the floor to avoid this \ntough vote in the light of day so people can see what has occurred. \nMoreover, there is a little-understood danger in this legislation that \ngoes beyond spending. It really does. This bill can allow legislation \nthat would carry measures that are disproportionately policy heavy with \nvery little budgetary effect. We believe, as we have analyzed the bill, \nthat it could allow reserve funds to be used to increase the minimum \nwage, to change voter registration laws, to extend unemployment \ninsurance and offset it with some tax increase somewhere, regulate \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and more.\n  There is little that can be done in the Congress to stop that which \ncould have been done previously. This will allow this to go forward in \na way heretofore not done. So I urge my colleagues not to sit idly by \nand watch the rights of the Senate get pounded into the dirt. It is \nbetter to have their individual authorities from whatever State and \nwhatever party they come from to be able to highlight these problems. \nSo I will ask unanimous consent today to offer an amendment that would \nstrike the reserve funds from this legislation that is before us.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support that effort. If you care about \nthis Senate as an institution, if you care about the right of free \ndebate and the ability to actually amend legislation, if you care about \nthe heritage of the Senate and the importance of constraining spending, \nthen I would urge support of my unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. President, I would formally ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending motion so that I may offer a motion to concur with the \namendment numbered 2573 which is filed at the desk which would \naccomplish what I have described.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Is there objection?\n  The senior Senator from Washington State is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to \nfirst note that every one of the reserve funds included in this \nbipartisan bill was also included and voted on as part of the Senate-\npassed 2014 budget resolution. None of this material is new. My \ncolleagues have seen and voted on every one of those reserve funds.\n\n  In the 9 months since the Senate passed the budget, I cannot recall, \nfrankly, a single time that a Member came up to me and raised an issue \nregarding one of those reserve funds.\n\n[[Page S8955]]\n\n  I similarly would like to point out that reserve funds are not new. \nThe Senate has actually relied on reserve funds to help it carry out \nits priorities under the annual budget process for nearly 30 years. The \nauthority to include them is specifically authorized in law by section \n301(b)(7) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  In fact, reserve funds are so common and accepted by Republicans and \nDemocrats alike that Senators actually filed more than 300 of them \nduring the debate on the 2014 budget resolution.\n  Let me repeat that for everyone. Senators filed more than 300 reserve \nfunds this year, including, by the way, a few from my friend, the \nSenator from Alabama.\n  So if there is anything that should be noncontroversial, it should be \nincluding some of these reserve funds that were debated and agreed to \nlast spring.\n  More fundamentally, the bipartisan agreement now before the Senate \nwill ensure that the Senate once again has a budget. That is a good \nthing. Having a budget and the discipline of enforceable spending \nlevels will strengthen enforcement, not weaken it. If you do not have a \nbudget, you do not have a spending level you can enforce, you lose \ndiscipline and the ability to raise certain points of order. We fix \nthat actually in this agreement.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, these provisions that allow the \nobjections to the abuse of reserve funds have been in law since 1985, \n30 years almost. This has been the law that we have. I raised \nobjections to the tax-and-spend point of order and it has been \nsustained on the floor of the Senate. The Senate budget resolution that \nSenator Murray referred to is the one that would increase spending $1 \ntrillion over what was agreed to in 2011, August of 2011, and would add \n$1 trillion in taxes.\n  Then they changed this rule. This legislation alters that from the \npast. The budget resolution she referred to did pass the Senate with \nDemocratic votes only. It was a simple majority. But this is \nlegislation that changes the Budget Act. I feel strongly we have to \nabsolutely understand what has happened here. The rule has been \nchanged. Power that Senators had to block tax-and-spend legislation \nthat breaks spending limits has been eroded significantly. It should \nnot have been a part of any legislation that purports to be legislation \nthat puts this Nation on a financial path of soundness. In fact, it \ndoes the opposite. It weakens the ability of Senators who want to hold \nthis Congress to its own spending limits agreed to in law. It weakens \ntheir ability to stop breaking those spending limits. There is no doubt \nabout that. I am really upset about it. I think it is historic.\n  I understand that the House maybe did not fully understand what was \nmeant here. Maybe we can somehow revive this. But in truth we should do \nit now. We should not pass this bill that contains this legislation. \nHad we had a normal conference committee--and I had been a member of it \nand other Senators had been a member of that conference committee and \nhad a chance to talk about it, it would not have been in there. Maybe \nthat is why they chose not to have a public, open discussion of it, \nbecause they wanted to slip this through in the dead of night, up next \nto Christmas. Oh, you have got to pass this bill just as it is. There \ncan be no amendments. The government will shut down. We will all have \nto stay here until Christmas Eve, as we had to, to try to stop \nObamaCare that they passed on Christmas Eve. So this is the kind of \nthing that is not healthy for America. It is not healthy for the \nSenate.\n  Reserve funds are a function of policy. There is no common policy \nbetween the House and the Senate on budget resolutions. Budget \nresolutions are passed by each House, but we do not have common \npolicies there about how it is processed. Never have we adopted the \nvolume of reserve funds that will hereafter be longstanding parts of \nour law.\n  I believe we have a time to begin our wrapup now. Let me say Senator \nMurray is a good, strong advocate. She is effective in her leadership \nrole. I respect her and enjoy working with her. We sometimes disagree.\n  I wish to say, as we move to conclude this legislation, that I \nrespect the Senator, and we move forward.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Does the Senator need additional time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much additional time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Ten minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. It is gone.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would ask that the unanimous consent be equally \ndivided.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I believe the unanimous consent that was \npreviously entered allowed me the last 10 minutes, and the Senator from \nAlabama the prior 10 minutes, so most of that time has been used.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has about 2 minutes \nremaining and the Senator from Washington State has 10 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. What time is the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time expires at 4:27 p.m.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. How did it get to be at 4:27 p.m. instead of 4:30?\n  I ask unanimous consent the vote be held at 4:30, and I will wrap up \nin the time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, I will not object if I \ncould have 1 minute now on a matter of some importance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am not sure--I do not object to the President pro \ntempore's request for 1 minute.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would object if it is counted against my time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Maybe I can help us all out here. The Senator from \nAlabama has been speaking for about 25 minutes. I am pleased to give \nthe Senator from Alabama 4 minutes, the President pro tempore 1 minute, \nand I will take the final minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thought we were voting at 4:30 and \nthere would be 5 minutes left for me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Postcloture time expires at 4:27.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will accept the kind and generous offer of the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I was concerned about Senator Leahy. If I would have 4 \nminutes, I would consent to the Senator----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If I would have 4 minutes--I would ask unanimous \nconsent that the vote be delayed until I have 4 minutes and Senator \nLeahy has 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The bill before us today is a perfect example of why it \nis dangerous to produce a deal in secret and rush it through on the \nfloor of Congress in a panic, as we have done time and time again. This \nbill is a perfect example of why we need regular order, why the Senate \nis supposed to be a deliberative body that debates and amends \nlegislation--there is no amendment being allowed to this legislation--\nand why each Senator is supposed to have a chance to have their say and \noffer amendments to the bill. Each Senator in this Chamber, Republican \nand Democrat, is being diminished if they are not allowed to have an \namendment on an important piece of legislation such as this.\n  I was astonished to hear earlier that we have no choice but to pass \nthis bill exactly as it is, that there is no other alternative. What \nabout letting the Senate work its will, I suggest. Could we not find 51 \nSenators who could have agreed on a better way to save money than to \ncut retired military personnel, a cut that was used to increase \nspending in other areas, some of which is clearly not more significant \nthan the cuts falling on military retired personnel?\n  We learn after the House has passed the bill, that also includes a \ncut to the pensions of wounded warriors and--I suspect most House \nMembers didn't realize that, as my friend from Mississippi has pointed \nout.\n\n[[Page S8956]]\n\n  We were blocked yesterday from having a vote, and it looks as if we \nwill continue to be blocked. We will move to final passage, and there \nwill be no opportunity to amend this bill and the big $500 billion \nDefense authorization bill that will be on the floor next immediately. \nThereafter, it will be voted on tomorrow, and there will be no \namendments to it.\n  This is unprecedented to have the Defense bill on the floor when we \noften have 30 or more amendments. Zero. We don't have time, we have \nwasted our time on all kinds of things. We had a whole week in which \nthere were two measly votes conducted when 30 or more could have been \nconducted easily that week, and there wouldn't have been that many \nvotes on the Senate bill.\n  I would say that I do not believe this legislation is sound \nlegislation. I believe it does damage to the ability of this Senate to \nprotect the Treasury of the United States of America. I think it takes \nus down the road to eroding the power of individual Senators to \nconstrain spending and stay within the limits we agreed to, that we put \nin law. I am not happy about it. I wish I had more time to talk about \nit. I don't.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to work with Senator Murray. I greatly \nrespect Congressman Ryan. But there are some problems with this \nlegislation. We should not pass it, and there is plenty of time for the \nHouse of Representatives to respond to any changes we were to make.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator pro tempore is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The White House has released a report that was prepared by \nthe President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications \nTechnologies. The message is very clear. The message to the NSA is now \ncoming from every branch of government, from every corner of our \nNation: NSA, you have gone too far. The bulk collection of Americans' \ndata by the U.S. Government has to end.\n  The review group came to the same conclusion that I have about the \nutility of the section 215 phone records program, the same conclusion \nthat Judge Leon found just the other day, calling it unconstitutional. \nThey said the section 215 program was ``not essential to preventing \nattacks and could readily have been obtained in a timely manner using \nconventional section 215 orders.''\n  They say what many of us have been saying, that just because we can \ncollect massive amounts of data doesn't mean we should do so.\n  The report states:\n\n       Although we might be safer if the government had ready \n     access to a massive storehouse of information about every \n     detail of our lives, the impact of such a program on the \n     quality of life and on individual freedom would simply be too \n     great.\n\n  Senator Lee, I, and others have legislation to curtail this. I think \nfor the sake of our Nation and the sake of our Constitution we should.\n  In October, I introduced with Senator Lee the USA FREEDOM Act--a \nbipartisan and bicameral bill that ends the dragnet collection of \nAmericans' phone records and recalibrates the government's surveillance \nauthorities. This is commonsense legislation that has broad support \nfrom legislators across the political spectrum, civil liberties groups, \nand technology companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Yahoo.\n  I welcome the report and call on the President to immediately \nconsider implementing the recommendations that can be achieved without \nlegislation. I have invited the members of the President's Review Group \nto testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee next month, and look \nforward to discussing their important recommendations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from the State of \nWashington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The American people are sick and tired of the constant \ncrises that we have seen in Washington, DC, over the past few years. \nThey want us to work together, they want us to solve problems, and they \nwant us to focus on jobs, families, and broad-based economic growth. \nThat is why I am so pleased we are now headed to a final vote on the \nbudget agreement that Chairman Ryan and I reached that breaks through \nthis partisanship and gridlock and shows that Congress can function \nwhen Democrats and Republicans work together to make some compromises \nfor the good of the country.\n  The Bipartisan Budget Act puts jobs and economic growth first by \nrolling back those automatic and harmful cuts to education, medical \nresearch, infrastructure investments, and defense jobs for the next 2 \nyears. If we didn't get a deal, we would have faced another continuing \nresolution that would have locked in those damaging automatic cuts or, \nworse, a potential government shutdown in only a few short weeks.\n  This bill we are about to vote on replaces almost two-thirds of the \ncuts for this year to the domestic discretionary investments and, \nimportantly, it prevents the next round of defense cuts that is \nscheduled to hit in January.\n  It is not going to solve every problem the automatic cuts have \ncaused, but it is a step in the right direction and a dramatic \nimprovement over the status quo.\n  This bill builds on the $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction we have \ndone since 2011 with an additional $23 billion in responsible savings \nacross the Federal budget.\n  Crucially, we protected the fragile economic recovery by spreading \nthe savings out responsibly over the next 10 years and maintained the \nkey precedent that sequestration cannot be replaced with spending cuts \nalone.\n  This bill isn't exactly what I would have written on my own--and I am \npretty sure it is not what Chairman Ryan would have written on his \nown--but it is what the American people have called for, a compromise. \nThat means neither side got everything they wanted and both sides had \nto give a bit.\n  I am hopeful this deal can be a foundation for continued bipartisan \nwork, because we do have a lot of big challenges ahead of us for our \nfamilies and communities that we all represent.\n  As we wind this down and go to a vote in a minute, I especially wish \nto thank my colleague across the aisle, Chairman Ryan, for his work \nwith me over the past 2 months. He stood with courage, an honest \nbroker, and a tough negotiator, but in the end we were able to come to \nan agreement and I wish to commend him for that.\n  I thank ranking member Chris Van Hollen, who worked steadfastly with \nus.\n  I thank Leader Reid and all of our leadership for their support \nthroughout this budget process as we worked to negotiate this deal and \nmove it through the Senate.\n  I also particularly thank the members of the Senate Budget Committee \nwho worked so hard to pass a budget, start a conference, and reach this \nbipartisan deal--Senators Ron Wyden, Bill Nelson, Debbie Stabenow, \nBernie Sanders, Sheldon Whitehouse, Mark Warner, Jeff Merkley, Chris \nCoons, Tammy Baldwin, Tim Kaine, and Angus King. They were great \nmembers of our Budget Committee, and I thank them for their diligent \nwork this year, as well as all of the Republicans on our committee who \nworked so hard with us.\n  Finally, I thank all of our staffs who have spent so many hours on \nputting this together.\n  From my office, Budget Committee staff director Evan Schatz; our \ndeputy staff director John Righter; Budget Committee communications \ndirector Eli Zupnick; my chief of staff Mike Spahn; and all of our \nstaff members, too numerous to mention right now, but I want each and \nevery one of them to know how much I appreciate the intense work they \nput into all of this. I will insert all of their names in the Record.\n  I also thank Chairman Ryan's office: Budget Committee staff director \nAustin Smythe; policy director Jonathan Burks; and many more who helped \nus be successful.\n  I also thank David Krone from Leader Reid's office and Kris Sarri \nfrom the Office of Management and Budget.\n  I thank Director Doug Elmendorf, Bob Sunshine, Pete Fontaine, and all \nof the staff at the Congressional Budget Office for their innumerable \nhard work and support.\n  We are at the end of the time. I urge all of our colleagues now to \nsupport this Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. We are about to put jobs \nand economic growth first and, most importantly, we are going to give \nthe American people back some certainty that they do deserve.\n\n[[Page S8957]]\n\n  Has all postcloture time expired in the motion to concur with respect \nto H.J. Res. 59?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the motion to concur with \nan amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object, I would note this is the \nway the process--the train that runs through this body and denies \namendments to be allowed--occurs. At this point, there will be a move, \nin effect, to clear the tree so this can be passed. It is an unhealthy \ntree we are in, and I am disappointed that we are heading in this \ndirection, but it points out the actual legislative steps that are \nrequired to get to final passage after the leader has filled the tree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Cloture having been invoked, the motion to \nrefer falls.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join Senator Inhofe, \nthe ranking Republican on our committee, in bringing to the floor the \nagreement between the Armed Services Committees of the Senate and the \nHouse on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014.\n  The House passed this bill last week with a vote of 350 to 69, and if \nwe pass it in the Senate, which I am optimistic now that we will, it \nwill mark the 53rd year in a row we have enacted this bill that is so \nessential to the defense of our Nation and to our men and women in \nuniform and their families.\n  I wish to thank all of the members of the Armed Services Committee \nand our staffs. I especially want to thank our subcommittee chairs and \nranking members for the hard work they have done to get us to the \nfinish line on this bill.\n  Of course, I thank Senator Inhofe for the close partnership we have \nhad in leading this committee. We have both had the benefit of a strong \nrelationship\n\n[[Page S8958]]\n\nwith the chairman and ranking member of the House Armed Services \nCommittee, Buck McKeon and Adam Smith, in our endeavor.\n  I share the disappointment of Senators with our inability to vote on \nmore amendments when our committee bill was brought to the Senate floor \na few weeks ago. Senator Inhofe and I spent a week on the Senate floor \nbefore Thanksgiving trying to bring up more amendments and to have them \ndebated and voted on.\n  We tried to reach agreement to limit consideration to defense-related \namendments, but we were unable to do that. We tried to consent to vote \non two sexual assault amendments, the Gillibrand amendment and the \nMcCaskill amendment, which had been fully debated, but we could not get \nconsent to do that. We tried to get consent to adopt a package of 39 \namendments that had been cleared on both sides, but we were unable to \ndo even that.\n  It then became clear, given the Senate schedule, that our only hope \nof enacting a defense bill this year was to negotiate a new bill with \nthe House Armed Services Committee on the basis of two bills: one that \nwas reported out of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and, two, the \nbill that was passed by the House of Representatives, and then we \ndecided we would seek enactment of a new bill in both Houses.\n  That new bill passed the House without amendment. If we fail to pass \nthe same bill, there will be no National Defense Authorization Act this \nyear, with the result being we would deny the Department of Defense \nvital authorities, we would undermine congressional oversight of the \nmilitary, and we would fail in our duty to provide our men and women in \nuniform the support they need and deserve.\n  The bill before us is not a Democratic bill and it is not a \nRepublican bill. It is a bipartisan, bicameral defense bill. It is a \ngood bill and one that deserved the strong support it received in the \nHouse of Representatives and that I hope will receive a strong vote in \nthe Senate tomorrow.\n  The bill includes hundreds of important provisions to ensure that the \nDepartment can carry out its essential national defense missions.\n  Here are just a few examples: Our bill extends the Department of \nDefense authority to pay out combat pay and hardship duty pay.\n  The bill extends supplemental impact aid to help local school \ndistricts educate military children.\n  The bill extends existing military land withdrawals at China Lake, \nChocolate Mountain, and Limestone Hills that would otherwise expire, \nleaving the military without critical testing and training \ncapabilities.\n  The bill includes a new land withdrawal, which is critical to the \nMarines, to expand its training area at 29 Palms.\n  Our bill provides needed funding for the destruction of the Syrian \nchemical weapons stockpile and for efforts of the Jordanian Armed \nForces to secure that country's border with Syria.\n  Our bill enables the Department of Defense to save more than $1 \nbillion by authorizing a number of multiyear contracts.\n  Our bill includes more than 30 provisions, as our Presiding Officer \nwell knows, to address the problem of sexual assault in the military. \nFor example, we provide every military sexual assault survivor a \nspecial victim's counsel--a lawyer who works not for commanders, not \nfor prosecutors or defense attorneys or a court but for the victim.\n  We include strong new protections for survivors, for those people who \nhave been victims, making it a crime under the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice to retaliate against a servicemember who reports a sexual \nassault and requiring that the Department of Defense inspector general \nreview and investigate any allegation of such retaliation.\n\n  Our bill requires that commanders who become aware of a reported \nsexual assault immediately forward that information to criminal \ninvestigators.\n  Our bill ends the ability of commanders to modify findings and \nconvictions for sexual assaults and other serious crimes.\n  Our bill provides that any decision by a commander not to prosecute a \nsexual assault complaint undergoes an automatic review by a higher \ncommand authority, which in nearly all cases would mean a general or a \nflag officer.\n  Our bill includes the Boxer amendment to make the article 32 process \nmore like a grand jury proceeding in which the purpose is to determine \nprobable cause rather than the current process which is used as a \ndiscovery tool by the defense.\n  While this change is not limited to sexual assault cases, it will \nmean the victim of a sexual assault will not have to appear in person \nand be subjected to cross-examination by the defense.\n  As Senators are aware, we were unable to vote on either the \nGillibrand amendment or the McCaskill amendment on the floor because of \nprocedural objections. I hope the Senate will be able to consider and \nvote on both of these important initiatives early next year.\n  Again, relative to sexual assault, our bill does contain \ngroundbreaking reforms that will provide much needed assistance to \nvictims of sexual assault while also helping establish a climate in the \nmilitary in which there is no tolerance for sexual assault or for \nretaliation against those who report it.\n  With regard to Guantanamo, the bill we reported out of the Armed \nServices Committee included both language making it possible to bring \ndetainees to the United States for trial and a provision making it \neasier to transfer detainees back to their home countries. The full \nSenate voted to retain these provisions by a 55-to-43 vote when the \ncommittee-reported bill was on the floor.\n  The compromise we reached includes the House prohibition on bringing \nGitmo detainees to the United States but follows the Senate language \ngenerally, which provides our military greater flexibility to transfer \nGitmo detainees to third countries. As a result, our military will be \nable to make decisions about how long to keep detainees and under what \ncircumstances to transfer them to third countries on the basis of a \nreal-world evaluation of risks rather than the current law, which \nprovides an arbitrary and extreme checklist of certification \nrequirements.\n  We recently received letters from our senior military leaders urging \nus to enact the Defense authorization bill before we leave this year.\n  For example, GEN Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, \nwrote that the authorities included in this bill ``are critical to the \nNation's defense and urgently needed to ensure we all keep faith with \nthe men and women, military and civilian, selflessly serving in our \nArmed Forces.''\n  GEN Ray Odierno, the Army Chief of Staff, told us:\n\n       From authorities that help us prevent and respond to sexual \n     assault, restore readiness, allow for continuous work in our \n     industrial base, and start important military construction \n     projects, this NDAA is critical to your Soldiers, their \n     Families, and the numerous local communities that support our \n     installations.\n\n  ADM Jonathan Greenert, Chief of Naval Operations, stated that pushing \nthe bill into the next year ``would mean critical authorities expire, \nwhich would exacerbate my readiness challenge and jeopardize our \ncommitment to our service men and women.''\n  Gen. James Amos, Commandant of the Marine Corps, wrote:\n\n       Without an NDAA, landmark legislation transforming the \n     Uniform Code of Military Justice and improving the support \n     provided to victims of sexual assault will be lost.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       I am also concerned about the adverse impact on logistical \n     support for Coalition forces in Afghanistan, our ability to \n     retrograde military equipment along the Northern Distribution \n     Network, and the impact on Coalition Support Funds that \n     support ground transportation of supplies and retrograde of \n     equipment through Pakistan.\n\n  Gen. Mark Welsh, the Air Force Chief of Staff wrote:\n\n       The FY 14 NDAA contains critical authorities that enable us \n     to protect the American people while keeping our promise to \n     our active duty, Guard, Reserve, and civilian airmen. If this \n     important legislation is not enacted, I worry about \n     significant impacts to Air Force operations that could \n     jeopardize the missions we are tasked to perform. . . . \n     Simply put, we cannot operate effectively without your help \n     and without the direction that the NDAA provides.\n\n  Gen. Frank Grass, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, told us:\n\n       Failure to enact an NDAA would break faith with our Army \n     and Air Guardsmen by not re-authorizing special pay and \n     bonuses.\n\n[[Page S8959]]\n\n     Also, authorities contained in the NDAA are crucial to \n     maintaining the training, equipment, and opportunities \n     necessary for the National Guard to remain an operational \n     force ready to respond to domestic and overseas \n     contingencies.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in full in the \nRecord.\n\n                                                      .Chairman of\n\n\n                                    the Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 9, 2013.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader: As we enter the final weeks of \n     December, I write to urge you to complete the National \n     Defense Authorization Act this year. The authorities \n     contained therein are critical to the Nation's defense and \n     urgently needed to ensure we all keep faith with the men and \n     women, military and civilian, selflessly serving in our Armed \n     Forces. Allowing the Bill to slip to January adds yet more \n     uncertainty to the force and further complicates the duty of \n     our commanders who face shifting global threats. I also fear \n     that delay may put the entire Bill at risk, protracting this \n     uncertainty and impacting our global influence. For your \n     reference, enclosed is a list summarizing expiring \n     authorities.\n       I deeply appreciate congressional efforts to achieve a \n     budget deal and subsequent appropriations. Your efforts to \n     provide the Joint Chiefs the Time, Certainty, and Flexibility \n     in both our budget and authorities will help ensure we keep \n     our Nation safe from coercion.\n       I appreciate your continued concern for and support of our \n     men and women in uniform.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Martin E.

Harry Reid\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid: Today, your Army has close to 70,000 \n     Soldiers deployed around the world with nearly 40,000 of \n     those brave men and women in combat in Afghanistan and \n     several thousand more in hazardous duty postings such as the \n     Persian Gulf and Horn of Africa. With many of the \n     authorizations for their support and the support to their \n     families set to expire later this month, I believe it is \n     imperative that the Congress pass the National Defense \n     Authorizations Act this December. Our Soldiers and their \n     families require the many authorities that your bill, when \n     passed, will provide for them to accomplish their missions \n     overseas and here at home. For an Army still very much at \n     war, it is vital that the Congress not allow these critical \n     defense authorizations to lapse.\n       The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has laid out the \n     impacts of a lapse in defense authorizations on our Combatant \n     Commanders' operations and on deployed troops. The impacts of \n     not having a defense authorization bill passed in this \n     calendar year will have a significant impact at home as well \n     From authorities that help us prevent and respond to sexual \n     assault, restore readiness, allow for continuous work in our \n     industrial base, and start important military construction \n     projects, this NDAA is critical to your Soldiers, their \n     Families, and the numerous local communities that support our \n     installations. As a nation, we cannot afford to allow those \n     authorities to lapse and delay the implementation of new \n     authorities designed to make our National defense stronger \n     and more effective.\n       With great respect, I urge you to find a way to work with \n     the House in the days remaining prior to the Holiday Recess \n     and pass the NDAA. Given these authorities, I look forward to \n     returning to Congress in the early spring with Secretary \n     McHugh and testifying on the Army's Posture.\n       Thank you for your continued support of our Army, Soldiers, \n     Civilians, and Veterans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Raymond T. Odierno,\n     General, United States Army.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Chief of Naval Operations,\n\n                                                December 12, 2013.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: I am writing to request the expeditious \n     passage of the FY14 National Defense Authorization Act.\n       Early in my tenure as Chief of Naval Operations, I \n     established three tenets for the Navy: ``Warfighting First,'' \n     ``Operate Forward,'' and ``Be Ready.'' In support of these \n     three tenets, I ask that you give every consideration to \n     completing the FY14 NDAA before the end of the year. Passage \n     of the bill will give me the authorities needed to support \n     our Sailors through special pays, allowances, and enlistment \n     and retention bonuses. Sailor readiness is the foundation of \n     Fleet readiness. Support to our Civilians, Sailors, and their \n     Families is central to Sailor readiness. Deferring the NDAA \n     into calendar year 2014 would mean critical authorities \n     expire, which would exacerbate my readiness challenge and \n     jeopardize our commitment to our service men and women.\n       Thank you in advance for your efforts and persistence in \n     passing the FY14 defense authorization bill as soon as \n     feasible.\n     Jonathan W. Greenert.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 December 9, 2013.\n       Dear Leader Reid, I am writing you to express my strongest \n     support for the passage of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act (NDAA) prior to the end of this year This year's NDAA \n     contains authorities critical to our Nation's defense that \n     enable us to protect the American people while keeping our \n     promises to our Marines, Sailors and Civilian Marines. I \n     believe that passage of a National Defense Authorization Act \n     prior to the end of the current calendar year is a national \n     security imperative.\n       As a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I am gravely \n     concerned that, without timely passage of the NDAA, critical \n     authorities will expire. Without an NDAA, landmark \n     legislation transforming the Uniform Code of Military Justice \n     and improving the support provided to victims of sexual \n     assault will be lost. I am also concerned about the adverse \n     impact on logistical support for Coalition forces in \n     Afghanistan, our ability to retrograde military equipment \n     along the Northern Distribution Network, and the impact on \n     Coalition Support Funds that support ground transportation of \n     supplies and retrograde of equipment through Pakistan.\n       As the Commandant of the Marine Corps, I am concerned that \n     failure to pass an NDAA will break faith with our Marines, \n     Sailors and Civilian Marines on authorizations for their pay \n     and benefits. Also, hard-won gains on the Twenty-nine Palms \n     land expansion Senator Feinstein worked so hard over the past \n     seven years to accomplish will be threatened.\n       I thank you for your willingness to reach across the aisle \n     in a timely and creative fashion in order to pass this vital \n     piece of legislation prior to the end of the year. Your \n     continued support for the men and woman that wear our \n     nation's uniform will add certainty to the force and simplify \n     the duties of commanders around the globe who are providing \n     for our common defense.\n       Again, thank you for all you do to support your Marines and \n     Sailors. I\n       remain . . .\n           Semper Fidelis,\n\n                                                James F. Amos,\n\n                                       General, U.S. Marine Corps,\n     Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Department of the Air Force,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 12, 2013.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid: I write to urge Congress to pass the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 (FY14 \n     NDAA) prior to the end of this calendar year. The FY14 NDAA \n     contains critical authorities that enable us to protect the \n     American people while keeping promises to our active duty, \n     Guard, Reserve, and civilian Airmen. If this important \n     legislation is not enacted, I worry about significant impacts \n     to Air Force operations that could jeopardize the missions we \n     are tasked to perform.\n       In addition to serious operational impacts, I am concerned \n     that failure to pass an NDAA, would break faith with Airmen \n     as authorizations for pay and benefits expire. As you know, \n     today's Air Force faces many challenges, and we depend on the \n     NDAA to provide policy direction on a variety of matters, \n     ranging from sexual assault prevention and response to \n     adjusting force structure and\n\n[[Page S8960]]\n\n     manpower to meet future threats, all while complying with \n     budget constraints. Simply put, we cannot operate effectively \n     without your help and without the direction that the NDAA \n     provides.\n       Thank you for your attention to our concerns and for \n     considering action on the FY14 NDAA before this congressional \n     session comes to a close. We are grateful for your continued \n     support for all of the men and women who wear our Nation's \n     uniform.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Mark A. Welsh, III,\n     General, USAF, Chief of Staff.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            National Guard Bureau,\n\n\n                                             Defense Pentagon,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader: I write to you to urge completion \n     of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). I \n     understand you have received similar letters from the Army \n     and Air Force Chiefs of Staff, highlighting the impact a \n     lapse of authorization would have on federalized National \n     Guardsmen. As Chief of the National Guard Bureau, I want to \n     echo these sentiments as well as point out the harmful \n     effects on non-federalized National Guardsmen, military \n     technicians, and their families. Specifically, failure to \n     enact an NDAA would break faith with our Army and Air \n     Guardsmen by not re-authorizing special pay and bonuses. \n     Also, authorities contained in the NDAA are crucial to \n     maintaining the training, equipment, and opportunities \n     necessary for the National Guard to remain an operational \n     force ready to respond to domestic and overseas \n     contingencies.\n       I truly appreciate your efforts to pass an NDAA and \n     Appropriations Bill that support and enable our military to \n     defend our Nation and keep it safe. Thank you for your \n     continued support of all National Guardsmen, civilians, and \n     their families.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Frank J. Grass,\n\n                                        General, U.S. Army, Chief,\n                                            National Guard Bureau.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Finally, we have managed to pass a national defense \nauthorization bill for 52 straight years, including a number of recent \nyears when we were unable to pass a bill in the Senate, and therefore \nunable to go to a traditional conference. That is not best way to \nproceed. I think we all acknowledge that.\n  Our troops, their families, and our Nation's security, deserve a \ndefense bill, and what we are offering to the Senate is the only \npractical way to get a bill passed and enacted.\n  Again, before I yield the floor, I wish to thank Senator Inhofe and \nhis staff who have joined so closely with myself and all of the members \nof the Armed Services Committee and our staff to make it possible to \nget, as I said before, this close to the finish line.\n  I am confident we are going to cross that finish line because of the \nhard work of our members. I want to especially point out our \nsubcommittee chairs and the ranking members as well as all of the \nmembers of the Armed Services Committee, including Senator Blumenthal, \nwho at this moment is presiding over the Senate and has personally \nplayed such an important role in getting us to where we are.\n  With that, and again with my thanks to Senator Inhofe, I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, I wish to say the same thing. It \nsounds as though it is all rehearsed, but it is not. It is actually a \nreality that I have always felt I could call and talk to the chairman \nabout things we might not have in common--although I can only remember \none issue where we were on opposite sides, but we have our reasons for \nbeing on opposite sides. Unless we work those out, then between John \nBonsell and Peter, it is always a joy to be able to call and know I am \nreaching the top and we are going to be able to come up with a \ndecision.\n\n  I talked to a lot of the Republicans who voted against this, and I \nwant the chairman to be aware of this. I think almost all of them who \nvoted against it voted that way for one reason; that is, the process. \nThey wanted to have amendments. They are entitled to amendments. I \nthink we said that over the last 10 years we have averaged 9 days of \ndebate on this most significant bill each year. That is an average. We \nhave had about 100 amendments on average. So that is something both the \nchairman and I agree should have happened, but it just didn't happen. \nWe can't really blame one side more than the other.\n  Then, of course, when the nuclear option came, that got things pretty \nhostile here, and unfortunately what suffered was our bill.\n  I feel strongly that we have a good bill. In fact, a lot of people \ndon't know how this process works when we cannot get a bill through the \nHouse and/or the Senate to make it a reality, and I had to go through \nthis one year when I was on the House Armed Services Committee. Then \nthey had the big four; that is, the chairman and the ranking member of \nthe Senate and the chairman and the ranking member of the House, get \ntogether and put this together. That may not be the process--in fact, \nit is not the process we wanted--but the choice became, do we have a \nbill or do we not have a bill, and we have gotten down to that choice.\n  What I tried to do, and I failed--I am embarrassed to say I failed \nwith many of our Republicans in explaining to them what would happen if \nwe don't have a bill. I started writing what the chairman talked about \nthat is in this bill, and I couldn't keep up. He was too fast. But I \nwould like to mention a couple of things that I think perhaps were not \nmentioned.\n  Of course, we did cover Gitmo, and I look at it just a little bit \ndifferently than the chairman does. I like the restoration of the 1-\nyear prohibition on the transferring of the detainees to the United \nStates. That was a 12-month provision we had last time that we tried to \nget in, and we actually addressed this in our bill. But in this bill--\nthe substitute bill we just voted on--I think it is very important and \nsomething I feel very strongly about.\n  On the sexual assault, we had both Senators McCaskill and Gillibrand, \nand I recall both of them saying: Well, this isn't everything I wanted. \nBut they both thought it sure was a lot better than not having a bill. \nSo I think we have done a good job there.\n  I always pick out one area that shows how much this would cost. If we \nlook at the CVN-78--75 percent finished right now, $12 billion spent on \nit now--and if we didn't have this bill, I am sure we would try to do \nsomething, but work would stop, and people would be laid off. It would \nhave then cost a lot more to wind things up and get back into it. When \nI say ``a lot more,'' we are talking about millions of dollars more. So \nthat is one of the great victories we have.\n  The one aspect so many of my constituents are concerned about that I \nthink needs to be called to everyone's attention that is in this bill \nis the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty. I remember back when we had the bill \nthat didn't ultimately pass, but we had an all-night session, and at 5 \no'clock in the morning I passed my amendment that would preclude us \nfrom getting involved in that treaty. This was after our Secretary of \nState had already signed this treaty. We had 53 votes. We had all the \nRepublicans and six of the Democrats vote in favor of that. That didn't \npass, but it is very important that we address that, not just to \nprotect Second Amendment rights but also to protect our ability to help \nour allies without having to go through the United Nations. And we have \nthat provision in here, which is very significant.\n  On the BRAC, BRAC is controversial. I was opposed to the last BRAC \nround. My feeling at that time was that we were getting the force \nstructure down artificially low, and I didn't feel comfortable bringing \ndown the infrastructure to meet that because I was hoping we would be \nable to--that is the same reason I would not want to have a BRAC round \nright now. We have never been in such a critical fiscal condition in \nsupporting our military as we are today.\n  One thing that is certain about BRAC rounds is that we can debate \nabout how much ultimately they will save, but everybody knows what it \ncosts in the first 5 years, and these are the first 5 years that we \nreally can't afford it, particularly the first year.\n  The last thing I would mention is something I felt more strongly \nabout than I think most of the rest of them did, and that is how much \nwe have spent on these drop-in fuels, the biofuels, and we have \nlanguage here that would say we would not do it unless they are cost-\ncompetitive. That is a huge issue to me personally.\n  The last two I would like to mention--people say in my conference, a \nlot of them are saying: Well, what is going to happen on December 31 if \nwe don't pass the bill? I have a long list of expirations here that I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record. I will only \nmention three of them. One is on the aviation officer retention bonus.\n\n[[Page S8961]]\n\n  I think we all know and most of us believe that we made a mistake in \nApril when we shut down some of our squadrons and about a third of our \nfighter squadrons for a period of about 3 months. General Walsh \npresented a very persuasive case that it costs a lot more to get them \nback to current, as we started to do in July, than the money that was \nsaved during the time they were down. I think we lost a lot of aviators \nat that time because they were grounded, they weren't flying, and they \njust decided they would go into the private sector.\n  If we take away the aviation officer retention bonus, that is going \nto accelerate the lost number of people who would otherwise stay in the \nmilitary. That would have gone away on the 31st of December. I don't \nknow how many of the aviators we would lose, but I do know this: It is \na $25,000 bonus, and the difference between retraining and retaining is \nhuge. We can retain them, if the bonus would influence them, for \n$25,000, but retraining, to get to the optimum--the first level being \nthe F-22--is about $7.5 million, but there is another $9 million to get \nto the top proficiency. That means $17 million as opposed to $25,000. \nSo I think we need to in the future always keep track of retraining and \nretaining.\n  The health care professional bonus would end on December 31. Why is \nthat important? Because a lot of these people who are taking care of \nour wounded warriors--not just at the hospitals but also after they \nleave--have special pay to take care of our wounded warriors, those who \nhave made the sacrifices, and that would have ended on December 31.\n  The reenlistment bonus for Active members would also end. I remember \nfrom my military days that when people were getting ready to leave, \nthey looked at the bonus, and that is there to encourage them to stay. \nSo it is not just aviators; it is the ground guys and gals too.\n  So we have done a lot. I really appreciate that opportunity.\n  The last thing I will say--and I will ask my staff to put up the \npicture--this is my appeal to the minority leader and the majority \nleader. We could play the game and extend this and be here until \nmidnight, I guess, on Thursday night. It happens that tomorrow is my \n54th wedding anniversary, and I would really like to ask both the \nmajority and the minority if we couldn't yield back a little bit of \ntime. We know we are going to have the votes for this. I would sure \nlike help. Those 20 kids and grandkids are waiting for me for a big \ndinner on our 54th wedding anniversary tomorrow night. So have mercy, \ngive us a break, and let's try to get this voted on and go home. And \nMerry Christmas to everybody.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  NDAA Authorities Expiring on 31 Dec\n\n\n                  Travel and transportation allowances\n\n          Military Special Pay & Bonuses provided by FY13 NDAA\n\n       Reenlistment bonus of active members\n       Healthcare Professional bonus and special pays\n       Reserve forces bonus and special pays\n       Nuclear Officers Bonus and special pays\n       Assignment pay or special duty pay\n       Skill incentive pay or proficiency bonus\n       Retention incentives for critical military skill or \n     assigned to high priority units\n       Aviation officer retention bonus\n       Assignment incentive pay\n       Enlisted bonus\n       Accession bonus for new officers in critical skills\n       Incentive bonus for conversion to military occupational \n     specialty to ease personnel shortage\n       Incentive bonus for transfer between armed forces\n       Accession bonus for officer candidates\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I surely join Senator Inhofe in the plea \nthat his time and much of the time between now and the 30-hour end \npoint be yielded back. Somehow or other, I hope our leaders can manage \nthat for not just Senator Inhofe's 54th wedding anniversary--I thought \nI was a heroic figure; my wife is more heroic than I--because we have \nbeen married 52 years.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Oh, you will make it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. She is the hero. But in any event, I surely join in that \nrequest.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a full list of our \nminority and majority staff who have given so much of themselves and \ntheir families be printed in the Record, including Peter Levine, John \nBonsell, and then all of the other staff members, both the majority and \nminority staff.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Peter K.

Mr. President, I again thank all of the members of our \ncommittee and staff who worked--I don't know how to describe the effort \nthat every year is put into our authorization bill. It is a round \nnumber--52, maybe now 53 years. It is a big number. It doesn't say what \neach year--each month of every year--our staffs put into the annual \nauthorization bill. It is an extraordinary effort that they make. \nSenator Inhofe and our colleagues and I watch them really with \namazement because of what they give up to accomplish this. We are not \nquite there yet. We have to have a final passage vote. I hope it comes \na lot earlier than late tomorrow.\n\n\n                 energy savings performance contracting\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, the Department of Defense is the largest \nsingle consumer of facilities energy in the Nation and spends more than \n$4 billion a year to power military installations. Energy management is \nvery important to DoD's mission, both as a matter of conservation and \nthe proper stewardship of funds provided by Congress.\n  In recent years, the Department of Defense has made significant \nprogress in reducing energy use on military installations. In fiscal \nyear 2012, the Department achieved a 17.7 percent reduction in energy \nuse from the fiscal year 2003 baseline established by law in the Energy \nIndependence and Security Act of 2007. In addition to direct \ninvestment, the Department's use of energy savings performance \ncontracting and utility energy savings contracting has historically \nplayed an important role in the achievement of the Department's \nfacility energy management objectives. Energy Savings Performance \nContracts, commonly known as ESPCs, provide private sector financing \nfor energy improvements at government facilities, with that investment \npaid back over time from the agency's utility bill savings. As part of \na broad administration effort established in 2011 to improve Federal \nenergy efficiency, the Department has committed to award $1.2 billion \nin performance-based contracts by the end of 2013.\n  I would pose a question to my colleague, the ranking member of the \nfull committee and a manager of the bill, Senator Inhofe, who has long \nbeen a supporter of performance contracting, about this matter and \nwhether he believes the Department can do more.\n\n[[Page S8962]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire, \nthe chair of the Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support, for \nher question. I am a strong supporter of energy performance contracts \nthat provide maximum savings for the Federal Government. It is my \nunderstanding that the components of the Department of Defense have \nidentified additional opportunities for energy conservation and energy \ndemand management that could benefit from performance contracting, \nHowever, in order to maximize taxpayer savings, it is vital that DoD \ncontract for those projects that provide the greatest return on \ninvestment as opposed to directing the use of certain mandated energy \nsources without an assessment of relative costs over the life cycle of \nthe project. I join with the Senator from New Hampshire to strongly \nencourage the Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the military \ndepartments to increase the use and streamline the administration of \nenergy savings performance and utility energy savings contracting \nvehicles that will incorporate the most efficient and effective energy \nsystems in order to maximize the reduction of operational costs, to \nconserve energy resources, and to improve the efficiency of building \nsystems. I hope my colleague will join with me as part of our oversight \nresponsibilities for the committee that we ensure energy performance \ncontracts carried out by the Department of Defense meet the intent of \nthe President's executive order of December 2011 to maximize cost \nreductions for the Federal Government by promoting projects to offer \nthe greatest return on investment.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma and I \nlook forward to working with him to improve DoD's management practices \nin this area.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I too wish to congratulate the Senator from \nOklahoma and Kay for their 54th wedding anniversary. It is quite a \nlandmark for an outstanding couple. I hope they get to celebrate on \ntheir day. I think that probably, if we knew the final vote on this was \ngoing to be the end of the whole process before Christmas, it probably \nwould include time yielded back. But if there are going to be a whole \nbunch of things thrown in that really have relatively little importance \nbefore the end of the year, the Senator probably won't get his wish. So \nI am hoping we can end it with this bill.\n  I rise to express my disappointment that this National Defense \nAuthorization Act on which we will soon be having a final vote is the \nproduct of another deal instead of the result of discussion, debate, \nand amendment process on the floor. Once again, the Senate has failed \nto do its job. The Senate majority leader has blocked all but two \namendments to this NDAA from consideration, and those were to prevent \nany other amendments from happening. That is not right. That is not the \nway we used to do it. If we want to know what is wrong with the Senate \nand why people of all political persuasions are upset with Congress, \nthat is a big part of the answer right there--no amendments allowed.\n  Here we are at the end of the year--this didn't have to come at the \nend of the year. In fact, I never remember us debating it this late in \nthe year.\n  Incidentally, this is the only committee that gets a bill every year. \nThe other committees have to fight for some time and hopefully have a \npersuasive enough bill to get it. But every year I have been here, we \nhave debated this National Defense Authorization Act, and it is \nimportant.\n  There are two primary things we are charged with, and one is spending \nfor the United States and the other is national defense. And this is \nabout the national defense. It shouldn't be crowded into 30 hours or \neven 1 week. There ought to be the ability to express what we think is \nimportant dealing with national defense, and we are not being allowed \nto do that.\n  This is an important bill for our country. There are a lot of \nimportant issues in it that we need to discuss. We haven't considered \nissues relating to our nuclear deterrent, to privacy concerns related \nto the National Security Administration, to detention of U.S. citizens, \nand the need to address sexual assault in the military, or a number of \nother important issues. In the past, we have spent multiple weeks on \nthe Defense bill and considered dozens of amendments. That is what we \nshould be doing this year too.\n  I understand we have come up against this December 31 deadline and \nhow critical that is. That should not have happened. Our national \nsecurity needs to be fully debated, and it needs to be debated by the \nwhole Senate.\n  Every voice needs to be heard. That means every constituent out there \nwhom we represent has to have at least an opportunity to have their \ninterests reflected in this national bill. We all have some military in \nour States, and it is very important. That is how it is supposed to \nhappen, and that is the way the Senate does its best work.\n  One of the things that have been holding it up, of course, are the \nnominations. Most of those nominations did not have urgency to them. \nThey could have been done next year without hurting the United States \nat all--not the case with the National Defense Authorization Act. So we \ndo not have priorities on what we are debating around here, and then we \nhave limits because of the timeframe. It is not right.\n  One of those important issues we are skipping over is the nuclear \ndeterrent. I offered several amendments on this issue because I believe \nthe administration is playing a dangerous game with national security. \nThe solution I proposed in my amendment was simple and straightforward. \nIt would have ensured that American citizens and our allies would not \nbe harmed by this administration's bad policy decisions--both today and \nfor years to come--by ensuring that any further reductions in our \nnuclear arsenal could not be done by the administration unilaterally.\n  As background, here in the Senate I have the honor of representing \nthe city of Cheyenne, WY, which is the home of F.E. Warren Air Force \nBase and the 90th ICBM Missile Wing. Those who proudly serve there have \nan awesome responsibility and a history of doing excellent work. We \nhave entrusted the most powerful of our weaponry to the best, to the \nmost capable of managing these weapons in a thoroughly professional and \nreliable manner. Every day, the top-notch men and women who are \nstationed at F.E. Warren work together to maintain the world's most \npowerful military force, our ICBMs. Seven days a week, 24 hours a day, \nthey stand guard to ensure our safety and our freedom. They maintain a \nconstant vigil from which they can never stand down because their \nmission is that critical. In a very real sense, that is why each one of \nus is able to sleep well at night. Moms and dads and grandpas and \ngrandmas all across America know that when they tuck their kids in at \nnight, someone is on duty and will continue to be watching through the \nlonely hours of the night to make sure their little ones are safe and \nsecure.\n  Unfortunately, there are those in the administration who take the \ncontributions of our military for granted. They do not have the sense \nof history that is needed to fully appreciate why these weapons were \ndesigned and put into operation in the first place. They do not see how \nmuch they are needed today and will still be needed tomorrow to ensure \nour future. They do not fully appreciate the key role they have played \nin the past either. They seem to think that nuclear weapons are part of \na bygone era, a relic of the past that has not been needed since the \nCold War ended.\n  The adoption of such a position is dangerous because it takes our \nposition of strength for granted. What they fail to understand is the \npower of this deterrent and how it has kept us safe for decades. In the \npast, any nation that gave even a casual thought to threatening us or \ntrying to do us harm had to quickly shelve those plans when the \nrealization of what they would be up against was made clear. That is, \nafter all, the point of having these weapons. That is one of the \nreasons why they are necessary. They have served us well ever since \nthey were first deployed.\n  The administration's views on our nuclear deterrent should not come \nas a surprise to any of us who have watched the development of these \nideas when they were first offered for consideration. We have seen \nPresident Obama promise to do all he can to reduce our nuclear \narsenal--step by step. First, he rammed the New START treaty through \nthe Senate by promising commitments that he ultimately did not\n\n[[Page S8963]]\n\nkeep. One of those was the promise to modernize our nuclear force, \nwhich we are still waiting on. I voted against ratification of the New \nSTART treaty because I believe maintaining a strong nuclear force is a \ncritical part of protecting our country. It still is.\n  The Obama administration has stated its intention to reduce the \nnumber of deployed nuclear warheads to as few as 1,000, which would be \n550 fewer than is allowed under that New START treaty. What is more, in \nthe factsheet on the Nuclear Posture Review Implementation Study, it \nstates that the President could go outside the formal treaty-making \nprocess and reduce our nuclear arsenal unilaterally. That has ``bad \nidea'' written all over it. It means the administration can still make \ndrastic nuclear reductions even if Russia will not agree to do the \nsame. Does that make any sense? Should we just bargain with ourselves? \nThat is something which should give us all pause and encourage us to go \non record as to what needs to be done to keep our people safe.\n  In case you think I am overreacting, last year President Obama was \ncaught on an open microphone promising former Russian President Dmitry \nMedvedev that he would have more flexibility to negotiate on nuclear \ndefense issues after his election. Those comments are still before us, \nand they do not exactly instill trust and confidence that the President \nwill not choose to bypass Congress and act unilaterally on nuclear \nreductions.\n  All we have to do is look around the world to see why we should be \nconcerned. Everywhere we look, nations are looking to increase, not \ndecrease, their weaponry. In fact, as the President makes plans for \nreducing our own nuclear arsenal, it appears Russia and China are \nlooking for ways to modernize and update their own arsenals.\n  These are dangerous weapons, and we need to be certain we do \neverything we can to ensure that they continue to be fully monitored. \nThey must never be used. But it seems to me that the best way to make \ncertain they are never used is to be certain that no one would ever \ndare to think of using them against us or our allies.\n  The concerns I have that some other country might use these weapons \nfirst are increased, not decreased, when I see the administration \nsending signals that they might not wait for everyone to disarm; they \nmight do it on their own first. It would be like taking your own team \noff the field and allowing the other team to score at will. Relying on \nthe good will of the opponent rarely works, and it is clearly not a \ngood strategy.\n  One final point. We are not the only ones who are relying on our \nnuclear arsenal for our safety and security. There are other countries \nthat rely on the United States for their national security. If we make \nit clear that we are dropping out of this vital source of our strength \nas a nation, this could encourage other countries to increase their own \nnuclear capability because they will suspect that they can no longer \nrely on us. Increasing the number of nations that have a nuclear \ncapability is clearly something we dare not encourage.\n\n  Simply put, this is exactly what my amendment was trying to stop. It \nwould have ensured that any further reductions in our nuclear arsenal \ncould not be done on a unilateral basis by the President alone. \nInstead, any changes would have to follow the application of the treaty \nsystem, which would give the Senate an opportunity to weigh in on this \nmatter again when a proposal in the form of a treaty is brought before \nus for our consideration.\n  Just as ridiculous, the President threatened a veto if the amendment \nwere in the bill. Now, unfortunately, due to the majority leader's \nactions, we are not going to be able to debate this and other important \nissues like I mentioned before--the privacy issue at the National \nSecurity Agency, the NSA listening in on telephone calls; the detention \nof U.S. citizens; addressing sexual assault in the military; and a \nnumber of others.\n  For all of these reasons, I cannot support moving forward on the \nDefense bill. I hope that on our next Defense authorization bill we \nwill all recognize the importance of being allowed to fully debate \nthese issues, so we will not wait until the end of the year when there \nis this looming deadline regarding bonuses, so our men and women in \nuniform can continue to fulfill their mission of keeping our Nation \nsafe, secure, and free, knowing what their future is.\n  Something as important as the Defense authorization bill must not be \ndrafted or taken up for a vote until it has made it through the whole \nlegislative process. The legislative process was created for a reason, \nand we do ourselves and our constituents and those who serve in our \nArmed Forces a disservice when we fail to make full use of it. The bill \nhas not made it through each step of the process. In my opinion, that \nis a fatal flaw. We can do better. We need to do better. We better do \nbetter in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. The budget agreement that we passed is an important step \nforward for our country and for our government. I know Chairman Patty \nMurray worked tremendously hard to get to a conference in the first \nplace and to reach this agreement with the House. I commend Chairman \nMurray for all of her work.\n  The U.S. Government has been lurching from crisis to manufactured \ncrisis and using short-term stopgaps to fund the government. The threat \nof a shutdown and the lack of uncertainty has hurt our economy and has \neroded the American people's confidence in our ability to solve \nproblems.\n  It is our job to produce a budget and to figure out a way to work \ntogether and not shut the government down. That is what the people \nexpect of responsible leaders in a divided government.\n  This budget agreement is the way to move forward. It ends the \nreckless threats of government shutdown and lays a clear path to end \nsequestration.\n  The sequester hit my home State of Hawaii very hard. The across-the-\nboard arbitrary cuts from sequester have been devastating for our \nmiddle-class families and to our economy.\n  I wish to read a letter that I received from a professor at the \nUniversity of Hawaii at Manoa in September.\n  He wrote:\n\n       I was contacted today, as I often am, by a student wanting \n     to join our graduate program in the Department of Geology and \n     Geophysics.\n       Unfortunately, I had to tell this student that funding for \n     accepting new students is low right now, which may make it \n     impossible for me to accept him as a graduate student, \n     despite his excellent qualifications.\n       This exchange reminded me that one source of the problem is \n     the budget cuts to NSF (and other science funding agencies) \n     that are the result of sequestration. The current situation \n     is having the following impacts, which are happening right \n     now at research centers nationwide, including UH Manoa:\n       Many scientific workers are being laid off or are not being \n     hired--this includes individuals in Honolulu.\n       Research groups are being forced to cut infrastructure that \n     took decades to build.\n       Some scientific discoveries that could help our society are \n     not being made.\n       Some bright young students are not being given \n     opportunities to advance their scientific careers.\n       I think that this last point is the saddest result because, \n     it negatively impacts the hopes and dreams of many young \n     people.\n       Furthermore, these students are the future of our \n     scientific workforce--people that will be leading us toward \n     the innovation and problem-solving that is crucial for our \n     country's future.\n\n  This professor urged me and this Congress to do everything that we \ncan to roll back the sequester. That is one of the many reasons why I \nsupported the budget today.\n  Sequestration caused Federal workers to be furloughed or laid off \nthroughout Hawaii. Sequestration hurt our national defense, U.S. \ncompetitiveness, and harmed education programs.\n  Head Start in Hawaii had to cut children from its programs this year. \nThis early education program is critical for\n\n[[Page S8964]]\n\na young child's success later in life. Some of these kids and parents \ndon't have other options without Head Start.\n  Without this budget agreement, there would have been an additional \n$20 billion cut to our defense programs hitting next month. Those \ndefense cuts are going to disproportionately hurt my home State of \nHawaii. Without this budget agreement, 25,000 Federal civilian workers \nin Hawaii could be furloughed or laid off.\n  Hawaii can't afford that. I voted for this budget to prevent those \ncuts.\n  The bipartisan budget agreement finally provides relief from the \nsequester and a path forward to get our economy on the right track. \nMost importantly, the budget protects Social Security and Medicare \nbenefits.\n  Although this budget is the right choice for many reasons, we know it \nis not perfect. I do believe we need to work together to improve parts \nof it.\n  I find it unacceptable and inexplicable that the House of \nRepresentatives left town for the holidays without extending long-term \nunemployment benefits, and I know we are working on making it a \npriority as soon as we return in January.\n  In addition, Senator Shaheen has introduced legislation--which I am \nproud to support and cosponsor--to protect military retirees from the \ncost-of-living pay adjustment. The cost-of-living pay adjustment won't \ntake effect until January of 2015, which means that we have time to fix \nthis issue, but we must fix this issue.\n  This legislation that I am cosponsoring with Senator Shaheen will \nfully pay for the change by closing a loophole that some companies are \nusing to avoid paying U.S. taxes with offshore tax havens. This is a \ncommonsense fix that I believe we can get bipartisan support for. We \nneed a long-term budget, but not at the expense of our military \nretirees.\n  We can replace the money raised by closing this tax loophole that \nsome companies are abusing. We have time to fix this issue, and we have \nto do so before 2015. But now is the time to move forward, to protect \njobs, and to give our country some economic certainty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to address the dire \nnational security situation and the responsibility of this body to pass \na national defense authorization bill this year.\n  Congress has passed this legislation for each of the last 51 years, \nalways with broad bipartisan support. This year should be no different. \nOur service men and women are deployed around the globe in defense of \nour Nation. They put themselves in harm's way to further the American \nprinciples of freedom and democracy, yet we have failed to provide \nthese men and women and our senior military leaders the fiscal \ncertainty and legal authorities they need to complete their vital \nmissions.\n  Instead, we have a Senate majority intent on fundamentally altering \nthe way the Senate conducts business by pushing through bills without a \nfull and open process. This is not the way the Senate was designed to \nfunction.\n  This year's National Defense Authorization Act was reported out of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee on June 20 of this year. Since that \ntime it has been delayed time and again by the Senate majority leader \nas our Defense leaders struggle to implement our national security \nstrategy. General Dempsey recently transmitted to congressional \nleadership an itemized list of 26 authorities that will expire at the \nend of this year or shortly thereafter. We are not talking about \nlegislating ancillary programs or nonessential functions, we are \ntalking about military special pay and bonuses for deployed \nservicemembers, funds to transition security responsibilities to our \nAfghan partners, and critical counterinsurgency programs in the Middle \nEast, as well as funding for our intelligence community.\n  While I support the underlying bill, I am deeply disappointed with \nthe process that got us to this point and thus why I did not vote to \ninvoke cloture. Frankly, I had several amendments I would like to have \nadded to this bill addressing such issues as a technical correction \ngiving Reservists and National Guardsmen proper credit toward \nretirement for time spent deployed, and an important land transfer of \nCamp Merrill in Georgia between the Army and the U.S. Forest Service.\n  I have seen many changes during my years in the Senate, but among \nthose is a disturbing trend regarding the NDAA. We seem to be operating \non the premise of fewer, faster, and later. By fewer, I mean fewer \namendments. All Senators deserve the opportunity to amend this \nimportant piece of legislation. The 20-year average is 140 amendments \nper year. Last year we were only able to pass 106 amendments. This year \nwe debated one.\n  As we have seen time and time again, the majority uses the amendment \ntree to shut down debate and move the bill quicker through the Senate. \nMy colleagues and I have filed over 500 amendments to this year's NDAA. \nThrough hard work and bipartisan support, the two Armed Services \nCommittee staffs have striven to accommodate the concerns of the \nSenate. But even so, there are pressing issues that require full and \ndeliberative debate in the Senate. These include military sexual \nassault, counterterrorism and detention policy, and sanctions against \nthose regimes that would do America harm, including Iran.\n  By faster, I mean the bill spends less time on the Senate floor. The \n20-year average is over 9 days, with a maximum of 19 days for the \nfiscal year 2008 bill. The 1 day we spent on this bill in November is \ninsufficient time to debate the critical security issues confronting \nour Nation.\n  The Senate majority has gone to great lengths to keep the bill off \nthe floor. When they could no longer avoid it, they have compressed the \ntimeline for consideration or recommitted it to the Armed Services \nCommittee. This is unprecedented and it is totally unacceptable.\n  By later, I mean a lack of urgency to take up the bill after \ncommittee action. Looking back over the last 40 years, the Senate has \ngone from passing the NDAA consistently before August to later and \nlater in the year. Last year, it was December. This year we are running \nup against the end of the year.\n  I am deeply disappointed at the recent turn of events in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S8965]]\n\nUnder the guise of streamlining the legislative process, the Senate \nmajority has effectively blocked critical legislative priorities such \nas the National Defense Authorization Act. I urge my Senate colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to work together to discharge the \nfundamental duties our constituents, servicemembers, and veterans \ndemand of us. We should dispose of the fewer, faster, and later \nmentality and return Congress to regular order.\n  Leadership matters. No one knows this better than our men and women \nin uniform. The Constitution of the United States tasks us with \nproviding for the common defense. I fear we have failed in our \nconstitutional obligation, and this failure is a failure of leadership, \nplain and simple.\n  With that being said, I want to pay a particular compliment to \nChairman Levin as well as to Ranking Member Inhofe for their \nleadership, which has not failed the country nor has it failed this \nbody. They got together and produced a bill that came out of our \ncommittee in due course after a full and open debate on many critical \nissues, with the understanding we would have the opportunity on the \nfloor of the Senate to file amendments, debate those amendments, and \nhave up-or-down votes.\n  Chairman Levin has been more than accommodating throughout the \nprocess, before and after the time the bill came out of the Armed \nServices Committee. Likewise, Senator Inhofe has been more than \naccommodating in making sure Members on this side of the aisle had free \nand open access to the debate process. They have provided the kind of \nleadership we expect.\n  Unfortunately, the majority leader has made a decision to cram this \ndown the throats of the Senate, and from a national security standpoint \nthat is simply not the way this body is designed to work or should \nwork.\n  I will support the passage of this bill, because I think the end \nproduct, amazingly enough, has turned out to be a pretty good product. \nCould it have been better? You bet. Could the process have been better? \nWithout question. I just wish we had had the opportunity to debate the \nserious issues that are on the minds of a number of Members of the \nSenate when it comes to national security, and that we had had the \nopportunity to present amendments that would have made this strong bill \neven stronger and to provide our men and women in uniform and the \nleadership at the Pentagon with the tools they need to be sure we \nremain the world's strongest military power and that we are able to not \nonly defend America and Americans but to provide for freedom and \ndemocracy around the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to engage for perhaps the next \n20 or so minutes with Senator Cantwell, who is arriving shortly. I will \nbegin with some remarks and ask unanimous consent for us to engage in a \ncolloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I am here today to talk about the health care problem \nin the country, because I think the fixation of this body on the health \ncare Web site has taken our eye off the fact we have a very significant \nand fundamental health care problem.\n  This graph represents how much we spend on health care as a country. \nIt begins back here in 1960. I was 5 years old in 1960. So this is a \nlifetime: 50-some years, $27.4 billion. That is what we spent on health \ncare. Now here we are. This is up to 2011, and $2.7 trillion is what we \nspend on health care. It is 100 times as much in 50 years. Granted, \nthere are more Americans but not 100 times as many.\n  This has been an explosive cost growth curve. When we were trying to \npass the health care bill, that is what we were looking at for costs. \nIt is a big competitive problem for our country.\n  This is a really interesting graph. I wish every time anybody talked \nabout health care they would take 1 minute and look at this graph. I \nwill explain briefly what it is.\n  This column is the up access and measures life expectancy in years, \ncountry by country, 65 to 85, where countries fall in terms of their \naverage life expectancy for their population, for their citizens. This \nalong the bottom is the cost, the health spending per capita per person \nin that country. So if you measure it all out, what you see is a great \nraft of countries all through here: Japan, Great Britain, Netherlands, \nSwitzerland, Norway, Italy, Greece. There is a whole large group of \ncountries right here, and all of them have a life expectancy 80 or \nolder and they all spend between $6,000 and $2,000 per person on their \ncountry's health care. Essentially the entire modernized, civilized \nworld is in that zone, from here to here.\n  Guess where the United States of America is. Boom. Here. We are below \nthem all in life expectancy. We are trailing the pack of modern \nindustrialized nations in our life expectancy. We are competing with \nChile and the Czech Republic. But Japan, Greece, Great Britain, France, \nGermany, Luxembourg, all manage with their health care systems to \nachieve longer lifespans for their people. And we are doing it at a \ncost of about $8,500 per person per year.\n  To give a comparison, here are Switzerland and Norway. They are the \nother two most expensive countries in the world per capita on health \ncare spending, and they are at about $5,700 per year. If we could bring \nour per capita health care spending in this country down to the most \nexpensive countries in the world, if we could compete head to head with \nthe most expensive countries in the world, we would save more than $1 \ntrillion a year.\n  This is an interesting graph because it shows basically all the \nmodern industrialized nations here, and it shows us here as a way \noutlier. It is a big deal for us to be an outlier here, because it \nmeans we blow about $1 trillion a year in wasteful and unnecessary \nhealth care which could be building infrastructure, solving problems, \nreducing the deficit, and could be doing other work. Instead, we spend \nit on a health care system which doesn't produce good health care \nresults--at least not measured by life expectancy, which is a pretty \ngood proxy.\n  There is a huge $1 trillion a year cost to our society in being that \nbad of an outlier. The cost is also measured in lost lives and lost \nyears of life, because we are averaging 77 years and these countries \nare averaging 82 years of life.\n  We have a real problem on our hands, and obsessing about a Web site \nis a complete distraction from getting after this problem--5 years off \nevery human's life in this country and $1 trillion a year. That is \nworth paying attention to.\n  The health care changes we brought are actually making a difference. \nHere are some interesting graphs. Each one is a projection done by the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office of what health care costs are \ngoing to look like in the future, and what you see is a progression. \nThey did this graph in August of 2010. This was where they projected \nhealth care spending would go when they projected in August of 2010 for \nthis period, from 2014 onward to the next decade. A year later they \nwent back and they projected again, and they projected actually costs \nwould be lower. Then they came back in August of 2012 and they did \nanother projection, and their projection showed that these anticipated \ncosts went down again, every year, lower and lower.\n  Here is the big one. In May of this year, the Congressional Budget \nOffice went back and redid its projections for Medicare and Medicaid \nspending from 2014 to 2023. Look how far below what they had projected \n1 year ago, 2 years ago, and 3 years ago the current projection. That \nis a saving of about $1.2 trillion in that decade.\n  That is a long way from $1 trillion a year we could be saving if we \njust got back to where we were on this graph, if we got back from here \nto where Switzerland and Norway, the most expensive countries in the \nworld, are. That is $1 trillion over 1 year. This is $1.2 trillion over \n10 years, but it is still a big change and it is still moving in the \nright direction. So we shouldn't be too quick to condemn ObamaCare when\n\n[[Page S8966]]\n\nthat kind of savings is already being projected.\n  The last slide I will show before I go to Senator Cantwell, who has \nbeen good enough to join us, is this one. Why might it be that those \ncosts went down so far in May of 2013? Why might it be that graph of \nprojected costs keeps going down? It is because of changes in what is \ngoing on in the health care system.\n  This is one good example. This shows the hospital readmission rate \nfrom January of 2007 until August of 2013. This is how often somebody \nwas discharged from the hospital, went home, and then within 30 days \nhad to come back and be readmitted.\n  That could potentially be for a completely new reason, but usually it \nis because the discharge planning wasn't done well enough and there was \na bad handoff between the hospital and the primary care physician or \nthe nursing home. What we found is you could make that transition much \nbetter for patients. When you do, guess what. They don't get sent back \nto the hospital. When they don't get sent back to the hospital, you \nsave money.\n  That is just one way the kind of huge $1.2 trillion over 10-year \nsavings CBO has already projected could be taking place, but this is \nclearly a part of it. It is improving the quality of care so people \naren't going back into the hospital, aren't going to the emergency \nroom, and you avoid that cost at all by having handled the patient \nbetter, by having given them better treatment and better care.\n  It is pretty astounding. In 2007, right through here until the end of \n2011, it was a pretty steady readmission rate. Then when we changed the \nsignal to the hospitals and cut their payment for readmissions, boom, \ndown it fell. That represents a very significant savings in the system. \nAnd in the personal lives of those people and their families not having \nto go back to the hospital, that is a pretty big plus too.\n  It was Senator Cantwell's idea that we should come down today and \ntalk a little bit about the delivery system reform side of the health \ncare discussion. I got started a little bit before she could get here, \nbut my wonderful colleague now has arrived, so let me yield the floor \nto her. I will put this graph back because I want to leave this here \nfor whenever the camera swings my way. I want people to see this graph. \nIt is inexcusable that all of these competitive industrialized nations \nof ours should be able to deliver universal high-quality health care \nfor what would be a $1 trillion a year savings if we could simply match \nthem, and they produce a longer life expectancy for their people and we \nare stuck competing for life expectancy with Chile and the Czech \nRepublic. Come on. We can do a lot better than that, and that should be \nthe ball we have our eye on rather than obsessing about the ObamaCare \nWeb site.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor to join my colleague \nfrom Rhode Island. I applaud him for his diligence, making sure this \ndebate happened today, and for his leadership on this issue. It might \nsound kind of wonky to say there is a group of Senators that have a \ncaucus called the Delivery System Reform Caucus, but we wear that \nbanner with pride because we know that there are savings in our health \ncare delivery system. We want to make sure that they are delivered for \nthe American people.\n  While some want to talk about cutting people off of service or \nraising certain ages, we are focused on the fact that there are \nhundreds of billions of dollars of savings in the delivery system and \nthat it is our job to improve upon them. I like to say to my office \nteam: There is a reason why Ma Bell doesn't exist anymore. The \nchallenge is I have so many young people, and some of them don't \nremember Ma Bell. But the issue is the delivery system for \ntelecommunications changed, and look at what it unleashed--a lot of \ngreat technology.\n  Yes, change, but with ways to drive down costs and deliver better \naccess. That is what we are talking about here with the health care \nsystem. My colleague from Rhode Island has had a group for more than a \nyear that has been talking about these delivery system reforms. We are \ngoing to come out on a more frequent basis and try to have a dialog \nwith our colleagues about why it is so important.\n  We have taken a small but very important step led by our senior \nSenator from Washington Senator Murray on the budget. But there is so \nmuch more we can do if we can include these delivery system reforms. So \nI thank Senator Whitehouse, the Senator from Rhode Island, for his \nleadership.\n  I want to talk about one area today, the area of long-term care \nservices. I authored a provision in the Affordable Care Act called the \nBalancing Incentive Payments Program. While that sounds in and of \nitself like a wonky title, Balancing Incentive Payments Program, this \nprogram is really there to promote home and community-based care over \nnursing home care. If you ask any senior they will say of course they \nwould like to receive health care services in their home or in their \ncommunity. No, they do not want to go to a nursing home. But the \ndiscussion has been limited on how much cheaper it is and how much \nbetter the care could be for delivery in the home as opposed to nursing \nhome care.\n  According to a survey by AARP, over 90 percent of seniors age 50 or \nover desire to remain in their home as long as possible. We know that \nhome and community-based care is 70 percent cheaper than nursing home \ncare--70 percent cheaper. So for us in Washington State we thought \nabout this long ago, and we decided that we were going to implement a \nsystem to reform our State and put more community-based care in our \nState and pull Medicaid patients away from nursing home care. We did \nthat. We successfully made that transition. This chart shows you what I \nwas just referring to, that home-based care can be as little as $1,200 \na person versus the same person getting care in an institutional \nfacility at $6,000.\n  We made the transition in Washington State to be predominantly a home \nand community-based care State. We did that with our own State dollars, \nour own program, and it was a transition that took place over many \nyears. We are kind of the antithesis of what the Federal system is. It \nis still more weighted on a State by State basis towards nursing home \ncare. That means people are going into nursing home care, and we are \nfooting the bill for more expensive care at $6,000 per person when we \ncould have services in the community that would allow them to stay in \ntheir home and get more efficient care. So in 2009, the long-term care \nbudget overall for Medicaid accounted for 32 percent of the Medicaid \nexpenditures or $360 billion a year. You can see that this is a very \nexpensive area for us at the Federal level. If we could do anything to \nhelp change those numbers, we would be delivering an improvement to the \nsystem.\n  When we first made this transition from 1995 to 2008, the State of \nWashington saved $243 million from this investment. But more important, \neven, than the money--in an article in 2010, the Spokesman Review in \nSpokane ran a story called ``Dying to live at home,'' the family of \nNancy and Paul Dunham, a couple of more than 60 years, said they wanted \nto age at home. Because of the Medicaid funding for in-home services, \nthey were able to stay. Mr. Dunham was able to stay in his home until \nthe age of 83.\n  I am sure many of my colleagues know people who are getting on in \nyears who prefer to stay at home. But the Balancing Incentives Program, \nwhich was in the Affordable Care Act, was the first Federal effort that \nwe had that tried to assist States to move away from nursing home care \nand move towards community-based care. We put some incentives in the \nprogram. Here are the States so far that have taken up the Federal \nGovernment in the Affordable Care Act on this incentive program: New \nHampshire, Maryland, Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri, Georgia, Texas, \nIndiana, Connecticut, Arkansas, New York, New Jersey, Louisiana, Ohio, \nMaine, and Illinois.\n  It is a diverse group of States, I might add. Some States, probably, \nwhere Governors said they did not want to support the Affordable Care \nAct yet are taking advantage of this provision. Some States probably \nare forerunners of delivery system reform and have done lots of \ndelivery system reform and want to do more. It is a mix\n\n[[Page S8967]]\n\nof States. I think we have a lot of great examples in those States and \nwhat we can do to transition away from institutional care to home and \ncommunity-based care.\n  The program authorizes grants to States to increase access to their \nnon-institutional long-term care services, and it supports including \nstructural changes that help streamline the system--conflict-free case \nmanagement, core standardization of assessment instruments, single \nentry-point systems so it is not confusing, so that the system is very \nstreamlined. States have until September of 2015 to increase their \nlong-term care services in the community and support expenditures of \nthese noninstitutional-based care facilities.\n  We are very excited that it has had a robust uptake by these States. \nI am encouraged that there has been so much interest shown in changing \nthe political orientation, if you will, of States, to how do you deal \nwith long-term care. We know everybody is living longer. We know as \nbaby boomers retire, it is going to be a bubble to our health care \ndelivery system. But this is an excellent idea, a way for us to deliver \nbetter care.\n  What does it do? As I said in the first chart, $1,200 versus $6,000 \nin nursing home care. It reduces costs. Reducing those costs has to be \na key focus for us.\n  These Medicaid recipients are people who maybe even start on Medicare \nbut because of the extreme cost of health care at the end of life, end \nup spending it out, end up on Medicaid, end up being a Federal \nresponsibility. If we can reduce those costs by driving more community-\nbased care, it is a win-win situation.\n  The second thing it does is it helps improve quality. If people can \nstay at home and get access to the delivery system by these new \nrequirements, making sure it is case managed and has the single point \nof entry and standardization of the home care system, it helps us to be \nefficient about the quality of care that is being delivered. Again, \nwhen you have a community-based setting, either in the home or where \ncare is delivered through the home, there are lots of ways for us to \nhave checks and balances on the system.\n  I have talked to many people who are in the nursing home industry. \nThey will say we like the idea that we are only going to take the \nsickest patients. We like the idea we are only going to serve people \nwho really need to be there as opposed to some people who may not be \nready for those facilities but end up there anyway just because there \nare not the community efforts to support it.\n  Besides reducing costs and improving quality, we save money. That is \nwhy we are here today, to talk about these important ideas that save \nmoney. This is a simple one, but it is already in place. It has already \nstarted. There are many States taking us up on this offer, but it is \ncritical that we understand and score these costs because they can show \nhow we can save billions of dollars in our health care delivery system.\n  I know my colleagues, some of them on the other side of the aisle--\nwell, all of them on the other side of the aisle--didn't support the \nAffordable Care Act. Take a second look at what your States are doing. \nYour States are supporting the legislation, at least through one \nprovision. I think when you check, you will see that one provision is \ngoing to save your State money. It is going to give your citizens \nbetter choice in their quality of care. It is going to help us reduce \nour Federal costs and expenditures as well, and that is what delivery \nsystem reform is all about.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Isn't it the heart of what the Senator said just a \nmoment ago that there is an area that actually touches on a lot of \nhealth care--it is a big area--where you can do two things at once? You \ncan save significant money for taxpayers and insurance ratepayers, and \nat the same time you can improve the quality of care that people \nreceive.\n  So often in legislative matters it is a zero sum game. One wins so \nthe other has to lose exactly by the same amount. This is not like \nthat. This is a win-win situation. So there really should be energetic \nefforts to pursue these win-win opportunities.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for that \nquestion. I think his charts pointed to the fact that he was \narticulating, the fact that everybody is arguing about the Web site. As \nsomebody who has been involved in a software company that wrote code, \nwhat happened is very unfortunate, but writing code and fixing it is a \nstraightforward task that can be achieved. It is a little less \ndifficult than cleaning up oil in the gulf or something of larger \nenvironmental impact.\n  To me, we will get that fixed. In the meantime, there are a lot of \nthings that have to happen, that need to change in our delivery system \nthat are about saving costs, delivering better quality care, that we \nknow are proven, successful answers to this question. We need to get \nmore than just these States to take us up on this offer. We need to get \nCBO to actually give us a score on how much money this has the \npotential of saving, and then we have to figure out a way to \nincentivize all other States to implement this as soon as possible.\n  When you think about our senior population, this is what they want. \nThey want to stay at home as long as possible. It is so much cheaper \nper Medicaid beneficiary to do this.\n  This is what we have to achieve. We hope by coming out here and \neducating people about the various aspects of the Affordable Care Act, \nthe things in the delivery system reform that are on the agenda to \nimprove access and help save costs, that this will start taking hold \nand we will get more people talking about these solutions. This is \nabsolutely the direction we need to go.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If I could ask the Senator another question in \nresponse to what she just said, not only is it a win-win, being lower \ncost and better quality care, but I believe the Senator said that there \nis actually a third win here. There is the win of lower cost, there is \nthe win of better quality care, but for seniors there is a huge win of \nmaintaining your independence and being able to stay at home. It is \nhard to put a price on that, but if you are facing the choice of having \nto leave your home and having to go to a more restrictive health care \nsetting, being able to stay at home is a very big plus.\n  Really, it is not win-win, it is win-win-win.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. \nHe is correct. There are the individuals who win. The State in this \ncase saves Medicaid dollars, and the Federal Government saves dollars \nas well. But to the individual, if you ask them, this is their choice. \nThey want to stay at home. Nobody says they want to go into nursing \ncare.\n  We appreciate the nursing home care delivery aspect of health care. \nThey deal with some of the most complex patients. But they do not need \nto deal with people who do not need to be there. We have to have a \ndelivery system that helps support community-based care for long-term \ncare. I hope that we will get more support for these ideas and that we \nwill help figure out a way to get a score for them as well. I think \nthat part of the misery in this whole issue of health care savings is \nfiguring out ways to do things that are not so complex in what they are \ndoing. Moving from nursing home care to community-based care, $1,200 \nversus $6,000, that is not the hard part of the equation. What is hard \nis to get CBO to guesstimate how much population would be affected.\n  We do know this. If you take the number of seniors to be affected as \nthe baby boomer population reaches that retirement age, if you think \nthey are going to be supported primarily by nursing home care--I think \nI am correct that our State has now made the shift so the majority of \nour people who are on Medicaid are taken care of by long-term care \nservices in the community if they are seeking those services, versus \nthe Federal numbers which are just the opposite. The majority of people \nseeking those Medicaid long-term care dollars, the average of those \nStates is more towards nursing home care. We need to flip that. The \nSenator is right, it would be a win-win-win situation for all of us.\n  I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his leadership on this \nissue.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, in responding to what Senator Cantwell\n\n[[Page S8968]]\n\njust said about the Congressional Budget Office, it indeed has been \nfrustrating and bedeviling to run up against their inability to project \nthese savings in a way that would allow us to--what we call in \nWashington--score them and get budget credit for them. But even though \nthey have that difficulty, there are some very serious organizations \nthat project that very significant savings of the kind I have \nmentioned--the $1 trillion savings--are possible.\n  Some years ago the President's own Council of Economic Advisers \nestimated that we could do savings of $700 billion without affecting \nthe quality of care in any way for the worse.\n  The National Institute of Medicine has made several regular \nprojections. The most recent one is $750 billion a year. The Institute \nof Medicine is pretty serious folks, and they are entitled to respect \nwhen they say we can have those kinds of savings.\n  RAND Corporation--a lot of people know a lot about it--is a very \nexpert organization. They have done two things. They looked at what we \ncan save in health care, and then they looked at what we can save in \nhealth care plus an additional bit for dealing with waste and fraud. \nThey gave ranges for the two. The midpoint of the range for savings is \nabout $730 billion. If we add their suggestions on waste and fraud, the \nmidpoint of their range goes to about $910 billion a year.\n  The Lewin Group, which is another respected think tank that looks at \nhealth care issues, wrote a piece some time ago with George Bush's \nformer Treasury Secretary, and they said it was $1 trillion.\n  So is it $700 billion a year? Is it $750 billion a year? Is it \nsomewhere between $730 and $910 billion a year depending on how you \nscore the waste and fraud? Is it $1 trillion a year? Either way, I will \ntake it. Those are big numbers, and wherever it falls in that range, we \nshould be energetically fighting for it.\n  I will close with the request I always make in these speeches--and \nthis is a request to the President and to his administration--and that \nis to inspire us and set a bold national target. Sure, CBO, OMB, and \nour actuarial and accounting organizations cannot predict what these \nsavings are going to be, but, by gosh, the President can direct his \nadministration to target a savings goal and to go after it. I think if \nthe President were to set a hard date and dollar target for delivery \nsystem savings--a couple of years out so we have a chance to do that--\nthat would make a big difference.\n  The example that I use is of President Kennedy. Back in 1961, when it \nlooked as if we were losing the space race to the Soviet Union, \nPresident Kennedy declared that within 10 years--he put a date on it--\nhe would put a man on the Moon and bring him back safely. He had a hard \ntarget, something specific so you would know if it was or wasn't \nachieved. The message was clear, the mission that was outlined was \nclear, and the result was a vast mobilization of private and public \nresources to achieve that purpose.\n  It is not enough to talk about bending the health care cost curve. \nThat catchphrase should be jettisoned and discarded. We should have a \nhard date and dollar figure, and that should be a target the entire \nadministration aims toward.\n  Had President Kennedy given that speech back in 1961 and declared as \nhis purpose to bend the curve of space exploration, I very much doubt \nwe would have put that man on the Moon within 10 years. It was his \nexercise of Presidential leadership and challenge--ahead of what the \nscientists knew could be done but with confidence and faith in our \nability to achieve big things--that put the executive branch of \ngovernment into focus so we could achieve exactly what he had directed. \nWe can do the same with health care. We should do the same with health \ncare. There is no downside to it because this is a win-win area, as I \ndiscussed with Senator Cantwell.\n  On that note, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I asked my colleague from Rhode Island \nto stay on the floor for a couple of minutes because I wanted to thank \nhim for the erudite and eloquent explanation he has just given for why \nour focus should be so aggressively and unrelentingly on the tremendous \nopportunities for saving health care costs and raising health care \nquality at the same time. I am very proud to have joined him and other \ncolleagues in a task force that is seeking commonsense solutions to \nlower the costs of health care and at the same time increase its \nefficiency and quality. The two go together.\n  The phenomenon he just discussed of reducing readmissions to \nhospitals once patients are discharged also means that the quality of \nthose discharges, the rehabilitation plans and hand-offs to primary \nphysicians, and the suffering and pain for those patients is reduced, \nand that is just a microcosm of one example of how this goal can be \naccomplished.\n  We are late in this year, and we have no real time remaining before \nthe end of this year to do the kinds of reforms legislatively that will \nhelp advance this ball. But the attention we need to devote to this \nissue is clearly beyond this year and beyond the next year.\n  We are making progress, and the graphs show it, but there is so much \nprogress to be made in extending lifespans and quality of life as well \nas reducing the cost of health care.\n  We need to make sure we seize this historic moment to show the rest \nof the world that we can do better and we will do better in providing \nhealth care delivery. The cause of health care delivery reform is one \nthat cries out for a focused effort involving both branches of our \ngovernment, executive and legislative, and both parties, as well as \nboth Houses of this legislature.\n  The kind of focus given by Senators Cantwell and Whitehouse so \npenetratingly and powerfully today is the kind of focus we should \nmaintain. I hope in the days or months ahead we will devote more \nattention by coming to the floor, doing events in our States, and \nmaking sure the administration is aware of our concern in meetings. I \nlook forward to continuing that effort in the time ahead.\n  Again, I thank my colleague Senator Whitehouse, as well as others, \nsuch as Senator Schumer and my colleague from Connecticut Senator \nMurphy, as well as Senator Cantwell, for their devoted efforts. I am \nvery proud to be working with them.\n  I see my colleagues are on the Senate floor. It is late in the day, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I would point out that the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware was on his way to speak and has graciously \noffered to defer for moment or two while I make my brief remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/18/senate-section/article/S8968-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8968-S8969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 U.S. DELEGATION TO THE SOCHI OLYMPICS\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak briefly about \nthe delegation chosen by President Obama to represent the United States \nat the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Olympic Winter Games \nin Sochi, Russia. I would also like to offer a few suggested additions \nto the delegation.\n  As Members know, Janet Napolitano, former Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, will lead the U.S. delegation to the opening ceremonies on \nFebruary 7. Our Deputy Secretary of State, William Burns, will lead our \ndelegation to the closing ceremonies on February 23. Our two \ndelegations will include tennis legend Billy Jean King, gold medalist \nfigure skater Brian Boitano, gold medalist figure skater Bonnie Blair, \nsilver medalist hockey player Caitlin Cahow, and Olympic gold medalist \nspeed skater Eric Heiden. These individuals are American sports figures \nwho should be lauded for their contributions. I am confident they will \nrepresent us well.\n  May I suggest with all seriousness that this delegation could well be \nexpanded. Some have asked what message the President might be trying to \nsend to Russia in choosing this delegation. White House Press Secretary \nJay Carney asserted this morning that ``in the selection of the \ndelegation, we are\n\n[[Page S8969]]\n\nsending the message that the United States is a diverse \nplace.'' Whether we are sending a message or simply pointing to our \ndiversity, I submit our official delegation would be enhanced by adding \nthe following: an American citizen of Russian parentage, perhaps a \nRussian orphan adopted and raised to adulthood by loving parents in the \nUnited States would be a good addition to this delegation or a Syrian \nAmerican who has fled the barbaric and treacherous rule of Bashar al-\nAssad in Syria. In addition, an Iranian-American exile from the \noppressive and murderous regime in Iran might make an outstanding \naddition to this delegation. I would also suggest that LTG Keith \nAlexander, the Director of the National Security Agency in this \nadministration, would be an appropriate representative also of the \nUnited States of America.\n\n  So whether it is messaging that is taking place or simply diversity, \nI strongly suggest this outstanding delegation could be improved by \nthese individuals and perhaps others.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to speak tonight on two subjects. \nThe first is the budget resolution, the bipartisan, bicameral budget \nresolution conference report we approved today. This is the first time \nin a number of years we have actually been able to debate and find some \nconsensus on a bipartisan blueprint for spending for the balance of \nthis fiscal year. I commend Senator Murray and Congressman Ryan for \ntheir work and for their leadership and their willingness to find the \nmiddle.\n  My wife and I celebrate our 28th anniversary in about 2 weeks. \nActually, it is a few minutes after midnight on New Year's Day. One of \nthe things I love to do when I talk to people who have been married a \nlot longer than we have is to ask them the secret for being married a \nlong time. I have heard all kinds of answers--hilarious answers, some \nvery poignant answers. The best answer I ever heard is the answer of \nthe two Cs. The first time someone said that to me I said: What are \nthey? They said: Communicate and compromise. Communicate and \ncompromise. As it turns out, that is not just the secret for a long \nmarriage between two people, but it is also the secret for a vibrant \ndemocracy. If we are to continue to thrive as a nation and to meet our \nresponsibilities, it will be by doing what our leaders on the Budget \nCommittees have done; that is, communicated at great length with one \nanother, developed a sense of trust with one another, an understanding \nof the other's views, and being willing to compromise and find their \nway to the middle.\n  Everyone here could fault some aspect of the agreement that was \nstruck. I can, and I know others can. But I wish to commend them and \nthank them for the effort that went into getting this one.\n  The Presiding Officer has heard me say once or twice in the last year \nor so that there are three key ingredients to making real progress, \nmajor progress, on deficit reduction, and one of those is entitlement \nreform which saves the programs for future generations, saves money, \nand does not savage old people or poor people. The second is tax \nreform, which helps us lower some of the corporate rates a bit as well \nas generates revenues for deficit reduction. The third element is the \nnotion of looking at everything we do in Federal Government--everything \nwe do--and answer this question: How can we get a better result for \nless money or the same amount of money?\n  As we approach the next budget resolution next spring and the next \nopportunity to revisit these issues of spending, including domestic \nspending, defense spending, entitlement spending, and revenues, my hope \nis that we will be able to make even greater progress by focusing also \non those three critical elements. So that is one of the things I wanted \nto speak about.\n\n\n                          Mayorkas Nomination\n\n  The other issue I wish to speak about actually is a person; that is, \na fellow named Alejandro Mayorkas. He has been nominated by the \nPresident to serve as the Deputy Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security. He was nominated some 8 months ago.\n  As the Presiding Officer may recall, I have the privilege of chairing \nthe committee of jurisdiction over Homeland Security, the Committee on \nHomeland and Government Affairs, and we are responsible for working \nwith the administration. We are also responsible, as are a lot of other \nfolks in this country and outside of it, to help protect our Nation's \nsecurity both at home and abroad. At the same time we strive on our \ncommittee to make sure Federal agencies work better, work smarter, and \nmore efficiently with the resources we entrust to them. We are an \noversight committee.\n  During my years in public service, I have learned that the most \nimportant ingredient in enabling organizations to work well is \nleadership. That is the case both in government and in the private \nsector, in organizations large and small. Part of our shared \nresponsibility is ensuring that we have effective leaders in place \nacross our Federal Government. It is every Senator's constitutional \nrole to provide advice and consent on the President's nominees in a \nthorough and timely manner as part of the Senate's confirmation \nprocess. While we in Congress hope to soon wrap up our 2013 session, it \nis going to be with far less to show than many of us would have liked, \nbut at least the Senate will have had an opportunity to fill some key \nleadership positions across the Federal Government and to confirm a \nnumber of judges in many courts where they need a judge or two.\n  One of the roles that needs to be filled, again, is that of Deputy \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security. This Department, as \nwe know, plays a critical role in protecting our Nation and its \ncitizens from harm. Whether the threat relates to terrorism from \nabroad, to homegrown extremists, to cyber attacks or natural disaster, \nthis Department and the folks who work there are on the frontline for \nus.\n  Because of the Department's significant role in the security of our \ncountry, I have been very concerned--very concerned--for many months \nabout the high number of senior level vacancies at the Department of \nHomeland Security. In fact, the Department has been without a Senate-\nconfirmed Deputy Secretary since April and without a Senate-confirmed \nSecretary since I think late last summer.\n  Earlier this week, we took an important step to address this problem \nby voting to confirm Jeh Johnson, a good man, as the next Secretary of \nthe Department of Homeland Security with an overwhelming bipartisan \nvote. I wish to thank our Republican colleagues for joining us in that \nvote. That is good news. But we should not stop there. We need to \nensure that Secretary Johnson has a Senate-confirmed leadership team in \nplace and that certainly includes Alejandro Mayorkas as his Deputy.\n  I wish to take a few minutes, if I could, to speak in strong support \nof the nomination of Director Mayorkas' nomination and explain why I am \nconvinced he is one of the leaders we urgently need at the Department \nof Homeland Security. As of this week, more than 8 months have passed \nsince former Deputy Secretary Jane Holl Lute stepped down from her post \nat DHS, and nearly 6 months have passed since the President has \nnominated this man, currently the Director of U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services, for that post. It is time to put in place Senate-\nconfirmed leadership in this very important Deputy Secretary position.\n  The former Deputy Secretary--the last Senate-confirmed Deputy \nSecretary for this Department--was a woman named Jane Holl Lute, a very \nimpressive leader in her own right and widely respected not just by \nmembers of the committee but by many of our colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans, in the Senate for her leadership, management skills, \nexpertise, and for her candor. She helped DHS make strides in many \nareas; for example, in narrowing the operational and management issues \nidentified as high risk by the Government Accountability Office. Ever \nsince the Department of Homeland Security was created, it has been on \nthe high-risk list every other year by GAO. They put it out at the \nbeginning of every Congress, and one of the leaders, if you will, in \nterms of getting a lot of mentions on the high-risk list, is the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n\n[[Page S8970]]\n\n  One of the criticisms of the Department for the last 10 years is they \nnever passed a financial audit. They are supposed to, under a law \npassed roughly 20 years ago, and little by little every Federal agency, \nexcept the Department of Defense, has become auditable and then finally \nachieved a clean audit. Last week we learned the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, within 10 years or so, finally has achieved that goal.\n  Why is that important? Because what we cannot measure, we cannot \nmanage. This is a big Department, spread out across the country. There \nare 22 disparate agencies, with hundreds of thousands of employees, and \nthey need to be well managed.\n  One of Jane Holl Lute's accomplishments, along with Janet Napolitano, \nthe former Secretary, was to make them auditable and to get them a \nclean audit. I think it is safe to say that the Department needs \nsomebody with the same kind of commitment and willingness to tackle \nproblems head-on that Jane Holl Lute brought to the job.\n  Similarly, Director Mayorkas understands and is well prepared to \ntackle these management challenges and is committed to continuing these \nreform efforts needed to move the Department forward.\n  Director Mayorkas has a distinguished record of leadership in public \nservice. In fact, he has been confirmed by the Senate not once but \ntwice--first as the U.S. attorney for the Central District of \nCalifornia, the youngest U.S. attorney in the country at the time, and \nagain in his current capacity as the leader of the U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services. He has also served as a partner in a major U.S. \nlaw firm, O'Melveny & Myers.\n  Director Mayorkas has a long and distinguished record in law \nenforcement. As an assistant U.S. attorney, he aggressively prosecuted \ndrug traffickers, human smugglers, and violent criminals. As U.S. \nattorney, Mr. Mayorkas led the largest Federal judicial system in the \nUnited States and was appointed by then-U.S. Attorney General Janet \nReno to serve on her advisory committee on ethics and government. \nMoreover, while a partner at O'Melveny & Myers, he served as chair of \nthe firm's Values Committee and he was a recipient of the firm's annual \nValues Award.\n  Since his confirmation by voice vote by the Senate in 2009, Director \nMayorkas has served as Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices. He has skillfully led the largest immigration system in the \nworld. In this capacity, Director Mayorkas has been responsible for an \n18,000-member workforce that maintains more than 200 offices worldwide \nand is supported by a $3 billion budget.\n  Director Mayorkas has led the effort to turn around an agency that \nwas widely considered to be foundering. He has helped to put it on the \npath to professionalism and competence. His first action after being \nconfirmed several years ago was to order a top-to-bottom review of the \nagency to identify its strengths and to identify its weaknesses.\n  When the review concluded, Director Mayorkas became concerned that \nCitizenship and Immigration Services was prioritizing speed over \nsecurity when it came to processing visa applications. In order to make \nsure that national security concerns were getting the proper attention, \nhe created an entirely new directorate responsible for policing visa \nissuance, reporting directly to him. This ensured that national \nsecurity professionals would have a seat at the management table and a \nvoice in all major decisions.\n  Director Mayorkas has proven that he is an exceptional manager during \nhis time at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Let me give a \ncouple concrete examples of how he has made the agency more effective.\n  He dramatically improved what I believe is one of the most important \nprograms in all of DHS; that is, E-Verify. This is a voluntary program \nthat allows employers to check whether prospective employees are \neligible to work in the United States. I was pleasantly surprised to \nlearn that under Director Mayorkas' leadership, the number of employers \nusing E-Verify tripled--from 156,000 employers in 2009 to almost half a \nmillion today. The number of people processed by E-Verify also \nincreased from nearly 9 million to over 20 million people. That is \nremarkable improvement in this important program.\n  His implementation last year of the President's Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals Program--a hugely complicated and challenging \nundertaking that brought hundreds of thousands of people out of the \nshadows--has also been widely praised.\n  Within 60 days, Director Mayorkas managed to implement a program that \nprocessed hundreds of thousands of people while ensuring that the \nappropriate security checks were performed. I think it is a stunning \nachievement.\n  Here is something else I found interesting. Just yesterday, the \nPartnership for Public Service issued its rankings of the best places \nto work in the Federal Government in 2013--just yesterday. On the one \nhand, I was dismayed to find out that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity ranked last on their list of Cabinet Departments. However, \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, led by Ali Mayorkas, was one \nof the highest ranked components within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, coming in, I think, at 76 out of some 300 Federal agencies. \nAnd after Alejandro Mayorkas took over in 2009, employee satisfaction \nwith senior leadership did not drop; it increased by over 20 percent. \nWe need more of that kind of proven and committed leadership at DHS.\n  Everything I have learned about Director Mayorkas over the past \nyear--and I have learned a lot--has led me to conclude that he is an \nexceptional candidate to be the next Deputy Secretary at this \nDepartment.\n  But don't just take my word for it. Director Mayorkas has received \nglowing accolades from a number of our colleagues who have worked \nclosely with him.\n  I might also say that he has been strongly endorsed by every single \nformer Secretary of this Department, every one of them, two appointed \nby George W. Bush and one by our current President. They have all \nendorsed him.\n\n  He has also been endorsed by a number of our colleagues--Mary \nLandrieu, who knows him well, who is a valued member of our committee; \nDianne Feinstein from California, who recommended Director Mayorkas for \nhis positions--both as U.S. attorney out there to President Clinton and \nto President Obama for his current leadership position.\n  We have also received dozens of letters from a distinguished, \nbipartisan group of individuals and organizations asking us to move \nforward with this nomination. I want to take a minute or two, if I \ncould, right now to share with our colleagues what some of these \ndistinguished people have been saying about Director Alejandro \nMayorkas.\n  Among those writing on his behalf are many individuals whom a lot of \nus deeply respect. I mentioned Jane Holl Lute, the previous Deputy \nSecretary; and Richard Skinner, the last Senate-confirmed Department of \nHomeland Security inspector general, who was nominated by former \nPresident George W. Bush.\n  I particularly value what Jane Holl Lute has to say given that she \nhas an unparalleled perspective on what it takes to be an effective \nDeputy Secretary. She was one herself, and she was terrific. Here is \nwhat she said about Director Mayorkas:\n\n       As I have come to know Ali, I can tell you that he asks no \n     more of others than he does of himself, and, in leading by \n     example, sets a standard of excellence for all who consider \n     themselves committed to public service. In my view, Homeland \n     Security could be in no better hands.\n\n  That is Jane Holl Lute.\n  In one of two support letters--not one but two support letters--\nRichard Skinner, the last Senate-confirmed inspector general of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security--again, a Bush appointee--he sent two \nletters to our committee, including one earlier this month, and in it \nhe said this of Ali Mayorkas:\n\n       During my tenure as Inspector General, Mr. Mayorkas \n     demonstrated that he possessed the intellectual wherewithal \n     to make objective and often times very tough decisions on \n     complex, multifaceted issues, and a genuine commitment to the \n     mission, vision, and core values of the U.S. Department of \n     Homeland Security. He is a strong leader who will be able to \n     bring together diverse interests in collaborative efforts.\n\n  That is the last Senate-confirmed inspector general for this \nDepartment.\n  The list of supporters for Director Mayorkas also includes other \nsenior officials in the George W. Bush administration, such as Kenneth \nWainstein,\n\n[[Page S8971]]\n\nwho was President Bush's Homeland Security Advisor. Here is what Mr. \nWainstein had to say:\n\n       Ali has consistently shown an exceptional ability to \n     mobilize, manage, and lead people and organizations . . . as \n     USCIS Director, he has effectively led a large and complex \n     organization during a time of continuing change and \n     challenge. His marked success in that difficult role is a \n     strong predictor of his performance in the Deputy Secretary \n     position.\n\n  Again, that is what Mr. Wainstein had to say. I could not agree more.\n  Those from the law enforcement community also laud Director Mayorkas. \nFor example, we received strong letters of support from the people \ncharged with securing our borders during the George W. Bush \nadministration: Robert Bonner, Ralph Basham, and Jason Ahern--all of \nwhom served as Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  Mr. Bonner wrote:\n\n       It is not merely his willingness to serve the public good \n     that impels me to write this letter of support for his \n     nomination, it is rather my firm belief that Ali has the \n     experience, skills, talents, and plain old good judgment to \n     be an effective Deputy Secretary, perhaps the best DHS has \n     ever had.\n\n  Having succeeded Jane Holl Lute, that is saying a mouthful.\n  Mr. Basham also wrote:\n\n       Mr. Mayorkas has already served the Department well and \n     honorably in the role of Director of U.S. Citizenship and \n     Immigration Services. I also believe Mr. Mayorkas to be a \n     public servant of integrity with a clear and distinguished \n     track record of leadership.\n\n  Mr. Ahern, also one of the past Commissioners of this Department, \nsaid these words:\n\n       It is my strong opinion that Director Mayorkas' experience \n     and leadership will be invaluable as DHS continues the work \n     of protecting the homeland against threats of all kinds. As \n     the Department of Homeland Security continues to mature, \n     Alejandro Mayorkas is the right leader to continue that \n     development and also meet the many critical mission \n     challenges faced every day.\n\n  Think about it. The three most senior border security officials who \nserved under George W. Bush all agree that Director Ali Mayorkas would \nmake an outstanding Deputy Secretary. They have worked with him in many \ncases. They know him. They have seen him up close and in person. They \nhave watched him lead.\n  But it is not only former DHS officials who feel that way. Chuck \nCanterbury, the national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, \nsaid that Director Mayorkas' ``professionalism, leadership skills and \nintegrity make him an ideal candidate for this post.''\n  All of these individuals who have worked closely with Director \nMayorkas have spoken highly of him. They cite his integrity, his \ncommitment to excellence, and his tenacity.\n  I will close with this. At his confirmation hearing Director Mayorkas \nsaid that his goal in life has always been to bring honor to his \nparents. His parents brought him to this country as a refugee from Cuba \nwhen he was 1 year old, he and his brothers. They worked hard every day \nto give him and his brothers the opportunity to go to school and make a \nbetter life for themselves. Like his parents, Alejandro Mayorkas has \nworked hard all of his life. He has worked hard and he has worked hard \nin part to make them proud.\n  I believe he has brought great honor to them and to this country and, \nif confirmed, would continue to do so as Deputy Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to say a word about the statement made by my \ncolleague from Delaware.\n  Senator Carper and I came to Congress together over 30 years ago in \nthe House of Representatives. He left for a short interlude to become \nGovernor of the State, and then I recall making a telephone call to him \n1 day saying would you consider joining me again in the Senate, and he \nwas kind enough to do so. The people of Delaware were wise enough to \nelect him. I have known Tom Carper for a long time. He is an honorable \nman, a man of integrity.\n  This is a controversial nomination on the other side of the aisle. \nThere are some who question the integrity of Mr. Mayorkas and his \nfitness to be chosen for this position. I have met him. He makes a \npositive impression and a very strong case that he should continue in \npublic service. But what I respect most is my colleague, Senator Tom \nCarper, chairman of this committee, has gone to extraordinary lengths \nto investigate every allegation, to answer every question, and to be \nthere to work with the other side of the aisle to try to resolve any \nproblems that they have with this nomination. Sadly, he has not been \nsuccessful. There are still some on the other side who will oppose him.\n  I spoke to Senator Reid, the majority leader, earlier this week, and \nsaid: If Tom Carper believes that Ali Mayorkas is an honorable man \nbased on his investigation, I trust Tom Carper. I don't believe he \nwould ever mislead the American people, the people of Delaware, or the \nSenate. We should confirm this man. The allegations that have been made \nagainst him have not been substantiated and, frankly, should not ruin \nwhat is an extraordinary public career and an opportunity for him to \ncontinue to serve this Nation that he loves.\n  I thank Tom Carper for his leadership, for his integrity, and his \ncommitment to fairness to make sure that this man is treated fairly by \nthe Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/18/senate-section/article/S8971-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8971-S8972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. RUSSELL DOHNER\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, many times in life we are in a doctor's \noffice, and many times in life it is a tense, worrisome moment when we \nare waiting for that doctor to make a diagnosis or to tell us what we \nneed to know about ourselves or someone we love. There are great \ndoctors, and we hope that we are in the room with one at that moment. \nThere are great doctors who are extraordinary surgeons and great \nresearchers, but there are also great doctors who are caring, healing \nprofessionals who are there when we need them the most.\n  I wish to tell a brief story about one of them from my home State of \nIllinois, an exceptional man. Dr. Russell Dohner is a family doctor who \nretired quietly in October at the age of 88. He had been a practicing \nfamily practitioner in Rushville, IL, a small farming community in \ncentral Illinois, for 58 years. Dr. Dohner is the only doctor many \nfamilies in Rushville have ever known, but the longevity of his career \nis only one small reason they love him.\n  For many families in Rushville and the neighboring towns, Dr. Dohner \nwas a one-man solution to the problem of unaffordable health care. When \nhe started practicing medicine in 1955, he charged the going rate \naround town for an office visit: $2. In 1970, with an apology, he had \nto raise his fee. His fee for an office visit was raised to $5, and \nthat is where it stayed for 43 years. If families couldn't pay, Dr. \nDohner would quietly signal to his office manager: No charge this time. \nHe never, ever accepted medical insurance payments--said it wasn't \nworth the bother.\n  In 58 years as Rushville's family doctor, Dr. Dohner never--never--\ntook a vacation. He worked 7 days a week. He started each day at the \n25-bed hospital, Culbertson Memorial, where he checked on every single \npatient at the hospital.\n  At 10 a.m. he was in his office--a red brick storefront on the town \nsquare--to see his patients. There were no appointments. Dr. Dohner saw \npeople in the order they arrived. Years back, he used to see 50 \npatients a day. His rule was if you were in his office by 5 p.m., he \nwould see you, even if it meant working late into the night. The local \npharmacy down the block stayed open until Dr. Dohner called to say he \nhad seen his last patient.\n  But that wasn't the end of Dr. Dohner's day. After he saw his last \npatient in the office, he headed back to his hospital. That was his \nhome away from home, as he called it. He ate dinner and went back to \nthe hospital to check on his patients.\n  He made house calls for patients who were too sick or frail to get to \nhis office. He visited his patients in nursing homes.\n  He took off a half day each week, Thursday afternoon. First he went \nto the local Rotary lunch and then, back in the day, he might even \nconsider going fishing. The only time anyone in Rushville can remember \nDr. Dohner leaving town was for a medical conference.\n  A few years back he had quadruple bypass surgery himself. The day he\n\n[[Page S8972]]\n\ncame home from the hospital, he went to work for a few hours.\n  Garry Moreland is a co-owner of the pharmacy down the street from Dr. \nDohner, and he said: ``Healing is more than a dedication or a \ncommitment, it's a calling.''\n  Tim Ward, director of the foundation for Culbertson Memorial \nHospital, said of Dr. Russell Dohner: ``He's the closest thing we have \nto a saint.''\n  Dr. Dohner's staff was just as dedicated as he was. His sister \nClarice, who died in April, helped him set up his practice in 1955. She \nhelped him buy his first car so he could make house calls and she \nmanaged his office for more than 40 years.\n  Edith Moore, his office assistant, died last July at the age of 85, \nworking right up to the day of her death.\n  Rose Busby, one of Dr. Dohner's two nurses, retired about a year ago \nin her late eighties.\n  Nurse Florence Bottorff worked for Dr. Dohner for 50 years until he \nclosed his office. She finally quit her nursing career at age 90.\n  Russell Dohner grew up on a farm just north of Rushville, outside the \nlittle town of Vermont, IL. He says he inherited his work ethic from \nhis parents, who taught their seven kids the importance of working hard \nand taking care of others.\n  He was inspired to become a doctor by the town doctor who treated him \nfor seizures when he was a child. After he served in the Army in World \nWar II, he went to Western Illinois University on the GI bill and then, \nin the early 1950s, Northwestern University in Chicago, where he went \nto medical school.\n  He thought he was going to stay in Chicago and be a cardiologist. \nInstead, he became the heart of a small town. The long-time family \ndoctor in Rushville was retiring and persuaded the newly minted Dr. \nDohner to come home for just a year or two to fill the void. Well, the \nyears stretched into decades and Doc Dohner found he just couldn't \nleave. There was always somebody who needed a helping hand.\n  The decision to stay in a small town cost him his marriage, but that \nwas all right. Dr. Dohner said his patients were his family.\n  Similar to George Bailey in ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' it seems Dr. \nDohner has touched and enriched the lives of almost everyone in this \nsmall town. He estimates he has delivered 3,500 babies, more than the \nentire current population of the city of Rushville. Among those he \nbrought into the world are Rushville's mayor and half of the staff at \nthe local hospital. He once climbed down into a coal mine to help \nrescue four men.\n  Lynn Stambaugh is the CEO at Culbertson Memorial Hospital. Her \nyounger sister suffered seizures as a baby. She remembers Doc Dohner \ncoming to their house and sitting beside her sister's crib all night \nlong to make sure she was going to be OK.\n  Carolyn Ambrosius recalled for a local reporter that her mom became \npregnant at the age of 41, and a doctor in Springfield told her that \neither she was going to survive or the baby would survive but not both \nof them. She went home to Rushville in tears, and then she met with Doc \nDohner. She remembers the Doc told her mother: God's going to take care \nof us, and I am going to help. Doc Dohner came to the house every day \nto check on Carolyn's mom and often stayed to have dinner with the \nfamily. Today, Carolyn Ambrosius's baby brother is a healthy middle-\naged man.\n  Family doctors such as Doc Dohner are a disappearing breed. Only 2 \npercent of all medical students in a recent study expressed interest in \npracticing primary care as a general internist. Most medical students \nchoose a more lucrative specialty field. In the United States, we are \nnow short approximately 9,000 primary care doctors. The situation is \nnot getting any better. In the next 15 years we are going to face a \nshortage of more than 65,000 primary care doctors.\n  Stephanie LeMaster is one of that special 2 percent, though. \nStephanie grew up in Rushville. As a little girl, she wanted to be a \nnurse like her mom and her grandmother. At her mother's suggestion, she \ninterviewed Doc Dohner for a fourth grade--fourth grade--school \nproject. Listening to him talk about his love of doctoring, she changed \nher plans. Stephanie LeMaster is now a second-year medical student at \nSouthern Illinois University. She says:\n\n       They tell me I should be the next Dr. Dohner, but I'm not \n     sure I can live up to him. He's the only one like him.\n\n  Dr. Dohner has been recognized by State and national organizations as \none of the best country doctors in America. He has been profiled in \nPeople magazine, featured on the ``Today Show,'' and he was the grand \nmarshal for the Illinois State Fair parade this year. In September, the \ntown of Rushville unveiled a bronze statue of Dr. Dohner in the town's \nCentral Park. It is about 200 feet from his old office. The statue \ndepicts Dr. Donor seated on a park bench with a child listening to his \nheart through a stethoscope.\n  Besides doctoring and a little bit of fishing and the Rotary Club \nmeeting, Doc Dohner also loves trees. Rushville mayor Curt Lunt \nestimates the doctor has donated thousands of trees to the town over \nthe years.\n  It has been said you have to have faith in the future to plant a \ntree. The trees of Rushville symbolize not just Doc Dohner's faith in \nthe future but also his love for that community that became his family.\n  Retirement is taking some adjustment for Doc Dohner. The last time he \ntook a full day off he was in the Army in World War II.

Mr. President, today, I, along with several other \nSenators, will be meeting with EPA Administrator McCarthy concerning a \nproposal from EPA to waive the renewable fuel standard, or RFS. If the \nproposed rule is made final, it would undermine one of the biggest \npolicy tools we have to support energy independence, to lower \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and stabilize our rural economy.\n  The renewable fuel standard was created in 2002 to drive growth in \nthe biofuels industry. Why is that so important? When biofuels are \ncontributing to our domestic fuel supply, we use less petroleum-based \nenergy. Gasoline blended with ethanol burns more cleanly, so cars are \ngenerating less greenhouse gas; And with a steady, predictable market \nfor biofuels, there is now a healthy biofuels industry that supports \nhundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  Each year the Environmental Protection Agency sets volume standards \nfor renewable fuels that requires refiners to blend certain levels of \nbiofuels into the fuel supply. RFS levels have been steadily increasing \nby law since Congress updated the renewable fuels effort in 2007.\n  The renewable fuel standard has worked well. The United States needs \nto be less reliant on other countries for its energy. Growth in the use \nof biofuels--particularly corn-based ethanol--is one of the few, \nmeaningful steps we have taken. And it is working. Last year, we used \n13.3 billion gallons of ethanol to displace 465 million barrels of oil. \nThat is 12 percent of the total U.S. crude oil imports.\n  Not only do biofuels play an important role in energy independence, \nthey have the added benefits of being good for the environment. The \nrenewable fuel standard promotes the adoption of biofuels explicitly \nbecause they reduce greenhouse gas emission.\n  Many of my colleagues may know that in Illinois we grow a lot of \ncorn. Not surprisingly, we also happen to be one of the largest \nproducers of corn-based ethanol--the biofuel most often cited as not \nbeing as ``green'' as other biofuels. But even ethanol is required to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent.\n  A recent study by Argonne National Lab found that, on average, \nethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 24 percent. In 2012, \nethanol reduced emissions from cars and trucks by 33.4 million tons. \nThat is the equivalent of taking 5.2 million cars off the road.\n\n[[Page S8973]]\n\n  But it is not just ethanol. Advanced biofuels reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions even further. They are required to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions by at least 50 percent. That is why groups like the American \nLung Association have supported the development and use of biofuels. \nAnd while many advanced biofuels are just beginning to come online, \nothers--like biodiesel--are getting closer to really hitting their \nstride.\n  An added benefit of growth of biofuels in States like Illinois is the \neffect it has had on our rural economy. The use of biofuels has helped \ncreate an additional market for crops, but it also has created an \nemerging industry in rural communities. There are now 14 ethanol plants \nand 5 biodiesel plants operating in Illinois. Steady biofuels \nproduction in Illinois means new jobs in communities that were having \ntrouble economically even before the recession. Those 14 ethanol plants \nhave led to 5,400 direct jobs in Illinois and payroll exceeding $250 \nmillion.\n  EPA issued a draft rule last month that would waive the statutory RFS \nlevels for 2014 below levels even required in 2012. By waiving the \nstandard as proposed, the rule not only threatens the current biofuels \nindustry, but it will significantly slow or stop more advanced biofuels \ncoming to the market. In effect, what EPA has proposed would stop any \nnew growth in the industry.\n  Today, most gasoline is blended with 10 percent ethanol, more \ncommonly referenced as E-10. Some think of this level as a ``blend \nwall'' because to increase the blend ratio, we need more investment in \ninfrastructure like gas pumps that deliver it. But if we get stuck at \nE-10, that effectively shuts down for many biofuels. Corn-based ethanol \nalready is produced at levels to completely saturate the market at E-\n10, leaving little room for growth advanced cellulosic ethanol.\n  Part of the reason for creating the RFS was to help create incentives \nto push past barriers like the blend wall. EPA has already approved a \npathway to doing just that in the form of E-15. But instead of using \nRFS to help push through infrastructure hurdles to biofuel growth, \nEPA's proposal would enshrine this market barrier as the true ceiling \nfor much of our biofuels growth.\n  And EPA's proposed rule is already reverberating through the market. \nInvestments in biofuels, particularly advanced biofuels, are already \nstarting to slow, based on the proposed rule. I heard from a company in \nIllinois that had recently announced new investments in their plant. \nThey are now re-thinking their expansion plans. That means if EPA's \nproposed waiver is adopted, we may never realize the full benefits of \nRFS that Congress intended. We will freeze our progress on reducing \ngreenhouse gas emission. We will limit a tool in securing our energy \nindependence. And we will stymie the growth of an industry that is \nplaying an important role in rural economies.\n  That is why I am working with like-minded Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle to urge the EPA to reconsider this rule before it is \nfinalized. We have come too far to take this giant step backward. \nBiofuels are an important part of our energy future and the right path \nfor our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/18/senate-section/article/S8973-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COLONEL RICHARD D. ROOT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our men and women in uniform sacrifice much \nto keep our Nation strong and free. They are well-trained, \nextraordinarily capable and are some of our country's best and \nbrightest. One of them is a man I want to help recognize today as he \nretires from the U.S. Army.\n  COL Richard D. Root, from Hartford, MI, has served our country in \nuniform for a quarter of a century and I am delighted to congratulate \nhim on a long and distinguished military career. In 2007, Colonel Root \ncame to the Senate as the Deputy for the Army's Senate liaison office. \nHe was then selected as the Director of legislative affairs for GEN \nJohn Allen, the commander, International Security Assistance Force, \nISAF, during the critical period in Afghanistan from 2011 to 2013. In \nthis capacity, Colonel Root escorted over 70 congressional delegations \nvisiting Afghanistan and Pakistan. During these congressional \ndelegations, Colonel Root masterfully balanced both the interests of \nSenators with the priorities of his commander to ensure that Members of \nCongress received a clear and accurate picture of the strategic \nmilitary and political situation in Afghanistan.\n  Prior to his service with congressional liaison, Colonel Root \nperformed with great distinction in all of his assignments throughout \nhis extraordinary career, including command of the 3rd Battalion, 320th \nField Artillery Regiment ``Red Knights'' during Operation Iraqi Freedom \nfrom 2005 to 2006. Additionally, he served as an executive officer for \nthe 4th Infantry Division Artillery and a variety of other tactical and \noperational assignments from platoon to brigade while deployed for the \ninvasion of Iraq in 2003 and for Operation Desert Storm/Desert Shield \nin 1991.\n  In his final assignment as the executive officer to the chief of army \nlegislative liaison, Colonel Root worked tirelessly to expand \nrelationships between the Army and the 113th Congress.\n  Our military personnel do not shoulder the stress and sacrifice of \nmilitary service alone, and Colonel Root is no exception. His wife, \nDiann, and his daughter, Lexi, have stood proudly by his side, \nsacrificing time with their husband and father while he fulfilled his \nmilitary commitments. To them also, we offer a truly heartfelt thanks.\n  As he retires, Colonel Root leaves behind an impressive record of \nmilitary service and his counsel, professionalism and expertise will \nsurely be missed by the Army and Congress alike. We offer him our \nsincere thanks for his service to our Nation and the example he has set \nfor those under his command and colleagues with whom he served. I know \nmy colleagues join me in wishing Colonel Root and his family all the \nbest as they begin this next exciting chapter in their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/18/senate-section/article/S8973-2", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8973-S8974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ITALIAN HALL TRAGEDY IN CALUMET, MICHIGAN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a century ago on December 24, 1913, \nhundreds of miners and their families had gathered for a Christmas Eve \ncelebration in the small Upper Peninsula town of Calumet, MI. Their \ncommunity was under tremendous stress; the miners of what is known to \nthis day as ``Copper Country'' had been on strike for 5 months. But \nthey had come for a brief holiday respite from the trials and struggles \nof those difficult days.\n  What began as a joyful day ended in tears and wails and inconsolable \ngrief. While no one will know for certain what sparked the families' \nrush to the doors at the bottom of the stairs leading from the hall, \nmost believe that someone yelled ``Fire!'' even though there was none. \nWhat resulted in the rush to the exit is almost unimaginable: 59 \nchildren and 14 adults were dead, having been trampled or suffocated.\n  This dreadful disaster has forever brought back painful memories on \nDecember 24, Christmas Eve, for the community of Calumet, MI. On the \ncentennial anniversary of this event, the anguish is still real. The \nsadness is only overshadowed by the senselessness of the event.\n  The families celebrating in the Italian Hall were hard-working \nimmigrants, struggling through the labor strike to fight for better \nwages, hours and working conditions. They came to Copper country for \nthe promise of work, even though mining was difficult and dangerous. \nThis area was home to the largest known deposits of pure elemental \ncopper in the world, drawing hundreds of thousands of people from \naround the world. It was here that the lives of immigrants shaped our \nnation, with their successes and their struggles.\n  So many reminders of the copper mining heyday remain in the quaint \ntown. From the historic architecture to the Yooper accents; from the \nvariety of ethnic foods to the hard living work ethic that exists \ntoday, the Copper Country communities are reminded every day of their \nheritage. The historic buildings, landscapes and museum collections of \nthe area are protected and preserved by the Keweenaw National \nHistorical Park, working collaboratively with local and State \ngovernments, historic organizations and private property owners. The \npark brings to life the multi-faceted story of\n\n[[Page S8974]]\n\ncopper mining history including its social, ethnic, commercial and \ntechnological dimensions. However, no artifact can compete with the \nfeeling that Christmas Eve presents to the Village of Calumet every \nyear when it is reminded of the Italian Hall tragedy.\n  On this centennial, we remember those who perished, and celebrate \ntheir lives and the heritage they have left for us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/18/senate-section/article/S8974-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         Captain Reid Nishizuka\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ.

She is a \nremarkably compassionate woman who often worked tirelessly with our \nmost vulnerable populations--our senior citizens and veterans. There \nare many extraordinary stories about constituents whose lives she has \ntouched. One in particular stands out to me: Last year, we were \ncontacted by the wife of a veteran whose husband was hospitalized at a \nprivate hospital because of an emergency. Unfortunately, he passed away \nthe next day and the Department of Veterans Affairs refused to pay for \nhis care. Marilyn successfully worked with the private hospital to make \nsure that the veteran's care in his final hours would not become a \nfinancial burden to his widow.\n  Marilyn joined Senator John Warner in 1981 as a correspondence \nmanagement specialist and rose to the position of caseworker. When \nSenator John Warner retired, Marilyn joined my staff to continue \nhelping the people of Virginia. Because of her diligent work, she was \npromoted first to constituent services representative and then \nconstituent services director. Marilyn has also been a dedicated member \nof her community in Richmond. She attended Virginia Union University \nand is an active member of her church, New Jerusalem International \nChristian Ministries, where she has been known to knit items for fellow \nchurch members. She has one beloved daughter, Shannan Hester.\n  After over 30 years of working for the people of the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, Marilyn Jones is retiring.

Coming to Alaska in 1943 originally to work on the \nconstruction of the ALCAN Highway, James demonstrated the versatility \nfor which Alaskans are famous. By 1945, he was a deputy U.S. Marshall \nin Nome. Seeking to give more to his new home State, James left Alaska \nin 1948 to attend law school.

A bill to amend the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct to provide for a fixed annual open enrollment period; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor, as I have \nfrequently since the health care law was passed, as a doctor who has \npracticed medicine in Wyoming for a quarter of a century, taking care \nof people, providing low-cost blood screenings through the Wyoming \nHealth Fair, of which I was the medical director. I was back in Wyoming \nlast week talking to folks about their health care and their concerns.\n  With the end of the year rapidly approaching, Americans are gathering \nwith family and friends to celebrate the holidays, to count their \nblessings. But from what I heard last weekend in Wyoming and on a \ntelephone townhall meeting Monday night, very few people are thankful \nfor the President's health care law.\n  I met yesterday with the Wyoming insurance commissioner. Fewer than \n1,000 people have been able to sign up, but thousands have had their \ninsurance canceled under the law. So many more people are suffering \nbecause of the law than people who are potentially able to benefit. \nThis law was forced down the throats of the American people, supported \nunanimously by the Democrats in this body. It is continuing to disrupt \npeople's lives and to cause them very real harm.\n  After a year of false starts and failures, what we have seen is that \nthe\n\n[[Page S8978]]\n\nPresident's health care law is nothing more than a collection of \ndeception, delays, and disappointments. If you look at the headlines, \nthe biggest disappointment was the launch of the healthcare.gov Web \nsite in October. It was a total disaster. But it really is just the tip \nof the iceberg. The Web site failures are what people have seen across \nthe country. That is the most visible, and it has obviously been the \ncause of concerns and jokes by the late-night comedians. But the real \ndamage is going to start on January 1--damage to people's lives.\n  This was just about a computer screen. Below this tip of the iceberg \nis what people are actually noticing at home. They are paying higher \npremiums, and I am hearing that around the State of Wyoming; canceled \ncoverage--thousands in Wyoming but over 5 million, I understand by last \ncount, across the country. And we don't even know how many have been \ncanceled in the States of Illinois, Texas, and Ohio. But we know that \nmore than 5 million people have lost their coverage. People are finding \nout they can't keep their doctor. We are seeing that with seniors on \nMedicare, and we are seeing that with children who are going for cancer \ncare. We are finding that people are having a harder time finding a \ndoctor or even having to make choices as they go to the Web site: Well, \ndo I want to keep my doctor or do I want to keep the hospital that I go \nto or do I want to keep the drug coverage I have? And many people are \nfinding they can't find any plan that will let them keep everything \nthey have now--in spite of the President's promise.\n  We are hearing more and more stories about fraud and identity theft \nacross the country related to the health care Web site, including a \nSenate staff member who was signing up. It asked for his bank number \nand PIN number, and he called the helpline. He had to wait a long \nperiod of time to get through, as has been the experience for many \nAmericans, and they said: No, that is not the regular Web site. That \nmust be some kind of a scam trying to fraudulently take your \ninformation.\n  People are seeing higher copays and deductibles. The average \ndeductible now is over $5,000 for people in bronze plans.\n  That is what is continuing to happen with this health care law.\n  October was just about the Web site. January is going to be about \nreal people, their lives and their ability to get affordable quality \ncare from the doctors they know and trust.\n  The Obama administration made a lot of promises about this law. The \nadministration has known for months--I believe the administration has \nknown for years that many of the promises were not true. They knew \npeople would lose their doctors, and they knew millions of people would \nlose their health insurance plans. But instead of leveling with the \nAmerican people, the White House chose to mislead them.\n  It continues to mislead them today on one important issue after \nanother, and the people have seen through it. Washington Post, Tuesday, \nDecember 17, just yesterday: ``Obama's approval ratings plummet. Poll \nresults worrisome for Democrats looking to the midterm elections.'' A \nrespected group, politifacts.com, whose role is sorting out the truth \nin politics, has come up with their lie of the year, and they attribute \ntheir lie of the year for 2013 to President Obama: ``If you like your \nhealth care plan, you can keep it.'' That is the lie of the year to the \nAmerican people. So it is no surprise, then, that the President's \napproval ratings continue to plummet.\n  I looked at a decision this administration made very recently, a \ndecision to delay next year's open enrollment season until after the \nmidterm elections. To me, this is a blatant political move--a blatant \npolitical move that they snuck out the announcement just days before \nThanksgiving.\n  So what kind of announcement is the administration going to try to \nsneak out now, just before Christmas? Well, the enrollment period for \ninsurance coverage in 2015 was set to begin October 15, 2014, and then \nend in December. Now it won't begin until November 15. Why in the world \nwould they need to delay it for a month? Enrollment in the government \nhealth insurance exchange has been a disaster, but the administration \nsays it has fixed all the problems. So why do they want to delay it for \na month? What is the difference between October 15 and November 15? I \nbelieve it is because the administration is in a panic mode, and it \nwill do anything it can to hide the cost of the health care law on the \nAmerican people--hide the skyrocketing costs. What they have done is \nthey have moved it from a couple of weeks before the election until a \ncouple of weeks after election day 2014.\n  The American people don't need more lies. What they need from their \nPresident is for the President to come clean about the terrible effects \nof the law. The fact is that many Americans can't keep their coverage, \ncan't keep their doctors, and they can't afford this law.\n  The Associated Press put out a poll the other day. The headline was \n``Health Law Seen as Eroding Coverage.'' The health care is eroding \ncoverage. According to the poll, 69 percent of people say their \npremiums will be going up and 59 percent say their deductibles and \ncopayments will be increasing. People can't afford those kinds of price \nincreases--this whole redistribution of assets and wealth on the \nAmerican people. People were told by this President that their health \ncare costs were going to go down. Instead, they are seeing them go up.\n  The Obama administration doesn't want people learning about their \nnext increases right before the 2014 election, so they are trying to \nhide the truth. That is why today Senator Alexander, Senator Enzi, and \nI plan to introduce a bill to give the American people the transparency \nthey deserve when they are making important health care decisions for \ntheir families. We are calling this bill the Premium Disclosure Act, \nand it will do a couple of things.\n  First, the bill sets the exchange's opening date of October 15, 2014, \nin statute so that Democrats can't change it to meet their political \ngoals around an election.\n  Second, the bill says the Obama administration has to make premiums \nand cost-sharing requirements public 30 days before the open enrollment \nbegins, so people will have this important information in mid-\nSeptember, making it easier for families to budget and to plan.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services has previously said it \ndid not have this authority. That is why they said we need to wait \nuntil October 1 to find out what premiums would be this year. This bill \nwould specifically give the administration the authority, so they will \nhave no more excuses for hiding health insurance cost increases from \nthe American people.\n  Americans wanted a few very simple things from health care reform. \nThey wanted better access to care. Washington Democrats gave them less \naccess. They wanted lower costs, but Washington Democrats gave them \nhigher costs. They wanted help. Washington Democrats have caused them \nharm.\n  This bill will help add some transparency and shed light on things \nthe Obama administration does not want the American people to see. The \nPresident's health care law has been a failure. It cannot be fixed just \nby delaying one more part or by sending out the spin doctors one more \ntime or by having one more press conference. I hope when we return \nafter the New Year that President Obama and Democrats in Congress will \nbe ready to sit down with Republicans to talk about real bipartisan \nsolutions that put patients and families first.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1851. A bill to provide for incentives to encourage health \ninsurance coverage, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am introducing the Empowering Patients \nFirst Act, companion legislation to H.R. 2300, introduced in the House \nof Representatives by Congressman Tom Price. I thank Congressman Price \nfor all the hard work he did on this legislation. I am very grateful \nfor that.\n  I believe this legislation would give patients, families, and doctors \nthe power to make medical decisions, and not Washington.\n  Specifically, this legislation would enable everyone to purchase \nhealth insurance through deductions, credits, or advanceable credits; \nequalize tax treatment of employer-sponsored plans and plans purchased \nby individuals by letting individuals buy health insurance\n\n[[Page S8979]]\n\nwith pre-tax dollars; let small business owners band together across \nState lines through association health plans, known as AHPs, and take \nadvantage of the increased purchasing power which larger businesses are \nable to take advantage of through increased bargaining power, volume \ndiscounts, and administrative efficiencies. It would let consumers buy \ninsurance across State lines, and let individuals own their insurance \nlike a 401(k) plan so they can take it with them across State lines if \nthey change jobs.\n  I don't think there is any doubt in the majority of Americans' \nminds--and poll after poll indicates--that ObamaCare is a failure. The \nAmerican people do not believe in it. And it isn't just the problems \nwith the rollout of the Web site--it is all of the aspects of it which \nhave become so complex and so difficult.\n  Basically, it is as some of us who fought it day after day here on \nthe floor said: an experiment in social engineering, where young people \nwho are healthy are going to pay for the health care of those who are \nolder and sicker--a redistribution of wealth that then-Senator Obama \nfavored and stated when he was running for President.\n  That is not the way to address health care needs in America. It has \nnot bent the health care curve down. It has not allowed people, if they \nwant to keep their insurance, to be able to keep it. I noticed that was \nvoted as the biggest lie of the year by one of the periodicals here. \nAnd it is a failure.\n  We on the other side of this issue are also required to come up with \nalternatives, because we vowed to repeal and replace ObamaCare, not \njust repeal it. I believe that what Congressman Price has introduced, \nand what I am introducing today as a companion bill, is a step in that \ndirection.\n\n  It is time that we on this side of the aisle came up with our agenda \nfor health care in America because we know that the inflation \nassociated with health care costs is unsustainable, that there are \nmillions of Americans who do not have health care, and there is a \nparticular problem for those with preexisting conditions.\n  We need to repeal this horrendous mistake--which, by the way, was \ndone on strictly party line votes, the first entitlement program ever \nenacted that was done without a single bipartisan vote on it. As many \nof us predicted back in 2009 when this legislation was passed, it was \ndoomed to failure. Time after time, amendment after amendment, as we \nattempted to repeal it for 25 days, I believe it was, of floor \nconsideration back in 2009, it was voted down on a party line basis.\n  They sowed the wind and are now reaping the whirlwind. We need to \nrepeal the Affordable Care Act, and we need to replace it because \nhealth care in America is still not satisfactory, nor have we fulfilled \nthe needs and the obligations we have to all of our citizens.\n  The problems with the Affordable Care Act are well known: A failed \nWeb site rollout that has hindered enrollment and the purchase of \nmandated coverage. As of December 17, only an estimated 440,835 people \nhave enrolled for a health plan. That is 6.2 percent of the enrollment \ngoal of 7 million by March 31, 2014.\n  There is a destructive tax on medical devices that will discourage \ninnovation and encourage these businesses to move offshore. We have \nalready seen medical device manufacturers leaving the United States of \nAmerica as they said they would if they were taxed to the point where \nthey could not be competitive with medical devices that were \nmanufactured in foreign countries.\n  There is disappointment for Americans who are happy with their \ncurrent coverage and want to keep their coverage. It is estimated that \n10 million Americans will have their health plans terminated due to \nObamaCare.\n  According to a December 17 Washington Post-ABC poll, only 19 percent \nof Americans believe ObamaCare is improving the country's health care \nsystem. Only 8 percent believe ObamaCare is improving their insurance \ncoverage. Only 5 percent of Americans believe their health care costs \nare decreasing as a result of ObamaCare, and 47 percent of Americans \nbelieve the President's health care law is increasing the cost of their \nhealth care.\n  It is clear that ObamaCare is not working for the American people, \nand they have little faith in the administration's efforts to fix our \nbroken health care system.\n  This legislation I am introducing today makes the purchase of health \ncare financially feasible for all Americans--from deductions to \nadvanceable, refundable credits so that everyone has an economic \nincentive to purchase coverage they want for themselves and their \nfamilies, not what the government forces them to buy. In addition, it \nallows greater choices in portability, so that every health policy is \nowned by the patient, regardless of who pays. This means the coverage \nwould go with the person if they change or lose their job. It gives \nemployers more flexibility in the benefits offered and provides many \nmore coverage options for people with preexisting conditions so that no \none is priced out of the market, regardless of health status.\n  It addresses increasing costs by clamping down on abusive lawsuits, \nends the practice of defensive medicine, gains significant savings from \nhealth care efficiencies--sifting out waste, fraud, and abuse--and \nbringing our Nation's budget under control.\n  Finally, it establishes doctor-led quality measures, ensuring that \npatients receive quality care defined by people who know medicine, not \nby government. It encourages healthier lifestyles by giving employers \nand health policies more flexibility to offer discounts for healthy \nhabits through wellness and prevention programs.\n  If enacted, this legislation would save trillions of dollars. Douglas \nHoltz-Eakin, who is the former director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice and one of the most credible people in this town, estimates this \nlegislation would save American tax payers $2.37 trillion in its first \ndecade alone. According to the analysis of Mr. Holtz-Eakin, compared to \ncurrent law this legislation would produce smaller premium increases on \naverage, yielding lower premiums than current law--nearly 19 percent \nfor single policies and up to 15 percent for family policies; increase \npatient access to physicians; produce a 10-percent increase in medical \nproductivity; and increase the number of insured individuals by 29 \npercent.\n  Americans are looking for an alternative to ObamaCare. This \nlegislation is a step in the right direction and will provide Americans \nan alternative that empowers patients, families, and doctors to make \nthe medical decisions, not those in Washington, DC.\n  I find of interest in the Wall Street Journal an opinion piece \nentitled ``ObamaCare's Troubles Are Only Beginning,'' by Michael \nBoskin, a very well respected economist. It says:\n\n       Be prepared for eligibility, payment and information \n     protection debacles--and longer waits for care.\n\n  He says:\n\n       The shocks--economic and political--will get much worse \n     next year and beyond. Here's why: The ``sticker shock'' that \n     many buyers of new, ACA-compliant health plans have \n     experienced--with premiums 30% higher, or more, than their \n     previous coverage--has only begun. The costs borne by \n     individuals will be even more obvious next year as more \n     people start having to pay higher deductibles and copays.\n       If, as many predict, too few healthy young people sign up \n     for insurance that is overpriced in order to subsidize older, \n     sicker people, the insurance market will unravel in a ``death \n     spiral'' of ever-higher premiums and fewer signups. The \n     government, through taxpayer-funded ``risk corridors,'' is on \n     the hook for billions of dollars of potential insurance-\n     company losses. This will be about as politically popular as \n     bank bailouts.\n       The ``I can't keep my doctor'' shock will also hit more and \n     more people in coming months. To keep prices to consumers as \n     low as possible--given cost pressures generated by the \n     government's rules, controls and coverage mandates--insurance \n     companies in many cases are offering plans that have very \n     restrictive networks, with lower-cost providers that exclude \n     some of the best physicians and hospitals.\n\n  Finally, there is an article entitled ``Second wave of health care \nplan cancellations looms.'' It goes on to say:\n\n       An analysis by the American Enterprise Institute, a \n     conservative think tank, shows the administration anticipates \n     half to two-thirds of small businesses would have policies \n     canceled or be compelled to send workers into the ObamaCare \n     exchanges. They predict up to 100 million small and large \n     business policies could be canceled next year.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent these articles be printed in the Record.\n  It is time for us to begin to consider alternatives and recognize \nthat this legislation needs to be repaired and replaced.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S8980]]\n\n                            [Dec. 15, 2013]\n\n                ObamaCare's Troubles Are Only Beginning\n\n\n    Be prepared for eligibility, payment and information protection \n                  debacles--and longer waits for care.\n\n                         (By Michael J. Boskin)\n\n       The White House is claiming that the Healthcare.gov website \n     is mostly fixed, that the millions of Americans whose health \n     plans were canceled thanks to government rules may be able to \n     keep them for another year, and that in any event these \n     people will get better plans through ObamaCare exchanges. \n     Whatever the truth of these assertions, those who expect \n     better days ahead for the Affordable Care Act are in for a \n     rude awakening. The shocks--economic and political--will get \n     much worse next year and beyond. Here's why:\n        The ``sticker shock'' that many buyers of new, ACA-\n     compliant health plans have experienced--with premiums 30% \n     higher, or more, than their previous coverage--has only \n     begun. The costs borne by individuals will be even more \n     obvious next year as more people start having to pay higher \n     deductibles and copays.\n       If, as many predict, too few healthy young people sign up \n     for insurance that is overpriced in order to subsidize older, \n     sicker people, the insurance market will unravel in a ``death \n     spiral'' of ever-higher premiums and fewer signups. The \n     government, through taxpayer-funded ``risk corridors,'' is on \n     the hook for billions of dollars of potential insurance-\n     company losses. This will be about as politically popular as \n     bank bailouts.\n       The ``I can't keep my doctor'' shock will also hit more and \n     more people in coming months. To keep prices to consumers as \n     low as possible--given cost pressures generated by the \n     government's rules, controls and coverage mandates--insurance \n     companies in many cases are offering plans that have very \n     restrictive networks, with lower-cost providers that exclude \n     some of the best physicians and hospitals.\n       Next year, millions must choose among unfamiliar physicians \n     and hospitals, or paying more for preferred providers who are \n     not part of their insurance network. Some health outcomes \n     will deteriorate from a less familiar doctor-patient \n     relationship.\n       More IT failures are likely. People looking for health \n     plans on ObamaCare exchanges may be able to fill out their \n     applications with more ease. But the far more complex back-\n     office side of the webssite--where the information in their \n     application is checked against government databases to \n     determine the premium subsidies and prices they will be \n     charged, and where the applications are forwarded to \n     insurance companies--is still under construction. Be prepared \n     for eligibility, coverage gap, billing, claims, insurer \n     payment and patient information-protection debacles.\n       The next shock will come when the scores of millions \n     outside the individual market--people who are covered by \n     employers, in union plans, or on Medicare and Medicaid--\n     experience the downsides of ObamaCare. There will be longer \n     waits for hospital visits, doctors' appointments and \n     specialist treatment, as more people crowd fewer providers.\n       Those with means can respond to the government-driven \n     waiting lines by making side payments to providers or seeking \n     care through doctors who do not participate in insurance \n     plans. But this will be difficult for most people.\n       Next, the Congressional Budget Office's estimated 25% \n     expansion of Medicaid under ObamaCare will exert pressure on \n     state Medicaid spending (although the pressure will be \n     delayed for a few years by federal subsidies). This pressure \n     on state budgets means less money on education and \n     transportation, and higher state taxes.\n       The ``Cadillac tax'' on health plans to help pay for \n     ObamaCare starts four years from this Jan. 1. It will fall \n     heavily on unions whose plans are expensive due to generous \n     health benefits.\n       In the nearer term, a political iceberg looms next year. \n     Insurance companies usually submit proposed pricing to \n     regulators in the summer, and the open enrollment period \n     begins in the fall for plans starting Jan. 1. Businesses of \n     all sizes that currently provide health care will have to \n     offer ObamaCare's expensive, mandated benefits, or drop their \n     plans and--except the smallest firms--pay a fine. Tens of \n     millions of Americans with employer-provided health plans \n     risk paying more for less, and losing their policies and \n     doctors to more restrictive networks. The administration is \n     desperately trying to delay employer-plan problems beyond the \n     2014 election to avoid this shock.\n       Meanwhile, ObamaCare will lead to more part-time workers in \n     some industries, as hours are cut back to conform to \n     arbitrary definitions in the law of what constitutes full-\n     time employment. Many small businesses will be cautious about \n     hiring more than 50 full-time employees, which would subject \n     them to the law's employer insurance mandate.\n       On the supply side, medicine will become a far less \n     attractive career for talented young people. More doctors \n     will restrict practice or retire early rather than accept \n     lower incomes and work conditions they did not anticipate. \n     Already, many practices are closed to Medicaid recipients, \n     some also to Medicare. The pace of innovation in drugs, \n     medical devices and delivery is expected to slow \n     significantly, as higher taxes and even rationing set in.\n       The repeated assertions by the law's supporters that nobody \n     but the rich would be worse off was based on a beyond-\n     implausible claim that one could expand by millions the \n     number of people with health insurance, lower health-care \n     costs without rationing, and improve quality. The reality is \n     that any squeezing of insurance-company profits, or reduction \n     in uncompensated emergency-room care amounts to a tiny \n     fraction of the trillions of dollars extracted from those \n     people overpaying for insurance, or redistributed from \n     taxpayers.\n       The Affordable Care Act's disastrous debut sent the \n     president's approval ratings into a tailspin and \n     congressional Democrats in competitive districts fleeing for \n     cover. If the law's continuing unpopularity enables \n     Republicans to regain the Senate in 2014, the president will \n     be forced to veto repeated attempts to repeal the law or to \n     negotiate major changes.\n       The risk of a complete repeal if a Republican takes the \n     White House in 2016 will put enormous pressure on Democratic \n     candidates--and on Republicans--to articulate a compelling \n     alternative to the cost and coverage problems that beset \n     health care. A good start would be sliding-scale subsidies to \n     help people buy a low-cost catastrophic plan, purchasable \n     across state lines, equalized tax treatment of those buying \n     insurance on their own with those on employer plans, and \n     expanded high-risk pools.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From FoxNews, Nov. 20, 2013]\n\n             Second Wave of Health Plan Cancellations Looms\n\n       A new and independent analysis of ObamaCare warns of a \n     ticking time bomb, predicting a second wave of 50 million to \n     100 million insurance policy cancellations next fall--right \n     before the mid-term elections.\n       The next round of cancellations and premium hikes is \n     expected to hit employees, particularly of small businesses. \n     While the administration has tried to downplay the \n     cancellation notices hitting policyholders on the individual \n     market by noting they represent a relatively small fraction \n     of the population, the swath of people who will be affected \n     by the shakeup in employer-sponsored coverage will be much \n     broader.\n       An analysis by the American Enterprise Institute, a \n     conservative think tank, shows the administration anticipates \n     half to two-thirds of small businesses would have policies \n     canceled or be compelled to send workers onto the ObamaCare \n     exchanges. They predict up to 100 million small and large \n     business policies could be canceled next year.\n       ``The impact I'm mostly worried about is on small young, \n     entrepreneurial firms that will suddenly face much higher \n     health insurance premiums if they want to offer health \n     insurance to their employees,'' said AEI resident scholar \n     Stan Veuger. ``I think for a lot of other businesses . . . \n     they can just send their employees to the exchanges or offer \n     them a fixed subsidy every month to buy health insurance \n     themselves.''\n       Under the health care law, businesses with fewer than 50 \n     workers do not have to provide health coverage. But if they \n     do, the policies will still have to meet the benefit \n     standards set by ObamaCare.\n       As reported by AEI's Scott Gottlieb, some businesses got \n     around this by renewing their policies before the end of \n     2013. But the relief is temporary, and they are expected to \n     have to offer in-compliance plans for 2015. According to \n     Gottlieb, that means beginning in October 2014 the \n     cancellation notices will start to go out.\n       Then, businesses will have to either find a new plan--which \n     could be considerably more expensive--or send workers onto \n     the ObamaCare exchanges.\n       For workers, their experience could mirror that of the 5 \n     million or so on the individual market who already received \n     cancellation notices because their plans did not meet new \n     standards under the Affordable Care Act.\n       President Obama announced last week that insurance \n     companies could offer out-of-compliance plans for another \n     year. But that only means the cancellation notices will \n     resume late next year.\n       Obama met Wednesday with state insurance commissioners \n     about the change. In a statement afterward, National \n     Association of Insurance Commissioners President Jim Donelon \n     voiced concern with the change but said: ``We will work with \n     the insurance companies in our states to implement changes \n     that make sense while following our mandate of consumer \n     protection.''\n       The business community has already been hit with another \n     side effect from ObamaCare. Because the law will require \n     businesses with more than 50 full-time workers to offer \n     health coverage, there are reports that companies are \n     shifting employees to part-time status to avoid hitting the \n     threshold.\n       Though the administration describes these accounts as \n     anecdotal--and has already delayed the employer mandate by a \n     year--studies suggest otherwise.\n       The International Franchise Association and the U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce have studied the impact and say the \n     president's health care law has resulted in higher costs and \n     fewer full-time positions.\n       A survey showed 31 percent of franchise businesses, and 12 \n     percent of non-franchise businesses, have already reduced \n     worker hours. It also showed 27 percent of franchise \n     businesses, and 12 percent of non-franchise businesses, have \n     replaced full-time workers with part-time employees.\n\n[[Page S8981]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/18/senate-section/article/S8981-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 323--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON \nMAINTAINING THE CURRENT ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT IN RETIRED PAY FOR MEMBERS OF \n                  THE ARMED FORCES UNDER THE AGE OF 62\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS (for himself, Mr. Isakson, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. McCain, \nMr. Hoeven, Mr. Johnson of Wisconsin, Ms. Collins, Mr. Blunt, and Mr. \nPortman) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Armed Services:\n\n                              S. Res. 323\n\n       Whereas is the responsibility of Congress to get the fiscal \n     house of government in order, and all government spending \n     should be examined to achieve that goal;\n       Whereas HJ Res. 59 (113th Congress), a bipartisan budget \n     proposal, is a first step is this direction, though it fails \n     to address broader government spending issues;\n       Whereas retirees from the Armed Forces, both those who \n     served a full career and those medically retired and their \n     survivors, have provided great service and sacrificed much \n     for our country;\n       Whereas HJ Res. 59 (113h Congress) disproportionally \n     targets these military retirees in the name of fiscal \n     responsibility; and\n       Whereas, while the decisions regarding future spending cuts \n     may be difficult and painful, the solution should require \n     contributions from all Americans: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) retirees from the Armed Forces should not unfairly bear \n     the burden of excessive government spending;\n       (2) military retirees earned the benefits they were \n     promised upon entering military, and it is the duty of the \n     Senate to protect them; and\n       (3) the Senate should seek alternatives to the provisions \n     of section 403 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2103 \n     (introduced as HJ Res. 59 (113th Congress)) before the \n     effective date of that section and the amendments made by \n     that section.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a sense of the \nSenate resolution to address the issue of military retirement pay in \nthis budget proposal.\n  It is the responsibility of Congress to get our fiscal house in order \nand that all government spending should be examined to achieve that \ngoal. However, this budget proposal disproportionately targets the \nretirees of the U.S. Armed Forces in the name of fiscal responsibility.\n  We, as a body, acknowledge military retirees, both those who served \nfull careers and those who have medically retired and their survivors. \nThey have provided great service and sacrificed much for our country. \nMaking decisions regarding future spending cuts would be difficult and \npainful, but the solution should require contributions from all \nAmericans, not just our servicemembers who have sacrificed so much.\n  Therefore, I, along with Senator Isakson--and I am pleased to say \nSenator Murkowski and Senator McCain--have joined in offering a sense \nof the Senate resolution that military retirees should not unfairly \nbear the burden of our excessive government spending.\n  Our military retirees earned the benefits they were promised upon \nentering the military, and it is our duty to protect them.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Chambliss in \nthis sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It is absolutely important that we \nnot disproportionately burden those who have served us and who have \nsaved us, and our veterans have done both. As we deal with the \ndifficult decisions in the years ahead on getting our debt and our \ndeficit in order, it is important that we all share part of the burden, \nthat we all put our shoulder to the yoke and we make sure we don't \ndisproportionately put it on our veterans or on any segment of our \nsociety. We are all in this together. But, most importantly, we are all \nhere today because of the sacrifice of our men and women in harm's way, \nand we cannot single them out for disproportionate savings in terms of \nthe budget and the deficit.\n  I commend Senator Chambliss on his leadership, and I am happy to join \nhim in this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/18/senate-section/article/S8981-2", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 324--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT \nTO THE TRAGIC SHOOTING AT LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT ON NOVEMBER \n  1, 2013, OF EMPLOYEES OF THE TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, and Mrs. Feinstein) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
