Mr. President, I am satisfied and pleased that we have a \nnumber of Senators on the floor wishing to speak. I am going to say \njust a few brief words, and then we are going to go into a quorum call \nuntil the Republican leader comes. He has some things to do here. So we \nwill wait for him.\n  Mr. President, we find ourselves at the end of this work period \nhaving done not a lot. There is a lot of blame to go around, and we \ncould spend all day blaming each other, but the fact is we need to do \nbetter.\n\n[[Page S5318]]\n\n  I am grateful, though; yesterday we were able to pass the veterans \nconference report. It wasn't what we passed out of the Senate, but it \nwas OK. It will help. I admire very much the people who were able to \nget that done.\n  Bernie Sanders worked extremely hard, and I am not sure he could have \ncompleted that without the work of the senior Senator from Arizona.\n  The bill was dead, the conference was really dead, a week ago. But \nthe senior Senator from Arizona weighed in, and with his influence with \nDemocrats and Republicans, it was made possible to move forward and was \nbrought back on track.\n  I am surprised my friend from Arizona is here. I acknowledge the work \nthat he did. Others worked on it, of course, but without his McCain-\nlike advocacy last Friday and Thursday night, it wouldn't have \nhappened.\n  Mr. President, I am not only grateful for the conference report we \ngot on the veterans matter but also the highway bill. Now, I think we \nneed a long-term highway bill, and I think we will get one in the near \nfuture. The work done by Senator Boxer and others to have a long-term \nbill because they wanted us to finish something this year didn't come \nto fruition. We passed it here. But we worked together and have a bill \nthat will allow construction to continue.\n  In the House, I regret they weren't able to overcome Republican \nresistance to funding a response to the humanitarian crisis at the \nborder. Again, we could stand here for the next couple hours and affix \nblame as to whose fault it is. The fact is I don't think it is going to \nget done.\n  I watched the House closely. I have heard commentators. It is \nsurprising but I am told that even Charles Krauthammer today said: This \nis a little unusual. They weren't able to complete their work yesterday \nand the day before. So what they have done is demanded that President \nObama do things on his own, for which they have sued him. That is a \nlittle inconsistent. One of the Republican senior House Members was on \n``Morning Joe'' this morning. He said the same thing. But the House \nappears to be heading from bad to worse as the House Republican \nmajority hunts for votes on border policy.\n  So let's be clear about what is happening today on the other side of \nthe Capitol.\n  House Republicans will vote to deport children who have been living \nin the United States their entire lives, all in a pathetic attempt to \nappease the tea party. The worse the bill gets the more votes they are \ngetting over there. That is the harsh, wrong-headed idea. If the House \ndoes pass a bill, I can't imagine it could be cleared on either side \nover here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/08/01/senate-section/article/S5318-1", "month": "08", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5318-S5319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  MAKING CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY \n                  ADMINISTRATION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2014\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 220, H.J. Res. 76; that a \nReid-McConnell-Mikulski substitute amendment at the desk providing \nemergency appropriations for the Iron Dome defense system in Israel be \nagreed to; that the joint resolution, as amended, be read a third time \nand passed; that the Reid-McConnell-Mikulski title amendment, which is \nat the desk, be agreed to; and the motions to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid on the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me say to my friend, the majority leader, this is \na good example of our being able to put aside partisan considerations \nand work together to help our good friend Israel.\n  I particularly want to salute Senator Graham and Senator McCain, who \nhave been absolutely relentless in their efforts to make sure we send \nthis important signal to Israel at a very tough time for them. They are \nbeing, in my view, criticized by everyone for pursuing a policy that I \nam absolutely certain we would pursue if somebody across our border \nwere launching missiles at our civilian population.\n  I think it is important for us to send a signal that the United \nStates stands behind one of its best friends--if not its best friend--\nin the world.\n  I think the Prime Minister of Israel pretty well summed it up when he \nsaid: There is no moral equivalency here. Hamas launches missiles on \ncivilians, and Israel warns civilians when it attempts to attack. And \nHamas uses its own civilians to protect its missiles. There is no moral \nequivalency whatsoever.\n  So as much of the world levels its criticism at Israel, I think it is \nimportant for the United States to say: What nonsense to suggest that \nthe Israelis are doing anything that almost any country in the world \nwould have done had its citizens been threatened by a neighbor as \nIsrael has experienced.\n  So, obviously, I do not object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to thank both \nleaders for their efforts in bringing about this much-needed--not only \nthe funding but the signal that the Congress will send and the \nPresident will sign that we are supporting them.\n  We all know the latest news is, tragically, that a proposed cease-\nfire has broken down. Apparently an Israeli soldier has been captured. \nAnd all of us know the ramifications of that in the future, the value \nthe Israeli Government and people rightfully put on each one of their \ncitizens who serve.\n  I thank again our majority leader and the Republican leader for \ncoming together on this most important signal. This isn't just about \nmoney. It is a signal from the American people and the American \ntaxpayers that we are with the Israelis, because if they do not have \nIron Dome, they can't defend themselves. It is that simple. The Iron \nDome is the ability to keep innocent civilians and neighborhoods and \nfamilies from being destroyed by these barrages of literally thousands \nof incoming rockets.\n  Again, I thank my friend. There has been no one more relentless in \nthis effort than the Senator from South Carolina. I yield for him.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the time is blurred now. Yesterday, or \nearly this morning, a very bad occurrence happened to the people of \nIsrael. During a cease-fire which they agreed to, an Israeli unit \napparently was attacked by a Hamas suicide bomber. After that attack \nthere was a charge against the unit in question, and apparently a \nsoldier has been kidnapped and taken to the tunnels.\n  It is so appropriate that today, of all days, the Senate speaks in \none voice.\n  I cannot thank Senator Reid enough for making this happen. Senator \nMcConnell has worked to make sure it got cleared on our side, and it \nfinally has.\n  They are running out of Iron Dome missiles to protect themselves. To \nwhom do they turn? To us.\n  Mr. President, $225 million is a lot of money, but it is a rounding \nerror in the budget.\n  It is not only the missiles that matter; it is the message that goes \nwith the missiles: We are with you. Here are the missiles. Use them to \ndefend yourself. We will stand with you on the battlefield. We will \nstand with you in the court of public opinion, and we are going to push \nback against the United Nations, which is becoming more and more anti-\nIsraeli. As dysfunctional as the Congress has been, this is one of our \nfiner moments.\n\n  We are about to leave here soon with a lot of work undone, but let it \nbe said that we did have the foresight and the ability and, quite \nfrankly, the moral decency to end on a positive note.\n  You can say a lot about this Congress--and much criticism is \ndeserved--but here is what you cannot say: We left Israel in the lurch. \nIn a bipartisan manner we were there when they needed us the most.\n  To our friends in Israel: Stay as long as you need to stay. Do \nwhatever you need to do.\n  To our friends in Palestine: We grieve when children are killed. \nThere is no more innocent person on the planet than a child.\n  To the Palestinian people: Reject Hamas and seek peace. We are not \nyour\n\n[[Page S5319]]\n\nenemy. We stand to help you, but you have to reject a terrorist \norganization that has the coldest and darkest of hearts, that would \nkill every Israeli child and put your children at risk. Reject this \nhateful ideology while you still can.\n  To our friends in Israel: There is more to come when it comes to \nstanding by your side.\n  I thank both leaders of the Senate for rising to the occasion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the words of my three friends.\n  Mr. President, there are times when partisanship does not exist. I \nhope everyone will note that last night when we couldn't get this \ncleared--I, we--there was no finger-pointing. I understand the person \nobjected. He is a fine man. He is a man of principle. But I have faith \nin this institution and our sticking by our friend. So I am happy to be \nhere today to be a part of this conclusion.\n  The situation in Israel is grave. We think this Iron Dome protects \nIsrael. It protects a lot of Israel. But Israel does not have enough \nIron Domes--plural--to protect them. They need more. But this will \ncertainly be a step in the right direction.\n  Three thousand rockets have been fired in the last 2\\1/2\\, 3 weeks--\n3,000. But for this technology that was perfected by the Israelis, they \nwould be in dire straits. There would be a war in the Middle East that \nwe cannot imagine.\n  Let's be realistic. Are we going to benefit from what they have done? \nOf course we are. They are sharing this technology with us as we speak.\n  There was a cease-fire that lasted about 2\\1/2\\ hours. It is terribly \nunfortunate what is going on over there, but, as David Brooks said on \n``NewsHour''--this conservative columnist said he had never known of a \nconflict in history where one side says: Kill more of us. It is hard to \ncomprehend. When the Israelis notify someone ``there is going to be \naction taken in this building you are in; would you leave,'' the \nleadership in Gaza tells them to stay there, and unfortunately a lot of \nthem do. This is something that is hard for me to comprehend, that \nsomething like this goes on.\n  That little country, that tiny little country is the only democracy \nin that whole area. That is it.\n  Netanyahu--if I were in Israel, I may have voted for someone else, \nbut the Israeli people determine who leads that country. I don't know \nof a bond of friendship that we have or ever had in world history \nbetter than this one, and so I will stand by Israel. I will stand by \nIsrael for a lot of personal reasons but certainly for political \nreasons, and I have no hesitation in declaring to the world that is how \nI feel.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the Director \nof the National Counterterrorism Center Matt Olsen. Matt has announced \nhis intention to leave his position later this year after serving as \nDirector of NCTC for over 3 years. Matt is one of the best and \nbrightest public servants with whom I have had the pleasure to work. I \nwish to take a couple of minutes to thank him for a job well done.\n  As vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I \nhave had the opportunity to work very closely with Matt, as he served \nin a number of key positions in the intelligence community. Regardless \nof his position, Matt has served with integrity and has provided sound, \nhonest counsel, which has benefited not only me but numerous other \nMembers of this body.\n  At NCTC Matt has overseen several key initiatives that have enhanced \nNCTC's ability to discover and prevent terrorist attacks, such as the \nPursuit Group that was put in place after the failed attack on \nNorthwest flight 253. Matt has been a strong advocate for NCTC's \nmission, striving to make sure NCTC has the right people and the right \ndata to get the job done. He has done his part and has kept the Center \nacutely focused on terrorist threats to the homeland.\n  I am certainly glad I supported his nomination and can attest that \nMatt is a man of his word. Before joining NCTC, Matt served as the \nNational Security Agency's general counsel and as an Associate Deputy \nAttorney General at the Department of Justice. Matt worked on several \nnational security issues at DOJ but quickly became an expert on the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act and its implementation. Matt has \nan excellent perspective of the role of surveillance and keeping this \ncountry safe, and I hope he will participate in the public debate on \nthis issue even after his departure from government service.\n  I would like to say a special thanks to his wife Fern and his three \nchildren: Elizabeth, Nate, and Will. Matt has missed many nights and \nweekends with his family as the Director of NCTC and throughout his \npublic service career. I am sure these sacrifices have been difficult \nat times, but our Nation is better for it. I know Matt has spent every \nday of his tenure as Director focusing on how best to neutralize the \nincreasing threat posed by Al Qaeda and its affiliates.\n  Matt's family should be very proud of his outstanding achievements \nand his dedicated efforts to protect our national security. I \nunderstand Matt plans to return to teaching and spend some well-\ndeserved free time with his family. His presence will be missed at NCTC \nas well as on the Hill. To Matt and his family, thanks again and best \nwishes for whatever the future holds.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I intend to speak on a couple matters in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S5320]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

That column also was hit by antitank missiles, and \na group of Palestinian Hamas fighters engaged the column, resulting in \nthe capture of one Israeli soldier.\n  For lack of a better way of explaining this, there was a cease-fire. \nIsrael was acting consistent with the terms of the cease-fire, and this \nwas a planned military operation to take advantage of the cease-fire. \nIn the law of war this would be a great breach. At the end of the day \nIsrael is a victim of a group of people called Hamas that lie, cheat, \nhave everything in their being that most of us should condemn.\n  So what has the Senate done? This could be a very good day for the \nU.S.-Israeli relationship. To my Democratic and Republican colleagues \nin the Senate, you have risen to the occasion. I thank the majority \nleader Senator Reid and the minority leader Senator McConnell for \nbringing up Iron Dome funding. I thank all of my colleagues for \nallowing the funding to go forward. Senator Coburn was trying to find \nan offset. He is being consistent in trying to bring our fiscal house \nin order. He is a very principled man, but he understood the urgency of \nthe matter in Israel and withdrew his objection last night.\n  To our friends in Israel, the Senate has acted in a unanimous \nfashion, bipartisan in nature, to appropriate $225 million to resupply \nthe missiles that you need to defend yourself under the Iron Dome \nProgram. With the missiles comes a message. The message is we are with \nyou. Take as long us you need. Go where you need to go to deal with \nthis terrorist threat called Hamas.\n  To the Palestinian people, we are not your enemy. We hope one day you \nwill reject Hamas and try to find a peaceful solution to your problems \nwith your Israeli neighbors, and we stand ready to help in that regard.\n  The Palestinian Authority and Israel have a good working relationship \nwhen it comes to the West Bank. Hamas has been in charge of Gaza for \nseveral years now, and this cycle of violence repeats itself. You will \nhave a cease-fire. You will have a lull in the violence. One year later \nyou will fight Hamas again. They have fired over 15,000 rockets into \nIsrael. In 2005 Israel withdrew from Gaza, giving land for peace. The \nland was given, the peace has been unattainable.\n  So the real root of the problem is Hamas. There is no moral \nequivalency here. Hamas is trying to kill every Israeli possible. They \nare firing missiles by the thousands indiscriminately into Israel. They \ncould care less where they land. Thank God for the Iron Dome. The most \nheinous of all is they have put their own people in harm's way as human \nshields. As Israel tries to tell people to withdraw from an area \nbecause it is coming under attack, Hamas says: Ignore the leaflets. You \ngo to that area.\n  There is a video where a hospital was occupied by Hamas fighters. \nIsrael gave 2 days' notice to evacuate the hospital. When the hospital \nwas destroyed militarily because it became a command center for Hamas, \nsecondary explosions went on for quite a while. It was also an ammo \ndump.\n  So Hamas uses mosques, hospitals, apartment complexes. We found two \ninstances of Hamas rockets being stored in U.N. schools. They are \nviolating every known tenet of the law of war. They are using their own \npeople as human shields in an unprecedented strategic manner.\n  As to the United Nations, you are about to run afoul of the Congress. \nThe Human Rights Commission issued a resolution that had one sentence \ncondemning the attacks on Israeli civilians. It never mentioned the \nword ``Hamas.'' It basically accused Israel of being a war criminal.\n  It passed 27 to 1. We were the lone vote objecting to the resolution, \nwhich was so out of sync with reality, and several major nations \nabstained.\n  The United Nations is becoming more anti-Israeli as I speak. Anti-\nSemitism is spreading throughout the world, but let it be said that the \nSenate in a bipartisan fashion will have no part of this. The United \nNations is a force that could be used for the good or it could be a \nforce to make problems worse.\n  I consider myself, as a Republican, an internationalist. I believe in \nforeign assistance. I believe in helping people. I believe in leading \nthe world, not having the world run us over. Ronald Reagan is a great \nrole model from my point of view. He said: America makes history. That \nis our destiny. We shape history; we are not overrun by it. That does \nnot mean we have to become the world's policeman or act as the Lone \nRanger. It does mean we have to stay involved in the world. That is my \npoint of view. But it is very hard to maintain that point of view when \nthe United Nations, I believe, is being hijacked in such a fashion.\n  To the United Nations leadership: You are about to run afoul of the \nCongress, who wants to be part of the body that wants to shape the \nworld for the better. By your constant condemning of Israel in a \ndisproportionate manner to what is going on, on the ground in Gaza, \nbeware of where you are taking this. To the Human Rights Commission: \nYou have become a joke in the eyes of Congress.\n  The second thing I hope we can do is pass a resolution that was \nauthored by myself and Senator Menendez this morning. It is cleared on \nthe Republican side. I think we are about there on the Democratic side.\n  So what have we done? Tactically, the Senate has acted in a fashion \nto resupply missiles to the Iron Dome Program that is literally under \nsiege. Strategically, we have a partnership agreement pending before \nthe Senate that reaffirms our relationship for years to come as a \nsignal to Israel: Strategically, we will be your partner as far as the \neye can see.\n  So that is pending before the Senate, and I hope we can clear it \ntoday. Today, of all days, would be a great time for us to make \ndecisions that reinforce the military capability of the Israelis to \ndefend themselves, recommit ourselves to a strategic partnership.\n  And the third thing we could do is lend our moral voices as a nation \nby condemning the attack of Hamas against the Israeli defense forces \nand the capturing of a soldier.\n  This resolution thoroughly points out the cease-fire breach by Hamas, \nthe preplanned attack on the Israeli column during the cease-fire, the \ncapturing of a soldier. We are condemning this activity as a breach of \ninternational law, and we are urging that Hamas return the IDF soldier.\n  This resolution would give the moral voice of our Nation and the \nSenate to the cause Israel faces. So if we could, in a dysfunctional \nCongress--and we deserve a lot of criticism, both parties are to \nblame--but if we could end the day speaking as one on something that is \nvery important, the survival of our friends in Israel--not being anti-\nPalestinian but being pro-Israel and pro-peace and being anti-Hamas--I \njust wish and hope and pray the Palestinian people will reject Hamas \nand turn in a new direction because in that direction you will find \npeace and you will find America as a partner.\n  So let it be said the Senate, in the most turbulent political times, \nfound its way when it came to supporting our friends in Israel by \nappropriating money to help their military which is under siege, by \npassing a strategic partnership agreement that reaffirms the \nrelationship, and by lending our voice to what happened today in \ncondemning, in no uncertain terms, the vicious attack and the breach of \nthe cease-fire by Hamas.\n  If we could do those three things today, it would be the right \nmessage, it would send the right message at the right time, and it \nwould solidify this relationship that is so important because the \nenemies of Israel are our enemies also. Radical Islam has the same \ndesire to kill us and destroy our way of life as they do Israel. At the \nend of the day we have to understand our fates are tied together.\n\n[[Page S5321]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/08/01/senate-section/article/S5321-1", "month": "08", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          CRISIS ON THE BORDER\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the second issue I would like to talk \nabout is my colleagues in the House are trying to find their way to \npass legislation regarding the crisis on the border. They tried \nyesterday. They failed. They are back at it again.\n  I thank Speaker Boehner, from the Republican point of view, for not \nleaving town until we have a solution in a Republican-controlled House. \nIt has been hard to find. It is an emotional issue. It is a difficult \nissue on many levels. The human suffering of the children--everybody is \nmoved by that, as we should be. But we cannot incentivize these three \ncountries in question to keep sending their children here, putting \ntheir children at risk, and overrunning our systems. That is not the \nway to deal with our neighbor.\n\n  So the House hopefully will pass legislation reforming the 2008 law \nthat needs to be reformed to make children from Guatemala, El Salvador, \nHonduras, that region subject to the same laws as if you came from \nMexico, and they are putting money aside to deal with the deportation \nproblem and the humanitarian crisis.\n  If they can pass a solution to this problem, I am urging the majority \nleader of the Senate to bring us back in because we should not be gone \nfor 5 weeks with something this important left unresolved. You may not \nagree with the House, but let's take up their proposal, amend it, vote \non it, vote it up or vote it down, take the prior Democratic proposal, \nallow amendments to be had on both sides of the aisle, and see if we \ncan find common ground on dealing with the border.\n  The President at one time embraced changes in the 2008 law. That has \nto be done or we will never solve the problem.\n  I do not mind spending money in a humanitarian fashion as long as we \nare spending money to solve the problem, not perpetuate it. So if the \nHouse can find its way in offering a solution to the border crisis, I \nam urging my Democratic colleagues who control this body to act. Let's \nnot be gone for 5 weeks. Bring us all back. See if we can find a \nsolution among ourselves in the Senate, talk to our colleagues in the \nHouse and solve the problem.\n  It is within our power to do so. I know we can get there. I know \nthere are at least five or six Democrats who understand throwing money \nat the problem without changing the 2008 law gets you nowhere. There \nare plenty of people on our side who understand a humanitarian crisis \ndoes exist. Let's marry these forces and see if we can come up with a \nbipartisan compromise in the Senate.\n  The only way you can do that is to be allowed to offer amendments and \ndebate. I cannot think of a problem more dramatic facing the Nation \nright now in terms of a crisis than what is happening on our border: \n50,000 unaccompanied children, the spike in people coming from Central \nAmerica after President Obama unilaterally gave amnesty to children \nalready here. No matter how well intentioned, it has created the belief \nin that part of the world that if you make it to America you can stay.\n  We want you to understand there is a legal way to get to America. \nJust do not show up on the doorstep and ask to be taken in. That is not \na way for our Nation to have to deal with people wanting to come to \nthis Nation. So I hope we will not be gone for 5 weeks with this \nproblem unaddressed.\n  If the House can get its act together and pass a solution to the \nproblem, it would be incumbent, in my view, upon the Senate to \nreconvene, deal with the House proposal, come up with one of our own, \nand engage the House to solve this problem. Five weeks is a very long \ntime to be away from a problem this important.\n  As to the August break, contrary to what a lot of people may believe, \nwe do not all go on vacation. We try to take some time for ourselves \nand our families. But it is a chance to go visit other parts of the \nworld, to get informed on problems that can come here in terms of \naffecting our national security. Situations over there are going to \ncome here if we do not deal with them responsibly. It is a chance to do \nthings in your State. So people are very busy during August. They try \nto capture some time for themselves. But at the end of the day, 5 weeks \nis way too long to be absent from Washington as the crisis on the \nborder gets worse. If the House can find a solution to this problem, I \nam urging the Democratic-controlled Senate to bring us back, take up \ntheir solution, vote it up, vote it down, bring back the Senate bill, \nallow it to be amended so we can find consensus. Consensus is there if \nwe want to find it.\n  I appreciate the Presiding Officer's voice on national security. The \nPresiding Officer has been a stalwart friend of Israel in trying to \nfind a way forward regarding the problems the Ukrainian people face. I \nhope we can find a solution to our border crisis. But a final thought \nas to Israel: Today could be a very good day for the U.S.-Israel \nrelationship. It started in the Senate. I hope my House colleagues will \npass the Iron Dome legislation that we passed by unanimous consent \ntoday. The House needs to get this done so the President can sign this \ninto law.\n  To my colleagues in the House: Please take up Iron Dome. Let's get \nthis right.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/08/01/senate-section/article/S5321-2", "month": "08", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5321-S5322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 2673\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we all know that our ally Israel is in a \nfight for survival because a terrorist group, so named by the United \nStates and Europe, is at war with Israel right now. We remember how it \nall started, with the kidnapping of three Israeli boys and the torture \nand the deaths, and Hamas praised that. Tragically, there was a revenge \nkilling, and the Israeli Government arrested the Israelis responsible \nfor that and they are going to face justice, while Hamas praises--\npraises--what happened.\n  Today I spoke to the Ambassador, and this is what I heard him say--\nand I haven't fact-checked this, but as I understand it there was a \ncease-fire in place, all sides agreed everything was clear. Israel was \ngoing to be allowed to clear out the tunnels which are being used to \nopen to Hamas the country of Israel, where they go under the ground and \nthey have one objective--to kill Israelis, to torture them, to kidnap \nthem. No country--no country--could ever live with that, no country--\nnot our country.\n  Imagine if we had 100 rockets a day coming from Mexico or Canada or \nfrom the sea, either side. We would never ever sit back for that. We \nwould never sit back if under our great cities we had terrorists \nbuilding tunnels so they could sneak in suicide bombers to kill our \npeople.\n  Here we had a cease-fire, and I know the Secretary of State worked \nhard. Yet and still what happened, even though it was known that Israel \nwas permitted to continue clearing out these tunnels, a suicide bomber \nblew himself up, killed Israeli soldiers and someone else grabbed and \nkidnapped--we think--we think--an Israeli soldier. We don't know all \nthe facts on it. This must be condemned.\n  We have a bill, Senator Blunt and I, and it has 81 cosponsors on it. \nIt is the Israeli American strategic partnership act, and it will send \na strong signal today that we stand with Israel. We want peace. We want \njustice. We want a good life for the Israelis and the Palestinian \npeople. But you cannot do it when you have a terrorist organization \nrunning, in essence, the Gaza Strip.\n  In this bill Senator Blunt and I have worked on, there is a visa \nwaiver section, and I want to go over that because I fear we may have \nobjections to this. I am hoping not, I still hope we won't, but in this \nvisa waiver section it does three things: First, it expresses the sense \nof the Senate that Israel should be designated as a program country \nunder the Visa Waiver Program.\n  Second, it urges United States engagement with Israel to help it meet \nthe requirements of the waiver program; i.e., when Israelis come over\n\n[[Page S5322]]\n\nthey pay attention to the time on their visas and they go back to their \ncountry when the time is up.\n  Third, it authorizes but doesn't require the administration to waive \na nonimmigrant visa waiver requirement only if Israel meets all the \nother program requirements.\n  Here is what is important. There are 38 countries in the Visa Waiver \nProgram. These countries represent some of America's closest allies. In \nfact, 20 of the current Visa Waiver Program countries are NATO allies. \nSo I want to say clearly to my friend Senator Sessions and anyone \nwithin the sound of my voice that the provision I hope he will not \nobject to today, the provision gives Israel, the strongest ally of the \nUnited States in the Middle East, a chance to join the program. As a \nmember of the Visa Waiver Program, Israeli citizens, many of whom have \nfamilies in America, would be allowed to visit the United States for up \nto 90 days without first obtaining a visa. This deepens the ties \nbetween our nations.\n  I want to read some of the countries that have these privileges: \nLithuania, Latvia, Hungary, Slovakia, Estonia, the Czech Republic. I \nwas proud to support them, but I am also proud to say that Israel \ndeserves to be on that list. Why shouldn't they have the same \nopportunity?\n  When we first wrote our visa waiver provision, there were objections \nthat we didn't have enough flexibility. We changed it and now we have \n81 sponsors on this legislation. I would ask, how many pieces of \nlegislation have 81 cosponsors? You couldn't even get it for a Mother's \nDay resolution. I mean this is strong. And of all the times for us to \nobject to this United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act, it \nshould not be today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 492, S. 2673; that the bill be \nread a third time and passed; and the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid on the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving my right to object, I appreciate Senator \nBoxer's leadership on this issue. She is a great advocate and a strong \nsupporter of Israel, as I am, and have been consistently since I have \nbeen in the Senate.\n  I would note for the Senator that the expansion of this program has \nbeen problematic for some time. I have been involved with the Visa \nWaiver Program for quite a number of years. So my concern is not based \non Israel, it is based on trying to maintain consistency and \neffectiveness of the program.\n  It is not a program that I think is operating effectively. Congress \nhas declared that no more waivers be granted until after this biometric \nexit system has been completed. I believe our House colleagues are \nconsidering a bill that is very similar to what Senator Boxer and \nothers are supporting but it does not include this provision.\n  Based on that, I am not able to support this amendment and would \nobject.\n  Mr. President, if the Senator would allow me, I would say let's pass \na bill without that provision in it. Let's get that done today, and I \nwill commit to further research and digging into this to see if there \nis any legitimate way based on law and consistency and the integrity of \nthe visa waiver system that I could support it. It might be. Israel is \nan educated country. We have a lot of people who travel back and forth \nbetween our countries. It is just so far the State Department has not \napproved it. The House does not have it in their bill, and I and the \nMembers of the Judiciary Committee who have dealt with these issues for \nquite a number of years--I have resisted the expansion of this program \ncontrary to the law and State Department policy. Regretfully I have \nobjected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I won't be long, but I am so disappointed. \nI know my friend wants to be helpful, but I have to say that the visa \nwaiver section--I am not being stubborn about this--all it does is it \nsays that Israel should have the same privileges as Lithuania, Latvia, \nEstonia, and the Czech Republic.\n  Of all the days to say no to this bill, with what is going on over \nthere. It hurts my heart. It breaks my heart, because this bill \nauthorizes $200 million in the value of U.S. weapons sales in Israel to \na total of $1.8 billion. It is a stockpile that is intended to be used \nby U.S. forces, but in event of emergency, Israel can tap that. And, my \nGod, this is an emergency. It is so critical. In fact, just last week \nthe United States provided Israel with ammunition from the stockpile \nafter Israel requested help to replace its depleted supplies.\n  We shouldn't be waiting another hour to pass this, and here we are as \nthe clock ticks down and we go off on our break and as my friend knows, \nthis bill doesn't cost one slim dime--not one slim dime--not one penny. \nIt is such a signal to Israel that we stand with her.\n  It also has an energy section where we help Israel develop her \nnatural gas supplies to become energy independent. It is so sad for me \ntoday.\n  Last night Senator Corker had an objection. He cleared it. He and I \nhad a real go-to on it. I know we had a bit of a misunderstanding. He \nbacked off. I am so appreciative. Then Senator Coburn had a problem, \nand he backed off and he said, ``No, I kind of like this section.'' \nThen Senator Lee had a problem and Senator Coburn talked to Senator Lee \nand Senator Lee was fine.\n  We have 81 people on this bill, and 1 Senator this afternoon is \nholding it hostage because he doesn't like the program. Well, we can \nall work together on the program, but why single out Israel because you \ndon't like the program? Let this go.\n  We can have a colloquy. We can work together, Senator Sessions. We \ncan make sure there is no abuse here. We changed this so we would be \nsure there is no abuse.\n  I am very saddened at this, and all I can say is that Senator Blunt \nand I are coming back with this bill over and over and over again, and \none way or the other we will get it done.\n  I say to my friends in Israel: Take heart. Eighty-one of our Senators \nare with you on this bill, and only a handful haven't even gone on, and \nonly one--only one--objected. So take heart, because we are with you \nand we will get this done.\n  Mr. President, that is the end of my remarks, and I note the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reid). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if it would be more convenient for you to \ncome to the desk, I am happy to sit in the Chair.\n  Since the Presiding Officer can't answer my question, I will note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to express my bitter \ndisappointment in the Senate for refusing to move forward with the \nPresident's request for emergency funding to deal with the humanitarian \ncrisis we are facing on our southern border with Texas.\n  Ordinary working people do not close up shop with urgent work still \nundone, and neither should we. There is plenty of blame to go around; \nas I speak, there is a strong chance the House will leave town without \ntaking action on this crisis either. The administration has asked for \nmoney, but has yet to speak clearly on what changes it needs in the law \ngoverning how we handle child migrants at the border.\n  As we all know, over the past several months, our Nation has \nexperienced an unprecedented surge in migration from three countries: \nEl Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. People from these countries are \nfleeing desperate, violent conditions and a large number of them are \nfamilies, and unaccompanied children--some as young as 4 years old.\n  The President and Department of Homeland Secretary, DHS, Johnson \nresponded with an all-hands-on-deck effort. The Federal Emergency \nManagement Administration, FEMA, is coordinating the response to the \nproblem. The Department of Defense is providing emergency beds for \nunaccompanied minors. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has greatly \nexpanded its ability to detain and remove families. We have surged \nBorder Patrol agents, immigration judges, and other personnel to the \nborder to help process people.\n  These measures have been working. For example, the amount of time \npeople are detained before they are removed has decreased from over a \nmonth to as little as 4 days in recent weeks. Migrant children who were \nlanguishing in crowded border patrol stations are being screened and \nrelocated more quickly. But these emergency measures are expensive, and \nnone of the Federal agencies involved have the money they need to \nsustain the aggressive steps they are taking to deal with this \nsituation. In fact, many agencies have indicated that they will run out \nof money in a matter of weeks without action--some even in a few days.\n  So last week, Senator Mikulski introduced a bill that would provide \n$2.7 billion in order to address the situation and ensure that the \nagencies charged with securing our borders do not run out of money this \nsummer. More importantly, it would also address some of the underlying \nroot causes of the problem we face.\n  But here we are, the day before Congress leaves town, and what have \nwe done to address this crisis? The answer is nothing.\n  The consequences of our inaction will be severe. Let me give you some \nexamples of what will happen if Congress continues to do nothing.\n  Families apprehended at the border will be released. Why? Because \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement does not have the money to add the \n3,000 detention beds it needs to house families until they can be \nreturned to their countries;\n  Undocumented migrants scheduled to be deported will stay here. Why? \nBecause ICE won't have the money for transportation.\n  People currently being detained will have to be released. Why? \nBecause ICE will have to reduce its detention population.\n  Undocumented immigrants waiting for their immigration court cases to \nbe heard will have to wait longer. Why? Because we are not adding the \n40 immigration court judges that the administration requested.\n  We also will not be able to hire the 82 immigration prosecutors and \n100 repatriation personnel that DHS was planning to hire in August. \nWhy? Because we will not be able to afford them.\n  Health and Human Services will have to cut back on the number of \nchildren it can house. This means that children will have to stay at \nBorder Patrol stations longer and agents will be forced to care for \nchildren instead of patrolling the border. Why? Because Health and \nHuman Services will not have the money it needs.\n  I am frankly stunned that we here in Congress do not have a sense of \nurgency to pass this bill and make sure that this does not happen. I \nguess my colleagues believe that we can just move money around in order \nto patch the holes in these agencies' budgets. We are robbing Peter to \npay Paul.\n  Because of Congress' inaction, the administration will be forced to \nask for an emergency reprogramming to get the agencies through August. \nBut this reprogramming will also have severe consequences--consequences \nthat I do not think many of our colleagues seem to understand.\n  Our border security will be reduced. Why? Because CBP will have to \ncut back on aerial support for Border Patrol agents on the border. When \nI was in Texas and Arizona last year, I heard frontline agents say \nagain and again that aerial support was the single most important force \nmultiplier that they had available to help them secure the border.\n  People and commerce trying to get into this country will be forced to \nlonger delays and intrusive screenings at our ports of entry. Why? \nBecause CBP will have to take money that was going to be used to fund \nsophisticated scanning equipment to pay for caring for unaccompanied \nchildren at the border.\n  The Coast Guard will have to stop doing maintenance on many of our \nCoast Guard vessels. Why? Because the Coast Guard's funds will be \nshifted.\n  FEMA will have less money for disaster response just as folks in \ncoastal states, like Delaware, are gearing up for the height of \nhurricane season. Why? Because DHS will have to raid its Disaster \nRelief Fund in order to make ends meet.\n  This is no way to respond to a crisis--a crisis--that we have been \ntalking and talking and talking about here in the Senate for months!\n  Finally--and in my mind, most incredibly--we will leave here without \ndoing anything to address the underlying factors that explain why this \nsurge is happening in the first place. The President and Senator \nMikulski included $300 million in the supplemental package to address \nwhat I believe to be the root causes of this surge: the lack of \neconomic opportunities, jobs, and hope in Central America, combined \nwith increasing violence and insecurity in the region. Make no mistake \nabout it, these funds are an emergency.\n  I am not suggesting that any of this will be a quick or easy fix. It \nwill require a sustained investment--and focus--on the region by the \nU.S. and also by a number of others. But if we turn our backs on these \ncountries now, I am convinced that we will be back here again 10 years \nfrom now dealing with another expensive humanitarian crisis on our \nborder.\n  But today, we are left empty-handed, and all by our own doing. Again, \nwe have been seeing this humanitarian crisis play out for months now. \nWe have heard the heartbreaking stories of the Central American \nchildren and families arriving at our borders.\n  I believe that we have a moral imperative here to address this crisis \nwith a humane response and one that honors our obligations under U.S. \nand international law--and is consistent with the\n\n[[Page S5324]]\n\nadmonition that we should love our neighbors as we love ourselves while \ntaking care of the least of these in society.\n  We have not even come close to meeting the moral imperative and I am \ndeeply disappointed.\n  Over the next few weeks and into September, I urge my colleagues in \nboth Chambers to think about ``the least of these'' that we have left \nbehind today and to work harder to come together and find a compromise \nto this challenge. I also urge the administration to speak more clearly \nabout what it needs, and to work with us to find a path to get it done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/08/01/senate-section/article/S5324-1", "month": "08", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN.

Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing William ``Bill'' Huffman, the director of Government \nRelations for Farmers' Rice Cooperative, who is retiring after a \ndistinguished career that has spanned more than five decades.\n  Bill Huffman's roots to rice date back to his childhood. He was \nraised on his family's rice farm in Gridley, located in the heart of \nCalifornia's rice country the Sacramento Valley. Bill later attended \nHumboldt State University and graduated with a degree in radio/\ntelevision before going to work for a Sacramento radio station as a \nfarm broadcaster.\n  Following his career in broadcasting, Bill worked in the government, \nagricultural, and financial sectors and then joined Farmers' Rice \nCooperative, California's largest rice marketing firm, representing \nmore than 700 rice growers.\n  During his 30-year career with Farmers' Rice, Bill promoted one of \nthe Golden State's most important crops with pride and skill, \nadvocating for important public policy issues on behalf of California's \nrice industry. Each week, growers could depend upon his summary of \nimportant local, State, and Federal news impacting the rice industry in \n``Bill Huffman's News of the Week'' blog. In addition to tirelessly \nrepresenting Northern California's rice growers, Bill also helped lead \ndisaster relief efforts to donate rice overseas following the tragic \n2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia. In recognition of all of his \noutstanding accomplishments, Bill was awarded the California Rice \nIndustry Award by the California Cooperative Rice Research Foundation \nin 2009.\n  I had the pleasure getting to know Bill well during his time with \nFarmers' Rice Cooperative. We worked together to promote California's \nhigh-quality rice, protect important conservation programs, and \nencourage sustainable rice farming. Bill has been a strong voice for \nour rice growers, and I wish my friend the best as he enjoys a well-\ndeserved retirement with his wife Sheila, their four children, and \nthree grandchildren.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/08/01/senate-section/article/S5324-3", "month": "08", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING JOHN VASCONCELLOS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of John Vasconcellos, a giant in California \npolitics and government who died on May 24 at the age of 82. John made \nthe personal political and took politics personally. He was a \ncompassionate and caring human being who brought all of his humanity to \nthe job of governance.\n  John Bernard Vasconcellos, Jr., was born in San Jose, CA in 1932. \nAfter graduating with high honors from Bellarmine College Preparatory \nand Santa Clara University, John spent 2 years in the Army before \nreturning to Santa Clara for law school, where he again graduated at \nthe top of his class.\n  John became interested in politics while serving on Governor Pat \nBrown's reelection campaign staff during Brown's epic 1962 race against \nRichard Nixon.\n  In 1966, John was elected to the California State Assembly, beginning \na record 38 years of uninterrupted service in the Legislature.\n  In the assembly, John was known for his visionary idealism, brilliant \nintellect, and tough pragmatism. His mastery of budget issues led to \nhis chairmanship of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, where he \nchampioned State investment in education. His deep interest in \npsychology led to the establishment of the California Task Force to \nPromote Self-Esteem and Personal and Social Responsibility.\n  When term limits forced John to leave the assembly in 1996, he was \nelected to the State senate. As chair of the senate committees on \neducation and aging, he championed new investments in K-12, higher \neducation and long-term care while winning bipartisan praise for his \ncareful fiscal stewardship.\n  In 2004, term limits ended John's legislative career, but he did not \nretire. Joining with a group of friends and supporters, he established \nthe Vasconcellos Legacy Project, VLP, an organization ``dedicated to \nthe proposition that positive political change is possible, especially \nbecause we human beings are innately inclined toward the good.'' \nThrough research and advocacy, the VLP has sought to overcome political \npolarization and cynicism to create a new ``Politics of Trust.''\n  Throughout his long and distinguished life in politics, John \nVasconcellos demanded expected the best from himself, his colleagues, \nand our democracy. He was one of a kind, and he will be truly missed. I \nextend my deepest condolences to his loving extended family and many \nfriends and admirers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/08/01/senate-section/article/S5324-4", "month": "08", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5324-S5325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING THEODORE VAN KIRK\n\n Mr. CASEY. Madam President, Theodore `Dutch' Van Kirk died on \nJuly 28, 2014, at the age of 93. A native of Northumberland, PA, he \nserved his country with distinction during a difficult time for our \nNation and the world. I ask that the following story from the \nPittsburgh Post-Gazette be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, July 30, 2014]\n\n  Obituary: Theodore ``Dutch'' VanKirk/WWII Airman Whose Crew Dropped \n           Atomic Bomb on Japan, Feb. 27, 1921-July 28, 2014\n\n                             (By Joe Smydo)\n\n       At first, Theodore ``Dutch'' VanKirk and the other airmen \n     aboard the Enola Gay feared the atomic bomb they had dropped \n     on Japan was a dud.\n       But after what seemed like an interminable wait, ``there \n     was a bright flash in the air,'' Mr. VanKirk recounted in a \n     2012 book. The B-29 rocked from the shock waves, a white \n     mushroom cloud shot into the sky, and the devastation became \n     clear even from the crew's vantage point thousands of feet in \n     the air.\n       ``The ground was covered with thick black smoke and dust \n     and dirt,'' he said. ``It looked like a pot of boiling black \n     oil covering practically the entire city of Hiroshima.''\n       Mr. VanKirk, 93, a Northumberland, Pa., native and the last \n     surviving member of the crew that dropped the atomic bomb on \n     Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, a secret mission credited with \n     bringing World War II to an end, died Monday in suburban \n     Atlanta. He had experienced vascular difficulties.\n       Thomas VanKirk of Mt. Lebanon said his father was \n     handpicked by the Enola Gay's pilot, Paul Tibbets, to serve \n     as navigator on the bombing run. The two had met and served \n     together in England years earlier.\n       After the war, Mr. VanKirk received bachelor's and master's \n     degrees in chemical engineering from Bucknell University and \n     was\n\n[[Page S5325]]\n\n     posted all over the country during a 35-year career with \n     DuPont.\n       ``Most importantly, he was an outstanding father,'' Thomas \n     VanKirk, Highmark's chief legal officer, said.\n       The decision to use the atomic bomb on Japan--another B-29, \n     the Bockscar, bombed Nagasaki three days after Hiroshima--\n     remains controversial because of the lives lost.\n       However, Donald Goldstein, a military historian, former Air \n     Force officer and retired University of Pittsburgh professor, \n     said the bombings hastened the war's end and spared many \n     other lives that would have been lost during an invasion of \n     Japan.\n       He said the prevailing sentiment among U.S. military \n     personnel at the time was, ``Thank God for the bomb.'' Mr. \n     Goldstein said bringing the war to a rapid close also helped \n     to forestall Soviet geopolitical ambitions in Japan.\n       Thomas VanKirk said he initially learned about his father's \n     exploits through newspaper clippings he found during a \n     childhood exploration of his grandmother's attic. In 1995, \n     father and son stood together during the unveiling of an \n     Enola Gay exhibit at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space \n     Museum.\n       ``He had no regrets about dropping the bomb. He believed it \n     was necessary,'' said Youngstown, N.Y., historian Suzanne \n     Simon Dietz, whose book about Mr. VanKirk, ``My True \n     Course,'' relies on his letters and memoirs.\n       In 2005, Mr. VanKirk told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, ``I \n     just had a job to do.'' But others considered him a hero and \n     his death a reminder of the passing of the WWII generation.\n       ``A son of Pennsylvania, Theodore `Dutch' VanKirk helped to \n     save the world from tyranny and then returned home to live \n     the quiet life of a citizen,'' Gov. Tom Corbett said in a \n     statement. Mr. Corbett said he and his wife, Susan, ``send \n     our heartfelt sympathies to his family and the thanks of a \n     grateful state for his service to the cause of freedom.''\n       Mr. VanKirk was born Feb. 27, 1921. He graduated from \n     Northumberland High School, briefly attended Susquehanna \n     University and joined the Army Air Forces cadet program in \n     fall 1941--before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, his \n     son said, because he knew the war was coming and wanted to \n     choose his method of service.\n       Posted to Europe, he served aboard a B-17 bomber, the Red \n     Gremlin, with Mr. Tibbets and bombardier Thomas Ferebee, who \n     also would be part of the Enola Gay crew for the Hiroshima \n     bombing. After nearly 60 bombing runs over Europe and a \n     special mission ferrying Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, Mr. \n     VanKirk returned to the United States and married his high \n     school sweetheart, Mary Jane Young, who died in 1975.\n       In 1944, at Mr. Tibbets' request, he joined a special \n     group, stationed in Utah, that was preparing for use of the \n     atomic bomb. Mr. VanKirk told his story many times over the \n     years and, Thomas VanKirk said, was still fit enough early \n     this summer to go on a family beach vacation.\n       Also surviving are another son, Larry VanKirk of Charlotte, \n     N.C.; two daughters, Vicki Triplett of Atlanta and Joanne \n     Gotelli of Sacramento, Calif; seven grandchildren; and two \n     great-grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/08/01/senate-section/article/S5325-1", "month": "08", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:41 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 935.

Res. 536\n\n       Whereas ovarian cancer is the deadliest of all gynecologic \n     cancers;\n       Whereas ovarian cancer is the 5th leading cause of cancer \n     deaths among women in the United States;\n       Whereas, in 2014, approximately 21,980 new cases of ovarian \n     cancer will be diagnosed, and 14,270 women will die of \n     ovarian cancer in the United States;\n       Whereas the mortality rate for ovarian cancer has not \n     significantly decreased since the ``War on Cancer'' was \n     declared more than 40 years ago;\n       Whereas 25 percent of women will die within 1 year of \n     diagnosis with ovarian cancer and over 50 percent will die \n     within 5 years;\n       Whereas while there is the mammogram to detect breast \n     cancer and the Pap smear to detect cervical cancer, there is \n     no reliable early detection test for ovarian cancer;\n       Whereas the lack of an early detection test means that \n     approximately 80 percent of cases of ovarian cancer are \n     detected at an advanced stage;\n       Whereas all women are at risk for ovarian cancer, and \n     approximately 15 percent of women diagnosed with ovarian \n     cancer have a family history of ovarian cancer, which places \n     them at even higher risk;\n       Whereas scientists and physicians have uncovered changes in \n     the BRCA genes that some women inherit from their parents, \n     which may make them 30 times more likely to develop ovarian \n     cancer;\n       Whereas the family history of a woman has been found to \n     play an important role in accurately assessing that woman's \n     risk of developing ovarian cancer and medical experts believe \n     that family history should be taken into consideration during \n     a woman's annual well woman visit;\n       Whereas many experts in health prevention now recommends \n     genetic testing for young women with a family history of \n     breast and ovarian cancer;\n       Whereas women who know they are at high risk of breast and \n     ovarian cancer may undertake prophylactic measures to help \n     reduce the risk of developing these diseases;\n       Whereas the Society of Gynecologic Oncology now recommends \n     that all women diagnosed with ovarian cancer receive \n     counseling and genetic testing;\n       Whereas many people are unaware that the symptoms of \n     ovarian cancer often include bloating, pelvic or abdominal \n     pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, urinary \n     symptoms, and several other symptoms that are easily confused \n     with other diseases;\n       Whereas awareness of the symptoms of ovarian cancer by \n     women and health care providers can lead to a quicker \n     diagnosis;\n       Whereas, in June 2007, the first national consensus \n     statement on ovarian cancer symptoms was developed to provide \n     consistency in describing symptoms to make it easier for \n     women to learn and remember the symptoms; and\n       Whereas each year during the month of September, the \n     Ovarian Cancer National Alliance and partner members hold a \n     number of events to increase public awareness of ovarian \n     cancer: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 2014 as ``National Ovarian Cancer \n     Awareness Month''; and\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Ovarian \n     Cancer Awareness Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/08/01/senate-section/article/S5326-2", "month": "08", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5326-S5327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 537--REAFFIRMING SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO DEFEND \n ITS CITIZENS AND ENSURE THE SURVIVAL OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL, AND FOR \n                             OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Menendez) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.:\n\n                              S.

STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to reaffirm the unwavering support of the people and \n     the Government of the United States for the security of \n     Israel as a Jewish state;\n       (2) to reaffirm the principles and objectives enshrined in \n     the United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of \n     2012 (Public Law 112-150) and ensure its implementation to \n     the fullest extent;\n       (3) to reaffirm the importance of the 2007 United States-\n     Israel Memorandum of Understanding on United States \n     assistance to Israel and the semi-annual Strategic Dialogue \n     between the United States and Israel;\n       (4) to pursue every opportunity to deepen cooperation with \n     Israel on a range of critical issues including defense, \n     homeland security, energy, and cybersecurity;\n       (5) to continue to provide Israel with robust security \n     assistance, including for the procurement of the Iron Dome \n     Missile Defense System; and\n       (6) to support the Government of Israel in its ongoing \n     efforts to reach a negotiated political settlement with the \n     Palestinian people that results in two states living side-by-\n     side in peace and security.\n\n     SEC. 1804.
