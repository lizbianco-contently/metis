Mr. President, I am told S. 1752 is due for a second \nreading.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the title of the bill \nfor the second time.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1752) to perform procedures for determinations \n     to proceed to trial by court-martial for certain offenses \n     under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. I object to any further proceedings on this bill at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the bill will be placed \non the calendar.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the leadership \ntime is reserved.\n\n\n                             Iran Sanctions\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of our Iran sanction \nregime and believe that the current sanctions have brought Iran to the \nnegotiating table.\n  I believe we must do everything possible to stop Iran from getting \nnuclear weapons capability, which would threaten Israel and the \nnational security of our great country.\n  The Obama administration is in the midst of negotiations with the \nIranians that are designed to end their nuclear weapons program. We all \nstrongly support those negotiations and hope they will succeed, and we \nwant them to produce the strongest possible agreement.\n  However, we are also aware of the possibility that the Iranians could \nkeep the negotiations from succeeding. I hope that won't happen, but \nthe Senate must be prepared to move forward with a new bipartisan Iran \nsanctions bill when the Senate returns after the Thanksgiving recess. I \nam committed to do just that.\n  A number of Senators, Democrats and Republicans, have offered their \nown amendments on Iran, and they have offered a couple of the \namendments in the Defense authorization bill. I know other Senators \nalso have their own sanctions bills they would like to move forward on.\n  I will support a bill that would broaden the scope of our current \npetroleum sanctions, place limitations on trade with strategic sectors \nof the Iranian economy that support its nuclear ambitions, as well as \npursue those that divert goods to Iran.\n  While I support the administration's diplomatic efforts, I believe we \nneed to leave our legislative options open to act on a new bipartisan \nsanctions bill in December, shortly after we return.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S8414]]\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Rules Reform\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the American people believe Congress is \nbroken. The American people believe the Senate is broken, and I believe \nthe American people are right.\n  During this Congress--the 113th Congress--the United States has \nwasted an unprecedented amount of time on procedural hurdles and \npartisan obstruction. As a result the work of this country goes undone.\n  Congress should be passing legislation that strengthens our economy \nand protects American families. Instead, we are burning wasted hours \nand wasted days between filibusters. I could say, instead, we are \nburning wasted days and wasted weeks between filibusters.\n  Even one of the Senate's most basic duties--confirmation of \npresidential nominees--has become completely unworkable. There has been \nunbelievable, unprecedented obstruction. For the first time in the \nhistory of our Republic, Republicans have routinely used the filibuster \nto prevent President Obama from appointing his executive team or \nconfirming judges. It is truly a troubling trend that Republicans are \nwilling to block executive branch nominees, even when they have no \nobjection to the qualifications of the nominee. Instead, they block \nqualified executive branch nominees to circumvent the legislative \nprocess. They block qualified executive branch nominations to force \nwholesale changes to laws. They block qualified executive branch \nnominees to restructure entire executive branch departments, and they \nblock qualified judicial nominees because they don't want President \nObama to appoint any judges to certain courts.\n  The need for change is so very obvious. It is clearly visible. It is \nmanifest we have to do something to change things.\n  In the history of our country--some 230-plus years--there have been \n168 filibusters of executive and judicial nominations. Half of them \nhave occurred during the Obama administration--so 230-plus years, 50 \npercent; 4\\1/2\\ years, 50 percent. Is there anything fair about that?\n  These nominees deserve at least an up-or-down vote--yes or no--but \nRepublican filibusters deny them a fair vote--any vote--and deny the \nPresident his team.\n  Gridlock has consequences, and they are terrible. It is not only bad \nfor President Obama and bad for this body, the Senate, it is bad for \nour country, it is bad for our national security, and it is bad for our \neconomic security.\n  That is why it is time to get the Senate working again--not for the \ngood of the current Democratic majority or some future Republican \nmajority, but for the good of the United States of America. It is time \nto change. It is time to change the Senate before this institution \nbecomes obsolete.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, the Republican leader pledged \nthat, ``This Congress should be more bipartisan than the last \nCongress.''\n  We are told in the Scriptures--let's take, for example, the Old \nTestament, the Book of Numbers, that promises, pledges, a vow--one must \nnot break his word.\n  In January, Republicans promised to work with the majority to process \nnominations in a timely manner by unanimous consent, except in \nextraordinary circumstances. Exactly three weeks later, Republicans \nmounted a first-in-history filibuster of a highly qualified nominee for \nSecretary of Defense.\n  Despite being a former Republican Senator and a decorated war hero, \nhaving saved his brother's life in Vietnam, Defense Secretary Chuck \nHagel's nomination was pending in the Senate for a record 34 days--more \nthan three times the previous average for a Secretary of Defense. \nRemember, our country was at war.\n  Republicans have blocked executive nominees such as Secretary Hagel \nnot because they object to the qualifications of the nominee but simply \nbecause they seek to undermine the very government in which they were \nelected to serve.\n  Take the nomination of Richard Cordray to lead the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau. There was no doubt about his ability to do the job. \nBut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the brainchild of \nElizabeth Warren, went for more than 2 years without a leader because \nRepublicans refused to accept the law of the land, because they wanted \nto roll back the law that protects consumers from the greed of Wall \nStreet.\n  I say to my Republican colleagues: You don't have to like the laws of \nthe land, but you do have to respect those laws and acknowledge them \nand abide by them.\n  Similar obstruction continued unabated for 7 more months, until \nDemocrats threatened to change Senate rules to allow up-or-down votes \non executive nominations. In July, after obstructing dozens of \nexecutive nominees for months--and some for years--Republicans once \nagain promised they would end the unprecedented obstruction.\n  One look at the Senate's Executive Calendar shows that nothing has \nchanged since July. Republicans have continued their record obstruction \nas if no agreement had ever been reached. Again, Republicans have \ncontinued their record of obstruction as if no agreement had been \nreached.\n  There are currently 75 executive branch nominations ready to be \nconfirmed by the Senate. They have been waiting an average of 140 days \nfor confirmation.\n  One executive nominee to the agency that safeguards the water my \nchildren and my grandchildren drink and the air they breathe has waited \nalmost 900 days for confirmation.\n  We agreed in July that the Senate should be confirming nominees to \nensure the proper functioning of government.\n  Consistent and unprecedented obstruction by the Republican Caucus has \nturned ``advise and consent'' into ``deny and obstruct.''\n  In addition to filibustering a nominee for Secretary of Defense for \nthe first time in history, Senate Republicans also blocked a sitting \nMember of Congress from an administration position for the first time \nsince 1843.\n  As a senior Member of the House Financial Services Committee, \nCongressman Mel Watt's understanding of the mistakes that led to the \nhousing crisis made him uniquely qualified to serve as Administrator of \nthe Federal Housing Finance Agency.\n  Senate Republicans simply do not like the consumer protections \nCongressman Watt was nominated to develop and implement, so they denied \na fellow Member of Congress and a graduate of the Yale School of Law \neven the courtesy of an up-or-down vote.\n  In the last 3 weeks alone, Republicans have blocked up-or-down votes \non three highly qualified nominees to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. \nThis does not take into consideration they twice turned down one of the \nmost qualified people in my 30 years in the Senate who I have ever seen \ncome before this body: Caitlin Halligan. So we have three more to add \nto that list.\n  The DC Circuit is considered by many to be the second highest court \nin the land, and some think maybe the most important. It deals with \nthese complex cases that come from Federal agencies and other things \nwithin their jurisdiction.\n  Republicans have blocked four of President Obama's five nominees to \nthe DC Circuit, whereas the Democrats approved four of President Bush's \nsix nominations to this important court.\n  Today the DC Circuit Court--at least the second most important court \nin the land--has more than 25 percent in vacancies. There is not a \nsingle legitimate objection to the qualifications of any of these \nnominees to the DC Circuit that President Obama has put forward. \nRepublicans have refused to give them an up-or-down vote--a simple \n``yes'' or ``no'' vote. Republicans simply do not want President Obama \nto make any appointments at all to this vital court--none, zero.\n  Further, only 23 district court nominations have been filibustered in \nthe entire history of our country--23. And you know what. Twenty of \nthem have been in the last 4\\1/2\\ years. Two hundred thirty-plus years: \n3; the last 4\\1/2\\ years: 20. That is not fair. With one out of every \n10 Federal judgeships vacant, millions of Americans who rely on courts \nthat are overworked and understaffed are being denied the justice they \nrightly deserve.\n  More than half of the Nation's population lives in parts of the \ncountry that have been declared a ``judicial emergency.'' No one has \nworked harder than\n\n[[Page S8415]]\n\nthe President pro tempore to move judges. The President pro tempore is \nthe chairman also of the Judiciary Committee. No one knows the problem \nmore than the President pro tempore.\n  The American people are fed up with this kind of obstruction and \ngridlock. The American people--Democrats, Republicans, Independents--\nare fed up with this gridlock, this obstruction. The American people \nwant Washington to work for American families once again.\n  I am on their side, which is why I propose an important change to the \nrules of the U.S. Senate. The present Republican leader himself said--\nand this is a direct quote--``The Senate has repeatedly changed its \nrules as circumstances dictate.''\n  He is right. In fact, the Senate has changed its rules 18 times, by \nsustaining or overturning the ruling of the Presiding Officer, in the \nlast 36 years--during the tenures of both Republican and Democratic \nmajorities.\n  The change we propose today would ensure executive and judicial \nnominations an up-or-down vote on confirmation--yes, no. The rule \nchange will make cloture for all nominations other than for the Supreme \nCourt a majority threshold vote--yes or no.\n  The Senate is a living thing, and to survive it must change, as it \nhas over the history of this great country. To the average American, \nadapting the rules to make the Senate work again is just common sense.\n  This is not about Democrats versus Republicans. This is about making \nWashington work--regardless of who is in the White House or who \ncontrols the Senate.\n  To remain relevant and effective as an institution, the Senate must \nevolve to meet the challenges of this modern era.\n  I have no doubt my Republican colleagues will argue the fault is \nours, it is the Democrats' fault. I can say from experience that no \none's hands are entirely clean on this issue. But today the important \ndistinction is not between Democrats and Republicans. It is between \nthose who are willing to help break the gridlock in Washington and \nthose who defend the status quo.\n  Is the Senate working now? Can anyone say the Senate is working now? \nI do not think so.\n  Today Democrats and Independents are saying enough is enough. This \nchange to the rules regarding Presidential nominees will apply equally \nto both parties. When Republicans are in power, these changes will \napply to them as well. That is simple fairness, and it is something \nthat both sides should be willing to live with to make Washington work \nagain. That is simple fairness.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition Of The Minority Leader\n\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, over the past several weeks, the \nAmerican people have been witness to one of the most breathtaking--\nbreathtaking--indictments of big-government liberalism in memory. And I \nam not just talking about a Web site. I am talking about the way in \nwhich ObamaCare was forced on the public by an administration and a \nDemocratic-led Congress that we now know was willing to do and say \nanything--anything--to pass the law.\n  The President and his Democratic allies were so determined to force \ntheir vision of health care on the public that they assured them up and \ndown that they would not lose the plans they had, that they would save \nmoney instead of losing it, and that they would be able to use the \ndoctors and hospitals they were already using.\n  But, of course, we know that that rhetoric does not match reality. \nThe stories we are hearing on a nearly daily basis now range from \nheartbreaking to comical. Just yesterday I saw a story about a guy \ngetting a letter in the mail saying his dog--his dog--had qualified for \ninsurance under ObamaCare. So, yeah, I would probably be running for \nthe exits too if I had supported this law. I would be looking to change \nthe subject--change the subject--just as Senate Democrats have been \ndoing with their threats of going nuclear and changing the Senate rules \non nominations. If I were a Senator from Oregon, for example, which has \nnot enrolled a single person--a single person--for the ObamaCare \nexchange, I would probably want to talk about something else too.\n  But here is the problem with this latest distraction: It does not \ndistract people from ObamaCare. It reminds them of ObamaCare. It \nreminds them of all the broken promises. It reminds them of the power \ngrab. It reminds them of the way Democrats set up one set of rules for \nthemselves and another for everybody else--one set of rules for them \nand another for everybody else.\n  Actually, this is all basically the same debate, and rather than \ndistract people from ObamaCare, it only reinforces the narrative of a \nparty that is willing to do and say just about anything to get its \nway--willing to do or say just about anything to get its way. Because \nthat is just what they are doing all over again.\n  Once again, Senate Democrats are threatening to break the rules of \nthe Senate--break the rules of the Senate--in order to change the rules \nof the Senate. And over what? Over what? Over a court that does not \neven have enough work to do?\n  Millions of Americans are hurting because of a law Washington \nDemocrats forced upon them, and what do they do about it? They cook up \nsome fake fight over judges--a fake fight over judges--who are not even \nneeded.\n  Look, I get it. As I indicated, I would want to be talking about \nsomething else too if I had to defend dogs getting insurance while \nmillions of Americans lost theirs. But it will not work. The parallels \nbetween this latest skirmish and the original ObamaCare push are just \ntoo obvious to ignore.\n  Think about it. Just think about it. The majority leader promised--he \npromised--over and over that he would not break the rules of the Senate \nin order to change them. This was not an ancient promise. On July 14 on \n``Meet the Press'' he said: ``We're not touching judges.'' This year, \non July 14, on ``Meet the Press'': ``We're not touching judges.''\n  Then there are the double standards.\n  When Democrats were in the minority, they argued strenuously for the \nvery thing they now say we will have to do without; namely, the right \nto extended debate on lifetime appointments. In other words, they \nbelieve that one set of rules should apply to them--to them--and \nanother set to everybody else. He may just as well have said: ``If you \nlike the rules of the Senate, you can keep them.'' ``If you like the \nrules of the Senate, you can keep them''--just the way so many \nDemocrats in the administration and Congress now believe that ObamaCare \nis good enough for their constituents, but that when it comes to them, \ntheir political allies, their staffs, well, of course, that is \ndifferent.\n  Let's not forget about the raw power--the raw power--at play here. On \nthis point, the similarities between the ObamaCare debate and the \nDemocratic threat to go nuclear on nominations are inescapable--\ninescapable. They muscled through ObamaCare on a party-line vote and \ndid not care about the views of the minority--did not care one whit \nabout the views of the minority. And that is just about what they are \ngoing to do here.\n  The American people decided not to give the Democrats the House or to \nrestore the filibuster-proof majority they had in the Senate back in \n2009, and our Democratic colleagues do not like that one bit. They just \ndo not like it. The American people are getting in the way of what they \nwould like to do. So they are trying to change the rules of the game to \nget their way anyway. They said so themselves. Earlier this year, the \nsenior Senator from New York said they want to ``fill up the DC Circuit \none way or another''--``fill up the DC Circuit one way or another.''\n  The reason is clear. As one liberal activist put it earlier this \nyear, President Obama's agenda ``runs through the DC Circuit.'' You \ncannot get what you want through the Congress because the American \npeople, in November 2010, said they had had enough--they issued a \nnational restraining order, after watching 2 years of this \nadministration unrestrained--so now their agenda runs through the \nbureaucracy and through the DC Circuit.\n  As I said, in short, unlike the first 2 years of the Obama \nadministration,\n\n[[Page S8416]]\n\nthere is now a legislative check on the President. The administration \ndoes not much like checks and balances, so it wants to circumvent the \npeople's representatives with an aggressive regulatory agenda, and our \nDemocratic colleagues want to facilitate that by filling up a court \nthat will rule on his agenda--a court that does not even have enough \nwork to do, especially if it means changing the subject from ObamaCare \nfor a few days.\n  And get this: They think they can change the rules of the Senate in a \nway that benefits only them. They want to do it in such a way that \nPresident Obama's agenda gets enacted but that a future Republican \nPresident could not get his or her picks for the Supreme Court \nconfirmed by a Republican Senate using the same precedent our \nDemocratic friends want to set. They want to have it both ways.\n  But this sort of gerrymandered vision of the nuclear option is \nwishful thinking. As the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee \nSenator Grassley pointed out yesterday: If the majority leader changes \nthe rules for some judicial nominees, he is effectively changing them \nfor all judicial nominees, including the Supreme Court, as Senator \nGrassley pointed out yesterday.\n  Look, I realize this sort of wishful thinking might appeal to the \nuninitiated newcomers in the Democratic Conference who have served \nexactly zero days in the minority. But the rest of you guys in the \nconference should know better. Those of you who have been in the \nminority before should know better.\n  Let's remember how we got here. Let's remember that it was Senate \nDemocrats who pioneered, who literally pioneered the practice of \nfilibustering circuit court nominees, and who have been its biggest \nproponents in the very recent past. After President Bush was elected, \nthey even held a retreat in which they discussed the need to change the \nground rules by which lifetime appointments are considered. The senior \nSenator from New York put on a seminar, invited Laurence Tribe, Cass \nSunstein. In the past the practice had been neither side had \nfilibustered circuit court nominees. In fact, I can remember at Senator \nLott's gagging several times and voting for cloture on circuit judges \nfor the Ninth Circuit, knowing full well that once cloture was invoked, \nthey would be confirmed.\n  So this business of filibustering circuit court judges was entirely \nan invention of the guys over here on the other side, the ones you are \nlooking at right over here. They made it up. They started it. This is \nwhere we ended up.\n  After President Bush was elected, they held this retreat that I was \njust talking about and made a big deal about it. It was all a prelude \nto what followed, the serial filibustering of several of President \nBush's circuit court nominees, including Miguel Estrada, whose \nnomination to the DC Circuit was filibustered by Senate Democrats a \nrecord seven times--seven times. Now they want to blow up the rules \nbecause Republicans are following a precedent they themselves set.\n  I might add, we are following that precedent in a much more modest \nway than Democrats did.\n  So how about this for a suggestion? How about instead of picking a \nfight with Senate Republicans by jamming through nominees to a court \nthat does not even have enough work to do, how about taking yes for an \nanswer and working with us on filling judicial emergencies that \nactually exist?\n  Yet rather than learn from past precedent on judicial nominations \nthat they themselves set, Democrats now want to set another one. I have \nno doubt if they do, they will come to regret that one as well. Our \ncolleagues evidently would rather live for the moment, satisfy the \nmoment, live for the moment, and try to establish a story line that \nRepublicans are intent on obstructing President Obama's judicial \nnominees. That story line is patently ridiculous in light of the facts. \nThat is an utterly absurd suggestion in light of the facts.\n  Before this current Democratic gambit to fill up the DC Circuit one \nway or the other, the Senate had confirmed 215--215--of the President's \njudicial nominees and rejected 2. That is a 99-percent confirmation \nrate. There were 215 confirmed and 2 rejected--99 percent.\n  Look, if advice and consent is to mean anything at all, occasionally \nconsent is not given. But by any objective standards, Senate \nRepublicans have been very fair to this President. We have been willing \nto confirm his nominees. In fact, speaking of the DC Circuit, we just \nconfirmed one a few months ago 97 to 0 to the DC Circuit.\n  So I suggest our colleagues take a timeout, stop trying to jam us, \nwork with us instead to confirm vacancies that actually need to be \nfilled, which we have been doing. This rules change charade has gone \nfrom being a biannual threat, to an annual threat, now to a quarterly \nthreat. How many times have we been threatened, my colleagues? Do what \nI say or we will break the rules to change the rules. Confirm \neverybody, 100 percent. Anything less than that is obstructionism. That \nis what they are saying to us.\n  Let me say we are not interested in having a gun put to our head any \nlonger. If you think this is in the best interests of the Senate and \nthe American people to make advice and consent, in effect, mean \nnothing--obviously you can break the rules to change the rules to \nachieve that. But some of us have been around here long enough to know \nthat the shoe is sometimes on the other foot.\n  This strategy of distract, distract, distract is getting old. I do \nnot think the American people are fooled about this. If our colleagues \nwant to work with us to fill judicial vacancies, as we have been doing \nall year--99 percent of judges confirmed--obviously we are willing to \ndo that. If you want to play games, set yet another precedent that you \nwill no doubt come to regret--I say to my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle, you will regret this, and you may regret it a lot sooner \nthan you think.\n  Let me be clear. The Democratic playbook of broken promises, double \nstandards, and raw power, the same playbook that got us ObamaCare, has \nto end. It may take the American people to end it, but it has to end. \nThat is why Republicans are going to keep their focus where it belongs, \non the concerns of the American people.

Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader will state the \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is it correct that under the bipartisan provisions of \nS. Res. 15, adopted earlier this year, postcloture debate time on a \ndistrict court nomination is limited to 2 hours before an up-or-down \nvote is required under the rules?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Pursuant to S. Res. 15 of the 113th \nCongress, postcloture debate on district court nominees is limited to 2 \nhours.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Further parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will state it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is it correct under the provisions of S. Res. 15, \nadopted earlier this very year, that postcloture debate time on any \nexecutive branch nomination other than those at the Cabinet level is \nalready limited to 8 hours before an up-or-down vote is required under \nSenate rules?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Pursuant to S. Res. 15 of the 113th \nCongress, postcloture debate on any nomination to the executive branch, \nwhich is not a level 1 position as set forth in title 5 of the U.S. \nCode, section 5312, is limited to 8 hours.\n  Mr. REID. I appeal the ruling of the Chair and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, one other parliamentary inquiry. When \nthe Senate's rules were amended and a new standing order on \nconsideration of nominations was established earlier this year, the \nmajority leader and I engaged in a colloquy to announce that no further \nrules changes would be considered unless under the regular order and \nthrough the action of the Senate Rules Committee.\n  Would the Chair confirm that currently the rules of the Senate \nprovide that a proposal to change the Senate rules would be fully \ndebatable unless two-thirds of the Senators present and voting voted to \ninvoke cloture, which would mean 67 Senators voting in the affirmative \nif all 100 voted?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Further inquiry: It is my understanding that \nprevailing on appeal of the ruling of the Chair would\n\n[[Page S8418]]\n\nchange Senate precedent on how nominations are considered in the Senate \nand effectively change the procedures or application of the Senate's \nrules.\n  How many votes are required to appeal the ruling of the Chair in this \ninstance?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. A majority of those Senators voting, a \nquorum being present, is required.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So I am correct that overturning the ruling of the \nChair requires a simple majority vote?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky is correct.\n  The majority leader has appealed from the decision of the Chair.\n  The question is, Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the \njudgment of the Senate?\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The yeas and nays are requested.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 48, nays 52, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 242 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--48\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Enzi\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kirk\n     Lee\n     Levin\n     Manchin\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Pryor\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--52\n\n     Baldwin\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Booker\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Coons\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Hirono\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Klobuchar\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Markey\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I make a point of order that \nnominations are fully debatable under the rules of the Senate unless \nthree-fifths of the Senators chosen and sworn have voted to bring \ndebate to a close. Under the precedent just set by the Senate, cloture \nis invoked at a majority. Therefore, I appeal the ruling of the Chair \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair has not yet ruled.\n  Under the precedent set by the Senate today, November 21, 2013, the \nthreshold for cloture on nominations, not including those to the \nSupreme Court of the United States, is now a majority. That is the \nruling of the Chair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I appeal the ruling of the Chair and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S8419]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes first to \ncongratulate our leader Senator Reid for leading the Senate finally \ninto the 21st century. This is the step that we have taken today. Thank \nyou very much, Leader Reid, for your courageous action and making sure \nthat the Senate can now work and get our work done.\n  I have waited 18 years for this moment. In 1995, when we were in the \nminority, I proposed changing the rules on filibuster. I have been \nproposing this ever since.\n  What has happened is this war has escalated. It is war on both sides.\n  I said at the time, in 1995, that it was like an arms race. If we \ndidn't do something about it, the Senate would reach a point where we \nwouldn't be able to function. At that time, I thought my words were a \nlittle apocalyptic, but as it turned out they weren't at all.\n  This is a bright day for the Senate and for our country, to finally \nbe able to move ahead on nominations so that any President--not only \nthis President, any President--can put together his executive branch \nunder our Constitution. A President should have the people who he or \nshe wants to form their executive branch.\n  Every Senator gets to pick his or her own staff. We don't have to \nhave the House vote on it or anybody else. It is true of every Member \nof the House or Senate. It is true of the judiciary, the third branch \nof the government. They can hire their clerks or their staff without \ncoming to us.\n  It is appropriate that any President can now form their executive \nbranch with only 51 votes needed in the Senate, not a supermajority. \nThat is a huge step in the right direction. We can confirm judges of \nall the courts less than the Supreme Court, circuit and district court \njudges, with 51 votes, without this supermajority that has been \nfestering for so long.\n  I listened to the Republican leader during the runup to these votes, \nand he said that we were going to somehow break the rules to make a new \nrule. We did not break the rules. With the vote that we just had, the \nSenate broke no rules.\n  The rules provide for a 51-vote nondebatable motion to overturn the \nruling of the Chair. We have done it many times in the past.\n  We did not break the rules. We simply used rules to make sure that \nthe Senate could function and that we can get our nominees through.\n  I like what the writer Gail Collins said in her column this morning \nin the New York Times about these rule changes. She has had a lot of \ngood columns, but she talked about how we were calling it the nuclear \noption. She proffered that it was probably called that because some \nthink that changing the rules in the Senate is worse than a nuclear \nwar, but it is not. It is time that we change these rules.\n  The Republican leader earlier said it was the Democrats who started \nthis. It reminds me of a schoolyard fight between a couple of \nadolescents, and the teacher is trying to break it up. One kid says: He \nhit me first. The other says: No, he hit me first. Then the other kid \nsays: No, he stepped on my toe first.\n  Who cares who started it? It is time to stop. Even if I accept the \nfact that Democrats started it--maybe they can prove that we did. It is \npossible way back when. It has escalated.\n  It turned from a punch here to a punch there to almost extreme \nfighting. It has reached the point where we can't function.\n  On nominations alone we had 168 filibusters since 1949. I picked that \ndate because that is when all of this filibustering started, 168; 82 of \nthose have been under this President. This is what I mean. It is worth \nit to talk about who started this. Fine. If they want to say the \nDemocrats started it, fine, we started it. It has escalated beyond all \nbounds, as I said in 1995. It has turned into an arms race, so it is \ntime to stop it. That is what we did this morning with this vote. We \ntook a step in the right direction.\n  In 2008 Norman Ornstein, who is a congressional scholar, wrote about \nthe broken Senate--our broken Senate--how we couldn't function. We can \ngo back even beyond that. In 1985, my first year, Senator Thomas \nEagleton, my neighbor to the south, said that the Senate is now in a \nstate of incipient anarchy.\n  We had something such as 20 to 30 filibusters in the Congress before \nthat. This has been escalating over a long period of time, and it was \ntime to stop. That is what we did this morning.\n  This is a big step in the right direction, but now we need to take it \nanother step further; that is, to change filibuster on legislation. We \nneed to change it as it pertains to legislation.\n  For example, we recently had the spectacle of a bill that I reported \nout of our committee unanimously--Republicans and Democrats. It passed \nthe floor of the House unanimously. It came to the Senate and one \nSenator stopped everything for 10 days. He stopped everything for 10 \ndays. Guess what. It finally passed by unanimous consent.\n  Should one Senator be able to stop things in the Senate in this \nmanner? It is time to move ahead and at the same time to protect the \nright of the minority, to offer amendments that are relevant and \ngermane, debate, and vote on them. Not that they should win, but the \nminority should be able to offer, debate, and vote on relevant and \ngermane amendments to legislation.\n  I proposed 18 years ago a formula that, quite frankly, was first \nproposed by Senator Dole many years before that. That was on a cloture \nvote to end a filibuster. The first time had to be 60 votes. Then we \ncould wait 3 days to file a new motion with the requisite signatures \nand at that time we would need 57 votes. Then if we didn't have 57 \nvotes, we could wait 3 more days, file the new motion on the same bill \nor amendment, and then it would require 54 votes. If we didn't have 54, \nwe would wait 3 days, file a new motion, and then we needed 51 votes.\n  At some point the majority could act on legislation, but the minority \nwould have the right to slow things down too; as Senator George Hoar \nsaid in 1897, give sober second thought to legislation in the Senate--\nsober second thought, not to stop it, not to block it, but to slow \nthings down, yes; give it a second thought; maybe we shouldn't rush \ninto things.\n  I understand that. Maybe things should be amended. The minority ought \nto have that right to offer those amendments--not just spurious \namendments, but amendments that are relevant and germane to the \nlegislation. Ultimately 51 should decide in the Senate what we proceed \non and the outcome of the vote.\n  I hope the vote today leads the Senate to adopt such an approach in \nJanuary 2015. When the new Senate comes in there will be a new \nCongress. I won't be here, but I hope at that point the Senate will \nthen take the next step of cutting down on the blatant use of the \nfilibuster on legislation.\n  Of the action taken today, this is what I predict. I predict the sky \nwill not fall, the oceans will not dry up, a plague of locusts will not \ncover the Earth, and the vast majority of Americans will go on with \ntheir lives as before. But I do predict that our government will work \nbetter. A President will be able to form an executive branch, our \njudiciary will function better, and the Senate will be able to move \nqualified nominees through the Senate in a more responsible manner.\n  This is a good day for the Senate, a good day for our Nation. The \nSenate now enters the 21st century.\n  I congratulate Leader Reid for bringing the Senate forward. It is a \ncourageous action. I compliment all of my fellow Senators who upheld \nthat vote, overruling the ruling of the Chair, so that from now on we \nonly need 51 votes to close debate and move nominations and judges \nthrough the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that after the Senator from Iowa \nis recognized, I be recognized for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                             Nuclear Option\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we didn't have a chance to debate the \nchange in rules, and we should have, so I am going to speak now on some \nthings I think should have been said before we voted--not that it would \nhave changed the outcome but because we ought to have known what we \nwere\n\n[[Page S8420]]\n\ndoing before we vote rather than afterward. So I will spend a few \nminutes discussing what the majority leader did on the so-called \nnuclear option.\n  Unfortunately, this wasn't a new threat. Over the last several years, \nevery time the minority has chosen to exercise his rights under the \nSenate rules, the majority has threatened to change the rules. In fact, \nthis is the third time in just the last year or so that the majority \nleader has said that if he didn't get his way on nominations, he would \nchange the rules. Ironically, that is about as many judicial nominees \nas our side has stopped through a filibuster--three or so.\n  Prior to the recent attempt by the President to simultaneously add \nthree judges who are not needed to the DC Circuit, Republicans had \nstopped a grand total of 2 of President Obama's judicial nominees--not \n10, as the Democrats had by President Bush's fifth year in office; not \n34, as one of my colleagues tried to suggest earlier this week; no, \nonly 2 had been stopped. If we include the nominees for the DC Circuit, \nwe have stopped a grand total of 5--again, not 10, as the Democrats did \nin 2005; not 34, as one of my colleagues tried to argue earlier this \nweek but 5. During that same time we have confirmed 209 lower court \nArticle III judges. That is a record of 209 judges approved to 5 who \nwere not approved. So this threat isn't based on any crisis. There is \nno crisis.\n  I would note that today's Wall Street Journal editorial entitled ``DC \nCircuit Breakers: The White House wants to pack a court whose judges \nare underworked'' lays out the caseload pretty clearly.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the editorial \nto which I just referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 21, 2013]\n\n                         D.C. Circuit Breakers\n\n              (By the Wall Street Journal Editorial Staff)\n\n       The White House wants to pack a court whose judges are \n     underworked.\n       We remember when a ``judicial emergency'' was the Senate's \n     way of calling attention to vacancies based on a court's \n     caseload. Those were the good old days. Now Democrats are \n     threatening to change Senate rules if Republicans don't \n     acquiesce to their plan to confirm three new judges to the \n     most underworked appellate circuit in the country.\n       That's the story behind the fight over the D.C. Circuit \n     Court of Appeals, with the White House trying to pack the \n     court that reviews much of its regulatory agenda. On Monday \n     Senate Republicans blocked the third nominee to the D.C. \n     appellate court in recent weeks, and Democrats with short \n     memories of their judicial filibusters in the Bush years are \n     claiming this is unprecedented. Majority Leader Harry Reid \n     and other Democrats are threatening to resort to the so-\n     called nuclear option, which would let the Senate confirm \n     judicial nominees by a simple majority vote.\n       This is nothing but a political power play because the D.C. \n     Circuit doesn't need the new judges. It currently has 11 \n     authorized judgeships and eight active judges--four appointed \n     by Democratic Presidents and four by Republicans. The court \n     also has six senior judges who hear cases varying from 25% to \n     75% of an active judge's caseload. Together they carry the \n     equivalent caseload of 3.25 active judges, according to \n     numbers from Chief Judge Merrick Garland. That means the \n     circuit has the equivalent of 11.25 full-time judges.\n       That's more than enough considering that the court's \n     caseload is the lightest in the country. For the 12-months \n     ending in September, the D.C. Circuit had 149 appeals filed \n     per active judge. By comparison, the 11th Circuit had 778 \n     appeals filed per active judge for the same period. If all \n     three nominees to the D.C. Circuit were confirmed, the number \n     of appeals per active judge would be 108, while a full slate \n     on the 11th Circuit would be 583 appeals per judge. The \n     national average of appeals per active judge is 383. The \n     closest to the D.C. Circuit is the 10th Circuit, at 217 \n     appeals.\n       Liberal Senator Pat Leahy claims that these comparisons \n     don't matter because the D.C. Circuit handles complex \n     rulemakings by federal agencies and sensitive national \n     security cases. But the truth is that all the circuits handle \n     complicated cases. And even many regulatory cases have been \n     migrating to other circuits as some of the D.C. Circuit's \n     stars have taken senior status.\n       According to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, \n     42.9% of the D.C. Circuit's caseload is made up of \n     administrative appeals of federal rules or regulations, the \n     highest percentage of any circuit. In raw numbers, the D.C. \n     Circuit is not carrying the heaviest load. That honor goes to \n     the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Democrats are in a rush to confirm as many judges as \n     possible because they know the clock is ticking on the Obama \n     second term. Liberals have criticized the White House for its \n     slow pace of nominations, but that isn't the fault of \n     Republicans. Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley, the ranking \n     Republican on Judiciary who has led the fight against more \n     D.C. Circuit confirmations, has been entirely consistent. In \n     the Bush years he opposed the nomination of a twelfth judge \n     for the court on workload grounds.\n       GOP Senators watched for years as Senate Democrats blocked \n     George W. Bush's nominees to the D.C. Circuit, including the \n     eminently qualified Miguel Estrada and Peter Keisler. \n     Republicans are right to say that the D.C. Circuit now has a \n     full complement of judges following the unanimous \n     confirmation of Obama nominee Sri Srinivasan in May.\n       Mr. Reid and his fellow Democrats are claiming that even if \n     they establish a new standard of 51 votes to confirm \n     appellate judges and executive-branch officials, they can \n     keep the 60 vote standard for the Supreme Court. They're \n     kidding themselves. If they change the rules to pack the D.C. \n     Circuit, Democrats should understand they are also setting \n     that standard for future Supreme Court nominees opposed to \n     Roe v. Wade.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. This is about a naked power grab and nothing more than \na power grab. This is about the other side not getting everything they \nwant, when they want it.\n  The other side claims they were pushed to this point because our side \nobjected to the President's plan to fill the DC Circuit with judges the \ncourt does not need, but the other side tends to forget history. \nHistory is something we ought to learn from, so let's review how we got \nhere.\n  After the President simultaneously nominated three nominees who are \nnot needed for the DC Circuit--a blatant political power grab in its \nown right--what did the Republicans do? Well, we did something quite \nsimple: We said we want to go by the rules the Democrats set in 2006. \nWe said we would hold those Democrats to the same standard they \nestablished in 2006 when they blocked a nominee of President Bush's by \nthe name of Peter Keisler.\n  Let's be clear about why the Democrats are outraged. Democrats are \noutraged because Republicans actually had the temerity to hold the \nother political party to a standard they established, and because we \ndid, because we insisted we all play by the same rules, they came right \nback and said: Then we will change the rules. In effect, the other side \nhas said: We don't want to be held to the standard we established in \n2006. And not only that, but if you don't give us what we want, we are \nwilling to forever change the Senate. And that is what happened today.\n  We hear a lot of ultimatums around here, but this ultimatum was not \nrun-of-the-mill. It was very different. It was different because this \nthreat was designed to hold the Senate hostage. It was different \nbecause it is designed to hold hostage all of the Senate's history and \ntraditions and precedents. It was different because its effectiveness \ndepends on the good will of Senators who don't want to see the Senate \nas we know it destroyed or function other than as the constitutional \nwriters intended.\n  I would note that today's majority didn't always feel that way--the \nvery way we have seen expressed today. Not too many years ago my \ncolleagues on the other side described their fight to preserve the \nfilibuster with great pride. For instance, in 2006 one of my colleagues \non the other side said:\n\n       The nuclear option was the most important issue I have \n     worked on in my public life. Its rejection was my proudest \n     moment as a minority leader. I emerged from the episode with \n     a renewed appreciation for the majesty of Senate rules. As \n     majority leader, I intend to run the Senate with respect for \n     the rules and for the minority rights the rules protect.\n\n  In 2005 another of my Democratic colleagues had this to say, \nreferring to when Republicans were in the majority:\n\n       Today, Republicans are threatening to take away one of the \n     few remaining checks on the power of the executive branch by \n     their use of what has become known as the nuclear option. \n     This assault on our traditions of checks and balances and on \n     the protection of minority rights in the Senate and in our \n     democracy should be abandoned.\n       Eliminating the filibuster by nuclear option would destroy \n     the Constitution's design of the Senate as an effective check \n     on the executive.\n\n  So here we have two quotes from Democrats in the 2005-2006 timeframe \nvery strongly supporting the precedent of the Senate in using the \nfilibuster to protect minority rights. But that was when they were in \nthe minority. Now\n\n[[Page S8421]]\n\nthey are in the majority, and the tradition of the Senate doesn't mean \nmuch.\n  Here is another quote from the late Senator Byrd in 2005:\n\n       And I detest this mention of a nuclear option, the \n     constitutional option. There is nothing constitutional about \n     it. Nothing.\n\n  But, of course, that was way back then--just 6, 7 years ago when \ntoday's majority was in the minority and there was a Republican in the \nWhite House. Today the shoe is on the other foot. Today the other side \nis willing to forever change the Senate because Republicans have the \naudacity to hold them--the majority party of today--to their own \nstandard. Why? Why would the other side do this? There clearly isn't a \ncrisis on the DC Circuit. The judges themselves say that if we confirm \nany more judges, there won't be enough work to go around. And it is not \nas if all of these nominees are mainstream consensus picks despite what \nthe other side would have us believe, that they are somewhat \nmainstream.\n  Take Professor Pillard, for instance. She has written this about \nmotherhood:\n\n       Reproductive rights, including rights to contraception and \n     abortion, play a central role in freeing women from \n     historically routine conscription into maternity.\n\n  Is that mainstream?\n  She has also argued this about motherhood:\n\n       Antiabortion laws and other restraints on reproductive \n     freedom not only enforce women's incubation of unwanted \n     pregnancies, but also prescribe a ``vision of the woman's \n     role'' as mother and caretaker of children in a way that is \n     at odds with equal protection.\n\n  Is that mainstream?\n  What about her views on religious freedom? She argued that the \nSupreme Court's case of Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church, \nwhich challenged the so-called ``ministerial exception'' to employment \ndiscrimination, represented a ``substantial threat to the American rule \nof law.'' Now, get this. After she said that, the Supreme Court \nrejected her view 9 to 0, and the Court held that ``it is impermissible \nfor the government to contradict a church's determination of who can \nact as its ministers.''\n  Do my colleagues really believe mainstream America thinks churches \nshouldn't be allowed to choose their own ministers?\n  I could go on and on, but I hope my colleagues get the picture.\n  The point is this: Voting to change the Senate rules is voting to \nremove one of the last meaningful checks on the President--any \nPresident--and voting to put these views on this important court.\n  So I ask again, why would the other side do this? It is nothing short \nof a complete and total power grab. It is the type of thing we have \nseen again and again out of this administration and their Senate \nallies, and you can sum it up this way: Do whatever it takes.\n  You can't get ObamaCare passed with Republican support? Do whatever \nit takes: Pass it at 7 a.m. on Christmas Eve with just Democratic \nvotes.\n  You can't get all of your side to support ObamaCare? Do whatever it \ntakes: Resort to things like the ``Cornhusker kickback.''\n  You lose your 60th vote on ObamaCare due to a special election? Do \nwhatever it takes: Ram it through anyway using reconciliation.\n  The American people don't want to be taxed for not buying health \ncare? Do whatever it takes: Tell the American people it isn't a tax and \nthen argue in the court that it is a tax.\n  The American people want to keep their health care? Do whatever it \ntakes: Promise them ``if you like your health care, you can keep it'' \nand then issue regulations making it impossible.\n  Your labor allies want out from under ObamaCare? Do whatever it \ntakes: Consider issuing them--labor--a waiver from the reinsurance tax.\n  You can't find consensus nominees for the National Labor Relations \nBoard? Do whatever it takes: Recess-appoint them when the Senate is \nstill in session.\n  You can't convince Congress to adopt your gun control agenda? Do \nwhatever it takes: Issue some Executive orders.\n  You can't convince moderate Democrats to support cap-and-trade fee \nincreases? Well, do whatever it takes: Do the same thing through EPA \nregulation.\n  Frustrated that conservative groups' political speech is protected \nunder the First Amendment? Do whatever it takes: Use the IRS to harass \nand intimidate those same conservative groups.\n  Frustrated when the court stands up for religious freedom and issues \na check on the ObamaCare contraception mandate? Do whatever it takes: \nStack the DC Circuit Court in your favor.\n  Frustrated when the court curbs your power on recess appointments? Do \nwhatever it takes: Stack the DC Circuit with your favorite appointees--\npeople who will rule in your favor.\n  Worried EPA's regulations on cap-and-trade fee increases might get \nchallenged in the court? Do whatever it takes: Stack the DC Circuit in \nyour favor.\n  Frustrated because Senate Republicans have the nerve to hold you to \nthe same standard you established during the last administration? Do \nwhatever it takes: Change the rules of the Senate. That is what we have \nwitnessed today, nothing but an absolute power grab.\n\n  The majority in the Senate and their allies in the administration are \nwilling to do whatever it takes to achieve their partisan agenda. They \nknow there will be additional challenges to ObamaCare. They know that \nif they can stack the deck on the DC Circuit they can remove one of the \nlast remaining checks on Presidential power.\n  But make no mistake, my friends on the other side will have to answer \nthis question: Why did you choose this moment to break the rules to \nchange the rules? Why now? Why, when we are witnessing the collapse of \nthis massive effort to centrally plan one-sixth of this wonderful \nNation's economy--why, when millions of Americans are losing their \nhealth care--why did you choose this moment to hand the keys to the \nkingdom over to the President, a President with less check on his \nauthority?\n  Because the fact of the matter is this: any vote to break the rules \nto change the rules is a vote to ensure ObamaCare remains intact.\n  I will conclude by saying this. Changing the rules of the Senate in \nthis way was a mistake. But if the last several years have taught us \nanything, it is that the majority won't stop making these demands. We \ncan't always give in to these constant threats. Sooner or later you \nhave to stand up and say: Enough is enough.\n  But if there is one thing which will always be true, it is this: \nMajorities are fickle. Majorities are fleeting. Here today, gone \ntomorrow. That is a lesson that, sadly, most of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle haven't learned for the simple reason that they \nhave never served a single day in the minority.\n  So the majority has chosen to take us down this path. The silver \nlining is that there will come a day when roles are reversed. When that \nhappens, our side will likely nominate and confirm lower court and \nSupreme Court nominees with 51 votes, regardless of whether the \nDemocrats actually buy into this fanciful notion that they can demolish \nthe filibuster on lower court nominees and still preserve it for \nSupreme Court nominees.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that after my remarks, the Senator \nfrom Alabama be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in the past, a few Senate majorities, \nfrustrated by their inability to get certain bills and nominations to a \nvote, have threatened to ignore the rules and change them by fiat, and \nto change rules to a majority vote change. Rule XXII of the Senate \nrequires two-thirds of the Senate to amend our rules. A new precedent \nhas now been set, which is that a majority can change our rules. \nBecause that step would change this Senate into a legislative body \nwhere the majority can, whenever it wishes, change the rules, it has \nbeen dubbed the nuclear option.\n  Arguments about the nuclear option are not new. Senator Arthur \nVandenberg confronted the same question in 1949. Senator Vandenberg, \nwho was a giant of the Senate and one of my predecessors from Michigan, \nsaid if the majority can change the rules at will, ``there are no rules \nexcept the transient, unregulated wishes of a majority\n\n[[Page S8422]]\n\nof whatever quorum is temporarily in control of the Senate.''\n  When Senator Vandenberg took that position, he was arguing against \nchanging the rules by fiat, although he favored the rule change that \nwas being considered.\n  Overruling the ruling of the Chair, as we have now done, by a simple \nmajority is not a one-time action. If a Senate majority demonstrates it \ncan make such a change once, there are no rules which bind a majority, \nand all future majorities will feel free to exercise the same power--\nnot just on judges and executive appointments but on legislation.\n  We have avoided taking those nuclear steps in the past, although we \nhave avoided them sometimes barely. I am glad we avoided the possible \nuse of the nuclear option again earlier this year when our leaders \nagreed on a path allowing the Senate to proceed to a vote on the \nPresident's nominees for several unfilled vacancies in his \nadministration. Today we are once again moving down a destructive path.\n  The issue is not whether to change the rules--I support changing the \nrules--to allow a President to get a vote on nominees to executive and \nmost judicial positions. But this is not about the ends but the means. \nPursuing the nuclear option in this manner removes an important check \non majority overreach. As Senator Vandenberg said: If a Senate majority \ndecides to pursue its aims unrestrained by the rules, we will have \nsacrificed a professed vital principle for the sake of momentary \nconvenience.\n  Republicans have filibustered three eminently qualified nominees to \nthe Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. They make no \npretense of argument that these nominees are unqualified. The mere \nnomination of qualified judges by this President, they say, qualifies \nas court packing. It is the latest attempt by Republicans, having lost \ntwo Presidential elections, to seek preventing the duly elected \nPresident from fulfilling his constitutional duties.\n  The thin veneer of substance laid over this partisan obstruction is \nthe claim that the DC Circuit has too many judges. To be kind, this is \na debatable proposition, one for which there is ample contrary \nevidence, and surely one that falls far short of the need to provoke a \nconstitutional battle. Republicans know they cannot succeed in passing \nlegislation to reduce the size of the court. So, presented with a \nstatutory and constitutional reality they do not like, they have \ndecided to ignore that reality and have decided they can obstruct the \nPresident's nominees for no substantive reason.\n  Let nobody mistake my meaning. The actions of Senate Republicans in \nthese matters have been irresponsible. These actions put short-term \npartisan interest ahead of the good of the Nation and the future of \nthis Senate as a unique institution. It is deeply dispiriting to see so \nmany Republican colleagues who have in the past pledged to filibuster \njudicial nominees only in extraordinary circumstances engaged in such \npartisan gamesmanship. Whatever their motivations, the repercussions of \ntheir actions are clear. They are contributing to the destruction of an \nimportant check against majority overreach. To the frustration of those \nwilling to break the rules to change the rules, those of us who are \nunwilling to do that have now seen it occur before our eyes when the \nChair was overruled earlier today.\n  So why don't I join my Democratic colleagues in supporting the method \nby which they propose to change the rules? My opposition to the use of \nthe nuclear option to change the rules of the Senate is not a defense \nof the current abuse of the rules. My opposition to the nuclear option \nis not new. When Republicans threatened in 2005 to use the nuclear \noption in a dispute over judicial nominees, I strongly opposed the \nplans, just as Senator Kennedy, Senator Biden, and Senator Byrd did, \nand just about every Senate Democrat did--including Democrats still in \nthe Senate today.\n  Back then, Senator Kennedy called the Republican plan a ``preemptive \nnuclear strike,'' and said:\n\n       Neither the Constitution, nor Senate rules, nor Senate \n     precedents, nor American history, provide any justification \n     for selectively nullifying the use of the filibuster. Equally \n     important, neither the Constitution nor the Rules nor the \n     precedents nor history provide any permissible means for a \n     bare majority of the Senate to take that radical step without \n     breaking or ignoring clear provisions of applicable Senate \n     Rules and unquestioned precedents.\n\n  Here is what then-Senator Biden said during that 2005 fight:\n\n       The nuclear option abandons America's sense of fair play. \n     It's the one thing this country stands for. Not tilting the \n     playing field on the side of those who control and own the \n     field. I say to my friends on the Republican side, you may \n     own the field right now but you won't own it forever. And I \n     pray to God when the Democrats take back control, we don't \n     make the same kind of naked power grab you are doing.\n\n  My position today is consistent with the position that I and every \nSenate Democrat took then--and that is just back in 2005--to preserve \nthe rights of the Senate minority. I can't ignore that. Nor can I \nignore the fact that Democrats have used the filibuster on many \noccasions to advance or protect policies we believe in.\n  When Republicans controlled the White House, the Senate, and the \nHouse of Representatives from 2003-2006, it was a Democratic minority \nin the Senate that blocked a series of bills that would have severely \nrestricted the reproductive rights of women. It was a Democratic \nminority in the Senate that beat back efforts to limit Americans' right \nto seek justice in the courts when they are harmed by corporate or \nmedical wrongdoing. It was a Democratic minority in the Senate that \nstopped the nominations of some to the Federal courts who we believed \nwould not provide fair and unbiased judgment. Without the protections \nafforded the Senate minority, total repeal of the estate tax would have \npassed the Senate in 2006.\n  We don't have to go back to 2006 to find examples of Senate Democrats \nusing the rules of the Senate to stop passage of what many of us deemed \nbad legislation. Just last year, these protections prevented adoption \nof an amendment which would have essentially prevented the EPA from \nprotecting waters under the Clean Water Act. We stopped an amendment to \nallow loaded and concealed weapons on land managed by the Army Corps of \nEngineers. With minority votes, we stopped legislation that would have \nallowed some individuals who were deemed mentally incompetent access to \nfirearms. That is just in the last year. Removing these minority \nprotections risks that in the future, important civil and political \nrights might disappear because a majority agreed they should.\n  Let us not kid ourselves. The fact that we changed the rules today \njust to apply to judges and executive nominations does not mean the \nsame precedent won't be used tomorrow or next year or the year after to \nprovide for the end of a filibuster on legislation, on bills and \namendments that are before us.\n  Just as I have implored my Democratic colleagues to consider the \nimplications of a nuclear option which would establish the precedent \nthat the majority can change the rules at will, it is just as urgent \nfor my Republican colleagues to end the abuse of rules allowing \nextended debate that were intended to be invoked rarely.\n  Some of my Democratic colleagues may rightfully ask, if a Democratic \nmajority cannot initially muster a supermajority to end filibusters or \nchange the rules, then what can the majority do? The rules give us the \npath, and that is to make the filibusterers filibuster. Let the \nmajority leader bring nominations before the Senate, and let the Senate \nmajority force the filibusterers to come to the floor to filibuster. \nThe current rules of the Senate allow the Presiding Officer to put the \npending question to a vote when no Senator seeks recognition. Let us, \nas the Senate majority, dedicate a week, or a weekend, or even a night, \nto force the filibusterers to filibuster.\n  In 2010, in testimony before the rules committee on this subject, \nthis is what Senator Byrd said:\n\n       Does the difficulty reside in the construction of our \n     rules, or does it reside in the ease of circumventing them? A \n     true filibuster is a fight, not a threat, not a bluff. . . . \n     Now, unbelievably, just the whisper of opposition brings the \n     ``world's greatest deliberative body'' to a grinding halt.\n\n  Then he said:\n\n       Forceful confrontation to a threat to filibuster is \n     undoubtedly the antidote to the malady.\n\n\n[[Page S8423]]\n\n\n  We have not used that antidote to the malady which besets this body, \nallowing the mere threat of a filibuster to succeed without challenging \nthat threat, without telling the filibusterers: Go ahead, filibuster. \nWe have rules that protect us. When you pause and when there is no one \nelse here, at 3 o'clock on the fourth day or the fifth day or the sixth \nday, the Chair can put the question. The American people will then see \nin a dramatic way the obstruction which has taken place in this body.\n  But before a Senate majority assumes a power that no Senate majority \nbefore us has assumed, to change the rules at the will of the majority, \nbefore we do something that cannot easily be undone--and we have now \ndone it--before we discard the uniqueness of this great institution, \nlet us use the current rules and precedents of the Senate to end abuse \nof the filibuster. Surely we owe that much to this great and unique \ninstitution.\n  There is a conversation, which was a formal conversation between the \nmajority and Republican leaders just last January. Here is what the \nmajority leader said:\n\n       In addition to the standing order [which is what we have \n     adopted] I will enforce existing rules to make the Senate \n     operate more efficiently. After reasonable notice, I will \n     insist that any Senator who objects to consent requests or \n     threatens to filibuster come to the floor and exercise his or \n     her rights himself or herself. This will apply to all \n     objections to unanimous consent requests. Senators should be \n     required to come to the floor and participate in the \n     legislative process, to voice objections, engage in debate or \n     offer amendments.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Finally, we will also announce that when the majority \n     leader or bill manager has reasonably alerted the body of the \n     intention to do so and the Senate is not in a quorum call and \n     there is no order of the Senate to the contrary, the \n     Presiding Officer may ask if there is further debate, and if \n     no Senator seeks recognition, the Presiding Officer may put \n     the question to a vote.\n\n  He, our majority leader, said:\n\n       This is consistent with the precedent of the Senate and \n     with Riddick's Senate Procedure.\n\n  What this showed again is that if we in the majority have the \nwillpower, as much willpower as has been shown by some obstructionists \nin this body--if we have an equal amount of will as they have shown, \nthat the current rules, before this change today, can be used to force \nfilibusterers to filibuster, to come to the floor and to talk, all we \nneed is the willingness to use the rules, to take the weekend off, to \ntake a week that we hoped for a recess, and use it to come back here; \nto take the recess itself, if necessary during the summer, for 1 month \nif necessary, to try to preserve what is so essential to this body, its \nuniqueness, which is that the majority cannot change the rules whenever \nit wants.\n  The House of Representatives can change the rules whenever it wants. \nIt is called a rules committee. They can adopt and modify the rules at \nany time, and they do. This body has not done that. We have resisted. \nWe have been tempted to do it. We have come close to doing it. But we \nhave never done it--until today.\n  Do I want to amend the rules? Do I. I want to amend these rules with \nall my heart. I want to embody a principle that a President, regardless \nof party, should be able to get a vote on his or her nominees to \nexecutive positions at the district and circuit courts. I believe in \nthat. I believe most Senators believe in that. We need to change the \nrule. But to change it in the way we changed it today means there are \nno rules except as the majority wants them. It is a very major shift in \nthe very nature of this institution, if the majority can do whatever it \nwants by changing the rules whenever it wants with a method that has \nnot been used before in this body to change the very rules of this \nbody.\n  We should have avoided a nuclear option. We should have avoided \nviolating our precedents. We should have avoided changing and creating \na precedent which can be used in the same way on legislation. It may \ngive comfort to some today: ``But this is only on judges, this is only \non executive appointments.'' This precedent is equally available to a \nmajority that wants to change the rules relative to the legislative \nprocess.\n  Those who have abused these rules, mainly on the other side of the \naisle, whether they acknowledge it, are contributors to the loss of \nprotections which we see today for the Senate minority. Given a tool of \ngreat power, requiring great responsibility, they have recklessly \nabused it. But now I am afraid it will not just be they who will pay \nthe price.\n  In the short term, judges will be confirmed who should be confirmed. \nBut when the precedent is set, the majority of this body can change the \nrules at will, which is what the majority did today. If it can be \nchanged on judges or on other nominees, this precedent is going to be \nused, I fear, to change the rules in consideration of legislation. Down \nthe road--we don't know how far down the road, we never know that in a \ndemocracy--but down the road the hard-won protections and benefits for \nour people's health and welfare will be lost.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, throughout our Senate history we have \nhad Senators such as Senator Levin. Before he does depart, I thank him \nfor his principled approach to this complex issue.\n  Just to share with all of our colleagues, he is completing his \nservice in the Senate this year. He is not running for reelection. He \ncertainly would have been reelected. This weekend I was at a national \nsecurity conference at the Reagan Library. The first winners of an \naward for national security were former Secretary of Defense Gates, who \nserved two Presidents, and Senator Levin was the other winner. I think \nit is a tribute to his commitment to this country.\n  We have disagreed on a lot of issues and no one should think he is \nnot a strong and effective advocate for values around here. But I think \nall of us should listen to his remarks and his warning, a very simple \nwarning. That warning is that if a majority can change the rules with a \nsimple majority vote in order to defeat what heretofore was a right of \na minority party in the Senate, there are no minority rights left. They \nsimply exist at the will of the majority. This is a fundamental matter. \nIt is an important matter.\n  We have had some close calls and a lot of intensity, but we have \navoided this kind of action. I think it is fair to say without dispute \nthat the significance of this rule change today dwarfs any other appeal \nof the ruling of the Chair that we have seen--maybe in the history of \nthe Republic. This is a big event. It changes what goes on because we \ndeal with power and the exercise of power.\n  This whole thing is simply Majority Leader Reid--and he has a \ndifficult job. I have tried to not make his life more difficult than it \nneeds to be.\n  But he is not a dictator. He does not get to dictate how this Senate \nis operated. He does not have the right to come in and change the rules \nbecause he wants to fill three judgeship slots that are not needed. \nThere is no way one can justify filling these court slots, based on \nsimple need or by caseload per judge.\n  He is unhappy about that. Maybe he wants to change the mood of the \ncountry from ObamaCare and the overreach that was executed to pass that \nbill on December 24, to ram it through the Senate on a straight party-\nline vote. I suspect that is part of it. But this is not the way to do \nbusiness.\n  The only reason those judges were blocked, the only reason they did \nnot get a confirmation, was because we did not need them. This country \nis going broke. There are districts in America that need judges. The DC \nCircuit does not need more judges. It does not need the eight they \nhave. Yes, they have 3 vacancies, but with the current 8 judges, their \naverage caseload per judge was 149, and they have been continuing to \ndrop. My circuit, the Eleventh Circuit, the Chair would be interested \nto know, has an average caseload per judge of 740. The next lowest \ncaseload per circuit is twice 149. The average is well above that per \ncircuit. The judges themselves say they do not need anymore judges. \nThey take the whole summer off.\n  These judges would not have been rejected if we had needed them. But \nthe President is so determined to try to leave a legacy of friends on \nthat court\n\n[[Page S8424]]\n\nthat he just shoved them anyway and demanded the Senate pass them, and \nSenator Reid demanded that we confirm these judges. The judges say they \ndo not need anymore judges on that court. They do not need them, \nwhether they say they need them or not. I know how to look at the \ncaseload. I am on the Judiciary Committee. I am on the courts \nsubcommittee. I have chaired it and been ranking member of it for \nyears. I know how to analyze weighted caseloads. There is no \njustification for adding or filling a single slot on that court and we \nshould not be doing it.\n  I am also ranking Republican on the budget committee, and I know we \ncannot keep throwing away money for no good reason. The last thing we \nshould do is ask the American people to fund $1 million-a-year judges. \nThat is what each judge and the staff are estimated to cost--and there \nare three of them. It is akin to every year burning $1 million on The \nMall. We do not have $1 million to throw away. But we do have judges, \nwe do have circuits, we do have district courts around the country that \nare overloaded and we are going to add some judges to them. We ought to \nclose these judge slots and move them to a place they are needed, as \nany commonsense person would do.\n  So it was not any animosity to any of the nominations and their \ncharacter or decency that led to this rejection. It was because we \nwarned against it.\n  Senator Grassley and I serve on the judiciary committee. He \npreviously chaired the court subcommittee, and Senator Grassley blocked \nPresident Bush in filling one of those slots. Oh, they wanted to fill \nthe slot. They thought they might leave a legacy judge who would be \ninfluential to them. That is what they suggested, but we refused. We \nwere actually able to transfer one of those slots to the Ninth \nCircuit. That is how good business should be done around here. We are \nat a point where we don't need to fill that slot, and it should in no \nway cause the majority leader to feel as if his power was threatened or \nthat his majority was threatened. We are changing the rules of the \nSenate so he can get three judges confirmed that we do not need. I will \nbe prepared to debate that issue anywhere, anytime on the merits. Not \none of those slots should be filled.\n\n  They have the lowest caseload per judge in America. Their cases are \nnot so complex that it would slow down their work and demand more \njudges. That has been analyzed, and it is not true.\n  Senator Reid asked for this job. That is what my wife says to me when \nI complain. She says: Don't blame me; you asked for the job. He asked \nto be the majority leader of the Senate, and it is not easy. There are \na lot of Members and a lot of different ideas about what ought to be \ndone.\n  Trent Lott called it herding cats. I suppose that is a pretty good \ndescription of it. One time he said it is like putting a bunch of frogs \nin a wheelbarrow. You put one in and two jump out. It is not easy to \nmove the Senate. I understand that. Changing the rules, as Senator \nLevin said, by a simple majority vote and significantly altering the \ntradition of the Senate is dangerous.\n  Senator Reid said we have been wasting time on the procedural hurdles \nthrown up in the Senate. He also said Congress is broken and the \nAmerican people think that Congress is broken. They thought it was \nbroken when they used legerdemain on December 24 before Scott Brown \nfrom Massachusetts could take office so they could pass a health care \nbill that the American people overwhelmingly opposed.\n  Maybe the reason the American people are frustrated with the Congress \nis that they passed a bill that the American people opposed without a \nsingle Republican vote in the House or the Senate. Maybe that is why \nthe American people are not happy with us.\n  I will explain, colleagues, what is causing the greatest frustration \nin the Senate. It is a trend that began some years ago--not long after \nI came to the Senate 17 years ago--and it has accelerated. It has \nreached a pace with Majority Leader Reid we have never, ever seen \nbefore, and it undermines the very integrity and tradition of the \nSenate. It has to stop. We have to recover the tradition of this body. \nWe owe it to those who will be filling these seats in the years to \ncome.\n  This is the problem: A maneuver called filling the tree was \ndiscovered. It is a parliamentary maneuver where the majority leader, \nwho gets recognition first in the Senate, seeks recognition and then he \nfills the tree. That parliamentary maneuver basically blocks anyone \nelse from getting an amendment. A Senator cannot introduce his or her \namendment. So how do we have an amendment? You have to go hat in hand \nto Senator Reid and say: Senator Reid, I would like an amendment.\n  Well, I don't think so.\n  I don't like that amendment.\n  But I like it. I want to vote on it.\n  Sorry. We don't want to vote on it.\n  That is the way it has been going every year. The Defense bill \ncommonly had 30 or more amendments of substance when it hit the floor--\n$500 billion. It was the biggest appropriation bill we had--$500 \nbillion. Senator Coburn has an amendment directly related to the \nDepartment of Defense that would save some money.\n  Senator Reid will not give him a vote on that.\n  People say: Why don't you do something, Sessions? Why don't you get \nan amendment passed? I cannot bring an amendment to the floor unless he \nagrees. He says it is because of delay. He says it is because it \ncreates time difficulties. We have been on this bill for a week, and we \nhave only had two votes. We have gone for days with no votes. It is not \nabout time. Let me tell you what it is: The majority leader of the \nSenate is protecting his members from tough votes. He does not want \nthem to have to cast votes on critical issues in this country. He is \nnot concerned about time or delay. There is plenty of time.\n  We could have already cast 15 votes on this bill, and everybody would \nbe satisfied. That is the way it was when Senator McConnell was here. \nThat is the way it has been. That is the way it had been when I came \nhere. We had 60-something votes on a bankruptcy bill. It went on for 3 \nweeks.\n  This is causing tension and frustration. One of our new Members in \nthe Senate when we were debating this very question some months ago \nsaid: They tell us we have to get Senator McConnell's decision before \nthey will let us introduce an amendment. I said: Wait a minute. Do you \nnot understand that you are a duly elected Senator from the United \nStates of America and you have to ask permission of the Republican \nleader before you can get a vote on an amendment? How did this happen?\n  This is a background issue that is undermining collegiality in this \nbody. I am tired of asking the majority leader for permission to give \nme a vote in the Senate. It is not right.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes, I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am assuming that his situation is very similar to the \nsituation that I find myself in. About a year ago we brought the farm \nbill to the floor. I was the ranking member of the committee. We voted \n73 times. We had over 300 amendments offered. The amendments came \nforth, and the first amendment had nothing to do with agriculture. \nBasically, we were able to get through it in 2\\1/2\\ days.\n  Fast-forward to this year's farm bill. I think there were 10 votes. \nSenator Thune has been on the committee for a long time. We respect his \nvoice, and we respect his amendments. He had about four amendments. \nSenator Grassley has been on the committee a lot longer. He always has \namendments on the farm bill. Senator Johanns is a former Secretary of \nAgriculture. He is an excellent Senator for Nebraska and a real voice \nfor Agriculture. He had several amendments. I had two or three \namendments that I would have liked to have had considered.\n  The reason I mention them is because we all agreed to hold off in \ncommittee as long as we could bring them to the floor. We wanted to \nexpedite it because the big issue was time. They said: Well, we don't \nhave time for a farm bill. Usually a farm bill takes 1 to 2 weeks. That \nis just not the case anymore. Last year we got through it in 2\\1/2\\ \ndays.\n\n  This year we expected to have votes, but none of us got amendments. \nAfter 10 votes, bingo, it was cut off. The majority leader controlled \nthe effort. This is like the Rules Committee in the House.\n\n[[Page S8425]]\n\n  When I was in the House, we had a Roberts-Stenholm amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. An amendment can't come up for a vote in the House \nunless it is approved by the Rules Committee.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. That is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is the difference between the House and the \nSenate.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, if I could respond to the distinguished \nSenator. We had a Roberts-Stenholm amendment at that point while the \nRepublicans were in the minority. Charlie Stenholm was a Democrat. As \nwe went in he whispered: You might want to make this the Stenholm-\nRoberts amendment. I figured that out pretty fast, and we got our \namendment made in order.\n  As a younger member of the House at that particular time, I thought \nthe Rules Committee was based on the merits of whether it was germane \nor pertinent, et cetera. It wasn't. It was just a complete rehash of \nwhat went on with the authorizing committee.\n  One of the reasons I decided to come to the Senate was that you can \noffer an amendment at any time on any subject, unless it was something \ninvolving national security or whatever. I understand that. What we \nhave now is a one-man rules committee. I deeply resent that.\n  I feel sorry for the Senate, and I feel sorry for the Members who \ncome here and are not able to have their amendments considered.\n  One of the first things I did as the ranking member of the Senate \nagriculture committee last year was to promise that amendments could be \nbrought to the floor. A lot of people on our side never had the \nopportunity to offer an amendment before. I said: You will have that \nopportunity if I can get this thing done. And we did. We opened it and \nit was one of the few bills that went under regular order, and we got \nthings done.\n  There is only one House. There is the House and there is the Senate--\njust like the House--and that is a shame.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for his comments.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator so very much. His insight is \ncorrect. I will wrap up and say that what happened today is very \nsignificant, and it is a sad day. It represents the greatest alteration \nof the rules without proper procedure that we have probably seen in the \nhistory of the Republic.\n  It erodes legitimate minority rights in a way that subjects every \nright a minority party has in the Senate and the right any individual \nSenator has in the Senate. It places that right at great risk. A \nmajority can do that at any time. That was explained so eloquently by \nSenator Roberts a few moments ago. I was so impressed with his \nanalysis.\n  We will wrestle through this and work at it. I know that Senator \nAlexander has worked hard in every way possible to avoid this day. He \nhas expressed great interest in it, and I look forward to hearing his \ncomments at this time on where we are and what is going to happen to \nus.\n  I thank the Senator and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for \nhis thoughtfulness and leadership.\n  As Senator Byrd used to say: The purpose of the Senate is to have a \nplace where there can be an opportunity for unlimited discussion, \nunlimited debates and unlimited amendments. That is why we are here.\n  Senator Byrd used to say so eloquently that the Senate was a unique \nbody because it provided the necessary fence against the abuses of the \nexecutive. That is what Senator Byrd said in his last speech to the \nSenate when he spoke before the rules committee. He said the Senate is \nthe necessary fence against abuses of the executive--remembering how \nthis country was founded in opposition to the king and the popular \nexcesses. That was what the Senate was supposed to be. I am afraid that \nended today.\n  This action by the Democratic majority is the most important and most \ndangerous restructuring of the rules of the Senate since Thomas \nJefferson wrote the rules at the founding of our country. It creates \nthe perpetual opportunity--as Alexis de Tocqueville described--that is \nmost dangerous for our country. He said that when he came to our \ncountry to visit in the 1830s. The young Frenchman said: I see two \ngreat dangers for this new American democracy. One was Russia and the \nother was the tyranny of the majority.\n  The action that was taken today creates a perpetual opportunity for \nthe tyranny of the majority because it permits a majority in this body \nto do whatever it wants to do anytime it wants to do it. This should be \ncalled ObamaCare 2 because it is another example of the use of raw \npartisan political power for the majority to do whatever it wants to do \nany time it wants to do it.\n  In this case what it wants to do is implement the President's radical \nregulatory agenda through the District of Columbia court. That's what \nthis is. It is not about an abuse of the filibuster.\n  There is a big football weekend coming up in Tennessee. Vanderbilt \nUniversity plays the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.\n  Let's imagine this: The Vanderbilt-Tennessee game, which is being \nplayed in Knoxville, home of the University of Tennessee, and \nVanderbilt gets on the 1-yard line. The University of Tennessee says: \nWell, we are the home team, so we will just add 20 yards to the field \nor whatever it takes for us to win the game. Or the Boston Red Sox are \nplaying at home. Let's say they are behind the Cardinals this year. \nThey get to the ninth inning and they are behind and they say: Well, it \nis our home field. We will just add a few innings or whatever it takes \nso we can win the game. That is what the Democratic majority did today. \nThey say: The rules don't allow us to do what we want to do, so we will \njust change the rules to do whatever it takes to get the result we \nwant.\n\n  That is what they did with ObamaCare. We remember that. I was \nstanding right here at the desk. It was snowing. It was the middle of \nthe winter. Senators were coming in, in the middle of the night, and \nwhat happened? Among the things the American people like the least \nabout ObamaCare is that it was crammed down the throat of the American \npeople by the raw exercise of partisan political power with not one \nsingle Republican vote. That is not the way the civil rights bill was \npassed. That is not the way Social Security and other great bills were \npassed. They were passed by a bipartisan majority so we could gain the \nsupport of the American people.\n  Our Democratic majority must have liked that ObamaCare night. The \nAmerican people aren't liking it so much because apparently nobody read \nthe bill very closely. There are millions of Americans who have had \ntheir policies canceled. There are going to be millions more when \nemployers start looking at the cost of ObamaCare.\n  This is ObamaCare 2; I say to my colleagues. This is another exercise \nof raw partisan political power for the Democratic majority to get the \nresult it wants. There is only one cure for it, and that is an \nelection. An election is coming up in about a year. The American people \ncan speak. In the meantime, this has been the most dangerous, most \nimportant restructuring of the Senate since Thomas Jefferson wrote the \nrules.\n  It is, according to the Senator from Nevada, who is the majority \nleader--it is, according to his book in 2008, the end of the Senate. \nThat is what he said this would be, and now he has done it. He has \nwritten the end of the Senate by his actions today.\n  The Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, said to all of us when we were \ndiscussing this earlier this year--he reminded us of the great Senator \nfrom Michigan, Arthur Vandenberg, who was the author of the idea of a \nbipartisan foreign policy. Senator Vandenberg said shortly after World \nWar II that a U.S. Senate in which a majority can change the rules \nanytime the majority wants is a U.S. Senate without any rules. Let me \nsay that again. A U.S. Senate in which the majority can change the \nrules anytime the majority wants is a U.S. Senate without any rules.\n  So this is not about the filibuster. This is another raw partisan \npolitical power grab so the Democratic majority can do whatever it \nwants to do whenever it wants to do it. It is ObamaCare II, and the \nAmerican people will see it that way when they can take time away from \nthe Web sites trying to fill\n\n[[Page S8426]]\n\nout their new insurance policies to be able to pay enough attention to \nit.\n  What is the excuse for this extraordinarily disturbing action today? \nThey are the flimsiest of excuses, and I will take a few minutes to \noutline what those are.\n  The first allegation is that the Republican minority was using the \nfilibuster to keep President Obama's appointees from gaining their \nseats. Well, let's look at the history from the Congressional Research \nService. How many Supreme Court nominees have ever not been seated \nbecause of a failed cloture vote? That is a filibuster. The answer is \nzero in the history of the Senate--not just President Obama but the \nhistory of the Senate. Someone might point to the Abe Fortas case when \nPresident Johnson--I guess it was in the late 1960s--engineered a 45-\nto-43 cloture vote so, in Johnson's words, Abe Fortas could hold his \nhead up, but, in fact, the filibuster has never been used to deny a \nSupreme Court Justice his or her seat. How many Cabinet Members of \nPresident Obama have been denied their seat by a filibuster? Zero. This \nis the Congressional Research Service.\n  The majority leader said: Well, what about Secretary Hagel, the \ndistinguished Defense Secretary? He had to wait 34 days to be \nconfirmed. Why shouldn't he wait 34 days to be confirmed? He was \nconfirmed shortly after his name was reported. We had a perfectly \nadequate Secretary of Defense sitting in the office at the time--\nSecretary Panetta. I remember the Senator from Nevada standing over \nthere and asking: What if we are attacked and Secretary Hagel is not \nthere? Well, Secretary Panetta was there.\n  The number is zero.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that after the Senator concludes \nhis remarks, we hear from the Senator from Arkansas Mr. Pryor, and that \nI be recognized after Senator Pryor for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Certainly. And if the Senator from Oklahoma needs to \nspeak now, I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is not necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, my point is that the charge is that \nRepublicans had been denying President Obama his nominations by \nfilibuster. Not on the Supreme Court, not to his Cabinet, and no \ndistrict judges, I say to my colleagues.\n  How many in the history of the country have ever been denied their \nseats by a failed cloture vote, including President Obama? The answer \nis zero.\n  That is very interesting. So what is the reason for this? Well, let's \ngo on. Maybe it was some other nomination that caused such a problem \nthat would justify this dangerous restructuring of the Senate rules.\n  Let's go to the sub-Cabinet category. These are all the executive \nappointments below the Cabinet level. How many of those have been \ndenied? Under President Clinton, the Senate rejected two nominees of \nhis by a cloture vote. Under George W. Bush, it was three. Under \nPresident Obama, it has been two. So in the history of the Senate, the \ncloture vote has been used to deny seven Presidential nominees their \nseat, including two for President Obama.\n  Let's go to the one area where there has been a little bit more; that \nis, the circuit judges. Remember, on the Supreme Court, never; district \njudges, never; Cabinet member, never; but circuit judges, yes. There \nhave been 10 instances where Presidential nominees for the Federal \ncircuit courts of appeals have been denied their seats because of a \nfailed cloture vote--that is a filibuster--five Democrats, five \nRepublicans.\n  How did this happen? If in all of these other areas it never happens, \nwhy did it happen here? Because, as the Republican leader explained \nthis morning, Democrats got together in 2003--the year I came to the \nSenate--and said, for the first time in the history of the U.S. Senate, \nwe are going to use the filibuster to deny President George W. Bush 10 \nnominations to the circuit court because they are too conservative, not \nbecause they are not qualified. One was Miguel Estrada, one of the most \nhighly qualified nominees ever presented. One was Judge Pickering. One \nwas Judge Pryor, who used to be a law clerk to Judge Wisdom, as I once \nwas. I know the high respect Judge Wisdom had for him. The end result \nwas that we had this Gang of 14, and the Democrats ended up only \nstopping five of President Bush's judges, but that was the first time \nin the history of the Senate. To date, including the judges we are \ndiscussing now, the three on the DC Circuit Court, the total is five. \nSo that is it.\n  How can anyone say President Obama has not been treated fairly when, \nin fact, the answer is zero on the Supreme Court, zero on district \njudges, zero on Cabinet and two on sub-Cabinet, and the same on circuit \ncourts that President Bush had?\n  I asked the Senate Historian if President Obama's second term Cabinet \nnominees had been moved through the Senate more swiftly or slower than \nthose of his two predecessors, Bush and Clinton. The Senate Historian \ntold me it was about the same. So on that question, that is a fake \ncrisis.\n  The second allegation is that it takes too long for President Obama's \nnominees to come through the Senate. Well, we have something on our \ndesks called the Executive Calendar. Every Senator has this. There are \n44 Senators in their first term, and maybe some haven't had a chance to \nread it very carefully, but it has on it all of the names of everyone \nwho could possibly be confirmed.\n  The way Senate procedure works is a nominee comes out of a committee \nto the Executive Calendar. Let me state the obvious: All of the \ncommittees are controlled by the Democrats. So if we want to report \nsomeone for the National Labor Relations Board, it has to be approved \nby a majority of senators on the committee on which I serve. Democrats \nhave a majority of the seats on the Committee; so a nominee gets on \nthis calendar by a majority of Democratic votes.\n  So how long have the people on the calendar been waiting? Well, 54 of \nthem have been waiting only 3 weeks; in other words, they just got \nthere. Most of them aren't controversial. Usually they are approved on \na day such as this when we are wrapping up before we go home for a week \nor two, so half of them would probably be gone today. There are 16 who \nhave been on the calendar for up to 9 weeks. That is a very short \nperiod of time in the U.S. Senate for people to have a chance to do \ntheir other business and get to know the nominees. There are eight who \nhave been on the calendar more than 9 weeks. Of the eight, two are \nbeing held up by Democrats, and two more are Congressman Watt and Ms. \nMillett. That leaves four, and one of those is a newscaster who has \nbeen nominated to be a member of the board of the Morris K. Udall \nFoundation and who is being moved along with other people to that \nfoundation board.\n  In other words, it is not true that there are people being held up \nfor a long period of time because the only way a nominee can be \nconfirmed in the U.S. Senate is if the majority takes someone from this \nExecutive Calendar, moves their nomination--it doesn't have to go \nthrough any sort of other motion; he can do it on his own--and then we \nmove to consider that person.\n  Well, one might say: But someone can hold each up one of those. Yes, \nwe can, under the cloture procedure. But let's take an example. Let's \nsay Senator Reid, the distinguished majority leader, were to come, \nunder the old rules, to the floor and say: I believe Republicans are \nholding up 10 of our lower-level nominees in an obstructionist way. So \nlet's say he arrives on Monday and he files cloture. He moves to \nconfirm all 10 of those. He takes them off this calendar, he moves them \nto be confirmed, and he files cloture on each of the 10 on Monday. \nTuesday is what we call an intervening day. He can get the rest of them \nconfirmed, by bankers' hours, by Friday if he wants to because after he \nhas that intervening day, there could only be, because we changed the \nrules earlier this year, 8 hours of debate, and his side can yield back \ntheir 4 hours, and then we go to the next one and then the next one. So \nwe have 40 or 45 hours, and we have them all.\n  The majority leader, if he wished to, could confirm all of these \npeople very\n\n[[Page S8427]]\n\neasily unless 41 Republicans said no. But what we have already seen is \nthat almost never happens. In the history of the country, it has \nhappened twice to President Obama on his sub-Cabinet members, never on \na Cabinet member; and never on district judges.\n  So the majority leader had plenty of opportunity to have everybody \nconfirmed if he wanted to. This is why Senator Byrd, who was majority \nleader and minority leader, in his last speech to the Senate said: \nThere is no need to change the rules--and I am paraphrasing. I was at \nthe Rules Committee hearing when he spoke. He said: A majority leader \ncan use the rules that we have--that is, until today--to do whatever he \nwants to get done.\n  Then there is the last charge about the District of Columbia Circuit. \nThat was the other pretext for this. Somehow Republicans were doing \nsomething wrong by saying it is too soon to cut off debate on the \nPresident's three nominees for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\n  Republicans were doing--to the letter--exactly what Democrats did in \n2006 and 2007. They were saying that court is underworked, that other \ncourts are overworked, and we ought to move judges from where they are \nneeded least to where they are needed most before we put anymore judges \non the court.\n  This is the letter sent on July 27, 2006, by all the Democrats on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, including Senators Leahy, Schumer, \nFeingold, Kohl, Biden, Feinstein, Ted Kennedy. They said ``under no \ncircumstances'' should President Bush's Republican nominee be \nconsidered, much less confirmed, by this committee before we address \nthe very need for the judges on the committee.\n  All we in the Republican Party were saying is--Senator Grassley has \nhad his bill in since 2003; the Democrats said in 2006 we should not \nput anymore judges on the court until we look at where the judges are \nneeded--we are saying: Consider Senator Grassley's bill before you \nconfirm the judges.\n  So that is the excuse--the flimsiest of excuses. The idea that \nPresident Obama is not being treated at least as well as previous \nPresidents with his nominees is just not true. The filibuster has not \nbeen used to deny him nominees, except in two cases for sub-Cabinet \nmembers; and in the case of circuit judges, no more than with President \nBush.\n  The majority leader has not used the rules he had before him to \neasily confirm the people on the Executive Calendar. Those on the \nExecutive Calendar for the most part have only been there for a few \nweeks. So why then did the majority feel the need to take this \nextraordinary action?\n  That takes us back to where we started. This is, very simply, another \npartisan political power grab to permit the majority to do whatever it \nwants to any time it wants to do it.\n  The American people--millions of them--are filling out their \ninsurance forms. They are trying to make the Web site work. They are \nterrified by the fact that they may not have insurance by January 1. \nThat is totally the result of a partisan political power grab in the \nmiddle of the night 3 years ago that put ObamaCare into place. This is \nanother example of that. The only cure for that is a referendum next \nNovember.\n  I deeply regret the action the Democratic majority took today. It is \nthe most dangerous and the most consequential change in the rules of \nthe Senate since Thomas Jefferson wrote those rules at the founding of \nour country.\n  Madam President, I would refer my colleagues to the letter I had \nincluded in the Record yesterday, the letter from the Senate Democrats \nin 2006 arguing that the DC Circuit should have no more judges until we \nconsider the proper number and also a 1-page list of the total number \nof sub-Cabinet members who have ever been denied their seat by a failed \ncloture vote--and that number is seventeen in the history of the \nSenate; two under Clinton, three under Bush, and two under President \nObama--plus five Bush judges and five Obama judges.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I want to echo at least some of the \nsentiment that my distinguished colleague from Tennessee just \nmentioned--that I am disappointed in the use of the nuclear option. I \nopposed that. I think it could do permanent damage to this institution \nand could have some very negative ramifications for our country and for \nthe American people.\n  I do not want to be an alarmist about it, but I do have concerns. I \nam very disappointed that it got to this point, and I want to talk \nabout that in a moment. But before I do, I would like to say, if you \nstep back, the Senate was designed to be a place for debate. It is \nwhere Members--the way it was designed, the way the rules were \nstructured, the size of it, the history of it--the Members can reach \nacross the aisle and find solutions.\n  That is what this country needs right now. We need solutions. We need \npeople who are willing to work together to get things done. Part of \nthat is to allow the minority to speak, even if it is a minority of \none. We need to protect that right, and we need to protect every \nSenator's right to debate and to amend legislation. I think no one here \nwith a straight face would say there have not been abuses from time to \ntime. We know that. There have been, and I have seen a lot since I have \nbeen here.\n  But also, if you step back and look at the Senate, it is the only \nplace in our government where the American people can actually see law \nbeing made. With all due respect to our colleagues in the House, you do \nnot see law being made there. They come out of their Rules Committee \nand it is all pretty much set up, and right now at least they kind of \ntend to vote party line, party line, party line--done. You do not see \nlaw being made at the White House. When they are doing things such as \nexecutive orders, all you know is you kind of get the press release or \nyou see an announcement in the Rose Garden, and that is it. You do not \nsee law even being made in the courts. A lot of law in this country is \nmade by the courts. For example, across the street at the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, what you have is they hear the arguments, and they all go back \nin chambers. You do not really know what they talk about, you do not \nreally know how that is working, and then they come out with their \ndecision--and in some cases decisions because a lot of times there is a \ndissent.\n  But the Senate is unique in that way. We are the only place in our \ngovernment where you can actually see the law being made. It is also, \nin that same sense, the only place where the minority is guaranteed a \nvoice. They sometimes get outvoted, but they are guaranteed at least to \nbe heard. I think that is important.\n  So again, I share the disappointment of many of my colleagues today \nin how this happened.\n  The Senate rules I have worked with for 11 years now. They can be \narcane and frustrating. But the way it is designed is it allows people \nto fight for their State's interests or their ideological beliefs, \nwhatever it happens to be, and the sense is everybody is fighting for \nwhat is best for the country. We may disagree with what is best, and \nthat is why we should have votes eventually on these matters. But it \nallows people to fight for what they think is right, best for their \nState, best for the country, best for the world--whatever the issue \nhappens to be.\n  Since I have been here, what I have tried to do consistently is to \nfight to maintain the integrity of this institution. Since I have been \nhere, there have been numerous times--and I have been part of \nbipartisan groups. Probably the most high profile one was the Gang of \n14 back in 2005, where we worked out some judicial nominations. But \nnonetheless I was a part of that; just recently, the Levin-McCain group \nthat helped to change the rules, as the Senator from Tennessee talked \nabout.\n  What that is all about is working with Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle to reach commonsense solutions--not just to protect the \nrights of the minority but also to improve the legislative process, to \nmake sure this place works as it is designed. So certainly that is what \nI try to do every single day when I come here. I do understand that if \nyou are going to get anything done in Washington, anything done in this \nSenate, you are going to have to work together to do it. It is like in \nthe Book of Isaiah. It says: ``Come now, let us reason together.'' I \nthink that is the\n\n[[Page S8428]]\n\none verse in the whole Bible that sort of sums up the Senate: Come and \nlet us reason together. The Senate should always be the place for that.\n\n  Let me make two last points on this nuclear option. The first is that \nI would encourage the American citizens to be very careful in looking \nat statistics. They are difficult to use. They can be very misleading \nbecause almost always these statistics lack context. I hear the talking \nheads. I hear folks on talk radio. I have even seen a few people right \nhere in this Chamber use these extensively, and very often there is no \ncontext. Sometimes, for example--if you just look at cloture motions--\nyou can actually have a filibuster without filing a cloture motion, and \nyou can have a cloture motion without there actually being a \nfilibuster. So, again, that will skew the numbers.\n  The bottom line is, there is plenty of blame to go around--plenty of \nblame. If one person says it is all the other side's fault, they are \nnot being truthful. There is plenty of blame to go around. On this both \nparties are at fault. I will give you one example. It was not too long \nago that I heard people come down here and say the DC Circuit's \nworkload was such that they needed more judges. Well, guess what. Now I \nhave heard those very same people say that the DC workload is so light \nthey do not need any more judges. The shoe is on the other foot. \nDemocrats back in the day said the DC Circuit had a light workload and \ndid not need any more judges. Now Democrats are saying it does need \nmore judges.\n  We need to stop the games and get back to work. I think there is one \nway to fix this, and that is by following the Golden Rule. I think if \nwe take those words of Jesus literally and apply those to what we do \nhere in the Senate--``Do unto others as you would have them do unto \nyou''--and really mean that and really apply that--to do unto others as \nyou would have them do unto you--I think all these problems would go \naway.\n  It is about respecting one another. It is about working with one \nanother. It is about respecting elections in other States, and national \nelections. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you and all \nthis would go away. Also, a little dose of forgive one another would \nalso help.\n\n\n                             Appropriations\n\n  Madam President, let me also spend a couple minutes here thanking \nChairwoman Mikulski. She has a tough job as chairwoman of the \nAppropriations Committee, and she is an example of someone who is \ndetermined to work together to get work done, trying to get the \nappropriations process back on track. No doubt it has been sidetracked \nthis year and in recent years. This year we have seen what I would term \nan irresponsible feud, especially down on the House side, blowing up \nthe farm bill, pushing for shutting down the government, trying to get \nus in a bad place on the debt ceiling.\n  I am not trying to do the blame game, but I know that Chairwoman \nMikulski is fighting very hard to put an end to that. We need to get \nback to our No. 1 priority. That should be growing our economy and \ncreating jobs. There are lots of ways we can do that, but one is \nthrough the appropriations process, by investing in infrastructure. We \ncan make responsible, targeted investments in our future with the right \nkind of spending on infrastructure, whether it is roadways or airports \nor schools or centers for innovation--whatever it happens to be. There \nare lots of smart ways to do that.\n  The history of this country shows it is a winning strategy when we \nwork together and make the right kind of investments in our future. \nArkansas is a good example. We have a number of items we could talk \nabout today where Federal spending has made a real difference in our \nState. One of those is called the Bayou Meto water project. It started \nback in 1923. It has been the subject of a lot of fights, and I have \nsome scars to show that I have been part of some of those fights. But \nthey are making great progress there. Not only is it good for thousands \nand thousands of farmers, but it is also great for drinking water and \nfor flood control, and there are 55,000 acres of fish and wildlife \nhabitat that are being protected through this project. So it is a win-\nwin for everybody.\n  Arkansas airports would be another example. You may not think of \nArkansas as an aviation State or an aviation powerhouse, but we have \n29,000 jobs that are tied to commercial and general aviation. It is \n$2.5 billion in our economy. Again, that investment in infrastructure \nis what makes that possible.\n  We also have the National Center for Toxicological Research down near \nPine Bluff, AR--cutting-edge research, lots of effort on \nnanotechnology.\n  We have a great technology park in Fayetteville. They are trying to \nbuild one in Little Rock. All of these--and the focus on STEM, et \ncetera--all of these help create jobs and grow our economy.\n  Congress needs to focus on that. I am not saying it is going to be \neasy, but we need to work together. We need to pass a budget. We need \nto move our appropriations bills through the process. And we just need \nto, bottom line, get back on track. The way to move our economy forward \nis by really putting the interests of our country first and not these \npartisan and sometimes petty disputes, ideological disputes. We need to \nthink about what is best long term for the country. Again, I think the \nappropriations process is the way to do that.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8428-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8428-S8431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, it is my understanding we may have a \nvote this afternoon. I have often said the most important bill we pass \nevery year--and we have passed every year for the last 52 years--is the \nNational Defense Authorization Act.\n  I would like to say this about the process we have gone through. I do \nnot recall ever having worked with a chairman when I have been in the \nminority who has been so easy to work with as Chairman Levin has been \non this Defense bill. It is one we all understand we have to do. It has \nto be a reality. A lot of what we do around here we can wait a month \nand do it. But on this we cannot, because right now we have men and \nwomen in the field. We have their paychecks. We have things that have \nto happen to keep this going as it has in the last few years.\n  Maintenance and modernization are right now. If we were not able to \npass this now, our research and development would no longer be able to \nbe there in time to take care of the immediate needs we have.\n  I am very upset about what has happened to our defense system. Under \nthis administration, we have lost $487 billion in Defense--coming out \nof the hide of Defense. In addition, we are now looking at the \nsequester. I will only say this, perhaps for the last time: Why should \nour defense system, which is only accountable for 18 percent of the \nbudget, be responsible for 50 percent of the cuts? It is because this \nadministration is determined that is what is going to happen to the \nmilitary.\n  So now we have people such as General Odierno, Commanding General of \nthe U.S. Army, who said:\n\n       . . . lowest readiness levels I have seen within our Army \n     since I have been serving for the last 37 years. Only two \n     brigades are ready for combat.\n\n  Admiral Greenert, the CNO of the Navy:\n\n       . . . because of the fiscal limitations and the situation \n     we are in, we do not have another strike group trained and \n     ready to respond on short notice in case of contingency. We \n     are tapped out.\n\n  Admiral Winnefeld is the No. 2 guy in the military system. He is the \nVice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He said:\n\n       There could be, for the first time in my career, instances \n     where we may be asked to respond to a crisis and we have to \n     say we cannot.\n\n  I have given a lot of talks on the floor about how serious things are \nright now.\n  Put the readiness chart up there.\n  I would only comment to this. A lot of people think there is an \neasier answer for this, and that we can, through efficiencies in the \nPentagon, take care of these problems. A lot of work needs to be done. \nMy junior Senator certainly is going to be concentrating on that, on \nthe efficiencies. However, if all\n\n[[Page S8429]]\n\nof the efficiencies were granted, that is only the blue line on this \nchart. This chart talks about sequestration, if nothing changes, what \nis going to happen to our military. We have that.\n  The next one up there, the next larger, is force structure. We are \ntalking about how many brigades, how many boots on the ground, how many \nships, what it is going to look like.\n  The next one up there is modernization. Modernization is a very small \nline. Here is the big one over here. That is our ability to fight a \nwar. That is our readiness.\n  If you look down here at the bottom at fiscal years 2014 and 2015, \nyou can see all of that is going to be gutted in the first 2 years if \nwe do not make a change in it. I tried to do that. I have an amendment. \nI still have an amendment that is out there that could correct that \nsituation. I think it is important for people to understand that the \nreadiness is going to be hurt more. This is after $487 billion has been \ncut from our defense system.\n  General Amos, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, who testified under \noath, said:\n\n       We will have fewer forces arriving, less-trained, arriving \n     late in the fight. This would delay the buildup of combat \n     power, allow the enemy more time to build its defenses, and \n     would likely prolong combat operations. Altogether, this is a \n     formula for American casualties.\n\n  It gets back to that orange line up there. The orange line is when \nyou do that, you have to accept a greater risk. That means American \nlives. I have already given that speech.\n  Right now we are getting close to the time when we are going to be \nactually casting a vote. I think I have kind of good news. Hopefully it \nis good news. I made a statement yesterday that the problem the \nRepublicans have is they have not been able to get amendments in. We \nhave gone through this in years past, and always something has broken \nloose where we are able to have amendments. Well, up until yesterday, \nthe Republicans had 81 amendments that we wanted to be considered. \nFrankly, that is not all that uncontrollable. That could have been \ndone. We could have still gotten through that this week. But as it is \nright now--the good news is, I said yesterday on the floor that I was \ngoing to come in and try to work all night long, and the staff has done \nthis, to come up with 25 amendments and say: If we, the Republicans, \ncan have 25 amendments to be considered, they can be voted down, but \njust to be considered on the floor, that we would be receptive to \nhaving the results.\n  Here is the interesting thing about it. We have heard a lot of people \ntalking about, well, why is it all of a sudden this has to be done in 5 \ndays? Yet we have been sitting around here for 3 months when we could \nhave been considering it.\n  I would like to suggest, if you look at this, this is every year how \nmany days it has taken for consideration. It is always more than what \nwe have for the rest of this week. I only say that, because in spite of \nthat, we still have a way of doing it.\n  For those who might think that the recorded votes we are requesting--\nit is not going to be that many votes. We are asking for 25 on the \nRepublican side. Democrats have 25. That is 50. But if you look at \nyears past--for example, last year we had total amendments offered of \n106, but only 34 were voice voted, only 8 required a recorded vote.\n  I can go back to all of the rest of the years that are on this chart. \nBut the bottom line is this: What I am asking for today is 25 for the \nRepublicans, 25 for the Democrats. Of those, not more than 15 to 20 \nwould require votes. We could do that in 1 day. So it can be done. We \ncould finish this and still give Republicans the opportunity to have \ntheir votes.\n  What I have here is a list of the 25 amendments we are asking for. \nAgain, I am not even for all 25 of them, but they should all be \nconsidered one way or another. This probably would end up requiring \nmaybe at the most 10 votes. So I am offering these amendments and \ntelling the majority--by the way, I have already talked about what a \ngreat relationship I have had during this consideration as the ranking \nmember of Armed Services with the chairman Carl Levin. So I am offering \nto Carl Levin and to the Democrats, the majority in the Senate and the \nmajority on the committee, these 25 amendments. All we are asking for \nis for those 25 to be considered. We can do this bill right, the way we \nhave done it for 52 years. We can have a bill. We can have it by the \nend of this week. So I am offering that.\n  I also announced yesterday that in the event I can come up with a \ntotal number of 25 that our caucus would agree with, that if we could \ndo that and we were refused, when the time comes I will vote against \ngoing to the bill. Now I think that very likely could happen this \nafternoon. However, if they accept them, I am committing right here on \nthe floor that I will be in full support and I will vote for it. I want \npeople to understand, in the unlikely event that the majority does not \naccept these--the consideration of these 25 votes, I will be voting \nagainst cloture on the bill when that vote comes up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. WARREN). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am not on the Armed Services Committee, \nalthough I was 38 years ago. But I would think that if there are any \ntwo people in this body who could work out a program to get the votes \nset up and voted on it is the distinguished senior Senator from \nMichigan and the distinguished senior Senator from Oklahoma. I would \nhope and encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to listen \nto the Democratic and Republican leaders of this Committee, because I \nthink they can probably work it out.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about the major rules change that \noccurred here today. In my capacity as President pro tempore, I was \npresiding during that time and did not get a chance to speak. I want to \nsay a few things.\n  In the four decades I have served here, I have been here with both \nDemocratic majorities and Republican majorities, through both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations. We have had moments of \ncrisis when I worried that our political differences outweighed the \nSenate's common responsibility. Yet we were always able to steer our \nway out of trouble. Majorities of both parties have come and gone, but \nI have never lost faith in our ability to see ourselves through the \ndivisions and come together to do what is best for the Nation.\n  I have always believed in the Senate's unique protection of the \nminority party, even when Democrats held a majority in the Senate. When \nthe minority has stood in the way of progress, I have defended their \nrights and held to my belief that the best traditions of the Senate \nwould win out, that the 100 of us who stand in the shoes of over 310 \nmillion Americans would do the right thing. That is why I have always \nlooked skeptically at efforts to change the Senate rules.\n  But in the past 5 years it has been discouraging. Ever since \nPresident Obama was elected, Senate Republicans have changed the \ntradition of the Senate, with escalating obstruction of nominations. \nThey crossed the line from the use of the Senate rules to abuse of the \nSenate rules. In fact, the same abuse recently, and needlessly, shut \ndown our government at a cost of billions of dollars to the taxpayers \nand billions of dollars to the private sector. I think it is a real \nthreat to the independent, judicial branch of government.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I am worried that the \nRepublican obstruction is damaging our ability to fulfill the Senate's \nunique constitutional responsibility of advice and consent to ensure \nthat the judicial branch has the judges it needs to do its job.\n  Republicans have used these unprecedented filibusters--and they are \nunprecedented--more than at any time that I have served here. They have \nobstructed President Obama from appointing to the Federal bench even \nnominations that were supported by Republican Senators from the State \nfrom where the nominee came. They have forced cloture to end \nfilibusters on 34 nominees, far more than we ever saw during President \nBush's 8 years in office. Almost all of these nominees were, by any \nstandard, noncontroversial and ultimately were confirmed \noverwhelmingly. In fact, Republican\n\n[[Page S8430]]\n\nobstruction has left the Federal judiciary with 90 or more vacancies \nduring the past 5 years.\n  Take for example the Republican filibuster of a judicial nominee to \nthe Tenth Circuit, Robert Bacharach last year, despite the support of \nthe Republican Senators from Oklahoma. This marked a new and damaging \nmilestone. Never before had the Senate filibustered and refused to vote \non a judicial nominee with such strong bipartisan support, and who was \nvoted out of the Judiciary Committee with virtually unanimous support. \nRepublicans continued to block Senate action on the Bacharach \nnomination through the end of last Congress and forced his nomination \nto be returned without action to the President. There is no good \nreason--none--why Robert Bacharach was not confirmed to serve the \npeople of Oklahoma and the Tenth Circuit as a Federal judge last year. \nHe was finally confirmed this year unanimously.\n  Republicans last year also filibustered William Kayatta, another \nconsensus circuit nominee who had the support of both Republican home \nState Senators. Like Judge Bacharach, Mr. Kayatta received the ABA \nStanding Committee on the Federal judiciary's highest possible rating \nand had strong bipartisan support and unimpeachable credentials. The \nsame also applies to Richard Taranto, whose nomination was returned to \nthe President at the end of last year after Republicans blocked action \non his nomination to a vacancy on the Federal Circuit for more than \neight months, despite no opposition in the Senate and despite the \nsupport of both Paul Clement and the late Robert Bork. Neither of these \nnominees faced any real opposition. Yet Republicans stalled both of \nthem through the end of last Congress and forced their nomination to be \nreturned without action to the President. They were both confirmed this \nyear with overwhelming bipartisan support.\n  Senate Republicans used to insist that the filibustering of judicial \nnominations was unconstitutional. The Constitution has not changed, but \nas soon as President Obama took office Republicans reversed course. It \nstruck me, because the very first--the very first--nominee to the \nFederal bench that President Obama sent here was filibustered. Judge \nHamilton of Indiana was a widely-respected 15-year veteran of the \nFederal bench nominated to the Seventh Circuit. President Obama reached \nout to the longest-serving Republican in the Senate, Senator Dick \nLugar, to select a nominee he supported. Yet, Senate Republicans \nfilibustered his nomination, requiring a cloture vote before his \nnomination could be confirmed after a delay of seven months.\n  It is almost a case of saying: Okay, Mr. President, you think you got \nelected? We are going to show you who is boss. We are going to treat \nyou differently than all of the Presidents before you.\n  This has never been done before, to filibuster the President's very \nfirst nominee. Somehow this President is going to be told he is \ndifferent than other Presidents.\n  Senate Republicans have obstructed and delayed nearly every circuit \ncourt nominee of this President, filibustering 14 of them. They abused \nthe Senate's practices and procedures to delay confirmation of Judge \nAlbert Diaz of North Carolina to the Fourth Circuit for 11 months, \nbefore he was confirmed by voice vote. They delayed confirmation of \nJudge Jane Stranch of Tennessee to the Sixth Circuit for 10 months \nbefore she was confirmed 71 to 21. Senate Republicans used procedural \ntactics to delay for months the Senate confirmation of nominations with \nthe strong support of Republican home State Senators--including Judge \nScott Matheson of Utah to the Tenth Circuit; Judge James Wynn, Jr. of \nNorth Carolina to the Fourth Circuit; Judge Henry Floyd of South \nCarolina to the Fourth Circuit; Judge Adalberto Jordan of Florida to \nthe Eleventh Circuit; Judge Beverly Martin of Georgia to the Eleventh \nCircuit; Judge Mary Murguia of Arizona to the Ninth Circuit; Judge \nBernice Donald of Tennessee to the Sixth Circuit; Judge Thomas Vanaskie \nof Pennsylvania to the Third Circuit; Judge Andrew Hurwitz of Arizona \nto the Ninth Circuit; Judge Morgan Christen of Alaska to the Ninth \nCircuit; and Judge Stephen Higginson of Louisiana to the Fifth Circuit.\n  The results are clear and devastating. The nonpartisan Congressional \nResearch Service has reported that the median time circuit nominees had \nto wait before a Senate vote has skyrocketed from 18 days for President \nBush's nominees during his first term in office to 132 days for \nPresident Obama's nominees during his first term in office. This is the \nresult of Republican obstruction and abuse of Senate rules. In most \ncases, Senate Republicans have delayed and stalled without explanation. \nHow do you explain the filibuster of the nomination of Judge Barbara \nKeenan of Virginia to the Fourth Circuit who was ultimately confirmed \n99 to 0? And how else do you explain the needless obstruction of Judge \nDenny Chin of New York to the Second Circuit, who was filibustered for \nfour months before he was confirmed 98 to 0?\n  In 2012, Senate Republicans refused to consent to a vote on a single \ncircuit court nominee until the majority leader filed cloture, even for \nnominees with home State Republican support like Adalberto Jordan of \nFlorida--strongly supported by Senator Rubio--and Andrew Hurwitz of \nArizona, strongly supported by Senator Kyl. They blocked the Senate \nfrom voting on a single circuit court nominee nominated by President \nObama last year. Since 1980, the only other Presidential election year \nin which there were no circuit nominees confirmed who was nominated \nthat same year was in 1996, when Senate Republicans shut down the \nprocess against President Clinton's circuit nominees.\n  In the 8 years George W. Bush served as President, only five of his \ndistrict court nominees received any opposition on the floor. That was \nover 8 years. In just 5 years, 42 of President Obama's district court \nnominees have faced opposition. The majority leader had to file cloture \non 20 of them. Federal district court judges are the trial court judges \nwho hear cases from litigants across the country and preside over \nFederal criminal trials, applying the law to facts and helping settle \nlegal disputes. They handle the vast majority of the caseload of the \nFederal courts and are critical to making sure our courts remain \navailable to provide a fair hearing for all Americans. Nominations to \nfill these critical positions, whether made by a Democratic or \nRepublican President, have always been considered with deference to the \nhome State Senators who know the nominees and their States best, and \nhave been confirmed quickly with that support. Never before in the \nSenate's history have we seen district court nominees blocked for \nmonths and opposed for no good reason. Many are needlessly stalled and \nthen confirmed virtually unanimously with no explanation for the \nobstruction. Senate Republicans have politicized even these \ntraditionally non-partisan positions.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee I have always acted fairly and \nconsistently whether the President has been a Democrat or a Republican. \nI have not filibustered nominees with bipartisan support. I have \nsteadfastly protected the rights of the minority and I have done so \ndespite criticism from Democrats. I have only proceeded with judicial \nnominations supported by both home State Senators. I will put my record \nof consistent fairness up against that of any chairman and never acted \nas some Republican chairmen have acted in blatantly disregarding \nevenhanded practices to ram through the ideological nominations of \nPresident George W. Bush.\n  Regrettably, the answer to my fairness and to my commitment to \nprotecting the rights of the minority has been unprecedented and \nmeritless obstruction. Even though President Obama has nominated \nqualified, mainstream lawyers, Republicans in the Senate have done away \nwith regular order, imposing unnecessary and damaging delays. Until \n2009, judicial nominees reported by the Judiciary Committee with \nbipartisan support were generally confirmed quickly. That has changed, \nwith district nominations taking over four times longer and circuit \ncourt nominees over seven times longer than it took to confirm them \nduring the Bush administration. Until 2009, we observed regular order \nand usually confirmed four to six nominees per week, and we cleared the \nSenate Executive Calendar before long recesses. Since then, Senate \nRepublicans have refused to clear the calendar and slowed us down to a \nsnail's pace. Until 2009, if a nominee was filibustered, it\n\n[[Page S8431]]\n\nwas almost always because of a substantive issue with the nominee's \nrecord. We know what has happened since 2009--Republicans have required \ncloture to consider even those nominees later confirmed unanimously.\n  This obstruction was not merely a product of extreme partisanship in \na Presidential election year--it has been a constant and across the \nboard practice since President Obama took office. At the end of each \ncalendar year, Senate Republicans have deliberately refused to vote on \nseveral judicial nominees just to take up more time the following year. \nAt the end of 2009 Republicans denied 10 nominations pending on the \nExecutive Calendar a vote. The following year, it took 9 months for the \nSenate to take action on 8 of them. At the end of 2010 and 2011, Senate \nRepublicans left 19 nominations on the Senate Executive Calendar, \ntaking up nearly half the following year for the Senate to confirm \nthem. Last year they blocked 11 judicial nominees from votes, and \nrefused to expedite consideration of others who already had hearings.\n  The effects of this obstruction have been clear. When the Senate \nadjourned last year, Senate Republicans had blocked more than 40 of \nPresident Obama's circuit and district nominees from being confirmed in \nhis first term. That obstruction has led to a damagingly high level of \njudicial vacancies persisting for over four years.\n  This year, Senate Republicans reached a new depth of pure \npartisanship. They have decided to shut down the confirmation process \naltogether for an entire court--the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC \nCircuit, even though there are three vacancies on that court. Senate \nRepublicans attempt to justify their opposition to filling any of the \nthree vacancies on the DC Circuit with an argument that the court's \ncaseload does not warrant the appointments.\n  We all know that this ploy is a transparent attempt to prevent a \nDemocratic President from appointing judges to this important court. We \nall know what has happened here in the DC Circuit. In 2003, the Senate \nunanimously confirmed John Roberts by voice vote as the 9th judge on \nthe DC Circuit at a time when the caseload was lower than it is today. \nHe was confirmed unanimously. No Democrat, no Republican opposed him. \nNot a single Senate Republican raised any concerns about whether the \ncaseload warranted his confirmation and during the Bush administration \nthey voted to confirm four judges to the DC Circuit--giving the court a \ntotal of 11 judges in active service.\n  Today there are only eight judges on the court; yet, when Patricia \nMillett was nominated to that exact same seat by President Obama, a \nwoman with just as strong qualifications as John Roberts--they both had \ngreat qualifications--she was filibustered. Some say we should not call \nthat a double standard. Well, I am not sure what else one might call \nit. We also should not be comparing the DC Circuit's caseload with that \nof other circuits, as Republicans have recently done. The DC Circuit is \noften understood to be the second most important court in the land \nbecause of the complex administrative law cases that it handles. The \ncourt reviews complicated decisions and rulemakings of many Federal \nagencies, and in recent years has handled some of the most important \nterrorism and enemy combatant and detention cases since the attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001. Comparing the DC Circuit's caseload to other \ncircuits is a false comparison, and those who are attempting to make \nthis comparison are not being fully forthcoming with the American \npublic. Years ago, one of the senior most Republican Senators on the \nJudiciary Committee said this:\n\n       [C]omparing workloads in the DC Circuit to that of other \n     circuits is, to a large extent, a pointless exercise. There \n     is little dispute that the DC Circuit's docket is, by far, \n     the most complex and time consuming in the Nation.\n\n  Now, however, that same Senator has engaged in the precise pointless \nexercise he once railed against.\n  This is an unprecedented level of obstruction. I have seen \nsubstantive arguments mounted against judicial nominees, but I have \nnever seen a full blockade against every single nominee to a particular \ncourt, regardless of the individual's qualifications. Republicans \nattempted to take this type of hardline stance with certain executive \npositions last year and earlier this year, when they refused to allow a \nvote for any nominee to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and \nthe National Labor Relations Board. Rather than representing \nsubstantive opposition to these individual nominees, this obstruction \nwas a partisan attempt to sabotage and eviscerate these agencies which \nprotect consumers and American workers. I have heard some call this \ntactic ``nullification.'' It is as if the Republicans have decided that \nthe President did not actually win the election in 2008, and was not \nre-elected in 2012.\n  Senate Republicans backed off this radical and unprecedented hardline \nstance on executive nominees earlier this year, but they have shown no \nsigns of doing the same with the DC Circuit. And it is not for lack of \nqualified nominees. This year, Senate Republicans filibustered the \nnominations of three exceptionally qualified women: Caitlin Halligan, \nPatricia Millett and Nina Pillard. Earlier this week Republicans \nfilibustered another stellar nominee to this court, Judge Robert \nWilkins.\n  I am a lawyer. I have tried cases in Federal courts. I have argued \ncases in Federal courts of appeal. I always went into those courts \nknowing I could look at that Federal judge and say: It doesn't make any \ndifference whether I am a Democrat or a Republican, whether I represent \nthe plaintiff or the defendant; this is an impartial court.\n  If we play political games with our Federal judiciary, how long are \nthe American people going to trust the impartiality of our Federal \ncourts? At what point do these games start making people think maybe \nthis is not an independent judiciary? If that day comes, the United \nStates will have given up one of its greatest strengths.\n  Let's go back to voting on judges based on their merit--and not on \nwhether they were nominated by a Democratic President or a Republican \nPresident. Let's stop holding President Obama to a different standard \nthan any President before him--certainly no President since I have been \nin the Senate, and I began with President Gerald Ford.\n  This obstruction is not just bad for the Senate, it is also a \ndisaster for our Nation's overburdened courts. Persistent vacancies \nforce fewer judges to take on growing caseloads, and make it harder for \nAmericans to have access to justice. While they have delayed and \nobstructed, the number of judicial vacancies has remained historically \nhigh and it has become more difficult for our courts to provide speedy, \nquality justice for the American people. In short, as a result of \nRepublican obstruction of nominees, the Senate has failed to do its job \nfor the courts and for the American people, and failed to live up to \nits constitutional responsibilities. That is why the Senate today was \nfaced with what to do to overcome this abuse and what action to take to \nrestore this body's ability to fulfill its constitutional duties and do \nits work for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8431-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8431-S8437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY\n\n  Seeing the distinguished Presiding Officer who is not only a New \nEnglander, but in this case from Massachusetts, let me just speak \npersonally for a moment on a very, very sad day.\n  Tomorrow will be November 22. And ever since I was a law student, \nNovember 22 has always brought a feeling of dread to me. Tomorrow will \nbe 50 years since President Kennedy was murdered.\n  My wife Marcelle and I were living in Washington at that time. She \nwas a young nurse, a registered nurse, working at the VA hospital on \nWisconsin Avenue, a site that is now occupied by the Russian Embassy. \nShe was helping to put this equally impoverished law student through \nGeorgetown Law School. We had been there in this basement apartment, \nfirst during the Cuban missile crisis. And like everybody, we held our \nbreath in this city, wondering if this new, young President, John F. \nKennedy, could get us through this crisis without plunging the world \ninto nuclear war. I was excited--we both were--to be in the same city.\n  My family has always been Democratic. Back in Vermont, the joke was: \n``That's the street where the Democrats live.'' There were so few of \nthem\n\n[[Page S8432]]\n\nin Vermont. But with an Irish-Catholic father and an Italian-Catholic \nmother, we had seen John Kennedy win--and in my State, amid something \nthat doesn't exist anymore--an anti-Catholic attitude.\n  President Kennedy stood up to those people, some in the Joint Chiefs, \nwho said they had so much more experience and we ought to go ahead and \nwe had nuclear superiority over the then-Soviet Union; let's attack \nthem, let's have a preemptive strike. And, Madam President, anybody who \nstudies history knows what would have happened: Half the world would \nhave been destroyed. Through patience and diplomacy, we got out of the \nsituation.\n  And so we watched a young President go step by step, not always \naccomplishing everything he wanted, but always inspiring young people. \nI remember standing on Pennsylvania Avenue and seeing an open car go by \nwith him. He had greeted an emperor, and their procession drove down \nPennsylvania Avenue with people cheering. This was only months before \nhe died. I was closer to him than I am to the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer.\n  I remember, as an honor student, our class was invited to the White \nHouse with other students. Standing there with other students, I \nremember being struck by how red his hair was and how young he was. He \ntalked with all of us.\n  Then I remember--as though it were yesterday, 50 years ago tomorrow--\nI was standing in the library of Georgetown University Law School. One \nof my classmates, who was not a fan of President Kennedy, came in and \nsaid: The President has been shot. I told him there was nothing funny \nabout saying something like that. Then I saw the shocked look on his \nface and realized he was telling the truth.\n  We didn't have a car and we used to take buses to school from where \nwe lived in the Glover Park area. I knew that Marcelle had been working \nall night and was probably home after getting off of her shift in the \nwee hours of the morning, and was home sleeping. I went running out, \ngrabbed a cab to go home to tell her what happened.\n  I think I got the only cab in Washington, DC, that did not have a \nradio. The cab driver didn't know what was going on. I just said: Let's \ngo. We drove on K Street. A number of the stockbrokers were there. I \nremembered past times when I went by that exact spot and saw ticker \ntapes projected on the wall with the numbers going by, with the stock \nmarket's activities. They were blank, even though the stock market \nshould have been open at that time. It was stopped.\n  I saw a relative of Mrs. Kennedy's going to work--being chauffeured \nin a Rolls-Royce. As one can imagine, as a young law student on an un-\nair-conditioned bus, I looked at him with envy. I saw him running out \nfrantically trying to grab a cab. It was very obvious something was \nwrong.\n  I got home, banged on the door and woke up Marcelle. I turned on the \nTV set and told her he had been shot.\n  She said: Who?\n  I said: The President.\n  We saw Walter Cronkite--which is something we keep seeing over and \nover, and have for 50 years--announcing the President was shot, and was \ndead.\n  We prayed for him, his family, for our Nation. Phones were just \nseizing up in Washington, but we talked with our family back in \nVermont.\n  We knew they were going to leave the White House to bring the \nPresident's body, so we decided to go watch the funeral procession. We \nwaited on the curb a few yards from the route on Pennsylvania Avenue. \nWe were expecting our first child--he was born in January following \nthis--but we thought, even so, we should go down, and we took the bus \ndown and we stood across from the National Gallery of Art, what's now \nthe west wing of the National Gallery of Art. There were several lanes \nof rows of people along the street--and it was so quiet, Madam \nPresident--so quiet--that even though the roads were blocked, the \nstreet lights were going, as they changed from red to green to yellow--\nwe could hear the ``click'' five lanes from the road. We could hear the \nclick of the street lights changing; it was that quiet.\n  Then we heard the drums. We heard the cortege leaving the White \nHouse. This was back before we had cell phones and everything else you \ncould follow. Everybody on the street turned toward the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue, even though we could not yet see them. But we \ncould hear them, it was that quiet.\n  And then cars came by the cortege: A riderless horse, a very skittish \nhorse. You could hear its horseshoes clicking back and forth, as it \nwould pull back and forth against the reigns, held by the man leading \nit, the boots turned backwards in the empty stirrups.\n  I saw Robert Kennedy go by in a car. In fact I took a photograph of \nhim--with his head bowed, his chin on his hand.\n  It was so sad. It all went by. As the casket passed by, people \nsaluted, held their hands over their hearts, and cried. Again, Madam \nPresident, it's like it was yesterday.\n  We watched the funeral from home. Mrs. Kennedy had decided that all \nof the world leaders who had come would march together from the White \nHouse to St. Matthew's where the President's funeral would be held.\n  I remember there had been a discussion of the protocol for having \nPresidents, Prime Ministers, and Emperors present. Mrs. Kennedy made \nthe brilliant decision to assign the countries alphabetically in \nEnglish. Haile Selassie, of Ethiopia, resplendent in his uniform, with \nbraids and everything else, walked next to Charles de Gaulle, who, like \nmyself, is well over six-feet tall, with a very plain uniform without \ndecorations. Nobody thought anything unusual about it. It was all so \nrespectful. Because there were so many heads of state, virtually every \npolice officer in the city was downtown in that area. Yet, there wasn't \na crime reported in DC at that time. Everybody was glued to their TV \nset.\n  The funeral scenes included young John Kennedy Jr., saluting his \nfather's coffin as it went by. We watched the burial at Arlington \nCemetery--we lived only a couple miles from there--and we saw the first \njets--the fighter jets--flying over. We rushed outside just in time to \nsee what we all know as ``missing man formation,'' when the jets are in \nformation, and one peels off. We saw that, and then we saw Air Force \nOne fly over, just having dipped its wing in tribute. It was a very \nlarge plane at that time--blue, white, and silver--the same plane that \nbrought the President's body back a few days before, from Dallas. It \nwas coming out of its salute.\n  Throughout that time, everywhere we went we saw a silent and stunned \ncity--both those who supported President Kennedy and those who had not. \nEverybody knew what a blow this was to our country. In fact, I did not \nagain see that kind of shock and silence in Washington, DC until I \nwalked from my office on 9/11, here on Capitol Hill, and saw the same \nthing after that attack on us.\n  For something like this, most people set aside their political \nbackgrounds.\n  I remember so many of us stood here on that March day when President \nReagan was shot. We all joined hands, Democrats and Republicans, and \nprayed for his safety and for the country. It is awful to have to have \na situation like that, a situation such as that, to bring people \ntogether, but we should think about the country first and foremost in \nthese things.\n  We look at those in succession to the Presidency; we worry about what \nmight happen to the President. No one ever wants anything to happen to \nany President, Republican or Democrat. We don't want these things to \nhappen to our country.\n  I was one of those young people inspired by John Kennedy and by \nRobert Kennedy--who invited me to join the Department of Justice as a \nyoung law student, though I was homesick and wanted to go back to \nVermont, and I am glad I did.\n  These were people who inspired young people. They inspired us because \nwe saw political life and elective office not as something for cynical \ngain or something to promote yourself or something where you could do \nbumper-sticker sloganeering. I don't care whether you were on the left \nor the right. They inspired others to make life better for everybody \nelse, to make the country better and stronger, and to leave a better \ncountry for the next generation.\n  I think that was the promise of John Kennedy. I am glad that many in \nboth\n\n[[Page S8433]]\n\nparties decided to follow that same promise. I just wish more would.\n  Madam President, I thank my colleagues for letting me have all this \ntime, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVermont for his remembrance of those days that were so special to him \nand also for really commemorating them so they will be special to all \nof us. I thank him for his comments.\n\n\n                              Rules Change\n\n  Madam President, I am going to speak as the ranking member of the \nSenate rules committee, and I am going to speak in regard to the rules \nchanges that have occurred today.\n  Under the rules of this body, it takes 67 votes to end debate on a \nrules change. As a continuing body, our rules carry on from one \nCongress to the next--or at least they used to--and can only be changed \npursuant to these rules. Our rules have always ensured a voice for the \nminority in this body. Unlike the House, where I served, where a simple \nmajority has the power to impose a rule change at any time, in the \nSenate the minority has always been protected. Here, the rules protect \nthe minority and cannot be changed without their consent--unless, of \ncourse, the majority decides it wants to break the rules to change the \nrules. I am saddened that is what happened today.\n  The Washington Post reported the other day that President Obama's \napproval rating has hit a record low; his disapproval rating has hit a \nrecord high--the worst of his Presidency. This is obviously the result \nof the disastrous rollout of ObamaCare which has caused Americans to \nquestion both the President's trustworthiness and his basic competence.\n  In light of these developments, one would think my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle might be reconsidering the wisdom of some of \ntheir past decisions. One would hope it would occur to them that maybe \nit was a mistake to pass the health care reform bill on a straight \nparty-line vote. I am one of the few who voted no in the HELP \nCommittee, no in the Finance Committee, and no on the Senate floor on \nthat Christmas Eve night.\n  One might expect them to have some doubts about the competence of \nthis administration, as most Americans clearly do on this particular \nissue especially and on a lot of other regulations; that it would dawn \non them that maybe now might be the right time to reassert \ncongressional authority to rein in and redirect the administration--the \nexecutive, if you will--and use the power of the Senate to move the \nadministration in a different direction. I am sorry that has not \nhappened. Instead, in the face of the obvious failures of this \nPresident and his plummeting approval ratings, the majority has decided \nit would be a really good idea to give him more power. That is right, \nthe majority thinks our biggest problem is that the President can't do \nwhatever he wants to do and we should change our rules to allow him to \ndo that. That is incredible.\n  The majority has permanently undermined this body, robbed it of a \nvital tool to check the untrammeled authority of this or any other \nPresident, so this sinking ship of an administration can make whatever \nappointments it wants. What a tragedy.\n  In Kansas, when you walk old ghost towns you will see buildings where \nnothing remains but the facade. Literally the entire building is gone \nand all that is left is the facade. To prevent that facade from \ncollapsing, you may see beams propping it up.\n  In recent weeks this administration has been exposed as a facade. It \nstill looks nice at first glance--the slick campaign-style appearances \ngo on as usual--but when you look behind it, you see there is nothing \nthere. It cannot perform the most basic tasks. It cannot even fulfill \nthe responsibilities it has assigned to itself. It is collapsing. So \nnow we, the Senate, are going to prop it up. The U.S. Senate, the \nworld's greatest deliberative body, has been reduced to being a prop. \nWe have reduced ourselves to rubberstamps, forfeiting our historical \nand constitutional authority to subject Presidential appointments to \nadvice and consent so this administration can do whatever it wants. \nAgain, what a tragedy. Never has so much been given for so little.\n\n  We have permanently undermined this body--for what? So this President \ncan appoint a few more judges and stack the DC Circuit Court that \noversees the constitutionality of Federal regulations? Yes, ObamaCare \nregulations, IRS regulations, EPA regulations--all of the regulations \nthat come like a waterfall over basically every economic sector we \nhave. This is unbelievable. What happened today will surely lead to \ncomplete control of this institution by the majority. I hope not, but \nthat is what has happened in the past, more especially in the House.\n  Do not listen to those who would seek to minimize the importance of \nwhat has been done. The claim that what they have done is limited--\napplying only to executive nominations--misses the point. The change \nitself is less important than the manner in which it was imposed. Once \nyou assume the power to write new rules with a simple majority vote, to \nignore the existing rules that require a supermajority to achieve such \na change, you have put us on a path that will surely lead to total \ncontrol of this body by the majority.\n  Before today, there was only one House of Congress where the majority \nhas total control. Now there are two. We have become the House. By its \naction today, the majority has ensured that for many years to come, \nMembers will not have any rights beyond those which the majority is \nwilling to grant.\n  When he was in the minority, our current majority leader recognized \nthis. In his book ``The Good Fight,'' Senator Reid wrote about the \nbattle over the nuclear option back in 2005. This is what he wrote:\n\n       Once you opened that Pandora's box, it was just a matter of \n     time before a Senate leader who couldn't get his way on \n     something moved to eliminate the filibuster for regular \n     business as well. And that, simply put, would be the end of \n     the United States Senate.\n\n  I repeat, ``the end of the United States Senate.''\n  Senator Reid further wrote:\n\n       . . . there will come a time when we will all be gone, and \n     the institutions that we now serve will be run by men and \n     women not yet living, and those institutions will either \n     function well because we've taken care of them, or they will \n     be in disarray and someone else's problem to solve.\n\n  He described the nuclear option this way then:\n\n       In a fit of partisan furry, they were trying to blow up the \n     Senate. Senate rules can only be changed by a two-thirds vote \n     of the Senate, or 67 Senators. The Republicans were going to \n     do it illegally with a simple majority, or 51 . . . future \n     generations be damned.\n\n  If only today the majority leader had recalled his own words. \nInstead, by his own hand, he has brought on the end of the Senate as we \nknow it. Instead of taking care of this institution, he will leave it \nin disarray--future generations be damned.\n  Our former Parliamentarian Bob Dove and Richard Arenberg, a professor \nand onetime aide to former majority leader George Mitchell, wrote a \nbook on this subject called ``Defending the Filibuster,'' and this is \nwhat they said:\n\n       If a 51-vote majority is empowered to rewrite the Senate's \n     rules, the day will come, as it did in the House of \n     Representatives, when a majority will construct rules that \n     give it near absolute control over amendments and debate. And \n     there is no going back from that. No majority in the House of \n     Representatives has or ever will voluntarily relinquish that \n     power in order to give the minority a greater voice in \n     crafting legislation.\n\n  Do not be fooled by those who would try to minimize the impact of \nwhat happened today. Again, the rule change itself is less important \nthan the manner in which it was imposed. Now that the majority has \ndecided it can set the rules, there is no limit to what it or any \nfuture majority might do in the future. There are no constraints. The \nmajority claims these changes are necessary to make the Senate \nfunction. If it decides further changes are needed, it will make them. \nThe minority will have no voice, no say, no power. That has never been \nthe case in the Senate--never. Until now.\n  It saddens me that we have come to this point. It saddens me that the \nMembers on the other side of the aisle who should know better have \ntaken this course. We have done permanent damage to this institution \nand set a precedent that will surely allow future majorities to further \nrestrict the rights of the minority. That is not a threat; it is just a \nfact. We have weakened this\n\n[[Page S8434]]\n\nbody permanently, undermined it, for the sake of an incompetent \nadministration. What a tragedy.\n  This is a sad, sad day. When the future generations we have damned by \ntoday's actions look back and wonder ``Why are things in such disarray? \nWhen did it go wrong? When did the demise of the Senate begin?'' the \nanswer will be today, November 21, 2013.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, as the majority contemplate changing \nthe rules of the Senate to expedite the confirmation of several \nexecutive branch nominees, I hope that serious consideration was given \nto the adverse effects this change could have.\n  We should resist embarking on a path that would circumvent the rights \nof the minority to exercise its advice and consent responsibilities \nprovided in the Constitution.\n  The consequences of the action by the majority should not be \nminimized. Former Senator Ted Kennedy, in 2003, testified before the \nRules Committee that by allowing a simple majority to end debate on \nnominees, ``the Senate would put itself on a course to destroy the very \nessence of our constitutional role.''\n  Such a departure from precedent would dilute the minority rights that \ndifferentiate the Senate from the other body. It also opens the door to \napplying this same rule to debate on judicial nominations, as well as \nthe legislative process.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I wish to echo what my colleague from \nMichigan Senator Levin said on the floor earlier today. He quoted the \nlate Senator Arthur Vandenburg of Michigan who said, in 1949, that if \nthe majority can change the rules at will ``then there are no rules \nexcept the transient unregulated wishes of a majority of whatever \nquorum is temporarily in control of the Senate.''\n  Senator Vandenburg's words from 1949 have proven to be prophetic.\n  Additionally, when he was a Member of the Senate in 2005, President \nObama said ``What [the American people] don't expect is for one party--\nbe it Republican or Democrat--to change the rules in the middle of the \ngame.'' That is exactly what his party did today--and they did so with \nthe President's full support.\n  The American people will not be deceived--the Majority Leader's \nexercise of the ``nuclear option'' today is merely an attempt to divert \ntheir attention from Obamacare's failure to launch and the President's \nfailure to keep his word to the American people on whether they can \nkeep health care plans they already have. Republicans will, however, \ncome together to maintain the American people's focus on these issues \nand on solving problems they are confronted with everyday--on health \ncare reform, economic growth, runaway deficit-spending, and an \nunsustainable national debt that threatens future generations. \nUnfortunately, in his desperation to divert everyone's attention from \nObamacare, the majority leader abused his position to decimate the \nintegrity of the institution he is supposed to serve and continues to \nplunge this institution into a hopeless abyss of distrust and \npartisanship. These are circumstances that can be remedied by nothing \nless than a change in the majority in the Senate and its leadership. I \nremain dedicated towards achieving that outcome.\n  It is unfortunate we are in this position today. Numerous times over \nthe years, the Senate has come to a standstill over nominees--whether \nthey were judicial or executive branch. That gridlock inevitably leads \nto threats from the majority to use the ``nuclear option''--to change \nthe rules of the Senate to strip the minority party of their right to \nfilibuster certain nominees. I opposed using the nuclear option back \nwhen my party had the majority, and I oppose it today.\n  I think the Majority Leader made a huge mistake today.\n  Senator Vandenberg:\n\n       . . . I continue to believe that the rules of the Senate \n     are as important to equity and order in the Senate as is the \n     Constitution to the life of the Republic, and that those \n     rules should never be changed except by the Senate itself, in \n     the direct fashion prescribed by the rules themselves.\n\n  Senator Vandenberg continued:\n\n       I have heard it erroneously argued in the cloakrooms that \n     since the Senate rules themselves authorize a change in the \n     rules through due legislative process by a majority vote, it \n     is within the spirit of the rules when we reach the same net \n     result by a majority vote of the Senate upholding a \n     parliamentary ruling of the Vice President which, in effect, \n     changes the rules. This would appear to be some sort of \n     doctrine of amendment by proxy. It is argued that the Senate \n     itself makes the change in both instances by majority vote; \n     and it is asked, what is the difference? Of course, this is \n     really an argument that the end justifies the means.\n\n  Senator Vandenberg continued:\n\n       We fit the rules to the occasion, instead of fitting the \n     occasion to the rules. Therefore, in the final analysis, \n     under such circumstances, there are no rules except the \n     transient, unregulated wishes of a majority of whatever \n     quorum is temporarily in control of the Senate. That, Mr. \n     President, is not my idea of the greatest deliberative body \n     in the world. . . . No matter how important [the pending \n     issue's] immediate incidence may seem to many today, the \n     integrity of the Senate's rules is our paramount concern, \n     today, tomorrow, and so long as this great institution lives.\n\n  He concluded, with that ``one consideration'':\n\n       What do the present Senate rules mean; and for the sake of \n     law and order, shall they be protected in that meaning until \n     changed by the Senate itself in the fashion required by the \n     rules?\n       . . . [T]he rules of the Senate as they exist at any given \n     time and as they are clinched by precedents should not be \n     changed substantively by the interpretive action of the \n     Senate's Presiding Officer, even with the transient sanction \n     of an equally transient Senate majority. The rules can be \n     safely changed only by the direct and conscious action of the \n     Senate itself, acting in the fashion prescribed by the rules. \n     Otherwise, no rule in the Senate is worth the paper it is \n     written on, and this so-called ``greatest deliberative body \n     in the world'' is at the mercy of every change in \n     parliamentary authority.\n\n  According to CRS, proposals to limit Senate debate are as old as the \nSenate itself. Over the 224-year history of the body, numerous \nprocedures have been proposed to allow the Senate to end discussion and \nact. The most important debate-limiting procedure enacted was the \nadoption in 1917 of the ``cloture rule,'' codified in paragraph 2 of \nSenate Rule XXII. Under the current version of this rule, a process for \nending debate on a pending measure or matter may be set in motion by a \nsupermajority vote of the Senate.\n\n       At times, Senators of both political parties have debated \n     the merits of the Senate's tradition of free and unlimited \n     debate. These debates have occurred at different times and \n     under different sets of circumstances as Senators attempted, \n     for example, to prevent filibusters of civil rights measures, \n     pass consumer protection legislation, or secure the \n     confirmation of judicial or executive branch nominations.\n       Although many attempts have been made to amend paragraph 2 \n     of Rule XXII, only six amendments have been adopted since the \n     cloture rule was enacted in 1917: those undertaken in 1949, \n     1959, 1975, 1976, 1979, and 1986. Each of these changes was \n     made within the framework of the existing or ``entrenched'' \n     rules of the Senate, including Rule XXII.\n       In 1949, the cloture rule was amended to apply to all \n     ``matters,'' as well as measures, a change that expanded its \n     reach to nominations, most motions to proceed to consider \n     measures, and other motions. A decade later, in 1959, its \n     reach was further expanded to include debate on motions to \n     proceed to consider changes in the Senate rules themselves. \n     The threshold for invoking cloture was lowered in 1975 from \n     two-thirds present and voting to three-fifths of the full \n     Senate except on proposals to amend Senate rules. In a change \n     made in 1976, amendments filed by Senators after cloture was \n     invoked were no longer required to be read aloud in the \n     chamber if they were available at least 24 hours in advance.\n       In 1979, Senators added an overall ``consideration cap'' to \n     Rule XXII to prevent so-called post-cloture filibusters, \n     which occurred when Senators continued dilatory parliamentary \n     tactics even after cloture had been invoked. In 1986, this \n     ``consideration cap'' was reduced from 100 hours to 30 hours.\n\n  At various times I have been a part of bipartisan groups of Senators \nwho were able to come together and negotiate agreements to end the \ngridlock surrounding nominees, avert the nuclear option, and allow the \nSenate to move forward with our work on behalf of the American people. \nMy work in these groups--often referred to as ``gangs''--has won me \nboth praise and condemnation, and has often put me at odds with some in \nmy own party.\n  In 2005 for instance, I joined 13 of my colleagues in an agreement \nthat allowed for votes on three of President Bush's judicial nominees \nwho were\n\n[[Page S8435]]\n\nbeing filibustered by the Democrats--who were in the minority at that \ntime. Part of that agreement addressed future nominees. It stated:\n\n       ``Signatories will exercise their responsibilities under \n     the Advice and Consent Clause of the United States \n     Constitution in good faith. Nominees should only be \n     filibustered under extraordinary circumstances, and each \n     signatory must use his or her own discretion and judgment in \n     determining whether such circumstances exist.''\n\n  In January of this year I began working with like-minded members of \nboth parties to diffuse legislative gridlock and to meet the goals of \nmaking it easier for the majority to bring legislation to the floor \nwhile also making it easier for a Member of the minority to offer \namendments to that legislation. Having a robust amendment process, \nespecially on legislation of major consequence, is how the Senate has \ntraditionally operated. It is something that has been sorely lacking \nfor the last several years. And it is something that, when it has \noccurred, has invariably led to legislative achievement.\n  And again in July of this year the Senate faced gridlock over the \nPresident's nominees to the National Labor Relations Board--NLRB. I \njoined with Members on both sides to come up with a reasonable \ncompromise which allowed for votes of the President's nominees.\n  My colleagues in the majority are mistaken if they assume that these \nagreements have meant that we, the minority party, have surrendered our \nright to filibuster nominees in certain circumstances. The exact \nopposite is true. These agreements were negotiated precisely to protect \nthe rights of the minority to filibuster nominations in good faith \nwhere the minority finds that doing so is warranted under the \ncircumstances.\n  I am disappointed my colleagues on the other side have taken this \nstep today. I would argue that our side, led by Senator McConnell, has \nbeen very accommodating in helping to secure cloture on numerous \nnominees. The fact that we have exercised our rights in several \ninstances should not deter from that fact, and is certainly not \ndeserving of this retaliatory action.\n  I have worked to end the stalemates over nominees, not for praise or \npublicity, but to retain the rights of the minority, and to help return \nthe Senate to the early practices of our government and to reduce the \nrancor and distrust that unfortunately accompanies the advice and \nconsent process in the Senate. I fear that today's action by the \nmajority will result in even more discord in this body.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, today we face a real crisis in the \nconfirmation process, a crisis concocted by the majority to distract \nattention from the Obamacare disaster and, in the process, consolidate \nmore power than any majority has had in more than 200 years. This \ncrisis was created by a majority that wants to win at all cost, for \nwhom the political ends justify any means whatsoever. The two parts of \nthis crisis are what the majority is doing and how they are doing it.\n  What the majority is doing is terminating the minority's ability to \nfilibuster judicial nominees. If anyone thought that judicial \nfilibusters were so easy that the minority has been doing it \nindiscriminately, they would be wrong. It is harder to filibuster \njudges today than at any time since the turn of the 19th century. And \nthe truth is that Democrats are now terminating a practice that they \ncreated and that they have used, by orders of magnitude, far more than \nRepublicans.\n  In February 2001, just after President George W. Bush took office, \nDemocrats vowed to use ``any means necessary'' to defeat his judicial \nnominees. That is one promise Democrats kept. They pioneered using the \nfilibuster to defeat majority-supported judicial nominees in 2003. In \nfact, 73 percent of all votes for judicial filibusters in American \nhistory have been cast by Democrats.\n  By this same point under President Bush, the Senate had taken 26 \ncloture votes on judicial nominees, more than twice as many as have \noccurred under President Obama. Under President Bush, 20 of those \ncloture votes failed, nearly three times as many as under President \nObama. Democrats set a record for multiple filibusters against the same \nnominee that still stands today. They filibustered the nomination of \nMiguel Estrada, the first Hispanic nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the DC Circuit, seven times.\n  Individual Democratic Senators took full advantage of the judicial \nfilibuster that they now are terminating. The majority leader, the \nmajority whip, and the Judiciary Committee chairman together voted 82 \ntimes to filibuster Republican judicial nominees. In contrast, the \nminority leader, minority whip, and Judiciary Committee ranking member \nhave together voted only 29 times to filibuster Democratic judicial \nnominees. For those same Democratic Senators to now take away from \nothers the very tactic that they invented and used so liberally is \nbeyond hypocritical.\n  The other part of this crisis is how the majority is terminating the \njudicial filibuster. The title ``nuclear option'' has been given to two \nmethods by which a simple majority can change how the Senate does \nbusiness. The first method has never been tried and can occur, if at \nall, only at the beginning of a new Congress. Because this method would \nactually change the Senate's written rules, it would be a public \nprocess involving a resolution and examination by the Rules Committee. \nRepublicans considered using this method at the beginning of the 110th \nCongress but did not do so.\n  The majority today is instead using the second method, which requires \nonly a ruling from whoever is presiding over the Senate. It is a pre-\nscripted parliamentary hit-and-run, over in a flash and leaving Senate \ntradition and practice behind like so much confirmation roadkill. This \nwould be the wrong way to address even a real confirmation crisis, let \nalone the fake one created by the majority today.\n  The majority, it seems, just does not like the way our system of \ngovernment is designed to work. I have been in the majority and the \nminority several times each, more than enough to experience that the \nrules, practices, and traditions of this body can annoy the majority \nand empower the minority. That is how this body is designed to work as \npart of the legislative branch. But the majority today wants to have it \nall. They are denying to others the very same tools that they used so \naggressively before.\n  This year, the Senate has confirmed more than twice as many judges \nthan at the start of President Bush's second term. We have confirmed \nnine appeals court judges so far this year, a confirmation rate \nexceeded only a handful of times in the 37 years I have served in this \nbody. President Obama has already appointed one-quarter of the entire \nFederal judiciary.\n  But that is not enough for this majority. In order to clear the way \nfor winning every confirmation vote every time, Democrats set up a \nconfrontation over nominees to the DC Circuit. They knew that the DC \nCircuit did not need more than the eight active judges it now has. How \ndid they know? Because the very same standards they used in 2006 to \noppose Republican nominees to that court told them so.\n  In 2006, Democrats opposed more DC Circuit nominees because written \ndecisions per active judge had declined by 17 percent. Since 2006, \nwritten decisions per active judge have declined by an even greater 27 \npercent. In 2006, Democrats opposed more DC Circuit appointments \nbecause total appeals had declined by 10 percent. Since 2006, total \nappeals have declined by an even greater 18 percent. The DC Circuit's \ncaseload not only continues to decline, but is declining faster than \nbefore.\n  In 2006, Democrats opposed more DC Circuit appointments because there \nwere 20 judicial emergency vacancies and there were nominees for only \n60 percent of them. Since 2006, judicial emergency vacancies have \nnearly doubled and the percentage of those vacancies with nominees has \ndeclined to less than 50 percent.\n  Judiciary Committee Democrats put those standards in writing in 2006. \nNone of them, including the four who still serve on the Judiciary \nCommittee today, have either said they were wrong in 2006 or explained \nwhy different standard should be used today. They have not done so \nbecause this about-face, this double-standard, is a deliberate ploy to \ncreate an unnecessary and fake confirmation confrontation.\n  I have to hand it to my Democratic colleagues because reality \ntelevision cannot hold a candle to this saga.\n\n[[Page S8436]]\n\nDemocrats first abandoned the arguments they used against Republican \nnominees to the DC Circuit in order to create a fake confrontation. \nThen they ``solve'' this confrontation by terminating judicial \nfilibusters that they once used against Republican nominees.\n  The filibuster has been an important--some would say a defining--\nfeature of how this body operates for more than 200 years. It has \nalways annoyed the majority because it empowers the minority. Both \nparties have used it, both parties have criticized it. But no majority \nhas done what Democrats have done today. They have fundamentally \naltered this body, they have in the most disingenuous way done long \nterm institutional damage for short term political gain. This majority \nwants everything to go their way, and will do anything to make that \nhappen.\n  The majority created this fake confirmation crisis for two reasons. \nFirst, they want to stack the DC Circuit with judges who will approve \nactions by the executive branch agencies that President Obama needs to \npush his political agenda. Second, they want to distract attention from \nthe Obamacare disaster. I think this heavy-handed move will have the \nopposite effect on both counts. Just as both parties have used the \nfilibuster to stop certain judicial nominees, both parties will use the \nabsence of the filibuster to appoint certain judicial nominees. And now \nthat the majority has crossed this parliamentary Rubicon, we can indeed \nfocus again on what Obamacare is doing to American families. This is a \nsad day for the Senate, for the judiciary, and for the American people \nwho want to see their elected representatives act on integrity and \nprinciple rather than use gimmicks and power plays.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, today the Senate took an \nunusual step to change our rules with a simple majority vote. I say \nunusual step, and not unprecedented, because it was something the \nSenate has done on many occasions in the past. Like those previous \nchanges, the action we took was not intended to destroy the uniqueness \nof the Senate but instead was meant to restore the regular order of the \nbody.\n  I believe, as I have stated many times since coming to the Senate, \nthat the best way to amend the rules is by having an open debate at the \nbeginning of each new Congress and holding a majority vote to adopt the \nrules for that Congress. I, along with Senators Harkin and Merkley, \ntried to do that at the beginning of this Congress and the last. \nUltimately we were unsuccessful in achieving the real reforms we \nwanted, including a talking filibuster. But there was some hope that \nthe debate highlighted some of the most egregious abuses of the rules \nand led to an agreement that both sides would strive to restore the \nrespect and comity that is often lacking in today's Senate. \nUnfortunately, that agreement rapidly deteriorated and the partisan \nrancor and political brinksmanship quickly returned.\n  As expected, many of my Republican colleagues called today's action \nby the majority a power grab and ``tyranny of the majority.'' They \ndecried the lack of respect for minority rights. I do believe that we \nmust respect the minority in the Senate, but that respect must go both \nways. When the minority uses their rights to offer germane amendments, \nor to extend legitimate debate, we should always respect such efforts. \nBut that is not what we have seen. Instead, the minority often uses its \nrights to score political points and obstruct almost all Senate action. \nInstead of offering amendments to improve legislation, we see \namendments that have the sole purpose of becoming talking points in \nnext year's election. Instead of allowing up or down votes on qualified \nnominees, we see complete obstruction to key vacancies. It is hard to \nargue that the majority is not respecting the traditions of the Senate \nwhen the minority is using this body purely for political gain.\n  During the debate over rules reform we had in January, many of my \ncolleagues argued that the only way to change the Senate Rules was with \na two-thirds supermajority. As we saw today, that simply is not true. \nSome call what occurred the ``Constitutional Option,'' while others \ncall it the ``Nuclear Option.'' I think the best name for it might be \nthe ``Majority Option.'' As I studied this issue in great depth, one \nthing became very clear. Senator Robert Byrd may have said it best. \nDuring a debate on the floor in 1975, Senator Byrd said, ``at any time \nthat 51 Members of the Senate are determined to change the rule . . . \nand if the leadership of the Senate joins them . . . that rule will be \nchanged.'' That is what happened today.\n  We keep hearing that any use of this option to change the rules is an \nabuse of power by the majority. However, a 2005 Republican Policy \nCommittee memo provides some excellent points to rebut this argument.\n  Let me read part of the 2005 Republican memo:\n\n       ``This constitutional option is well grounded in the U.S. \n     Constitution and in Senate history. The Senate has always \n     had, and repeatedly has exercised, the constitutional power \n     to change the Senate's procedures through a majority vote. \n     Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd used the constitutional option \n     in 1977, 1979, 1980, and 1987 to establish precedents \n     changing Senate procedures during the middle of a Congress. \n     And the Senate several times has changed its Standing Rules \n     after the constitutional option had been threatened, \n     beginning with the adoption of the first cloture rule in \n     1917. Simply put, the constitutional option itself is a \n     longstanding feature of Senate practice.\n       The Senate, therefore, has long accepted the legitimacy of \n     the constitutional option. Through precedent, the option has \n     been exercised and Senate procedures have been changed. At \n     other times it has been merely threatened, and Senators \n     negotiated textual rules changes through the regular order. \n     But regardless of the outcome, the constitutional option has \n     played an ongoing and important role.''\n\n  The memo goes on address some ``Common Misunderstandings of the \nConstitutional Option.''\n  One misunderstanding addressed, which we heard today is that, ``The \nessential character of the Senate will be destroyed if the \nconstitutional option is exercised.''\n  The memo rebuts this by stating that ``When Majority Leader Byrd \nrepeatedly exercised the constitutional option to correct abuses of \nSenate rules and precedents, those illustrative exercises of the option \ndid little to upset the basic character of the Senate. Indeed, many \nobservers argue that the Senate minority is stronger today in a body \nthat still allows for extensive debate, full consideration, and careful \ndeliberation of all matters with which it is presented.''\n  Changing the rules with a simple majority is not about exercising \npower, but is instead about restoring balance. There is a fine line \nbetween respecting minority rights and yielding to minority rule. When \nwe cross that line, as I believe we have many times in recent years, \nthe majority is within its rights to restore the balance. This is not \ntyranny by the majority, but merely holding the minority accountable if \nit crosses that line and makes the Senate a dysfunctional body. I would \nexpect the same if my party was in the minority and we were abusing the \nrules.\n  Many of my colleagues argue that the Senate's supermajority \nrequirements are what make it unique from the House of Representatives, \nas well as any other legislative body in the world. I disagree. If you \ntalk to the veteran Senators, many of them will tell you that the need \nfor 60 votes to pass anything or confirm nominees is a recent \nphenomenon. Senator Harkin discussed this in great detail during our \ndebate in January and I highly recommend reading his statement.\n  I think this gets at the heart of the problem. We are a unique \nlegislative body, but not because of our rule book. We have recently \ndevolved into a body that our Founders never intended. Rather than one \nbased on mutual respect that moves by consent and allows majority votes \non almost all matters, we have become a supermajoritarian institution \nthat often does not move at all.\n  With all of the economic issues we face, our country cannot afford a \nbroken Senate. Both sides need to take a step back and understand that \nwhat we do on the Senate floor is not about winning or keeping the \nmajority next November, but about helping the country today.\n  Today's vote to change the rules is a victory for all Americans who \nwant to end obstruction and return to a government that works for them. \nAmericans sent us here to get things done, but in recent years, the \nminority has filibustered again and again--not to slow action out of \nsubstantive concerns, but\n\n[[Page S8437]]\n\nfor political gain. Any President--Democrat or Republican--should be \nable to make their necessary appointments.\n  This change finally returns the Senate to the majority rule standard \nthat is required by the Constitution when it comes to executive branch \nand judicial nominees. With this change, if those nominees are \nqualified, they get an up-or-down vote in the Senate. If a majority is \nopposed, they can reject a nominee. But a minority should not be able \nto delay them indefinitely. That is how our democracy is intended to \nwork.\n  New Mexicans--all Americans--are tired of the gridlock in Washington. \nThe recent filibuster of three DC Circuit nominees over the last 4 \nweeks was not the beginning of this obstruction. It was the final straw \nin a long history of blocking the President's nominees. Doing nothing \nwas no longer an option. It was time to rein in the unprecedented abuse \nof the filibuster, and I am relieved the Senate took action today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8437-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8437-S8440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2014--Continued\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding cloture having been invoked on the Millett nomination, \nthe Senate resume legislative session and consideration of S. 1197; \nthat the time until 4 p.m. be equally divided and controlled between \nChairman Levin and Ranking Member Inhofe or their designees, with the \nchairman controlling the last half of the time; that at 4 p.m., the \nSenate proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on S. 1197, the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill; that if cloture is invoked, \nnotwithstanding cloture having been invoked, the Senate proceed to vote \non S.

Con. Res. 28.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1197) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2014 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Levin/Inhofe) Amendment No. 2123, to increase to \n     $5,000,000,000 the ceiling on the general transfer authority \n     of the Department of Defense.\n       Reid (for Levin/Inhofe) Amendment No. 2124 (to Amendment \n     No. 2123), of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid motion to recommit the bill to the Committee on Armed \n     Services, with instructions, Reid Amendment No. 2305, to \n     change the enactment date.\n       Reid Amendment No. 2306 (to (the instructions) Amendment \n     No. 2305), of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid Amendment No. 2307 (to Amendment No. 2306), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let me first repeat, as I have many \ntimes, I have never worked with a manager more closely than the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee Senator Levin. We worked very \nhard through a lot of issues. On the few where we disagreed with each \nother, we have handled it in a very civil way. We both want a bill and \nwe will have one.\n  The problem we have on the Republican side is we have not had a \nchance to have amendments. I don't have the charts in here, but earlier \nthis morning I had charts here to show historically every time this \ncomes up, we have a number of amendments that the minority has--whether \nthe minority happens to be the Democrats or Republicans. All we want to \ndo is to consider these amendments.\n  Yesterday I said I don't think we will be able to do it, but I am \ngoing to attempt to come today--or yesterday, I said tomorrow--with 25 \namendments that all of the Republicans have said they would not object \nto and we would say these are the ones we would like to have \nconsidered. Of those, assuming the Democrats had 25 also, the most we \nwould have up for consideration would be maybe 20, probably less than \nthat, because historically that is the way it is.\n  I have given the majority the 25 amendments we would like to have \nconsidered, and I made the statement yesterday--and I want to repeat it \ntoday--that now that we have agreed on a list, if we can have these \namendments considered on the floor, then I would be a very strong \nsupporter of this bill.\n  However, after going through the work of coming down to these \namendments--and that is not an easy thing to do--if we are rejected and \nwe are not going to be able to have consideration of these 25 \namendments, I would vote in opposition to cloture to go to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, we will soon vote on whether to invoke \ncloture on S. 1197, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2014. This bill was reported out of the Armed Services Committee \nwith a strong bipartisan vote of 23 to 3. We have enacted a National \nDefense Authorization Act every year for more than 50 years, and it is \ncritically important that we do so again this year.\n  We spent all day yesterday debating two amendments addressing sexual \nassault in the military, but we have not been allowed to vote on them. \nThere was opposition on the other side to voting even on those two \namendments which have now been fully debated. We were told that \nSenators wouldn't let us vote on the sexual assault amendments because \nthey were afraid those would be the only votes. We offered to lock in \nadditional amendments, six for Democrats, six for Republicans. That got \nan objection. Staff had built up a cleared amendment package of 39 \nadditional amendments on a bipartisan basis, about half for each side, \nthat were all agreed to on the merits. Again, we got thwarted.\n  So over and over, we had objections to considering amendments, based \non the accusation that we were not considering enough amendments. But \nhow on earth does blocking the consideration of amendments that we can \nall agree on advance the cause of considering amendments?\n  I am going to continue to work with my friend from Oklahoma--and we \nare good friends and we work together well. He is right. I am going to \ncontinue to work toward an agreement that will enable us to proceed \nwith additional amendments on this bill.\n  This would not be the first time this kind of a problem has happened \non a Defense authorization bill. In 2008, one Senator objected to \ncleared amendment packages and to bringing up amendments. As a result, \nwe were able to have only two rollcall votes and adopted only 9 \namendments--all of which were agreed to before the objection was \nraised. Then, as now, the objection did not result in more amendments \nbeing adopted but, rather, in almost no amendments being adopted at \nall. In 2008, we invoked cloture and proceeded with the bill with \nvirtually no Senate amendments--a result which was less than ideal, but \nat least it enabled us to enact a National Defense Authorization Act \nthat year.\n  We must pass a national defense authorization bill. If we fail to do \nso, we will be letting down our men and women in uniform and failing to \nperform one of Congress' most basic duties--providing for the national \ndefense.\n  As is the case every year, if we fail to enact this bill, our troops \nwill not get the full amount of compensation to which they are \nentitled. If we fail to act, the Department's authority to pay out \ncombat pay, hardship duty pay, special pay for nuclear-qualified \nservicemembers, enlistment and reenlistment bonuses, incentive pay for \ncritical specialties, assignment incentive pay, and accession and \nretention bonuses for critical specialties will expire on December 31.\n  After that date, we will have troops in combat who will not get \ncombat pay. We will lose some of our most highly skilled men and women \nwith specialties that we vitally need. Not only will we be \nshortchanging our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, but we will \nbe denying our military services critical authorities they need to \nrecruit and retain high-quality servicemembers, and to achieve their \nforce-\n\n[[Page S8438]]\n\nshaping objectives as they draw down their end strengths.\n  That is not all. If we fail to enact this bill, school districts all \nover the United States that rely on supplemental impact aid to help \nthem educate military children will no longer receive that money. If we \nfail to enact this bill, the Department of Defense will not be able to \nbegin construction on any new military construction projects in the \ncoming year. That means our troops won't get the barracks, ranges, \nhospitals, laboratories, and other support facilities they need to \nsupport operational requirements, conduct training, and maintain \nequipment. It means that military family housing will not receive \nneeded upgrades.\n  If we fail to enact this bill, the existing military land withdrawals \nwill expire at China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station and Chocolate \nMountain Aerial Gunnery Range. That means our military will have to \ncease operations on those vital test and training ranges, losing \ncritical testing and training capabilities that they relied on for the \nlast 25 years.\n  If we fail to enact this bill, the Department of Defense will run out \nof money for the construction of the first ship of the Navy's new class \nof aircraft carriers, the Gerald R. Ford. That means the Navy will have \nto issue a stop work order on the construction of the Ford, requiring \nthem to lay off workers and requiring a break in production that will \nadd hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars not only to the \ncost of the Ford, but also to the cost of follow-on aircraft carriers.\n  It goes on and on. If we fail to enact this bill, we will enact none \nof the far-reaching reforms we need to address on the problem of sexual \nassault in the military. Already we have been blocked in our effort to \nclear a package of manager's amendments, including Senator Boxer's \namendment reforming the article 32 process.\n  Now, we are not only going to lose important reforms, but there are \ntwo dozen measures that are in the bill which address the problem of \nsexual assault. If we don't adopt this bill, we won't be providing a \nSpecial Victims' Counsel for victims of sexual assault. We won't make \nretaliation for reporting a sexual assault a crime under the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice. If we don't adopt this bill, we won't require \ncommanders to immediately refer all allegations of sexual assault to \nprofessional criminal investigators. We won't restrict the authority of \nsenior officers to modify the findings and sentence of court-martial \nconvictions, and we won't require higher level review of any decision \nnot to prosecute allegations of sexual assault.\n  We have already failed our men and women in uniform by failing to end \nsequestration. We should not fail them again by failing to enact the \nmany critical measures included in the National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2014.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, the Gillibrand amendment would address an \nissue that is fundamental to who we are as Americans: ensuring justice \nfor the men and women who serve in our military.\n  When brave young men and women enlist in the armed services, they do \nso to defend our country and our values. Yet those values are being \nundermined by the problem of sexual assault in the military.\n  Over the past decades, our military has expanded equality. I am proud \nthat all of our services recognize that women have a vital role to play \nin the military, including in combat. I wholeheartedly endorse, after \nyears of debate, the recognition that being openly gay or lesbian has \nno bearing on one's ability to serve.\n  These advances in equality in our military are vitally important--\nthey make our military stronger and all of us safer--but they are an \nempty promise without access to justice. And when men and women are the \nvictims of sexual assault in the military, they are often deprived of \njustice.\n  We all know the shameful numbers. An estimated 26,000 cases of \nunwanted sexual contact and sexual assaults occurred in 2012--a 37 \npercent increase from 2011. But the statistics that trouble me most are \nthat 50 percent of female victims did not report the crime because they \nbelieved that nothing would be done. And 62 percent of victims who did \nreport a sexual assault perceived some form of professional, social, or \nadministrative retaliation as a result.\n  And the tragedy is--they're right. The Defense Advisory Committee on \nWomen in the Services spoke to this same problem and found: \n``Unfortunately, recent events have shown these fears to be justified, \nand may also have communicated to perpetrators that they need not fear \nbeing held accountable for their actions.''\n  No wonder then, that the advisory committee voted in favor of \nremoving the decision whether to prosecute sexual assaults and other \nserious crimes from the chain of command.\n  The United States was founded on twin ideals: equality and justice. \nAnd much of our history has involved the struggle to expand equal \ntreatment under the law and access to justice. When we expand equality, \nwe also provide access to justice.\n  I think of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which made it unlawful for \nemployers to discriminate on the basis of race, sex, religion, or \nnational origin and created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \nto enforce the law. Congress recognized that there is no equality \nwithout justice. I think back to the days when white male juries were \nthe rule in virtually every courthouse in this country. Yet finally, \nthe Supreme Court in Norris v. Alabama and Taylor v. Louisiana said \nthat no one could be assured of a fair trial unless women and African \nAmericans served on their juries.\n  Equality and Justice--they are two sides of the same coin. They walk \nhand in hand.\n  In the United States, one of the fundamental precepts of our criminal \njustice system is an independent prosecutor. The authority to charge \nsomeone with a crime is an awesome power. Exercised improperly, an \ninnocent person can be forced to endure a trial or a criminal can go \nunpunished, free to harm their next victim. Under the Code of Military \nJustice, that critical prosecutorial decision is made by a commanding \nofficer--someone often in both the victim's and the alleged \nperpetrator's chain of command--and, typically, not someone trained in \nthe law. If----and statistically in sexual assault cases it is rare--if \nthe commanding officer determines to try a charge by court-martial, the \nsame commander also picks the jurors who will decide the case. I have \nno doubt that most commanders try their best to evaluate charges of \nsexual assault but they are inherently conflicted and compromised when \nwe force them to make the call. We do these commanders a disservice by \nrequiring them to solve this inexorable conflict.\n  As an impressive group of law professors, many of whom are veterans, \nand all of whom are experts in military justice wrote:\n\n       Commanders play a decisive role in military operations and \n     must likewise play a central role in reducing sexual assault \n     and maintaining good order and discipline generally. That \n     role, however, need not extend to the relatively narrow and \n     thoroughly legal arena of criminal prosecution. Contemporary \n     norms of procedural justice require that attorneys, not \n     commanding officers, make decisions to prosecute. As a \n     result, we recommend that the decision to prosecute a member \n     of the armed forces for criminal conduct . . . be made by an \n     independent prosecutor outside the chain of command.\n\n  And, they added, personnel who serve as court-martial jurors should \nbe chosen by a court-martial administrator rather than a commander, \n``to avoid concerns about jury-stacking and unlawful command \ninfluence.''\n  That is precisely what the Gillibrand amendment does. It vests the \nauthority to prosecute serious criminal charges with experienced judge \nadvocate general officers who can evaluate the evidence with a clear, \ncold eye and determine whether charges should be tried. That \nindependence is the only way we can assure both the victim and the \nalleged perpetrator of justice--equal justice under the law. That's \nwhat this country is all about. That's why so many young men and women \nvolunteer to serve. And we owe them nothing less.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, today I rise in support of the fiscal \nyear 2014 National Defense Authorization Act and to address significant \nchallenges facing the Department of Defense.\n  The bill approved by the Armed Services Committee includes necessary \nprovisions to take care of our troops, such\n\n[[Page S8439]]\n\nas a 1-percent pay raise and the maintenance of affordable health care \nfees to avoid a detrimental effect on military retirees and their \nfamilies.\n  I thank Chairman Levin and Ranking Member Inhofe for increasing \nauthorizations for the shipbuilding budget, including an additional \n$100 million to support the procurement of a tenth DDG-51 destroyer \nunder the current multiyear procurement contract. I am pleased that the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee on which I serve has also included \nthis critical $100 million.\n  This ship is needed in the fleet to maintain the robust forward \npresence our Nation requires to protect trade routes, keep the peace, \nand assist when tragedy strikes.\n  When tensions flared in Syria, it was Navy destroyers that were \npositioned off the coast. Following the devastation of Typhoon Haiyan \nin the Philippines, two U.S. Navy destroyers were among the first ships \non station.\n  Taking advantage of the opportunity to procure this ship will lock \nadditional savings on a multiyear procurement that has already saved \ntaxpayers $1.5 billion compared to procuring the ships individually.\n  I am also pleased the Armed Services Committee incorporated many \nprovisions I support to combat sexual assault, which is one of the \ngreatest challenges faced by the Department of Defense for a decade.\n  I first raised my concern about sexual assaults in the military with \nGeneral George Casey in 2004. To say his response was disappointing \nwould be an understatement. I am convinced that if the military had \nheeded the concern I raised then, this terrible problem would have been \naddressed much sooner, saving many individuals the trauma, pain, and \ninjustice they endured.\n  While I will address this issue at greater length during \nconsideration of this bill, I want to highlight three of the most \nimportant changes included in the bill.\n  First, the bill limits the authority of a convening authority to \noverturn or modify the findings of a court-martial in sexual assault \ncases. Second, the bill requires the military to provide an attorney \ndedicated to the interests of survivors of sexual assaults to provide \nlegal advice and assistance when survivors need such assistance the \nmost. Third, a servicemember convicted of sexual assault would be \ndischarged from the military.\n  I also support the provisions in the bill to maintain the readiness \nof our military services by authorizing $1.8 billion to address \nreadiness problems caused by fiscal year 2013 sequestration. This bill \nalso directs the Pentagon to rein in unnecessary or wasteful spending \nwhile rejecting proposals that purport to save money but that actually \ncause more harm than good.\n  Two important provisions require DOD to develop a plan to reduce the \nnumber of General and Flag officer billets and to streamline management \nheadquarters in an effort to save $100 billion over 10 years. Reducing \nunnecessary overhead is something we must insist upon in these fiscally \nconstrained times.\n  Increasing the authorization for the Department of Defense Inspector \nGeneral by $36 million will allow the office to perform additional \noversight and help identify waste, fraud, and abuse in DOD programs. \nHistorically, DOD IG reviews have resulted in a return on investment of \nnearly $11 dollars for every $1 appropriated.\n  The bill wisely rejects the President's proposal to authorize a new \nBase Realignment and Closure round in 2015 and prohibits the \nauthorization of another BRAC round at least until the Department \nsubmits a review of excess overseas military facilities.\n  This is the right way to proceed because the GAO has found that the \nprevious BRAC round has never produced the amount of savings that were \npromised when it was originally sold to Congress.\n  While this is an excellent bill, I hope to offer several amendments \nto make this important bill even stronger in addressing the national \nsecurity challenges facing our country.\n  The first amendment I intend to offer, with my colleague Senator \nKing, has been requested by the Navy to support the final settlement of \nthe A-12 case. The Navy has reached an agreement with Boeing and \nGeneral Dynamics to settle a decades-old lawsuit concerning the \ncancellation of the A-12 aircraft.\n  Our amendment would allow the Navy to accept $400 million in in-kind \npayments from industry to satisfy outstanding Navy claims related to \nthe A-12 legal dispute between the Navy and two contractors, Boeing and \nGeneral Dynamics. All parties--the Navy, the Department of Justice, \nBoeing, and General Dynamics--support the settlement.\n  If this amendment is adopted, the Navy will receive $400 million \nworth of needed military hardware effectively for free at a time when \nit is facing incredible fiscal challenges from sequestration.\n  In addition, taxpayers benefit because there is no guarantee the \ngovernment will ultimately prevail in the ongoing litigation. If the \ngovernment does not prevail, taxpayers may not get anything.\n  The second amendment I intend to file would require athletic footwear \npurchased for new military recruits to be domestically manufactured. \nCurrently, DOD is circumventing the intent of the law known as the \nBerry Amendment through the use of cash allowances that provide no \npreference for domestically manufactured footwear. This amendment, \nwhich is also cosponsored by Senator King, would align the procurement \npolicy for athletic footwear with other footwear and clothing provided \nto servicemembers.\n  In the last year, the Defense Logistics Agency has awarded more than \n$36 million in contracts for combat boots and dress shoes made in \nAmerica. In contrast, the military services have provided cash vouchers \ntotaling more than $15 million per year to new recruits to purchase \nathletic footwear, without any preference for domestically manufactured \nproducts. Why should DOD single out athletic footwear to be treated \ndifferently from dress shoes or combat boots?\n  Another amendment with Senator Blumenthal would require the Attorney \nGeneral to jointly prescribe regulations to implement prescription drug \ntake-back programs with the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans \nAffairs.\n  We know prescription drug abuse is a major factor in military and \nveteran suicides, which are occurring at an alarming rate. \nUnfortunately, 349 servicemembers died from suicide in 2012--more than \nthe number of servicemembers who lost their lives in combat in \nAfghanistan last year. According to the VA, 22 veterans commit suicide \neach day based on data collected from more than 21 States.\n  Last year, the Senate adopted this amendment by unanimous consent. \nRegrettably, the provision was eliminated at the urging of the Drug \nEnforcement Agency with assurances that the agency was nearing \ncompletion of regulations that would address the concern.\n  One year later, we are still receiving written assurances from the \nDEA that they are ``almost ready'' to complete these regulations. In \nthe meantime, prescription drug abuse continues to afflict our service \nmen and women and our veterans. We cannot sit idly by for another year \nwaiting for the bureaucracy to address this matter of life and death.\n  Finally, Senator King and I will offer an amendment to allow \nbusinesses that are located on a closed military base to draw employees \nfrom the local community to meet the 35-percent requirement for the \npurposes of qualifying as a HUBZone.\n  Congress previously passed a law to assist communities affected by \nprevious BRAC rounds by allowing former bases to be eligible for \nHUBZone status, which provides preferences for certain Federal \ncontracting opportunities.\n  Unfortunately, the law limits the geographic boundaries of a BRAC-\nrelated HUBZone to be the same as the boundaries of the base that was \nclosed, which makes it difficult or impossible for businesses to \nqualify for the HUBZone program.\n  Our amendment would allow employees that live in nearby census tracts \nto count toward the 35 percent requirement and extend the period of \neligibility from 5 years to 10 years so Congress' original intent can \nbe fulfilled.\n  In addition to these amendments, I intend to cosponsor several others \nto further improve the bill.\n  Once again, I will support Senator Feinstein's amendment to make \nclear that a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident arrested in the \nU.S. cannot be\n\n[[Page S8440]]\n\ndetained indefinitely without charge or trial.\n  I am also cosponsoring an amendment with Senator Pryor to make sure \nthat our dual status National Guard technicians are treated on an equal \nfooting as our Active-Duty personnel. If our Active-Duty personnel are \nexempted from sequestration, then the National Guard dual status \ntechnicians--who are effectively the equivalent of Active-Duty military \nin the National Guard--should be exempt as well.\n  Let me close by thanking Chairman Levin and Ranking Member Inhofe for \ntheir hard work in putting together a bipartisan bill that addresses \nthe needs of our military and our national security.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I strongly oppose efforts to close down \ndebate on the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  It is a shame that despite being on this bill for four days, we have \nonly had two rollcall votes for amendments. Over 400 amendments have \nbeen filed and we only found time to vote twice.\n  This is unacceptable. While I voted against this legislation in \ncommittee because it clearly and significantly ignored the budget caps \nput in place by sequestration, there are significant provisions worthy \nof support.\n  The Senate worked in a bipartisan manner with leadership from the \njunior Senator from New York to consider an amendment to reform and \nmodernize our military justice system. This amendment was carefully \ncrafted in anticipation that it would receive a roll call vote on the \nSenate floor and I proudly cosponsored and supported this amendment.\n  The junior Senator from Indiana had an amendment to help military \nreservists and the National Guard be recognized for their service and \nqualify for veterans' preference in hiring for federal jobs. His \namendment deserves consideration and a vote.\n  Democrats and Republicans in the Armed Services Committee adopted \nseveral of my amendments to this bill to protect the religious liberty \nof our troops serving here in the United States and overseas. The Armed \nServices Committee also accepted my proposals to prohibit a base \nrealignment and closure commission until after the Department of \nDefense conducts an exhaustive review of our overseas bases, and to \nstudy how the entire United States should be protected against threats \nfrom a missile launch.\n  Also, I am seeking an up-or-down vote or an acceptance of an \namendment I filed to authorize up to a $10 million reward for any \ninformation regarding the terrorist attacks against Americans in \nBenghazi, Libya. I have been very flexible in accepting edits and \nchanges from the majority in order to speed this process along.\n  The same goes for my amendment to protect the Mount Soledad veterans' \nmemorial in California. In fact, the senior Senator from California \nfiled the exact same legislation. So this is not a political or \npartisan amendment but yet it is still being denied consideration.\n  For these reasons and for the obstruction by the Senate majority \nleader who accuses the minority of being obstructionist, I oppose \nending debate on the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would the Chairman yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Parliamentary inquiry? We were to be given equal time for \nthe last 10 minutes. I had 3 minutes. All I want to do is ask a \nquestion. Am I entitled to do that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that be allowed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Everything my Chairman has said I agree with. He is \nmaking my speech for me. It is critical we get the bill. All I am \nsaying is I made the statement yesterday that Republicans are entitled \nto some amendments. I am asking now--we were able to get it down to 25 \namendments to be considered. Will the majority consider these 25 \namendments which can be done in half a day? Would he consider that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, there are no Democrat amendments on his \nlist.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I said 25 amendments. This is our list. You come up with \nyour list.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We cannot agree with a list of amendments, many of which \nare not agreed to on this side, many of which would be filibustered on \nthis side, which would result in just making it impossible for us to \nget to a Defense authorization bill conclusion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a unanimous consent request--which I was \ngoing to make but I will withhold--that lists 26 amendments, half \nDemocratic, half Republican, that I was going to ask consent be adopted \nbecause they have been cleared--which I understand will be objected to \nso I will not make the unanimous consent request--be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Levin Amendments on DoD Auth Request\n\n       I ask unanimous consent that prior to the vote on the \n     motion to invoke cloture on S. 1197, the motion to recommit \n     be withdrawn; the pending Levin amendment #2123 be set aside \n     for Senator Gillibrand, or designee, to offer amendment #2099 \n     relative to sexual assault; that the amendment be subject to \n     a relevant side-by-side amendment from Senators McCaskill and \n     Ayotte, amendment #2170; that no second degree amendments be \n     in order to either of the sexual assault amendments; that \n     each of these amendments be subject to a 60 affirmative vote \n     threshold; the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the \n     Gillibrand amendment #2099; that upon disposition of the \n     Gillibrand amendment, the Senate proceed to vote in relation \n     to the McCaskill-Ayotte amendment #2170; that there be two \n     minutes equally divided in between the votes; upon \n     disposition of the McCaskill-Ayotte amendment and prior to \n     the cloture vote, the following amendments be in order to the \n     bill and called up, en bloc:\n     Inhofe #2031\n     Chambliss #2038\n     Graham #2062\n     Collins #2064\n     Thune #2093\n     Flake #2263\n     Kirk #2287\n     Johanns #2348\n     Moran #2365\n     McCain #2489\n     Lee #2453\n     Portman #2461\n     Cruz #2511\n     Gillibrand #2283\n     Warner #2415\n     Heinrich #2243\n     Durbin #2278\n     Kaine #2424\n     Boxer #2081\n     Hagan #2391\n     Wyden #2282\n     Blumenthal #2121\n     Manchin #2251\n     Coons #2442\n     McCaskill #2171; and\n     Levin #2204\n       That these amendments be agreed to, en bloc; and the motion \n     to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with \n     no intervening action or debate; that upon disposition of \n     these amendments, the Senate proceed to the cloture vote as \n     provided under the previous order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8440-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8440-S8441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the events and votes that took place today \nare probably as historic as any votes that I have seen taken in the \nyears I have been here in the Senate.\n  The majority, with only majority votes--the same as ObamaCare passed \nwith only Democratic votes--changed the rules of the Senate in a way \nthat is detrimental, in my view, not only to the Senate, not only to \nthose of us in the minority party, but great damage to the institution \nitself.\n  One of the men who served in this Senate for a long, long time, whom \nwe respected as much or more than any other leader--he certainly knew \nthe Senate rules more than any of the rest of us combined--was one \nRobert Byrd. Three months before his death, Robert\n\n[[Page S8442]]\n\nByrd wrote this letter. Three months before his death, he said:\n\n       During my half-century of service in various leadership \n     posts in the U.S. Senate--including Minority Leader, Majority \n     Leader, Majority Whip and now President Pro Tempore--I have \n     carefully studied this body's history, rules, and precedents. \n     Studying those things leads one to an understanding of the \n     Constitutional Framers' vision for the Senate as an \n     institution, and the subsequent development of the Senate \n     rules and precedents to protect that institutional role.\n\n  This is important, I say to my colleagues.\n  He said:\n\n       I am sympathetic to frustrations about the Senate's rules, \n     but those frustrations are nothing new. I recognize the need \n     for the Senate to be responsive to changing times, and have \n     worked continually for necessary reforms aimed at modernizing \n     this institution, using the prescribed Senate procedure for \n     amending the rules.\n       However, I believe that efforts to change or reinterpret \n     the rules in order to facilitate expeditious action by a \n     simple majority, while popular, are grossly misguided. While \n     I welcome needed reform, we must always be mindful of our \n     first responsibility to preserve the institution's special \n     purpose.\n\n  Finally, at the end, he said:\n\n       Extended deliberation and debate--when employed \n     judiciously--protect every Senator, and the interests of \n     their constituency, and are essential to the protection of \n     the liberties of a free people.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter by Robert \nByrd be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 23, 2010.\n       Dear Colleague: During my half-century of service in \n     various leadership posts in the U.S. Senate--including \n     Minority Leader, Majority Leader, Majority Whip and now \n     President Pro Tempore--I have carefully studied this body's \n     history, rules and precedents. Studying those things leads \n     one to an understanding of the Constitutional Framers' vision \n     for the Senate as an institution, and the subsequent \n     development of the Senate rules and precedents to protect \n     that institutional role.\n       I am sympathetic to frustrations about the Senate's rules, \n     but those frustrations are nothing new. I recognize the need \n     for the Senate to be responsive to changing times, and have \n     worked continually for necessary reforms aimed at modernizing \n     this institution, using the prescribed Senate procedure for \n     amending the rules.\n       However, I believe that efforts to change or reinterpret \n     the rules in order to facilitate expeditious action by a \n     simple majority, while popular, are grossly misguided. While \n     I welcome needed reform, we must always be mindful of our \n     first responsibility to preserve the institution's special \n     purpose. The occasional abuse of the rules has been, at \n     times, a painful side effect of what is otherwise the \n     Senate's greatest purpose--the right to extended, or even \n     unlimited, debate.\n       If the Senate rules are being abused, it does not \n     necessarily follow that the solution is to change the rules. \n     Senators are obliged to exercise their best judgment when \n     invoking their right to extended debate. They also should be \n     obliged to actually filibuster, that is go to the Floor and \n     talk, instead of finding less strenuous ways to accomplish \n     the same end. If the rules are abused, and Senators exhaust \n     the patience of their colleagues, such actions can invite \n     draconian measures. But those measures themselves can, in the \n     long run, be as detrimental to the role of the institution \n     and to the rights of the American people as the abuse of the \n     rules.\n       I hope Senators will take a moment to recall why the \n     devices of extended debate and amendments are so important to \n     our freedoms. The Senate is the only place in government \n     where the rights of a numerical minority are so protected. \n     Majorities change with elections. A minority can be right, \n     and minority views can certainly improve legislation. As U.S. \n     Senator George Hoar explained in his 1897 article, ``Has the \n     Senate Degenerated?'', the Constitution's Framers \n     intentionally designed the Senate to be a deliberative forum \n     in which ``the sober second thought of the people might find \n     expression.''\n       Extended deliberation and debate--when employed \n     judiciously--protect every Senator, and the interests of \n     their constituency, and are essential to the protection of \n     the liberties of a free people.\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                   Robert C. Byrd.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish Robert Byrd had been here on the \nfloor today. I wish Robert Byrd had seen the travesty that just took \nplace on a party-line vote. And when I use the word ``hypocrisy,'' I \nuse it guardedly. I do not use that word with abandon. But this is \nanother broken promise--another broken promise.\n  I read from an article entitled ``FLASHBACK: Reid in 2008: `As Long \nAs I Am The Leader' We Will Not Have a Nuclear Option.''\n\n       Sen. Harry Reid said in a 2008 interview that as long as he \n     was the Senate Majority Leader, the nuclear option would \n     never happen under his watch.\n       ``As long as I am the Leader, the answer's no,'' he said. \n     ``I think we should just forget that. That is a black chapter \n     in the history of the Senate. I hope we never, ever get to \n     that again because I really do believe it will ruin our \n     country.''\n\n  He was talking about 2005 when this side of the aisle was in the \nmajority and there was an effort--which we were able to diffuse--in \norder to do exactly what we did today. In 2008:\n\n       Reid railed against Republicans who fought for the measure, \n     saying it would lead to a unicameral legislature and that the \n     U.S. Senate was purposefully set up by the Founding Fathers \n     to have different rules than the House of Representatives. \n     Such a measure like the nuclear option, he said, would \n     ``change our country forever.''\n\n  I am sorry to say, I agree with him.\n  I agree with what he said in 2008. Yet, on Thursday, on a nearly \nparty-line vote of 52-48, the Democrats abruptly changed the Senate's \nbalance of power.\n  Here is the full exchange I will read from.\n\n       Tom Daschle: What was the nuclear option, and what \n     likelihood is there that we're going to have to face nuclear \n     option-like questions again?\n\n  This is an interview that the majority leader had with the former \nmajority leader Tom Daschle.\n\n       What the Republicans came up with was a way to change our \n     country forever. They made a decision if they didn't get \n     every judge they wanted, every judge they wanted, then they \n     were going to make the Senate just like the House of \n     Representatives. We would in fact have a unicameral \n     legislature where a simple majority would determine whatever \n     happens. In the House of Representatives today, Pelosi's the \n     leader. Prior to that, it was Hastert. Whatever they wanted, \n     Hastert or Pelosi, they get done. The rules over there allow \n     that. The Senate was set up to be different.\n       That was the genius, the vision of our Founding Fathers, \n     that this bicameral legislature which was unique, had two \n     different duties. One was as Franklin said, to pour the \n     coffee into the saucer and let it cool off. That's why you \n     have the ability to filibuster and to terminate filibuster. \n     They wanted to get rid of all of that, and that's what the \n     nuclear option was all about.\n       Daschle: And is there any likelihood that we're going to \n     face circumstances like that again?\n       Reid: As long as I am the Leader, the answer's no.\n\n  I repeat. He said, ``As long as I'm the Leader, the answer's no.''\n\n       I think we should just forget that. That is a black chapter \n     in the history of the Senate. I hope we never, ever get to \n     that again because I really do believe it will ruin our \n     country. I said during that debate that in all my years in \n     government, that was the most important thing I ever worked \n     on.\n\n  This gives new meaning as to where you stand on an issue as opposed \nto where you sit. This hypocrisy is not confined to Members of the \nSenate. Senator Barack Obama, former Member of this body, on April 1, \n2005, for the benefit especially of our newer Members on the Democratic \nside who were not here at the time and do not know what we went through \nto try to stop it when it was being proposed by this side of the aisle, \nthen-Senator Barack Obama said--who congratulated the Senate today on \nour action. He said:\n\n       The American people sent us here to be their voice. They \n     understand that those voices can at times become loud and \n     argumentative, but they also hope we can disagree without \n     being disagreeable.\n\n  Then-Senator Barack Obama went on to say:\n\n       What they don't expect is for one party, be it Republican \n     or Democrat, to change the rules in the middle of the game so \n     that they can make all of the decisions while the other party \n     is told to sit down and keep quiet.\n\n  I ask my colleagues, what were we just told to do today?\n  He went on to say that the American people want less partisanship in \nthis town. But everyone in this Chamber knows that if the majority \nchooses to end the filibuster:\n\n       If they choose to change the rules and put an end to the \n     Democratic debate, then the fighting and the bitterness and \n     the gridlock will only get worse.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Now, I understand the Republicans are getting a lot of \n     pressure to do this from factions outside the Chamber. But we \n     need to rise above the ends-justifies-the-means mentality, \n     because we're here to answer to the people, all of the \n     people, not just the ones that are wearing our particular \n     party label.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       If the right of open and free debate is taken away from the \n     minority party and the\n\n[[Page S8443]]\n\n     millions of Americans who ask us to be their voice, I fear \n     that already partisan atmosphere in Washington will be \n     poisoned to the point where no one will be able to agree on \n     anything.\n\n  That does not serve anyone's best interests. It certainly is not what \nthe patriots who founded this democracy had in mind.\n  We owe the people who sent us here more than that. We owe them much \nmore. There are several other--in May 2005, Senator Reid also said:\n\n       If there was ever an example of an abuse of power, this is \n     it. The filibuster is the last check we have against the \n     abuse of power in Washington.\n\n  We just eliminated the filibuster, my dear friends, on nominees.\n  Then he went on to say in April of 2005:\n\n       The threat to change Senate rules is a raw abuse of power \n     and will destroy the very checks and balances our Founding \n     Fathers put in place to prevent absolute power by any one \n     branch of government.\n\n  So, yes, I am upset. Yes, on several occasions we have gotten \ntogether on a bipartisan basis and prevented what exactly happened \ntoday. What exactly happened today is not just a shift in power to \nappoint judges. That, in itself, is something that is very important. \nBut what we really did today and what is so damning and what will last \nfor a long time, unless we change it, that could permanently change the \nunique aspects of this institution, the Senate, is if only a majority \ncan change the rules, then there are no rules. That is the only \nconclusion anyone can draw from what we did today.\n  Suppose that in a few weeks the majority does not like it that we \nobject to the motion to proceed: 51 votes. Suppose on cloture, they do \nnot like having those votes for cloture: 51 votes. My friends, we are \napproaching a slippery slope that will destroy the very unique aspects \nof this institution called the Senate.\n  I believe the facts will show, as the Republican leader pointed out \ntoday, that this was a bit of a strawman. Yes, there have been a \nhandful, a small number, of nominees who were rejected by this side of \nthe aisle. But there have been literally hundreds and hundreds of \nnominees who have not even been in debate on the floor of the Senate.\n  All I can say is, when people make a commitment such as I just read \nfrom the President of the United States when he was in the Senate, from \nour majority leader, we should not be surprised when there is a great \ndeal of cynicism about when we give our word and our commitment. I go \nback to the man I probably respected more than anyone in the years I \nhave been in the Senate, one Robert Byrd. One thing I can promise you, \nif Robert Byrd had been sitting over in the majority leader's chair \ntoday, we would not have seen the events that transpired. This is a sad \nday.\n  I am angry, yes. We will get over the anger. But the sorrow at what \nhas been done to this institution will be with us for a long time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey.) The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator McCain, because \nI remember very vividly Senator McCain was part of a group of 14 \nSenators who avoided this kind of occurrence.\n  In 2005, I guess it was, right after President Bush took office, a \ngroup of Senators, really the entire Democratic Conference, went into a \nretreat, as reported by the New York Times. I think Senator Schumer was \nthe organizer of it, but the whole conference attended. Cass Sunstein, \nLaurence Tribe, Marcia Greenberger were their experts. They discussed \nwhat to do about President Bush's new election and his ability to \nappoint judges. They announced they were changing the ground rules of \nconfirmation, and for the first time immediately thereafter the Bush \nnominees were filibustered systematically. He nominated a Mr. Gregory \nwho had been nominated by President Clinton and not confirmed. \nPresident Bush renominated him in a bipartisan act. He was promptly \nconfirmed.\n  But I believe the very next 10 nominees were all filibustered, every \none of them. We had never seen a real filibuster of any judges at that \ntime. But they were changing the ground rules to commit systematic \nfilibusters. They filibustered virtually the first 10 judges President \nBush nominated. It went on for weeks and months.\n  We brought up nominees every way we could. These were some fabulous \nnominees, Supreme Court Justices, people with high academic records. \nBut they were all blocked. It was something we had never seen before in \nthe Senate. There was great intensity of focus on it. It went on for \nquite a long time.\n  Finally there was a feeling on this side that this systematic \nfilibuster was so significant that it undermined and neutered the \nability of the President of the United States to appoint judges. There \nwas a discussion about changing the rules. As time went by, that became \nmore and more of a possibility. I think the American people turned \nagainst my colleagues who were blocking these judges, because they did \nnot appreciate it.\n  But finally a compromise was reached. This was what it amounted to: \nWe will not filibuster a judge unless there are substantial reasons to \ndo so. That was sort of the agreement. At that moment, five judges were \nconfirmed--and a lot of people remember that. But what is forgotten is \nfive went down. Five highly qualified judges were defeated on a \npartisan, ideological basis right out of the chute. They were some of \nthe first judges President Bush ever nominated.\n  I would just say that what has happened so far is that we have \nconfirmed over 200 of President Obama's judges. Only two have been \nblocked. They have brought forth at this time three judges for the DC \nCircuit, the District of Columbia Circuit, the Federal Circuit. They \nare not needed. This country is financially broke. Even with the \nvacancies on the court today, with the 8 judges they have, their \naverage caseload per active judge is 149. The average caseload for all \nthe judges in all of the circuits around the country is 383, almost 3 \ntimes, more than twice. My circuit, the Eleventh Circuit, the average \ncaseload per judge is 778. They say they are not asking for more \njudges; they have been able to maintain that caseload.\n  They say: Well, this is such a horrible, complex circuit. It is not a \nhorrible, complex circuit. That is not so. The judges take the whole \nsummer off because they do not have sufficient caseloads to remain \nbusy. Judges on that circuit say they do not need any more judges. They \ndo not need any more judges.\n  I have been the ranking Republican on the courts subcommittee of the \nJudiciary Committee and chairman of it at times. The entire time I have \nbeen in the Senate I have been on that subcommittee one way or the \nother. I know how the caseloads are calculated, weighted caseloads and \nactual caseloads.\n  That is why these judges were not confirmed, because we do not need \nthem. Not for some ideological purpose. But the reason the President \nhas insisted that they be appointed is an ideological purpose, because \nhe wants to pack that court because he thinks he can impact regulatory \nmatters for years to come. But I would just say, President Bush tried \nto do the same thing. Senator Grassley and I, who had been opposing to \nexpanding the circuit, resisted President Bush's importunings to \napprove one of his judges.\n  We eventually were able to fully transfer and close out one of those \nslots and move it to the Ninth Circuit where the judge was needed. \nStill, the caseloads have dropped. The caseloads in the DC Circuit have \ncontinued to drop year after year after year.\n  We are going broke. This country doesn't have enough money to do its \nbusiness. We are borrowing and placing our children at great risk. It \nis obvious we ought not to fill a judgeship we don't need. It is about \n$1 million a year, virtually $1 million a year to fund one of these \njudgeships. For the judges, the clerks, the supporting secretaries, the \ncomputer systems, and courtrooms we have to supply is $1 million. It is \nsimilar to burning $1 million a year on The Mall. We don't have $1 \nmillion a year to throw away.\n  We have other places in America that need judgeships. Senator \nGrassley has asked--and I have supported--and our bill would call for \nhearings and then we would transfer these judges to places that have \ngreater need. That is why the judges were not moved forward.\n  The caseloads continue to decline. The need is less than ever, and we \ndon't\n\n[[Page S8444]]\n\nhave the money to fill a slot we don't need.\n  It is heartbreaking to see that we have crossed this rubicon and \nchanged these rules when the President--as a matter of actual ability \nto perform the job--has only had 2 judges fail to be confirmed out of \nover 200.\n  This is breathtaking to me. There is a growing concern on our side of \nthe aisle that Senator Reid, the majority leader, is very unwilling to \naccept the process. He is unwilling to accept the fact that he can't \nwin every battle, and he changed the rules so he could win.\n  I feel this is a dark day for the Senate. I don't know how we can get \nout of it. It is the biggest rules change--certainly since I have been \nin the Senate, maybe my lifetime, and maybe in the history of the \nSenate--where it has changed by a simple majority by overruling the \nChair.\n  The Parliamentarian advises the Presiding Officer of the Senate, when \nSenator Reid asked that these judges be confirmed by a majority vote, \nthe Parliamentarian advises the Chair and the Chair ruled we can't \nconfirm them on a majority vote. We can't shut off debate without a \nsupermajority vote. The Chair ruled.\n  Senator Reid says: I appeal the ruling of the Chair. I ask my \ncolleagues in the Senate to overrule the rules of the Senate, by a \nsimple majority vote, to overrule the Parliamentarian and the Presiding \nOfficer of the Senate.\n  This is what happened. When our rules say to change the rules of the \nSenate, it takes a two-thirds vote.\n  This is a dangerous path which I hope my colleagues understand. Many \nthings that are bad have been happening in the Senate. I will speak \nmore about things that should not have happened and are eroding the \nability of this Senate and the way it should function, that are eroding \nthe ability of individual Senators from either party to have their \nvoices heard.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. I am a new Member of the Senate, serving in my first term. \nI was a Member of the House of Representatives before coming to the \nSenate, and I had great anticipation and expectation of the opportunity \nthat service in this body presented to me.\n  The Presiding Officer of the Senate today has had similar \nexperiences. We served in the House of Representatives together. The \nability for an individual Senator, particularly a new Senator, and \nperhaps even more so, someone from a smaller, rural State, our ability \nto influence the outcome to receive attention and to have the \nadministration's nominees come to pay a call on us to become acquainted \nis diminished.\n  In my view, today is the day that reduces the ability for all \nSenators to have influence in the outcome of the decisions of this body \nand therefore the outcome of the future of our country.\n  I don't understand why this happened today. The empirical evidence \ndoesn't suggest that Republicans have been abusive, that the minority \nparty has failed in its obligation to be responsible.\n  We heard the words the Senator from Arizona Mr. McCain spoke about \nothers--President Obama, the majority leader of the Senate, the former \nSenator from West Virginia Mr. Byrd--about their views on this issue. \nYet the outcome today was something different, different from what they \nsaid only a short time ago.\n  It is hard to know why we did what we did today, but I know our \nability as Senators of the United States to represent the people who \nhired us to represent them has been diminished.\n  I am reluctant to attribute motives as to why this occurred. In the \nabsence of evidence that would suggest there is a justifiable reason, a \njustified reason for doing so, I am fearful that what is reported in \nthe press and elsewhere is the reason the rules were changed, which \nmakes today even more sad to me because the explanation for why the \nrules were changed was a political effort to change the topic of \nconversation in Washington, DC, and across the country.\n  The story is that the White House pressured the Senate to change its \nrules, not because the rules needed to be changed, there was abuse or \nbecause people actually believed this was a good rules change for the \nbenefit of the Senate and the country but because the Affordable Care \nAct, ObamaCare, is front and center in the national media and on the \nminds of the American people. As ObamaCare is being implemented, people \nare discovering the serious problems it presents them and their \nfamilies. Therefore, politically, we need to change the dialog, change \nthe topic. For us to use a political reason to do so much damage to the \ninstitution of the United States is such a travesty.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  I wish to mention the Affordable Care Act and talk for a moment about \nthat.\n  I am headed home and on Monday I will conduct my 1,000th townhall \nmeeting. From the time I was in the House of Representatives, I held a \ntownhall meeting in every county. In the Senate, I have conducted a \ntownhall meeting in all 105 counties since my election to the Senate. I \nam beginning again and it happens that Monday will be my 1,000th.\n  I have no doubt the serious conversations we have will not be about \nthe rules or the institution of the Senate or what happened with \nsomething called cloture filibuster, the real problem people face is \nwhat ObamaCare is doing to them and their families. I have this sense \nthere is an effort or perhaps belief--at least an effort--to convince \npeople this is only a problem with a Web site. The Web site has \ncertainly received a lot of attention over the past few weeks. Perhaps, \nunfortunately, the Web site is not the real problem.\n  The real problems we have with the Affordable Care Act passed by a \nCongress on a straight party-line vote in the Senate, similar to what \nwe saw today, and the consequences of ObamaCare are real and cannot be \nfixed by fixing the Web site. I wish those problems were only a simple \nmatter of a technician adjusting the program that has been created for \nenrollment, but it is not the case.\n\n  The mess of ObamaCare runs so much deeper. One of the consequences I \nknow I will hear about on Monday and hitting individuals and families \nacross the country right now is their cancelled insurance companies.\n  President Obama spoke about this in the description of what the \nAffordable Care Act would mean to Americans: If you like your policy, \nyou can keep it. If you like your physician, you can retain him or her.\n  The fact that millions of Americans are now losing their health care \ncoverage is not an unintended consequence. I doubt if it is anything \nthat can be fixed with anything that President Obama said in his press \nconference a few days ago. The reality is this cannot be described as \nsomething we didn't know about.\n  In fact, on the Senate floor in 2010, again, a straight party-line \nvote occurred, as we saw today, in which the opportunity to do away \nwith the provisions of the grandfather clause--again, Republicans \nunanimously supporting an Enzi amendment to change it so this wouldn't \noccur and a straight party-line vote, with Democrats voting the other \nway. It wasn't as if this was something that wasn't considered or \nthought about. It wasn't as if we only woke up 2 weeks ago and we saw \npolicies were being canceled and thought: Oh, my gosh. That is not what \nthe Affordable Care Act is about.\n  The reality is it was expected, it was built in, and it is a \nconsequence of the Affordable Care Act.\n  In order for ObamaCare to work and the exchanges to function, the \nFederal Government has to have the power to describe what policies will \nbe available to the American people. ObamaCare takes the freedom to \nmake health care decisions for an individual and their families and \nrests that authority with the Federal Government.\n  Despite the headaches, frustrations, and anger Americans and Kansans \nare experiencing now, I don't see there is a real opportunity for us to \nsolve that problem, because undoing what is transpiring with the \npolicies would undermine the foundation of ObamaCare. I consider my \ntask as a Senator from Kansas, in part, is to help people. People tell \nme in person, email, and by phone call about the consequences.\n  The stories are a wide range of challenges. I talked about this on \nthe Senate floor last week. An example is one conversation with a \nconstituent who said: My wife has breast cancer. Our policy has been \ncanceled. We have nothing to replace it with. Help me.\n\n[[Page S8445]]\n\n  These are things I can't imagine anyone in the Senate wouldn't want \nto try to help them. I don't know how we do that with the basis of \nObamaCare that designs the policies and removes the individual person \nfrom making the decisions about what is in their best interests and for \ntheir families.\n  Calling for repeal and replacement of ObamaCare is not an assertion \non my part that everything is fine with our health care system. There \nare problems with our health care delivery system, and they do need \naddressing.\n  Long before President Obama was President of the United States, my \nservice in Congress, much of the effort was trying to find ways to make \ncertain health care was available and affordable to places across my \nState, whether one lived in a community of 2,000 or 20,000 or 2 \nmillion--we don't have many communities with 2 million--200,000; people \nought to have access to health care. In my view, it is an important \ntask for all of us.\n  While some hoped ObamaCare would be the solution, it turns out to be \nthe problem. We can replace ObamaCare with practical reforms that \npromote the promise that the President made, that empower individuals, \nand give people the options they want. We need to do that. In order to \ndo that we need to set ObamaCare aside and pursue what I would call \ncommonsense, step-by-step initiatives to improve the quality of health \ncare and slow the increase or reduce the cost of health care.\n  In my view, we cannot not address preexisting conditions. We need \nprotections for people, individual coverage, without a massive \nexpansion of the Federal Government.\n  We need to make certain millions of individuals retain their current \nhealth insurance policies that they know about and they like. We need \nto make certain we continue that health care coverage by enabling \nAmericans to shop for coverage from coast-to-coast regardless of what \nState they live in. Competition will help reduce premiums. Increased \ncompetition in the insurance market is something that is of great \nvalue.\n  It will extend tax incentives for people to purchase health care \ncoverage, regardless of where they live. To assist low-income \nAmericans, we can offer tax credits for them to obtain private \ninsurance of their choice and to strengthen access to health care in \nour community health care centers. We need to make certain our \ncommunity health care centers are supported so people who have no \ninsurance or no ability to pay have access to the health care delivery \nsystem.\n  Instead of limiting the plans Americans can purchase and carry, we \nneed to give small businesses and other organizations the ability to \ncombine their efforts and get a lower price because of quantity buying. \nWe need to encourage Health Savings Accounts so people are more \nresponsible for their own health.\n  When it comes time to purchase health care coverage or access to \nhealth care, we are focused on what it would cost and we don't \noverutilize the system. People need to be empowered to have ownership \nof their health care plans and their health.\n  We spend billions of dollars on health care entitlements. We need to \nboost our Nation's support for the National Institutes of Health by \ninvesting in medical research. We can reduce the cost of health care \nfor all, save lives, and improve the quality of life.\n  Our medical workforce needs to be enhanced. We need more doctors, \nnurses, and other health care providers. They need to be encouraged to \nserve across the country in urban areas of our country where it is \ndifficult to attract and retain a physician and in rural and small \ntowns where that is a challenge as well.\n  Finally, we need to reform our medical liability system and reduce \nfrivolous lawsuits that inflate premiums and cause physicians and \nothers to practice defensive medicine.\n  Those are examples of what we can do and we can do incrementally, and \nthey seem, at least in my view, to be common sense. If we don't get it \nquite right, we have the ability to take a step back and make an \nalteration and improve it over time, as compared to the consequences--\nthe massive consequences--of this multithousand-page bill that, as we \nwere told, we had to pass so that we would know what was in it.\n  The fatal flaw of the Affordable Care Act is not its Web site but, \nrather, the underlying premise that the government can and should \ndetermine what is best for Americans regardless of what they want. We \nmust not accept a health care system built upon such a faulty \nfoundation.\n  ObamaCare stands in stark contrast to the values of individual \nliberty and freedom that have guided our country since its inception. \nAmericans should be in control of their own health care, and I will \ncontinue to fight policies that violate those values and advocate for \npolicies that guard them, but also work to make sure that all Americans \nhave better access to more affordable health care.\n  If you like your health care policy, you should be able to keep it, \nand if you like your physician, you should be able to retain him or her \nproviding health care for you. Our task is difficult, but it is one \nthat is well worth the battle. We can preserve individual liberty and \npursue goals in our country that benefit all Americans.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time on the floor this \nafternoon. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, to follow up on some of the comments I \nmade earlier about the DC Circuit, there have been accusations--and I \nguess everybody has their perspective--that seem to suggest that \nRepublicans, for ideological reasons, won't fill these judgeships \nslots.\n  I have voted for probably 90 percent of President Obama's judges--\nwell over 80, I know--and the Senate has had confirmed over 200 of \nPresident Obama's nominees. I earlier said 250--I think maybe it is \nover 200. Only two have been denied confirmation.\n  So these three judges have been appointed to a circuit where the \ncaseload has been falling, and it already, by far--by far--has the \nlowest caseload in the country based on the eight judges now active in \nthat circuit. So adding three more judges would bring that caseload \ndown substantially further and create an even more underemployed court, \nwhich we don't need to do, especially when we have courts around the \ncountry that do need more judges. We need more district judges than \ncircuit judges, but there are some circuit judge slots that need to be \nfilled. So I say that out of respect to my colleagues. But it was a \ncause for concern that the President and other supporters of his \njudicial vision have openly stated their goal for filling these slots \nis to advance their agenda.\n  President Obama says:\n\n       We are remaking the courts.\n\n  Senator Schumer:\n\n       Our strategy will be to nominate four more people for each \n     of those vacancies. We will fill up the DC Circuit one way or \n     the other.\n\n  One way or the other. In other words, no limit to what we will do to \nfill these slots that are not needed.\n  Senator Harry Reid:\n\n       Switch the majority. People don't focus much on the DC \n     Circuit. It is, some say, even more important than the \n     Supreme Court.\n\n  I have heard conservatives make somewhat that statement, but that is \ntotally wrong: It is not that important a circuit.\n  It is an important circuit. Occasionally, key administrative rulings \nget filed in the DC Circuit, and they never get appealed to the Supreme \nCourt. Their decision may be final on some administrative powers, but \nit is not equivalent to the Supreme Court--nowhere close. You can see \nthat based on how few cases they actually handle.\n  Senator Reid goes on to say:\n\n       There are three vacancies. We need at least one more, and \n     that will switch the majority.\n\n  Apparently, he is saying there is a division within the circuit and a \none-vote majority for a more restrained view of the administrative \nrulings the court deals with sometimes and a group that is more \nactivist, and he wants to switch that majority. A bunch of others have \nsaid the same thing. They have said it.\n  Doug Kendall, a liberal activist has said:\n\n\n[[Page S8446]]\n\n\n       With legislative priorities gridlocked in Congress--\n\n  Now, get this--\n\n     --they want the court to advance their political agenda that \n     cannot be passed in the Congress.\n\n  Let me repeat that. The liberal activist goal is to advance an agenda \nthat cannot be passed by the Congress--the duly elected \nrepresentatives.\n  I remember Hodding Carter, who served President Jimmy Carter, went on \none of the morning Sunday talk shows--Meet the Press or something. He \nwas one of the regular guest hosts, and he said one time: We Democrats \nand liberals have got to just admit it. We want the courts to do for us \nthat which we cannot win at the ballot box.\n  Judges shouldn't be doing that. But that is what Mr. Kendall says. He \nsays:\n\n       With legislative gridlock in Congress, the President's best \n     hope for advancing his agenda is through executive action.\n\n  That runs through the DC Circuit.\n  Nan Aaron, long active in advocating for activist Federal judges, \nsaid this:\n\n       This court is critically important. The majority has made \n     decisions that frustrated the President's agenda.\n\n  So the President is being pressured by a lot of these special \ninterests, and there are others who are advocating these kind of \nactions. But the court is a court that is well constituted to do its \nduty, and it will continue to do so and needs no more judges. We don't \nhave the money to fill them. We don't have the money to spend on it \njust to allow the President to pack the court with some of his nominees \nthat will more likely advance an agenda. At least the agenda that he \nand his activist friends seem to favor that.\n  When I came to the Senate, Senators on both sides of the aisle got to \noffer amendments. I remember Senator Specter, who was then a \nRepublican--an independent Republican and a great Senator. He loved the \nSenate. He switched parties and became a Democrat. We were right down \nthere on the floor. He was managing a health bill, and I had something \nI wanted him to accept as part of the manager's package, and he didn't \nwant to do it. So I asked him again and he didn't want to do it, and I \nasked him again and he didn't want to do it. I wanted him to agree \nbecause I didn't want to offer the amendment and have Senator Specter \noppose it because I figured I would lose the vote. So I asked him \nagain, and he finally got irritated with me bugging him and he said: \nYou are a United States Senator. If you want to offer your amendment, \noffer your amendment.\n  That is the way it was when I came to the Senate.\n  If you didn't like something, you could offer your amendment. But the \nmanagers of the bill had a lot of respect from the colleagues, and if \nthe managers urged people not to vote for it, you were likely not going \nto win, but at least you could get a vote.\n  If you promised your constituents back home that you believed in \nsomething and you were going to fight for it, you could at least get a \nvote, even if you lost. You could tell people you did that. And then \nyou could hold people accountable for voting against what some might \nlike and others would oppose, and people would know where Senators \nstand.\n  We have had a significant, dramatic reduction in the number of votes. \nI think it started in maybe the late 1990s. I know Senator Frist filled \nthe tree a number of times, but not many, over his time here. But \nSenator Reid has just exploded this process.\n  A perfect example is this Defense bill. It was on the floor all week. \nWe have normally had at least 25 or 30 votes on the Defense bill. We \nspend $500 billion in that authorization. There is a lot of concern and \ninterest about defense money is spent and policies over sexual assault \nor other issues relative to the military, and those are important \nissues that people have concerns about and are willing to vote on. Why \nshouldn't they be able to get a vote? Really, why shouldn't they be \nable to get a vote?\n  Some of the new colleagues who got elected in 2012 particularly \nwanted to change the rules of the Senate and demanded that we do \nbetter. I raised the question of what the majority leader had been \ndoing. Let's take this Defense bill I mentioned. What did he do? He \ngets the right of first recognition in the Senate, and there are only a \ncertain number of amendments that can be put on the amendment tree. He \nfills all those slots--we call it filling the tree--and then no one \nelse can get an amendment pending that the majority leader doesn't \napprove. It is really unbelievable. And like frogs in warming water, we \ndon't even realize the pan we are in has about got us cooked. We have \nMembers on our side who have missed what is happening to us. I guess \nhalf of our Members even on the Republican side were not here when all \nthis started. All they have known is this process.\n  So Senator Reid fills the tree. He says he approved two sexual \nassault amendments for the military. That is all we have had all week, \nand he immediately files cloture. He immediately files to shut off \ndebate. When he does that, he then says we are filibustering. He is \nsaying that is a filibuster and he is going to file cloture, demand \nthat we grant cloture and move the bill without any amendments.\n  This is unacceptable. So Republicans say: We are not going to end \ndebate on the bill until we have a legitimate opportunity to file \namendments to the Defense authorization bill and actually vote on some \nof the key issues facing America's national security and our men and \nwomen in uniform. We want a robust ability.\n  No.\n  Well, submit a few amendments. Well, that is too many. We are not \ngoing to vote on that one. I don't like that one. I don't like that \none. No, you can't get a vote on that one. Our Members don't want to \nvote on that. You can only have a constricted number.\n  So we have this spectacle of Senators from great States all over \nAmerica, hat in hand, bowing before the majority leader, pleading that \nhe allow them to have their amendment up for a vote. It is not right. \nIt is an alteration of the whole concept of the free and open debate \nthe Senate is all about. I truly believe it is, and we are going to \nhave to stop it.\n  I blame myself. I have complained about this probably as much or \nmaybe more than anyone on our side, but I haven't taken the action \nmaybe that we need to take to begin to confront this issue.\n  When my new young colleagues and I were discussing this, one of them \nsaid: Why, we even have to ask Senator McConnell and get his permission \nto offer our amendment.\n  How could this happen? How could a Senator from one of the great \nStates of America be in a position--a Democratic Senator. He has a \nmajority in the Senate. How could he be in a position to have to seek \nSenator McConnell's approval to call up an amendment?\n  Here is the answer. Senator Reid tells Senator McConnell: I am not \ngoing to have all of these amendments. We are only going to have five \namendments, and you can't have this one, this one, and this one.\n  What are your amendments, Senator McConnell says to Senator Reid.\n  He says: Well, these are the amendments we want to offer.\n  Senator McConnell says: Well, you have restricted my amendments. I \ndon't want to vote on those two amendments of your five. You are going \nto have to pull those down.\n  So, in a sense, that young Senator was telling me the truth. I \nsuspect Senator Reid goes back and says: Senator So-and-So, Senator \nMcConnell is objecting to your amendment. We can't call it up.\n  Well, why can't you call it up? I mean, the very idea that a Senator \nfrom New York has to ask a Senator from Kentucky whether he can have an \namendment is contrary to the approach of the Senate.\n  So filling the tree is altering the whole process. Again and again, \nSenator Reid takes the floor, he fills the tree, limits amendments, and \nfiles cloture immediately. And those of us who say: No, we are not \ngoing to agree to shut off debate through cloture because you haven't \nallowed us to have a legitimate chance to offer amendments--we vote \nagainst cloture, and he says: You are filibustering the bill. And he \nadds these up, and he says that Republicans to an unprecedented degree \nare filibustering, when all it is, is a reaction to his railroading \ntactics that have never been used to this degree in the history of the \nSenate.\n  Senator McCain was quite correct in pointing out the switching of \npositions\n\n[[Page S8447]]\n\nthat Senator Reid now takes. While he was opposing this kind of tactic \nbefore and supporting filibusters, he has now taken the exact opposite.\n  With regard to our judicial issues, the Democrats went to a retreat \nin 2000 and decided to change the ground rules. I believe Senator Reid \nwas involved, and Senator Schumer was one of the organizers, according \nto the New York Times. He said: We are going to change the ground \nrules. And they started immediately and held the first 10 Federal judge \nnominees to the courts of appeals of President Bush and filibustered. \nWe had never seen anything like that.\n\n  Now, according to this document I have, Senator Schumer says: We are \ngoing to confirm these judges one way or the other, and if you use the \nright to filibuster--which I pioneered and Senator Reid pioneered--if \nyou use that right, now that we have the majority, we are going to \nchange the rules with a simple majority, and we are not going to allow \nthese judges to be blocked even though we have no need for one of them. \nWe are going to ram it through, and we are going to make the taxpayers \npay for it, $1 million a year, one way or the other.\n  So that is where we are, and I don't believe it is good.\n  I am not opposed to modernists. I believe we need to be consistent in \nour principles. We need to defend the history of the Senate. And I \ndon't believe you can change it one year and change it back the next \nand act as if nothing significant happened. I believe there is a truth \nand I believe there are values that need to be consistently upheld--at \nleast at a minimum--so this Senate can function.\n  Senator Reid has to stop this process. He cannot continue to dominate \nthe Senate the likes of which has never happened before. There is no \none-man dictator in this Senate. We need to say no. That is just the \nway it is. There is no way the majority leader of the Senate of the \nUnited States should be dominating this body the way it is happening \ntoday and going to the ultimate of changing the rules as was done \ntoday. I feel strongly about that. We are going to continue to talk \nabout that.\n  We have an institution to preserve. Senator Byrd would never have \nallowed this to happen--as Senator McCain said--the historian of the \nSenate, who explained this great Senate's history. When I first came \nhere, he lectured to both parties and new Members about what it is all \nabout. The love he had for this institution was strong.\n  I happened to have the honor earlier today to hear Senator Levin talk \nabout this issue. He is leaving this body. He is a great Senator. He is \nsmart. I have been so impressed with how he has handled the Armed \nServices Committee, on which I am a member and he is chairman. He gets \nvirtually unanimous votes on the defense authorization bill. And the \nonly reason we had no votes on the bill on the floor today in committee \nwas because they marked the spending level above what the Budget \nControl Act says. They shouldn't have done that. Under that proposal, \nwe would spend more money than we are allowed to spend under law. But \nit was done. Otherwise, all the differences were freely discussed. We \nhad multiple amendments. Senator Levin is very precise. He allows \npeople to make amendments. He suggests compromise. He allows people \ntime to discuss with staff, come back, amend, agree, disagree, and \nfinally have a vote. It creates good spirit, and it creates a committee \nsuch that even legislation as important as this can pass unanimously \nout of committee. I believe last year the bill was unanimous out of the \nArmed Services Committee, which is hard to achieve in any legislative \nbody.\n  This is a dark day. I am disappointed at where we are. This is a \nmatter that can't just be forgotten. It won't be forgotten. We don't \nneed to act precipitously, but we need to make clear that for the \nSenate to work, individual Senators of both parties have to be free to \noffer amendments--that clearly needs to be so--and certain rights the \nminority party might have cannot be eroded anytime they become \neffective to frustrating the majority leader's desire to advance \ncertain pieces of legislation or nominees.\n  This is not going away. We will keep discussing it. I hope and pray \nwe will be able to reach some sort of solution which puts us back on \nthe right path.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1774\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, as in \nlegislative session, the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. \n1774, a bill to reauthorize the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 for 1 \nyear, introduced earlier today; that the bill be read three times and \npassed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no \nintervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I say to \nour colleagues, this is not a good day to move forward with this \nlegislation. We will be glad to give it serious attention. I know it is \nthe kind of thing we probably can clear at some point, but I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my friend \nfrom Alabama, my gym mate and friend and colleague. I would say this. \nThis is simply a renewal of a bill that has passed the Senate \nunanimously several times before. These days, technology has allowed us \nto make undetectable a firearm--no metal. It can get right through a \nmetal detector.\n  I would like to improve on this bill but, because it expires by \nDecember 9, right before we get back, I was hoping we could simply pass \nthe existing law that is on the books. I am afraid that will not \nhappen.\n  I understand why my colleague from Alabama objected. I hope as soon \nas we come back we might get this body to pass it and maybe get the \nHouse to pass it.\n  We are in a dangerous world. To allow terrorists, criminals, those \nwho are mentally infirm, to walk through metal detectors with guns that \nare made of plastic and then use them at airports, sporting events, and \nschools is a very bad thing. What makes us need to do this rather \nquickly is that a few months ago someone in Texas published on a Web \nsite a way to make a plastic gun, buying a 3-D printer for less than \n$1,000. There are over 200,000 copies, hits on that Web site. People \nhit the Web site then, so we have to move quickly here. I hope we can \nmove as soon as we get back.\n  I do understand the objection of my colleague tonight, given \neverything that has happened today, but we cannot wait. I hope nobody \nwill object to this bill. I have some worries that some might, but \nlet's hope not. This is serious stuff.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the National \nDefense Authorization Act, an amendment I have filed, Amendment No. \n2903, which supports the next generation long-range strike bomber. I \nhope we do get on the Defense bill.\n  This amendment, like many of the amendments that have been filed to \nthis bill, is both germane and noncontroversial. As has been the past \npractice with the Defense authorization bill, my amendment should be \nincluded in a managers' package that could be passed by unanimous \nconsent. In the past, when the Senate has considered the National \nDefense Authorization Act, we have had an average of around 11 recorded \nvotes. That is the historical average. This year so far we have had \ntwo. For amendments included by voice vote or unanimous consent, \nanywhere from 80 to 100 amendments tend to be the norm. In other words, \nthat is the number of amendments that we process, not have recorded \nvotes on, but amendments that\n\n[[Page S8448]]\n\nare offered to the bill and handled one way or another but end up \ngetting added to the legislation. This year we have not even been able \nto have a managers' package, which would include many of these \nnoncontroversial amendments.\n  I support Senator Inhofe, who is the ranking Republican on the Armed \nServices Committee and my Republican colleagues here in the Senate, in \nthe approach they have taken while this bill has been on the floor. \nConsidering this bill, there needs to be an open amendment process. We \nare not talking, as I said, about the hundreds of amendments that have \nbeen filed, but a reasonable number should be considered on the Senate \nfloor.\n  Everyone here is aware of the time constraints we are under, but that \nis not an excuse for bypassing an open amendment process on this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  As the Senate debates the annual Defense authorization bill, our \nmilitary continues to face increasing budget constraints. These budget \nconstraints have forced our military to prioritize and develop ways to \nincrease efficiency and reduce spending. As we look ahead, the \nDepartment of Defense must continue to focus on ways to best prepare \nfor the threats our country will face in the future.\n  On all fronts, these future threats will require an increasingly \nmobile force that relies on speed and technology to reach conflict \npoints around the world. With regard to the Air Force, this means a \nmodernization of our current fleet. According to General Welsh, the \nChief of Staff for the Air Force, the next generation long-range bomber \nis one of the top three procurement programs our Air Force must pursue \nto modernize our fleet and to meet future challenges. The other two, \nthe F-35 joint strike fighter and the KC-46 aerial refueling tanker, \nare currently underway.\n  The next generation bomber, which General Welsh has called a must-\nhave capability, will ensure our ability to operate effectively in \nanti-access and area-denial environments. As potential adversaries \ncontinue to modernize their anti-aircraft systems, our ability to \npenetrate those systems must modernize as well.\n  The Department of Defense has already begun investing in the research \nand development phase for the next generation bomber. In the meantime, \nour current bomber fleets, B-2s, B-1s, and B-52s, continue to provide \nrobust deterrent in long-range strike capabilities. The upgrades which \nare currently being made to these aircraft allow them to operate in the \nmodern environment. However, as this fleet continues to age into the \nmid-2020s, the next generation bomber will need to come online.\n  My home State of South Dakota is home of the 28th Bomb Wing, which \ncommands two of three combat squadrons operating the B-1B strategic \nbomber. The men and women of the 28th Bomb Wing have bravely defended \nour country in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  In 2011, the B-1 played a key role in Operation Odyssey Dawn, \nlaunching from Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, dropping \nmunitions in Libya, and returning home in one continuous flying \nmission. This operation marked the first time the B-1 launched combat \nsorties from the continental United States to strike targets overseas, \nand it exemplifies the B-1's crucial flexibility and capability to \nproject conventional airpower on short notice anywhere in the world. Of \nthe three aircraft in our bomber fleet, the B-1B has the highest \npayload, fastest maximum speed, and operates at the lowest cost per \nflying hour. As I have said before, the B-1 is the workhorse of our \nU.S. Air Force.\n  As the R continues for the next generation bomber, the Air Force \nhas already identified many essential capabilities to this aircraft. \nAccording to the Air Force, the next generation bomber should be usable \nacross the spectrum of conflict from isolated strikes to prolonged \ncampaigns. It should provide the Commander in Chief the option to \nstrike a target at any point on the globe, and it must be able to \npenetrate modern air defenses despite an adversary's anti-aircraft \nsystems. In terms of payload, it must be capable of carrying a wide mix \nof standoff and direct attack munitions and have the option for either \nnuclear or conventional capability.\n  As part of the strategy for development, the next generation bomber \nshould allow for the integration of mature technologies and existing \nsystems, taking into account the capabilities of other weapon systems \nto reduce program complexity.\n  While developing the next generation bomber will not be easy, the Air \nForce has learned several important lessons from its most recent \nprocurement efforts. The Department of Defense has already streamlined \nrequirements and oversight to ensure a timely decisionmaking process \nfor the next generation bomber.\n  This initiative has included efforts to reduce costs for the overall \nprogram with a goal of preventing cost overruns which have plagued \nprevious acquisition programs.\n  The Department of Defense already knows the importance of this \nprogram. As outlined in the 2015 to 2019 Program Objective Memorandum, \nthe Air Force intends to prioritize the development and acquisition of \nthe long-range strike bomber over the next several years. As the Air \nForce continues to modernize, the long-range strike bomber remains a \nmust-have capability for future combat operations.\n  This amendment is very straightforward. I hope we get back on the \nDefense authorization bill. I hope we have an open amendment process. I \nhope that amendments such as this, which are germane and \nnoncontroversial, can be included in a managers' package of amendments \nor at least considered on the floor by my colleagues in the Senate.\n  It is essential in light of the many challenges we face around the \nglobe today with the potential adversaries out there and the threats \nthat exist as we look out over the horizon that we make every \npreparation and take every necessary step to ensure our country can \ndefend itself and our allies around the world. American interests and \nAmerican national security interests are always at stake, and it is \nimportant for us to invest wisely in those types of weapon capabilities \nthat can ensure that the United States is prepared for whatever \ncontingency might develop around the world.\n  I hope we will get back on the Defense authorization bill, allow \namendments to be considered, as they have been in the past. Whenever we \nhave processed Defense bills in the past, we have had a process that \nhas allowed for consideration of many amendments. As said before, we \nhad 80 to 100 amendments in most cases and multiple rollcall votes--way \nmore than we had on this bill so far.\n  This is important to the men and women who wear the uniform of the \nU.S. military. This should be a priority for us, and it should be a \npriority for our country. I hope we can get the bill on the floor, \nprocess amendments, pass it, and get it on the President's desk where \nit can be signed into law.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, next week, Americans across the country \nwill gather with family and friends to celebrate a national tradition, \nThanksgiving. Some will give thanks for their good fortune or health \nover the past year, while others will simply be thankful to see their \nloved ones together in one place. What most of us will take for \ngranted, however, is that we will have a meal to eat and have a home in \nwhich to gather. Far too many Americans will not have that luxury. \nDuring this time of reflection, and in\n\n[[Page S8449]]\n\nhonor of National Homelessness and Hunger Awareness week, I would like \nto take a moment to speak about those who are all too often overlooked, \nthe homeless and the hungry.\n  Each and every day, millions of Americans face the uncertainty of \nwhen their next meal will be or when they will be able to feed their \nfamily. On any given night, a disgraceful number of Americans face the \nuncertainty of not knowing where they will sleep. Sadly, many have \nnowhere to turn. These Americans live in both large States and small, \nin urban centers, and small, rural towns across the country. These are \nmen, women, and children who live, work, and attend schools in our \ncommunities without the basic needs of food security and a place to \ncall home.\n  There are nearly 3,000 Vermonters who do not have a roof over their \nhead each night. And while organizations like the Committee on \nTemporary Shelter, COTS, Spectrum Youth and Family Services, and the \nVermont Coalition for Runaway and Homeless Youth do their best to \nprovide emergency shelter, services, and housing for people who are \nhomeless or marginally housed, the need far outweighs their capacity.\n  Nationally, we have made some progress to address this issue and have \nseen the number of individuals experiencing chronic homelessness and \nhomeless veterans significantly decrease. Unfortunately, the face of \nhomelessness is changing, and the number of families facing \nhomelessness has dramatically increased. Shelters are seeing an \nunprecedented number of families. Many of these families have at least \none adult who is working full time, but who does not earn enough to \nafford a place to live. Of the 4,244 people who used emergency shelters \nin Vermont last year, 952 of them were children. We know that children \nwho experience homelessness suffer from high rates of anxiety, \ndepression, behavioral problems, and below-average school performance. \nRegrettably, shelter workers are beginning to see the first signs of \ngenerational homelessness. This is unacceptable, and we owe it to those \nchildren and families to do more.\n  Across the country nearly 1 in 6 people faces hunger on a daily \nbasis; 1 in 5 children are living in a household with food insecurity. \nIn a Nation where $165 billion worth of food goes to waste each year, \nit is clear that there is enough food to feed everyone in America. We \nneed to do a better job of getting that food to those who need it most. \nFor the more than 84,000 Vermonters facing food insecurity, the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, known as 3Squares in \nVermont, is a lifeline helping to feed their families. SNAP is our \nsingle most important anti-hunger program providing assistance to \nnearly 49 million Americans in need of help to afford food. With so \nmany Americans still struggling to put food on the table, it is \ndeplorable that some in Congress continue to call for reductions to \nfood assistance as a way to solve our Nation's deficit problems.\n  No one can deny the effects of hunger on Americans, especially \nchildren. Children who live in food insecure homes are at a greater \nrisk of developmental delays, poor academic performance, nutrient \ndeficiencies, obesity and depression. Yet participation in food \nassistance programs turns these statistics on their head. Federal \nnutrition programs have been shown to decrease the risk a child will \ndevelop health problems and is associated with decreases in the \nincidence of child abuse. Children from families who receive food \nstamps have a higher achievement in math and reading and have improved \nbehavior, social interactions and diet quality than children who go \nwithout.\n  Two-thirds of SNAP beneficiaries are children, the disabled, or the \nelderly who cannot be expected to work. The remaining participants in \nthe program are subject to rigorous work requirements in order to \nreceive continuing benefits. While SNAP offers crucial support to a \nfamily's grocery expenses, the benefits far from cover a family's food \nexpenses. With a benefit average of about $1.25 per person, per meal, \nit is understandable that families typically fall short on benefits by \nthe middle of the month.\n  Across the Nation, wages have remained flat as prices for every day \nessentials like food, heat, and especially housing, continue to rise. \nAt the same time, as more families find themselves in need of some \nhelp, the programs that provide that safety net have been devastated by \ncuts over the past several years and continue to be targeted for even \nfurther reductions in the name of protecting tax loopholes for \ncorporate jets and oil companies.\n  The budget decisions made in Congress have real impacts for real \npeople. Reductions to funding for the organizations providing emergency \nshelter, or programs that build much needed affordable housing, means \nmore Americans face housing insecurity. Cuts to the SNAP program means \nbenefits will run out earlier in the month and even though donations to \nfood banks and soup kitchens are down, they will see a record number of \nfamilies looking for a little help to just make it to the next month.\n  As the budget conferees discuss a path forward, it is essential that \nthey find a common sense compromise to replace sequestration and put an \nend to the deficit reduction on the backs of those most in need. There \nare just too many people that are one unforeseen expense away from a \ndesperate financial situation that could result in them losing the roof \nover their head, and the means to feed their family. We can all agree \nthat there is something fundamentally wrong with the reality that \nchildren living in one of the wealthiest nations in the world do not \nknow when they will get their next meal and do not have a safe place to \nsleep at night.\n  Every child in America deserves a fair shot. This is why I have \nchampioned the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. Programs authorized by \nthe RHYA have successfully helped countless runaway and homeless youth \nand their families in Vermont and across the nation over the last 30 \nyears, but we can and must do more. We must recognize the importance of \ninvesting in our Nation's youth, and direct resources where they are \nneeded most. Programs authorized by the RHYA expired at the end of \nSeptember. I hope that we can work to reauthorize and improve RHYA by \naddressing the needs of children in the most vulnerable communities, \nand provide services that meet the needs of youth who identify as LGBT \nand the young victims of trafficking or exploitation. We need more \ntraining and resources to help our grantees meet the needs of young \nvictims, and that is what the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act provides.\n  There are families that are having difficulty making ends meet. We \nmust pass a farm bill that does not include the extreme House cuts to \nSNAP benefits at levels 10 times as high as the bipartisan Senate bill \nand nearly twice as high as the House's original bill. Those cuts would \nmean that each year, an average of three million people will be kicked \noff food assistance, and hundreds of thousands of children will lose \naccess to school means. I hope that the bipartisan efforts of the \nSenate to pass a responsible farm bill will help produce a good farm \nbill out of conference that does not contain these deep and damaging \ncuts to food assistance.\n  We owe it to the American people to put politics aside and especially \nduring this time of year, to give a voice to those who are most in \nneed, to those often overlooked and marginalized and to start making \nmeaningful progress to eliminating homelessness and hunger in this \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8449-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8449-S8450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JAMES L. HURLEY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a friend \nof mine and a good friend to the Commonwealth, Mr. James L. Hurley, on \nhis recent inauguration as the 20th president of the University of \nPikeville. A graduate of the class of 1999 himself, President Hurley's \nnew post makes him the school's first alumnus to serve as president.\n  President Hurley was sworn in last month at the Eastern Kentucky Expo \nCenter in Pikeville, KY. He succeeds former Governor Paul Patton in the \nposition. Patton previously appointed Hurley as the institution's vice \npresident and special assistant. James is a native of eastern Kentucky \nand is married to Tina, also an alumna of the University of Pikeville.\n  President Hurley, after earning his bachelor's degree at the \ninstitution he now leads, earned a master's degree in educational \nleadership from Indiana\n\n[[Page S8450]]\n\nUniversity, a rank I in instructional supervision from the University \nof Kentucky, and a doctorate in higher education leadership and policy \nat Morehead State University. As an undergraduate he was a student-\nathlete on the Pikeville men's basketball team.\n  I commend President Hurley for his great achievement in reaching this \nposition and certainly wish him all the best in his leadership of the \nUniversity of Pikeville. I look forward to working with him to \naccomplish great things for the school, the region, and the \nCommonwealth.\n  Mr. President, an article that appeared in the University of \nPikeville campus newspaper after the announcement of his ascension to \nthe presidency described James L. Hurley's accomplishments and goals in \nhis new position. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  [From the University of Pikeville Campus Publication, May 21, 2012]\n\n          Hurley Named University of Pikeville President-Elect\n\n       Pikeville, KY--The University of Pikeville Board of \n     Trustees has named James L. Hurley president-elect of the \n     institution, effective July 1, 2013. Hurley currently serves \n     as the vice president for enrollment and retention and \n     special assistant to the president.\n       The action was taken during the board's spring meeting May \n     18. University President Paul Patton informed the board that \n     he would not ask for an extension of his contract, which \n     expires June 30, 2013.\n       ``The Patton-Hurley team has brought us tremendous \n     progress,'' said Board Chairman Terry Dotson. ``The Hurley-\n     Patton team will continue that progress.''\n       An experienced educator and administrator, Hurley spent 11 \n     years in the public education system, serving in numerous \n     roles, including as principal, assistant principal, dean of \n     students, teacher, and athletic coach. He joined Patton at \n     the University in 2009, providing leadership in the \n     administration of campus operations, program development, \n     strategic initiatives, recruiting, financial aid and \n     retention efforts.\n       Along with his wife, Tina, he is a graduate of the \n     University of Pikeville, formerly Pikeville College. He \n     earned his master's degree from Indiana University, a Rank I \n     from the University of Kentucky and his superintendent's \n     certification at Morehead State University. He will complete \n     his doctorate at Morehead in the fall.\n       ``James Hurley is bright, energetic, motivated and a self-\n     starter. He has been an integral part of the tremendous \n     progress we have made at the University these past three \n     years,'' said Patton. ``As our chief executive officer, he \n     will lead this University to new heights.''\n       The board also voted to establish the position of \n     chancellor, which Patton will assume on July 1, 2013. As \n     chancellor, Patton, who was governor of Kentucky from 1995 to \n     2003, will represent the University and concentrate on \n     fundraising.\n       ``I am humbled and honored by the board of trustees' \n     decision in naming me president-elect to succeed Governor \n     Patton next year,'' said Hurley. ``My wife and I love this \n     institution and we look forward to our continued journey with \n     the administration, faculty, staff and students at UPIKE. \n     Governor Patton's willingness to accept the role of \n     university chancellor will make for a seamless and smooth \n     transition.''\n       The announcement also has historical significance, as \n     Hurley will become the first alumnus to lead the institution, \n     which was established in 1889 to serve the youth of \n     Appalachia.\n       ``A great university can measure its worth by the quality \n     of its alumni,'' said Kay Hammond, president of the Alumni \n     Association. ``Vice President Hurley is certainly one of our \n     most accomplished. He has always sought to protect and \n     preserve all that is special about the University of \n     Pikeville.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8450-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8450-S8451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL RURAL HEALTH DAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today is National Rural Health Day. More \nthan 59 million Americans--nearly one in five--call rural communities \ntheir home, including more than 9 million Medicare beneficiaries. These \nsmall towns, farming communities, and frontier areas depend on rural \nhospitals for their health care needs. And their needs are as unique as \nthe communities they live in.\n  Rural areas are sparsely populated and are disproportionately older. \nMore families in rural communities tend to live with less income than \ntheir urban counterparts, and patients tend to be physically isolated, \nwhich can substantially increase travel costs associated with medical \ncare. These needs are not easily addressed by a one-size-fits-all \napproach. Rural providers must rely on providing affordable primary \ncare and a system that values prevention, wellness and, above all, care \ncoordination.\n  In Illinois, there are 102 counties, 83 of which are rural. Of these \n83 rural counties in Illinois, 81 are designated as primary care \nshortage areas, which affects nearly 2 million Illinoisans. To \nincentivize providers to work in underserved areas, States rely on the \nNational Health Service Corps--NHSC--Loan Repayment program, the NHSC \nScholars program, and the State Loan Repayment program. These programs \nhave been a mainstay of rural recruitment. This year, through the \ncoordination of loan repayment programs, an estimated 231,000 patients \nin rural Illinois were able to access care. These programs provide \nrecruitment tools for facilities in rural parts of the State.\n  Recruiting primary care professionals to rural communities is \nchallenging. Many programs, including these recruitment programs, \nrequire more funding.\n  New approaches are needed to increase the workforce in rural America. \nFor instance, the Federal Government and States should look at \nlicensure and new payment models that would allow allied professionals, \nincluding advanced practice nurses and physician assistants living in \nthese communities, to help meet the growing demand for primary health \ncare services.\n  Fortunately for Illinois, our network of critical access hospitals, \nrural health clinics, and federally qualified health centers work with \ntheir limited resources to provide exceptional care in rural \ncommunities. Critical access hospitals provide local access to \nhealthcare for more than one million people in Illinois in areas that \nare medically underserved and have too few primary care professionals.\n  More needs to be done to help rural communities improve access to \nprimary medical care. About 10 percent of physicians practice in rural \nAmerica despite the fact that nearly one-fourth of the population lives \nin these areas.\n  This is a fact that Cody Holst and his wife know all too well. Cody \nis a Hancock County cattleman who lives in Carthage, IL. Last year, \nCody's wife Erin was rushed to the emergency department at Memorial \nHospital. Erin was expecting but was only 32 weeks along in her \npregnancy. Doctors told Cody that typically they would recommended she \nbe flown to Peoria, IL, approximately 100 miles away. But in this case \nthey did not have that much time. Erin would need an emergency C-\nSection. Any delay in this operation would jeopardize Erin's pregnancy \nand her life. Fortunately, the operation was successful and led to the \nhealthy birth of Reese Holst. If Memorial Hospital was not in the \ncommunity and Cody had to travel any further, his wife and child may \nnot be here today.\n  This is just one of the many examples of what critical access \nhospitals are able to do for families in these communities. Critical \naccess hospitals make sure Americans in small communities, such as Cody \nand his family, still have access to high quality health care.\n  The Affordable Care Act begins to address some of these urgent issues \nfacing the Nation's health care system, such as lack of access to \nhealth insurance coverage. Nearly 8 million rural Americans under the \nage of 65 will have insurance under the law. More Americans will gain \naccess to private health insurance and Medicaid, increasing the demand \nfor care by rural hospitals and providers. Many of the provisions in \nthe law are aimed at solving this very challenge. For example, the \nAffordable Care Act dedicates funding to evaluate current payment \nsystems, particularly the Medical Home Model of care that incentivizes \ncare coordination.\n  As the demand for primary care providers increases, the Affordable \nCare Act aims to extend the role of nurse practitioners in primary care \nsettings and provides $15 million for ten nurse-managed clinics that \ntrain nurses and provide primary health care services in medically \nunderserved communities. The law also includes more than $200 million \nto training primary care doctors, nurses, and physician assistants and \nexpanded the National Health Service Corps program by $1.5 billion. The \nAffordable Care Act has provided a great foundation to solving these \nproblems, but more needs to be done.\n  Today, on National Rural Health Day, I urge my colleagues to join me \nin\n\n[[Page S8451]]\n\nrecognizing the unique healthcare needs and opportunities that exist in \nrural communities and work together to solve the issues these \ncommunities face.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8451-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CHAD PREGRACKE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the outstanding work \nof a great Illinoisan, Chad Pregracke, who has just been named a 2013 \nCNN Hero.\n  A native of East Moline, IL, Chad grew up knowing how important the \nMississippi River was to his community. He spent a lot of time on the \nriver with his parents, KeeKee and Gary, and his older brother Brent. \nChad saw how badly the river was being polluted and knew something had \nto be done. When no one else stepped up, he decided he would.\n  In 1997, he received a small grant and spent that summer cleaning up \npart of the river on his own, sorting through the trash on his parents' \nfront lawn.\n  In 1998, when he was just 23 years old, Chad founded his own non-\nprofit--Living Lands & Waters. The venture has now grown to a full \nstaff and fleet of barges. Living Lands & Waters relies on teams of \nvolunteers throughout the Nation, with a heavy focus on the \nMississippi, Illinois and Ohio River regions.\n  Living Lands & Waters organizes about 70 cleanups a year in 50 \ndifferent communities. Chad estimates that his group has worked with \nabout 70,000 volunteers to remove more than 7 million pounds of trash \nfrom the Nation's waterways. Among the trash they have pulled from \nriver are more than 67,000 tires, 218 washing machines and four pianos.\n  Not all of their finds are the size of pianos. Chad boasts an \nextensive collection of messages in bottles he has found over the \nyears. To date, Chad has retrieved 64 of these bottles, often hundreds \nof miles from their place of origin. They include everything from love \nletters and lottery tickets to treasure maps and simple notes of good \nwishes.\n  Chad's hard work has earned him significant recognition and praise, \nmost recently being honored by CNN as one of its 2013 Heroes. I am \npleased to add my thanks to Chad Pregracke for working to improve our \ncommunities by saving our rivers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8451-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMON SENSE GUN SALES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the holiday season draws close, millions \nof Americans are shopping online for clothes, toys, and other holiday \ngifts. But alarmingly, at the same time, convicted felons, domestic \nabusers, terrorists, and other dangerous people are able to go online \nand just as easily shop for something else: guns.\n  Studies have shown that thousands of firearms are bought and sold \nonline every year. Many of these sales exploit loopholes in the \nbackground check laws designed to keep our communities safe. Under \ncurrent law, an individual buying a gun at a brick-and-mortar, \nFederally licensed firearm dealer must pass a simple and quick \nbackground check to make sure that, among other things, they haven't \nbeen convicted of a felony, or aren't a domestic abuser, or haven't \nbeen adjudicated to be dangerously mentally ill. Department of Justice \nstatistics have shown that Brady background checks have blocked more \nthan two million instances in which a dangerous individual attempted to \nobtain a deadly weapon. But a significant loophole in this law is now \nwell known: felons and other prohibited persons can simply go to a \n``private seller,'' as opposed to a licensed dealer, and buy a gun \nwithout a background check.\n  It has been estimated that as of September 2013, about 67,000 \nfirearms were listed for sale online from private sellers. Many of the \npeople buying guns from these sellers have no intention of committing \nany sort of crime and would easily pass a background check. But as a \ndisturbing new report recently released by Mayors Against Illegal Guns \nmakes clear, all too often, the Internet serves as a black market where \ndangerous individuals can get their hands on weapons. According to this \nreport, 1 in 30 would-be firearm purchasers on www.armslist.com has a \ncriminal record that legally prohibits them from purchasing or owning a \ngun.\n  This means, according to the report, that more than 25,000 guns of \nalmost any kind may be transferred to prohibited persons through \nwww.armslist.com in any given year. At any time, a convicted felon can \nlog on and purchase a military-style weapon from a ``private seller.'' \nFor example, one ``private party'' listing on the website touts a \nmilitary-style semiautomatic rifle as the ``World War III special,'' \nand boasts that the weapon can ``provide rapid defensive fire when \nneeded.'' Such a weapon has no sporting purpose. It is designed to kill \nas many people as possible, as quickly as possible. Should it really be \navailable for anyone to purchase, at any time, without a background \ncheck?\n  This leads to dangerous and sometimes tragic outcomes. For example, \nthe report cites a man from North Carolina who, earlier this year, \nposted an ad on the Web site seeking to purchase a military-style \nassault rifle specifically from a private seller. The investigation \nfound that this prospective buyer had previously been convicted of \nseveral felonies, including robbery with a dangerous weapon, and would \nhave failed a background check. In another case, Zina Daniel of \nWisconsin obtained a restraining order against her husband which \nlegally prohibited him from purchasing a firearm. Days later, the \nhusband bought a semiautomatic handgun from a dealer through \narmslist.com, and went to find Ms. Daniel at her workplace. There, he \nused the weapon to murder her and two others, injure four more, and \nkill himself.\n  Had these individuals been confronted with a simple background check \nat a brick-and-mortar gun shop, they may have been turned away. Why \nshould a purchase from the online marketplace be any different? Study \nafter study, conducted by organizations across the political spectrum, \nhave shown that around 90 percent of the American public supports the \nenactment of background checks on all gun sales. The vast majority of \nour constituents agree that wherever someone is buying a gun--at the \nshop around the corner, from the Internet, from a gun show, or even \nfrom the back of a van in a dark alley--they should be able to prove \nthat they can pass a simple and quick background check.\n  We must not wait until the next unstable individual buys a deadly \nweapon online and turns it on our communities. We should act to protect \nour families, our neighbors, and our loved ones. I urge my colleagues \nto take up and pass background check legislation to shut down the \nonline black market for illegal firearm purchases. It's just common \nsense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8451-3", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8451-S8452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MAGGIE McINTOSH\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Since 2002, Maggie has represented the \npeople of northern Baltimore City as the Delegate for the 43rd District \nof Maryland.\n  She is also an active member of the Maryland Democratic Party. She \npreviously served for 8 years as a member of the Democratic Central \nCommittee from Baltimore City.\n  Maggie is a woman of many firsts. She was the first female majority \nleader in the Maryland House of Delegates. She was also the first woman \nto serve as chair of the Environmental Matters Committee.\n  Maggie is also a fighter. One of her many passions is education. She \nwas a Baltimore City public school teacher, and an adjunct professor at \nCatonsville Community College and the University of Baltimore.\n  Maggie is also passionate about environmental issues, Maryland \neconomic development, equal rights, and the effort to elect more women \nin Maryland. She has an extraordinary record as a legislature, and she \nis only now getting started.\n  Additionally, Maggie is a trusted friend. I have known her for many \nyears. Maggie previously served as my State director and campaign \nmanager--I call her ``Boss Maggie.''\n  Today, I wish to recognize her for her years of service to Johns \nHopkins University.

Mr. President, today, I wish to honor my long-time \nstaff member, Denise Nooe, on the occasion of her retirement.\n  Denise has been a part of my team for 30 years. She began working for \nme in 1983 as a constituent services representative when I was \nrepresenting Maryland's Third District in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, and she was a key part of my team when I transitioned \nfrom the House to the Senate. Denise has been the outstanding director \nof my Annapolis office since 1987.\n  Denise and I have similar backgrounds. We both believe in the power \nof community organizing to make a difference. We believe the best ideas \ncome from the people. We both have master's degrees in social work, and \nbelieve in the importance of helping individuals and serving our \ncommunities. We believe that the people have a right to know, to be \nheard and to be represented.\n  Throughout her career, Denise has strived to make a difference in \npeople's lives. She has utilized her social work skills every day in \nunderstanding how she can best serve the people of Maryland, and help \nthem to the best of her ability. As a caseworker, she has helped \nthousands of veterans and military personnel negotiate the labyrinth of \nthe Federal bureaucracy. She has brought solace to families when their \nloved one has died in the line of duty. She has made sure that the \nbrave soldier who died for his Nation could be buried at Arlington. She \nwas vigilant in getting the widow and children the benefits that the \nservicemember earned for them.\n  Our wounded warriors could always come to her with a problem and be \nconfident that it would be managed for them. She has represented me on \nhundreds of occasions on Veterans Day and Memorial Day and any day that \nveterans and our brave military needed me. She has also been the link \nto my Veterans Advisory Board and the Governor's Commission on \nVeterans.\n  Denise also represents me throughout Maryland, most especially in \nAnne Arundel County. She was instrumental in the creation of the BWI \npartnership and the Fort Meade Alliance. State and local officials in \nAnne Arundel County know she is my catcher's mitt. Actually they think \nshe is the Senator, because we are both short in height. But Denise is \nalso tall in stature among her colleagues, for certainly she has no \npeer.\n  Denise has recently been in a key advocacy role assisting me in my \nefforts to reduce the horrific backlog of Veteran's disability claims \nin Baltimore. She has been my boots on the ground in Baltimore and \nplayed an important role in rallying and assisting the Veterans Service \nOrganizations during this difficult time.\n  Throughout these wonderful 30 years, Denise has been an invaluable \nmember of my staff.

Today I want to \nrecognize her for all of the important work she has done, tell the \nworld that I hold her in the highest regard and wish her the very best \non her retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8452-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8452-S8453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          50TH ANNIVERSARY OF JOHN F. KENNEDY'S ASSASSINATION\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, 50 years after the assassination of John \nF. Kennedy, America still mourns his loss. For those of us who were \ninspired by his Presidency, it is easy to understand why. In a time of \nindifference, he reawakened this Nation to the finest meaning of \ncitizenship--placing public service ahead of private interest.\n  That is why a half a century later, he remains a powerful symbol of a \ntime of soaring idealism in America, when our people believed our \ncountry could do anything--even go to the moon.\n  John Kennedy also inspires Americans who know him only from history \nbooks or from the stories their parents and grandparents tell of that \nall-too-brief shining moment that was his Presidency.\n  John Kennedy was in the White House for only 1,000 days, not even 3 \nyears. But his achievements exceeded his years. It's easy to dismiss \nhis Presidency as one of rhetoric more than results. But to do so \nignores the New Frontier he pioneered--a new era of economic growth, \nspace exploration, civil rights advancements, conservation of natural \nresources, nuclear disarmament and generations of Americans who have \nmade public service a way of life.\n  John Kennedy's immortal words, especially those of his Inaugural \nAddress, still call us to action--to think beyond our own self-\ninterests, and to do what is best for our country and the people of the \nworld.\n  Like millions of Americans, I vividly recall the exact moment on that \ncold day of November 22, 1963, when I heard the shocking news from \nDallas that the President had been shot. I was a junior at Farmington \nHigh School. By the time we were told of the tragedy, it was just after \nlunch and my classmates and I walked into English class. Mr. Simon \nMatthews, our English teacher who also was one of our football coaches, \nbroke the unspeakable news.\n  Mr. Matthews announced austerely, ``The President has been shot.'' We \nthought he was joking and teased him to quit kidding us. He said again, \n``The President has just been assassinated,'' and we were sent home \nfrom school early.\n  When I arrived home, I was stunned to walk in to my living room and \nfind it filled by my entire family. I had never seen my grandfather or \nfather or my uncles leave work early. It was a somber time for every \nmember of my family as we tried to come to grips with the terrible \nnews. It was just so hard to believe our President could be taken from \nus. But he was.\n  Three days later, it was decided that our family would go to \nWashington to pay our respects to the President. As an eager 16 year \nold who had just gotten my license a few months before, I volunteered \nto drive us in Papa's '58 Cadillac. Six of us piled into the car and \nmade the trip to our Nation's capital.\n  I will never forget, as the caisson bearing the President's casket \nwas led down Pennsylvania Avenue on its way to Arlington Cemetery, my \ncousins and I climbed into the trees for a better view of the \nprocession. We saw the President's stricken family and friends, the \nsomber Washington dignitaries and world leaders, and Black Jack, the \nriderless horse with boots turned backwards in the stirrups, a \nheartbreaking symbol of the loss of a great leader. As I watched the \nprocession move slowly to the sad cadence of military drums, I thought \nof the time I had been fortunate enough to meet members of the Kennedy \nfamily.\n  I was working on my go-cart downstairs in the garage when they \nvisited my family in Farmington as then-Senator Kennedy was preparing \nfor the West Virginia presidential primary. My hands were dirty and \ngreasy, but my mother insisted that I wipe them clean and come upstairs \nto meet a few people. As I climbed the steps, I smelled my grandmother, \nMama Kay's, spaghetti. Everyone had gathered at the table for dinner \nand an exciting discussion about the political race ramping up in West \nVirginia. That was the day I shook hands with the Kennedys.\n  John Kennedy and his family spent so much time campaigning in West \nVirginia that he once quipped that ``West Virginia'' was the third word \nhis daughter Caroline learned to pronounce. He once boasted that he was \nthe only Presidential candidate in history, other than West Virginian \nJohn Davis in 1924, ``who knows where Slab Fork is and has been \nthere.''\n  John Kennedy came to West Virginia to show that a Catholic could win \nin a predominantly Protestant State. Americans worried that a Catholic \nPresident would be controlled by the Pope and that Catholic Mass would \nbe held in the White House every day. Let me just note here that John \nKennedy carried the West Virginia primary in a landslide--with 60.8 \npercent. He won our votes and our heart. He went on to become, as he \nput it, ``not the Catholic candidate for President,'' but ``the\n\n[[Page S8453]]\n\nDemocrat Party's candidate for President, who happens also to be a \nCatholic.'' But there was one Catholic Mass in the White House, on \nNovember 23, 1963--a Requiem Mass for the slain President.\n  As I reflect now on how much life intersected with John Kennedy's \nlife, I prefer to think about the beginning of the Kennedy Presidency \nrather than its tragic ending. I prefer to remember his Inaugural \nAddress. It was just 1,355 words and 14 minutes long, but it set in \nmotion a generation of Americans with a passion for public service.\n  Some were inspired to defend liberty as soldiers, sailors, Marines \nand airmen. Some would march for civil rights in the South. Some would \njoin the Peace Corps and become ambassadors of peace in villages \nthroughout the world. And some would answer the call to service by \nseeking public office.\n  John Kennedy was a powerful and positive force in my life and the \nlife of our Nation. To me, he embodied a time when politics could be \nharnessed to higher aspirations, to do good things for the country.\n  Not only did his Inaugural Address famously challenge us to ask \nourselves what we can do for our country, it also provided timeless \nadvice on how to overcome the bitterness of partisan politics. An \nelection, he said, is ``not a victory of party, but a celebration of \nfreedom,'' not an end but a beginning ``signifying renewal.'' That is \nstill good advice.\n  John Kennedy was a committed Democrat and few people loved politics \nmore than he and his family. But he understood--as he wrote in his book \nProfiles In Courage, that ``there are few if any issues where all the \ntruth and all the right and all the angels are on one side.'' He \naccepted the fact that democracy relies on competing views and vigorous \ndebate.\n  But he did not believe the objective should be to win political power \nbut to solve our country's problems. As he once said, ``Let us not \ndespair but act. Let us not seek the Republican answer or the \nDemocratic answer but the right answer. Let us not seek to fix the \nblame for the past--let us accept our own responsibility for the \nfuture.''\n  That is what I have always tried to do--to find the right answer and \nto do what is best for my country and the generations of Americans to \nfollow. That is why, 50 years after John Kennedy's death, I still try \nto follow his admonition to ``go forth to lead the land we love, asking \nHis blessing and His help knowing that here on earth God's work must \ntruly be our own.''\n  He acknowledged that this was not the work of a hundred days, or of a \nthousand days, or of one administration, or of a lifetime, but of \ngenerations. Even so, he said, ``Let us begin.'' Mr. President, to you \nand to all our colleagues in the Senate, I say: Let us continue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8453-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE CAREGIVERS ACT\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, November is National Family Caregivers \nMonth. As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I \nwould like to take a moment to discuss the important role caregivers \nplay in the lives of our Nation's veterans as they cope with the \nvisible and invisible wounds of war.\n  For generations, as the men and women of our armed forces returned \nhome with serious injuries sustained overseas, their wives, husbands, \nparents and other family members stepped in to care for them. These \nfamily members have often provided this care at significant personal \nsacrifice. Their dedication to the needs of injured veterans has often \nresulted in lost professional opportunities, negative impact on their \nown physical and mental health, and reduction in income.\n  Under the ``Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of \n2010,'' a number of important benefits were made available to these \ncaregivers for the first time, with additional services and benefits \nmade available to caregivers of seriously injured post-9/11 veterans \nand their families. These additional services and benefits include a \ntax-free monthly stipend, travel assistance, health insurance, mental \nhealth services and counseling, caregiver training and respite care.\n  Passage of the Caregivers Act served as an important step in ensuring \nthe caregivers of our newest generation of veterans received the \nadditional resources to provide the best possible care for their loved \nones. However, limiting eligibility for these additional services and \nbenefits to caregivers of post-9/11 veterans created an inequity \nbetween caregivers of the newest generation of veterans and the tens of \nthousands of hardworking, dedicated caregivers who provide care to all \nother veterans.\n  In an effort to address the disparity, I introduced legislation \nearlier this year that would extend the services and benefits of the \nCaregiver Program to caregivers of veterans of all eras. Through this \nexpansion, severely injured pre-9/11 veterans and their families may \nnow leverage the benefits from which, until now, only post-9/11 \nveterans have benefited. The Congressional Budget Office estimates this \nbill would expand access to services to approximately 70,000 caregivers \nof pre-9/11 veterans. I am pleased the committee passed my legislation, \nS. 851, the Caregivers Expansion and Improvement Act of 2013 earlier \nthis year and am working to bring it before the full Senate for a vote.\n  All caregivers of our Nation's injured veterans deserve our full \nsupport. This is an issue of equity. As a long-standing advocate for \nveterans, I will continue to work to ensure caregivers have the \nresources they need. We have learned from experience and research that \nveterans are best served when they can live as independently as \npossible. I hope my fellow Members will help me honor the commitment \nthis country has to all of its veterans by supporting S. 851 when it \ncomes to the Floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8453-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO NICHOLAS GIACCONE\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and \ncongratulate Chief of Police Nicholas Giaccone of the Hanover, NH \nPolice Department for his 40 years of dedicated service to the law \nenforcement profession, the Town of Hanover, and the State of New \nHampshire.\n  Chief Giaccone began his law enforcement career in 1973 as a patrol \nofficer with the Town of Hanover, home of Dartmouth College. Nicholas \nGiaccone was promoted to detective in 1977; detective sergeant in 1987; \nand assumed the role of acting chief of police, then chief of police in \nJuly of 1994. As a detective sergeant, Nicholas Giaccone helped lead \nthe investigation into a double homicide of two graduate students, \nwhich culminated in the successful prosecution and conviction of Haile \nSelassie Girmay on March 2, 1993.\n  He was chief of police when two Dartmouth professors, Half and \nSusanne Zantop, were killed inside their Etna home in 2001, garnering \nnational headlines for days. Chief Giaccone's diligence in ensuring the \ndepartment properly handled the vital physical evidence at the scene, \nled to the successful convictions of Robert Tulloch and James Parker. \nThey were sentenced on April 4, 2002.\n  During his long tenure as a police chief, Chief Giaccone has been a \nleader in promoting community oriented policing; in improving public \nsafety within the State of New Hampshire; and in promoting sound public \npolicies and practices, which have helped keep New Hampshire one of the \nsafest States in the Nation. Chief Giaccone has worked tirelessly with \ncommunity leaders, New Hampshire's Legislature, and other public \nofficials, to better the administration of justice and promote public \nsafety.\n  As Chief Nicholas Giaccone celebrates his retirement, I want to \ncommend him on a job well done, and I ask my colleagues to join me in \nwishing him well in all future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8453-3", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8453-S8454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES LANE, JR.\n\n Mr. JOHANNS.

Mr. Lane passed \naway on November 8, 2013, at the age of 88. He lived a life dedicated \nto defending our country and helping others in the greater Omaha \ncommunity.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Lane's military career began in 1943, when he \nentered\n\n[[Page S8454]]\n\nthe Cadet Corps at the Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, AL. He soon \nbecame a fighter pilot and joined the Army Air Corps 99th Pursuit \nSquadron. In World War II, Lane flew 26 combat missions, flying P-51 \nMustang fighter planes. Following the war, Lieutenant Colonel Lane \ncontinued his service in the U.S. Air Force for 27 years, until his \nretirement in 1970. His last station was at Strategic Air Command, \nOffutt Air Base, near Bellevue, NE. Following his service, Lane and his \nfamily remained in the area.\n  In 2007, Lane was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal by President \nGeorge W. Bush in recognition of his bravery, courage and sacrifice \nduring World War II. Along with his fellow Tuskegee Airmen, he bravely \nrose above the racial divisions of the time to serve our country with \nhonor and valor. In addition to their courageous service, the Tuskegee \nAirman provided inspiration to our country, paving the way towards \ngreater equality for all Americans.\n  As a civilian, Lieutenant Colonel Lane continued to serve his \ncommunity. As Executive Director of the Greater Omaha Community Action \nInc.--GOCA, he fought poverty on a number of fronts by addressing \nhunger, substance abuse, mental health and others. Spanning his tenure \nof more than two decades at the agency, he was known as being \ndetermined efforts to help the impoverished achieve self-sufficiency.\n  Demonstrating Lieutenant Colonel Lane's tireless passion for service, \nupon retirement he continued to volunteer his time, talent and \nresources to a number of important causes in the Omaha area. He founded \nthe 99th Pursuit Cadet Squadron of the Nebraska Wing of the Civil Air \nPatrol, the official auxiliary of the United States Air Force.

Mr. President, each November we \nrecognize National Native American Heritage Month to honor the \ntradition, culture, contributions, achievements, and sacrifices of \nthose that originally inhabited this great Nation. With over 5 million \nindividuals of Native American descent in the United States, it is \nimportant to celebrate the instrumental impact Native American culture \nhas had on American history. National Native American Heritage Month is \nan opportunity to focus our attention on tribal sovereignty by ensuring \ntrust responsibilities are upheld and government-to-government \nrelationships with tribes across the Nation are strengthened.\n  This month has added significance to me, as I represent a state with \nnine treaty tribes. I would like to personally acknowledge and honor \nSouth Dakota's nine treaty tribes: the Cheyenne River Sioux, the Crow \nCreek Sioux, the Flandreau Santee Sioux, the Lower Brule Sioux, the \nOglala Sioux, the Rosebud Sioux, the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate, the \nStanding Rock Sioux, and the Yankton Sioux. Each tribe brings rich \ncultures and histories that greatly benefit all South Dakotans, not \njust in November, but throughout the year.\n  American Indians across the United States have served and continue to \nserve in our Armed Forces at rates higher than any other ethnic group, \nand their dedication and commitment to the United States is unwavering. \nThis month, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, \nLower Brule Sioux Tribe, Oglala Sioux Tribe, Rosebud Sioux Tribe, \nStanding Rock Sioux Tribe, Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate and Yankton Sioux \nTribe were honored with Congressional Gold Medals for the contributions \nof their code talkers during World Wars I and II. The use of tribal \nlanguages equipped our Armed Forces with a system of communication that \nwas not decoded. The valiant contributions of tribal code talkers to \nthe United States are unparalleled and to be commended.\n  It is also important to reflect on the numerous contributions Native \nAmericans across the country have made in our society this November. \nCountless dedicated individuals continue to work on the ground in \nIndian Country to improve tribal communities for future generations. \nHowever, the Federal government must also uphold its trust \nresponsibility with tribes and continue to improve access to \nhealthcare, education, and adequate housing. Thoughtful communication \nand collaboration between tribal and federal leaders on these issues is \nnecessary to advance the quality of life for American Indians.\n  This November, I urge Americans to participate in the celebration of \nNative American Heritage Month by taking a moment to learn more about \nthe heritage, culture, and various contributions Native Americans have \nmade to the United States throughout our shared history. I would like \nto acknowledge and praise the more than 70,000 American Indians in \nSouth Dakota who enrich our communities on a daily basis. Education and \nawareness of tribal histories will enable us to move forward as a \nNation which embraces the diversity of all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8454-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8454-S8455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO CHARLIE E. WILLIAMS, JR.\n\n Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I recognize and pay tribute to \nCharlie E. Williams, Jr., who will retire as director of the Defense \nContract Management Agency--DCMA--on November 25, 2013, after more than \n30 years of service to our Nation.\n  Director Williams began his public service career in 1982 through the \nAir Force Logistics Command at Kelly Air Force Base in Texas. Over the \nfollowing years, his career included a series of appointments with \never-increasing responsibility. He was the Deputy Assistant Secretary \nof the Air Force for Contracting, in the Office of the Assistant \nSecretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, a U.S. member of the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization's Airborne Early Warning and Control \nProgram Board of Directors, the team lead of Program Executive Officer \nand Designated Acquisition Commander programs, and finally, Director of \nDCMA.\n  Director Williams was stationed at Fort Lee, VA for his final \nmission. As Director of DCMA he oversees the delivery of all products \nand services, from water to weapons systems, to our troops around the \nworld. He leads nearly 11,000 personnel, both civilian and military, \nwho execute contracts worldwide, covering more than 19,900 contractors \nand more than $223 billion in obligations. Recently, Director Williams \nand DCMA oversaw more than 300 critical theater support contracts \nvalued at more than $20 billion, delivering logistics, security, \ntransportation, maintenance and critical life-support services to \n230,000 International Security Assistance Force personnel at over 180 \nforward operating bases. Under Director Williams' leadership, DCMA \nprofessionals provided mentorship and guidance to more than 60,000 \ndeployed contractor personnel throughout Afghanistan, executing more \nthan 5,000 missions, despite significant danger. Their efforts ensured \nservice of more than 240 million meals to coalition force personnel, \nproduction of more than 10 billion gallons of water, and delivery of 48 \nmillion bags of laundry and 900 million gallons of fuel.\n  I commend Director Williams' commitment to duty and cause, as well as \nhis passion for public service. In every role in which he served, he \ncontributed to the success of the mission, demonstrated high standards \nof conduct, and served with honesty, loyalty, and integrity. His long \ncareer of service will leave a lasting impact on our Nation. Director \nWilliams is a devoted husband to his wife, Tujuanna, and dedicated \nfather to his two daughters, Chloe and Charity.\n  I extend my gratitude and that of the entire Nation to Director \nWilliams for his service to our country. The Commonwealth of Virginia \nand the United States are fortunate to have had Director Williams among \nour ranks. I wish him the best of luck in the months and years \nahead.\n\n[[Page S8455]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8455-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ROBERT DEPOE III\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Robert DePoe \nIII on recently becoming the new president of Salish Kootenai College \nin Pablo, MT. Robert was born in Polson, MT and was 2-years-old when \nSalish Kootenai College was founded in 1977. Robert spent his entire \nchildhood on the Flathead Reservation in Montana's Mission Valley, \ngraduating from high school in Ronan in 1993.\n  After attending North Idaho College, Robert returned home and worked \nat a local mill before going on a church mission that led him to \nSouthern Utah University. At Southern Utah, Robert earned his \nbachelor's degree in criminal justice before becoming a social worker \nwith the Paiute Tribe of Utah. At 27, Robert became education director \nand served as an advisor and chairman of the Coalition of Minorities to \nthe Utah State Board of Education. From there, Robert's ascent \ncontinued, and he went on to earn his master's degree in professional \ncommunication.\n  Now, at 38, Robert is returning home again to lead Salish Kootenai \nCollege. Robert will take over a job recently vacated by Luana Ross. \nPrior to Luana, the position was held exclusively by the founding \npresident of over 30 years, Joe McDonald. Joe is a legend in higher \neducation. Under his leadership, Salish Kootenai College became one of \nthe premier tribal colleges in the Nation.\n  During Joe's 38-year tenure, Salish Kootenai transformed from a \ncampus extension for a local community college to educating over 1,000 \nNative students. While Robert has big shoes to fill, I know he is ready \nfor the challenge. And he has a capable faculty and eager students to \nmake his task a little easier.\n  I wish good luck to Robert and to Salish Kootenai College as they \ncontinue to honor the heritage of the Salish and Kootenai while \npreparing our future leaders of Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8455-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8455-3", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8455-4", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:01 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1965.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1763. A bill to increase the effectiveness of child support \nenforcement and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud today to introduce the \nChild Support Enforcement Effectiveness Act of 2013. This legislation \nwill set the stage for improving child support enforcement across our \ncountry, and will provide states with more funds to allow them to do \nso. Through these crucial investments in this important child welfare \nprogram, we can improve the lives of thousands of children across our \ncountry.\n  Child support enforcement is a State-Federal partnership that works. \nFor every dollar agencies and departments spend on child support \nenforcement, states collect an average of $5.19 in child support due. \nFor that reason alone, this is an extraordinary use of taxpayer \ndollars. In 2010, the child support enforcement program a11owed States \nto collect more than $26 billion on behalf of the children and families \nto whom that money is owed. There is no question that these children \nbenefit because they receive support from both their parents.\n  In addition to being an effective use of taxpayer dollars, child \nsupport enforcement is one of our most important investments in child \nwelfare. Experts have repeatedly found that it is one of the most \neffective programs in reducing poverty rates among working families. \nFor single parents below the poverty line, child support often \nrepresents as much as half of their family's income, and makes the \ndifference between whether children's basic needs are met or not.\n  Because of the tremendous success of the child support enforcement \nprogram, we should work to improve it even further. One way we can \nimprove it is by identifying best practices at the state level, so \nevery state can maximize their return. West Virginia recovers about \n$4.99 for each dollar it spends on child support enforcement. Some \nstates recover substantially more for each dollar they spend. By arming \nevery State with information about what works and what doesn't, we can \nhelp States maximize the return on their investment and recover the \nlargest possible amount on behalf of children.\n  This legislation would also permanently restore full funding for \nchild support enforcement by reinstating the Federal match for \nincentive payments that States reinvest in their child support \nenforcement programs. By providing the resources for States to have \nrobust child support enforcement programs, we can profoundly improve \nthe lives of so many children across our Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MERKLEY (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1771. A bill to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to adjust the \nCrooked River boundary, to provide water certainty for the City of \nPrineville, Oregon, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue that \nis extremely important to the Central Oregon economy. For over 40 \nyears, an agreement has been out of reach in the Crooked River Basin in \ncentral Oregon on how to allocate water from the Prineville Reservoir \nto meet the diversity of needs. Over the last few years, Senator Wyden \nand I have worked with a broad group of water users in the Basin and \nhave come to a solution.\n  Today, Senator Wyden and I are introducing the Crooked River \nCollaborative Water Security Act of 2013 that will provide a \ncomprehensive framework for improving the management of water in the \nCrooked River, while creating opportunities for economic growth and new \njobs in central Oregon. This is especially good news in central Oregon, \na region that has been plagued with unemployment since the beginning of \nthe Great Recession and is in need of new jobs.\n  This legislation is built on a broad coalition of stakeholder \nsupport. I want to thank those stakeholders who put aside preconceived \nnotions, came to the negotiating table, and worked out a solution that \ncould achieve such a broad range of support.\n  The key elements of the legislation include meeting the municipal \nwater needs for the city of Prineville long into the future, so the \ncity can continue to attract new businesses like the data centers of \nFacebook and Apple that have recently moved to the region; providing \ngreater certainty for the agricultural community that depends on the \nCrooked River for irrigation and is the heart and soul of the Central \nOregon economy; allowing water to be released from Bowman Dam to help \nmaintain healthy steelhead, salmon and trout fisheries, which are \ncherished by local fisherman; allowing the Bowman Dam to be retrofitted \nto install a hydroelectric turbine and generate low-cost, clean power \nand create construction jobs; and creating a process to help better \nplan for dry years, including the impact on fish habitat and fishing, \nas well as boating and other recreational activities.\n  This bill is a comprehensive solution to a problem that has plagued \nthe region for 40 years and it has the support of numerous groups in \nthe Central Oregon region. The time is now for the Senate to quickly \nmove on this bill and help the Central Oregon economy move forward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1771\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I rise to join Senator Merkley and \ncosponsor a bill that strikes a balance between the competing demands \nfor a scarce resource, Crooked River water. The Crooked River \nCollaborative Water Security Act of 2013 is the product of long and \ndetermined negotiations to find solutions that will benefit many \ninterests in and around Prineville, Oregon. I was pleased to work to \nadvance this bill last Congress, and I look forward to working with \nSenator Merkley, other colleagues, and all the supporters of the bill \nto achieve the many benefits of this bill for Central Oregon.\n  Oregon works best when Oregonians work together and this is an \nexample of what can be done when faced with a very challenging set of \nissues. The City of Prineville needs water to grow economically. \nIrrigators along the Crooked River want certainty for future water \nsupply. The local utility Portland General Electric would like to build \na small hydroelectric plant on the Bureau of Reclamation's Bowman Dam. \nAnd the Warm Springs Tribes and conservation groups seek to ensure more \nwater is available for in-stream flows to protect reintroduced salmon \nruns in the Crooked River.\n  Water in the West is often the heart of many contentious battles, but \nthese parties and more worked tirelessly and in good faith to build a \nconsensus to meet those many important needs. The bill allocates \nuncontracted water in Bowman Dam to give water to the City and for fish \npopulations, while attaining certainty for the contracted water for \nirrigation. It also moves the Wild and Scenic River Act boundary to a \nplace that makes sense and would enable hydroelectric generation. The \nbill more explicitly looks after the recreation interests enjoyed by \nflatwater users above the dam.\n  I express my gratitude for the many groups and individuals who have \nworked diligently to strike the balance on the Crooked River. I look \nforward to working with those groups, the Bureau of Reclamation, \nCongressman Greg Walden, and especially Senator Merkley, who has shown \ndetermined leadership in marshaling this bill, to move this bill \nthrough Congress and to the President's desk this Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8464-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8464-S8465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 309--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE \n    COLLECTION, PROCESSING, AND CONSUMPTION OF RECYCLABLE MATERIALS \n                      THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. CARPER (for himself, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Grassley, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nBlumenthal, Mr. Casey, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Coons, and Mr. Pryor) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works:\n\n                              S. Res. 309\n\n       Whereas maximizing the recycling economy in the United \n     States will create and sustain additional well-paying jobs in \n     the United States, further stimulate the economy of the \n     United States, save energy, and conserve valuable natural \n     resources;\n       Whereas recycling is an important action that people in the \n     United States can take to be environmental stewards;\n       Whereas municipal recycling rates in the United States \n     steadily increased from 6.6 percent in 1970 to 28.6 percent \n     in 2000, but since 2000, the rate of increase has slowed \n     considerably;\n       Whereas recycling allows the United States to recover the \n     critical materials necessary to sustain the recycling economy \n     and protect national security interests in the United States;\n       Whereas recycling plays an integral role in the sustainable \n     management of materials throughout the life-cycle of a \n     product;\n       Whereas 46 States have laws promoting the recycling of \n     materials that would otherwise be incinerated or sent to a \n     landfill;\n       Whereas more than 10,000 communities in the United States \n     have residential recycling and drop-off programs that collect \n     a wide variety of recyclable materials, including paper, \n     steel, aluminum, plastic, glass, and electronics;\n       Whereas in addition to residential recycling, the scrap \n     recycling industry in the United States manufactures \n     recyclable materials collected from businesses and \n     individuals into commodity-grade materials;\n       Whereas those commodity-grade materials are used as \n     feedstock to produce new basic materials and finished \n     products in the United States and throughout the world;\n       Whereas recycling stimulates the economy and plays an \n     integral role in sustaining manufacturing in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas in 2010, the United States recycling industry \n     collected, processed, and consumed over 130,000,000 metric \n     tons of recyclable material, valued at $77,000,000,000;\n       Whereas many manufacturers use recycled commodities to make \n     products, saving energy and reducing the need for raw \n     materials, which are generally higher-priced;\n       Whereas the recycling industry in the United States helps \n     balance the trade deficit and provides emerging economies \n     with the raw materials needed to build countries and \n     participate in the global economy;\n       Whereas in 2010, the scrap recycling industry in the United \n     States sold more than 44,000,000 metric tons of commodity-\n     grade materials, valued at almost $30,000,000,000, to more \n     than 154 countries;\n       Whereas recycling saves energy by decreasing the amount of \n     energy needed to manufacture the products that people build, \n     buy, and use;\n       Whereas using recycled materials in place of raw materials \n     can result in energy savings of 92 percent for aluminum cans, \n     87 percent for mixed plastics, 63 percent for steel cans, 45 \n     percent for recycled newspaper, and 34 percent for recycled \n     glass; and\n       Whereas a bipartisan Senate Recycling Caucus and a \n     bipartisan House Recycling Caucus were established in 2006 to \n     provide a permanent and long-term way for members of Congress \n     to obtain in-depth knowledge about the recycling industry and \n     to help promote the many benefits of recycling: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses support for improvement in the collection, \n     processing, and consumption of recyclable material throughout \n     the United States in order to create well-paying jobs, foster \n     innovation and investment in the United States recycling \n     infrastructure, and stimulate the economy of the United \n     States;\n       (2) expresses support for strengthening the manufacturing \n     base in the United States in order to rebuild the domestic \n     economy, which will increase the supply, demand, and \n     consumption of recyclable and recycled materials in the \n     United States;\n       (3) expresses support for a competitive marketplace for \n     recyclable materials;\n       (4) expresses support for the trade of recyclable \n     commodities, which is an integral part of the domestic and \n     global economy;\n       (5) expresses support for policies in the United States \n     that promote recycling of materials, including paper, which \n     is commonly recycled rather than thermally combusted or sent \n     to a landfill;\n\n[[Page S8465]]\n\n       (6) expresses support for policies in the United States \n     that recognize and promote recyclable materials as essential \n     economic commodities, rather than wastes;\n       (7) expresses support for policies in the United States \n     that promote using recyclable materials as feedstock to \n     produce new basic materials and finished products throughout \n     the world;\n       (8) expresses support for research and development of new \n     technologies to more efficiently and effectively recycle \n     materials such as automobile shredder residue and cathode ray \n     tubes;\n       (9) expresses support for research and development of new \n     technologies to remove materials that are impediments to \n     recycling, such as radioactive material, polychlorinated \n     biphenyls, mercury-containing devices, and \n     chlorofluorocarbons;\n       (10) expresses support for Design for Recycling, to improve \n     the design and manufacture of goods to ensure that, at the \n     end of a useful life, a good can, to the maximum extent \n     practicable, be recycled safely and economically;\n       (11) recognizes that the scrap recycling industry in the \n     United States is a manufacturing industry that is critical to \n     the future of the United States;\n       (12) expresses support for policies in the United States \n     that establish the equitable treatment of recycled materials;

Res. 310\n\n       Whereas phenylketonuria is a rare, inherited metabolic \n     disorder that is characterized by the inability of the body \n     to process the essential amino acid phenylalanine and causes \n     mental retardation and other neurological problems, such as \n     memory loss and mood disorders, when treatment is not started \n     within the first few weeks of life;\n       Whereas newborn screening for phenylketonuria was initiated \n     in the United States in 1963 and recommended for inclusion in \n     State newborn screening programs under the Newborn Screening \n     Saves Lives Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-204; 122 Stat. 705);\n       Whereas approximately 1 out of every 15,000 infants in the \n     United States is born with phenylketonuria;\n       Whereas the Phenylketonuria Scientific Review Conference in \n     2012 affirmed the recommendation of lifelong dietary \n     treatment for phenylketonuria made by the National Institutes \n     of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement 2000;\n       Whereas women with phenylketonuria must maintain strict \n     metabolic control before and during pregnancy to prevent \n     fetal damage;\n       Whereas a child born from an untreated mother with \n     phenylketonuria may have a condition known as ``maternal \n     phenylketonuria syndrome'', which can cause a small brain, an \n     intellectual disability, birth defects of the heart, and a \n     low birth weight;\n       Whereas phenylketonuria is treated with medical food;\n       Whereas although there is no cure for phenylketonuria, \n     treatment involving medical food and restricting \n     phenylalanine intake can prevent progressive, irreversible \n     brain damage;\n       Whereas maintaining a strict medical diet for \n     phenylketonuria can be difficult to achieve, and poor \n     metabolic control can result in a significant decline in \n     mental and behavioral performance;\n       Whereas access to health insurance coverage for medical \n     food varies across the United States;\n       Whereas the long-term costs associated with caring for \n     untreated children and adults exceed the cost of providing \n     medical food treatment;\n       Whereas scientists and researchers are hopeful that \n     breakthroughs in phenylketonuria research will be \n     forthcoming;\n       Whereas researchers across the United States are conducting \n     important research projects involving phenylketonuria; and\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise \n     awareness of phenylketonuria among the general public and the \n     medical community: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates December 3, 2013, as ``National \n     Phenylketonuria Awareness Day'';\n       (2) encourages all people in the United States to become \n     more informed about phenylketonuria; and\n       (3) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the National PKU \n     Alliance, a non-profit organization dedicated to improving \n     the lives of individuals with phenylketonuria.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8465-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8465-S8466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 311--CALLING ON THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE \n   (IOC) TO STRONGLY OPPOSE RUSSIA'S DISCRIMINATORY LAW AGAINST THE \n   FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION FOR LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, AND TRANSGENDER \n (LGBT) PERSONS AND TO OBTAIN WRITTEN ASSURANCE THAT HOST COUNTRIES OF \nTHE OLYMPIC GAMES WILL UPHOLD ALL INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND CIVIL \n RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS FOR ALL PERSONS OBSERVING OR PARTICIPATING IN THE \nGAMES REGARDLESS OF RACE, SEX, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, OR GENDER IDENTITY, \n                         AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Murphy) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation:\n\n                              S. Res. 311\n\n       Whereas the goal of the Olympic movement is to contribute \n     to building a peaceful and better world by educating youth \n     through sport practiced in accordance with Olympism and its \n     values;\n       Whereas the role of the International Olympic Committee \n     (IOC), according to the Olympic Charter, is to cooperate with \n     the competent public or private organizations and authorities \n     in the endeavor to place sport at the service of humanity and \n     thereby promote peace;\n       Whereas, under the Olympic Charter, any form of \n     discrimination against a person is deemed incompatible with \n     belonging to the Olympic movement and the IOC is to act \n     explicitly against any form of discrimination affecting the \n     Olympic movement;\n       Whereas, in February 2014, the city of Sochi in the \n     Krasnodar region of the Russian Federation will host the 22nd \n     Winter Olympic Games;\n       Whereas, on June 30, 2013, President Vladimir Putin of \n     Russian signed into law a bill that allows the Government of \n     the Russian Federation to arrest gay or ``pro-gay'' \n     foreigners prior to being deported from the country;\n       Whereas the Krasnodar region of Russia, where the city of \n     Sochi is located, and 10 other regions have adopted similar \n     laws banning ``homosexual propaganda'';\n       Whereas several media outlets recently reported of \n     homophobic violence occurring in Russia resulting in the \n     deaths of Russian citizens;\n       Whereas authorities in Russia have refused to register the \n     nongovernmental organization that would set up a Pride House \n     in Sochi, which would work to combat homophobia in sport and \n     promote lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered (LGBT) \n     individuals' rights during the Olympic Games in Russia, as \n     the Pride House did during the 2010 Winter Olympics in \n     Vancouver;\n       Whereas the presence of a Pride House would be the \n     expression of human rights and have the mission of \n     celebrating diversity and inclusiveness through sport and \n     raising awareness of LGBT discrimination and criminalization;\n       Whereas the IOC has said that they have received assurances \n     from the highest levels of the Government of the Russian \n     Federation that Olympic athletes and visitors will not be \n     affected by Russia's discriminatory law, but the Minister of \n     Sports in Russia has suggested that athletes will not be \n     exempt;\n       Whereas the Department of State has a clear and consistent \n     policy of championing the protection of human rights of LGBT \n     individuals worldwide, including by opposing any legislation \n     that singles out people for discriminatory treatment due to \n     their sexual orientation and by encouraging countries to \n     repeal or reform laws that punish or criminalize LGBT status;\n       Whereas Russia has obligated itself to respect and enforce \n     the right to be free from discrimination and the right to \n     freedom of assembly, association, and expression under the \n     European Convention of Human Rights, the United Nations \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the \n     human dimension commitments of the Organization for Security \n     and Cooperation in Europe; and\n       Whereas the IOC recently stated, ``The International \n     Olympic Committee is clear that sport is a human right and \n     should be available to all regardless of race, sex or sexual \n     orientation. The Games themselves should be open to all, free \n     of discrimination, and that applies to spectators, officials, \n     media and of course athletes. We oppose in the strongest \n     terms any move that would jeopardize this principle.'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) calls on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to \n     strongly oppose Russia's discriminatory law as inconsistent \n     with Russia's international obligations and with the value of \n     the Olympic movement;\n       (2) calls on the IOC to insist, as a condition of holding \n     the planned Olympic Games in Sochi, that the Government of \n     the Russian Federation provide unconditional assurance that \n     no athlete, coach, official, spectator, or anyone otherwise \n     involved or affiliated with the Olympic Games will be \n     harassed, fined, detained, or otherwise have their human \n     rights, including their right to free expression, violated \n     due to their actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender \n     identity or expression of support for LGBT human rights;\n\n[[Page S8466]]\n\n       (3) urges the IOC to insist that venders and contractors \n     have LGBT nondiscrimination policies in place for the 2014 \n     Winter Olympics in Sochi and for all future Olympic Games or \n     other Olympic events;\n       (4) urges the IOC to call on the Russian Federation to \n     allow a Pride House that has the mission of celebrating \n     diversity and inclusiveness through sport and raising \n     awareness of LGBT discrimination and criminalization;\n       (5) urges the IOC to amend its charter to state that \n     discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender \n     identity is not compatible with the Olympic Games; and\n       (6) urges the congressionally chartered United States \n     Olympic Committee to intervene and assist the IOC in \n     establishing the objectives as laid out by this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8466-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 26--RECOGNIZING THE NEED TO IMPROVE \n PHYSICAL ACCESS TO MANY FEDERALLY FUNDED FACILITIES FOR ALL PEOPLE OF \n        THE UNITED STATES, PARTICULARLY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL (for himself and Mr. Murphy) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 26\n\n       Whereas, in 2012, 12 percent of the civilian population in \n     the United States reported having a disability;\n       Whereas, in 2012, 16 percent of veterans, amounting to more \n     than 3,500,000 people, received service-related disability \n     benefits;\n       Whereas, in 2011, the percentage of working-age people in \n     the United States who reported having a work limitation due \n     to a disability was 7 percent, which is a 20-year high;\n       Whereas the Act entitled ``An Act to insure that certain \n     buildings financed with Federal funds are so designed and \n     constructed as to be accessible to the physically \n     handicapped'', approved August 12, 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151 et \n     seq.) (referred to in this preamble as the ``Architectural \n     Barriers Act of 1968''), was enacted to ensure that certain \n     federally funded facilities are designed and constructed to \n     be accessible to people with disabilities and requires that \n     physically handicapped people have ready access to, and use \n     of, post offices and other Federal facilities;\n       Whereas automatic doors, though not mandated by either the \n     Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 or the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), provide a \n     greater degree of self-sufficiency and dignity for people \n     with disabilities and the elderly, who may have limited \n     strength to open a manually operated door;\n       Whereas a report commissioned by the Architectural and \n     Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (referred to in this \n     preamble as the ``Access Board''), an independent Federal \n     agency created to ensure access to federally funded \n     facilities for people with disabilities, recommends that all \n     new buildings for use by the public should have at least one \n     automated door at an accessible entrance, except for small \n     buildings where adding such doors may be a financial hardship \n     for the owners of the buildings;\n       Whereas States and municipalities have begun to recognize \n     the importance of automatic doors in improving accessibility;\n       Whereas the laws of the State of Connecticut require \n     automatic doors in certain shopping malls and retail \n     businesses, the laws of the State of Delaware require \n     automatic doors or calling devices for newly constructed \n     places of accommodation, and the laws of the District of \n     Columbia have a similar requirement;\n       Whereas the Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings \n     Service, published by the General Services Administration, \n     requires automation of at least one exterior door for all \n     newly constructed or renovated facilities managed by the \n     General Services Administration, including post offices;\n       Whereas from 2006 to 2011, 71 percent of the complaints \n     received by the Access Board regarding the Architectural \n     Barriers Act of 1968 concerned a post office or other \n     facility of the United States Postal Service;\n       Whereas the United States Postal Service employs \n     approximately 522,000 people, making it the second-largest \n     civilian employer in the United States;\n       Whereas approximately 3,200,000 people visit 1 of the \n     31,857 post offices in the United States each day; and\n       Whereas the United States was founded on principles of \n     equality and freedom, and these principles require that all \n     people, including people with disabilities, are able to \n     engage as equal members of society: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the immense hardships that people with \n     disabilities in the United States must overcome every day;\n       (2) reaffirms its support of the Act entitled ``An Act to \n     insure that certain buildings financed with Federal funds are \n     so designed and constructed as to be accessible to the \n     physically handicapped'', approved August 12, 1968 (42 U.S.C. \n     4151 et seq.), commonly known as the ``Architectural Barriers \n     Act of 1968'', and the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n     1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), and encourages full \n     compliance with such Acts;\n       (3) recommends that the United States Postal Service and \n     Federal agencies install power-assisted doors at post offices \n     and other federally funded facilities, respectively, to \n     ensure equal access for all people of the United States; and\n       (4) pledges to continue to work to identify and remove the \n     barriers that prevent all people of the United States from \n     having equal access to the services provided by the Federal \n     Government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/21/senate-section/article/S8466-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 27--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n   THE UNITED STATES SHOULD ENSURE THAT ISRAEL IS ABLE TO ADEQUATELY \n ADDRESS AN EXISTENTIAL IRANIAN NUCLEAR THREAT AND TO SUPPORT ISRAEL'S \nRIGHT TO RESPOND TO THE POTENTIAL THREAT OF A SYRIAN S-300 AIR DEFENSE \n                                 SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S.

FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Heavy rare earth elements are critical for the national \n     defense of the United States, advanced energy technologies, \n     and other desirable commercial and industrial applications.\n       (2) The Government Accountability Office has confirmed that \n     the monopoly control of the People's Republic of China over \n     the rare earth value chain has resulted in vulnerabilities in \n     the procurement of multiple United States weapons systems.\n       (3) China has leveraged its monopoly control over the rare \n     earth value chain to force United States, European, Japanese, \n     and Korean corporations to transfer manufacturing facilities, \n     technology, and jobs to China in exchange for secure supply \n     contracts.\n       (4) China's increasingly aggressive mercantile behavior has \n     resulted in involuntary transfers of technology, \n     manufacturing, and jobs resulting in onerous trade imbalances \n     with the United States and trading partners of the United \n     States.\n       (5) Direct links exist between heavy rare earth mineralogy \n     and thorium.\n       (6) Thorium is a mildly radioactive element commonly \n     associated with the lanthanide elements in the most heavy \n     rare earth deposits that are located in the United States and \n     elsewhere.\n       (7) Regulations regarding thorium represent a barrier to \n     the development of a heavy rare earth industry that is based \n     in the United States.\n       (8) Balancing the strategic national interest objectives of \n     the United States against economic and environmental risks \n     are best met through the creation of a rare earth \n     cooperative.\n       (9) A rare earth cooperative could--\n       (A) greatly increase rare earth production;\n       (B) ensure environmental safety; and\n       (C) lower the cost of the production and financial risks \n     faced by rare earth producers in the United States.\n       (10) Historically, agricultural and electric cooperatives \n     have stood as one of the greatest success stories of the \n     United States.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United \n     States to advance domestic refining of heavy rare earth \n     materials and the safe storage of thorium in anticipation of \n     the potential future industrial uses of thorium, including \n     energy, as--\n       (1) thorium has a mineralogical association with valuable \n     heavy rare earth elements;\n       (2) there is a great need to develop domestic refining \n     capacity to process domestic heavy rare earth deposits; and\n       (3) the economy of the United States would benefit from the \n     rapid development and control of intellectual property \n     relating to the commercial development of technology \n     utilizing thorium.\n\n     SEC. 1433.
