Mr. President, I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 99, \nwhich is the Transportation appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 99, S. 1243, a bill \n     making appropriations for the Departments of Transportation, \n     and Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the time until noon will be equally divided and \ncontrolled. At noon there will be a cloture vote on the motion to \nproceed to S. 1243. If cloture is invoked, all postcloture time will be \nyielded back and we will vote on adoption of the motion to proceed. I \nhope that will be a voice vote and we can begin consideration of the \nbill immediately following the vote at noon.\n  The Senate will recess from 12:30 until 2:15 p.m. today for our \nweekly caucus meetings.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Chiesa be recognized at 2:15 \np.m. today for up to 15 minutes to deliver his maiden speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. I am so happy to see the Presiding Officer. The Senator \nmight have presided before but I haven't been able to witness that. So \nI am very happy to have the Senator here. We are so fortunate to have \nhim here with his wide-ranging experience as a Member of Congress. My \ntime in the House was some of the most pleasant times of my career. I \nso admire and respect the House of Representatives. And for the \nPresiding Officer to have spent almost four decades there indicates the \npeople of Massachusetts will have someone here who will immediately hit \nthe ground running, and we are very happy to have the Senator with us. \nWe have the committee the Senator wanted, and with the wide experience \nhe has had in the areas of his choice, he will be a great benefit to \nMassachusetts and our country.\n  Today the Senate will begin work on the Transportation, Housing and \nUrban Development bill. It is a bipartisan measure that received six \nRepublican votes coming out of the full committee. This legislation \nwill strengthen our economy by investing in roadways, railways, \nairports, bridges, and more. I applaud the full committee chair Barbara \nMikulski for her good work and being so excited about bringing forth \nthe appropriations bills, and long-time member of the Appropriations \nCommittee chairwoman Patty Murray. She is chair of the subcommittee \nthat will be working on that for the next few days. I appreciate their \ndiligence and their bipartisan work on this measure.\n  The Transportation, Housing appropriations bill has always been a \nbipartisan bill. As we speak, we have 70,000 bridges in this country in \nneed of major repair. We have bridges in America today where \nschoolbuses unload their children before going over the bridge. We have \nbridges that are in need of extensive repair and some that need to be \nreplaced completely. One of every five miles of American roads is not \nup to safety standards, so it is easy to see why this bipartisan effort \nto upgrade America's crumbling infrastructure is so important. Our \ndeficient roads, bridges, railways, and runways are a drag on our \neconomy.\n  But this crisis is also an opportunity--an opportunity--to create \njobs by rebuilding America, which needs replenishing, restoring, and \nrebuilding. This bill will make traveling safer and more efficient for \nAmerican families and businesses.\n  We get so upset when we are on roads and freeways that are jammed and \nwe think how inconvenient it is for us. Think how inconvenient it is \nfor one of those trucks that is carrying products to be delivered and \nsold, how much it is costing each of us in our individual vehicles, and \nhow it is costing us more every minute that truck is stopped in a road \nbecause of heavy traffic. It is more expensive than virtually \neverything we do in America. We have to do\n\n[[Page S5810]]\n\na better job on our crumbling infrastructure. This bill will make \ntraveling safer, as I indicated, and more efficient.\n  The Senate bill also makes crucial investments in affordable housing \nprograms that assist low-income families in need. This legislation is \nan important step toward eliminating homelessness, especially among \nAmerica's veterans.\n  By contrast, the very partisan companion bill from the House that \nthey passed puts affordable housing out of reach for most everyone. \nMany who are out of reach of getting help are the elderly or disabled.\n  The House bill also slashes investments on new roads and bridges, and \nmakes deep cuts to the Federal aviation efforts to modernize our air \ntraffic control system. The Senate bill is a bipartisan blueprint, \ninvesting in modern infrastructure and creating new jobs while \nmaintaining a vital social safety net. House Republicans obviously have \na totally different version. They are jamming things through there on a \ntotally partisan basis.\n  On Sunday, John Boehner, Speaker of the House, said Congress should \nnot be judged by how many bills it passes but by how many laws it \nrepeals. If that is true, House Republicans are failing even by their \nown measure. They have replaced virtually nothing. So by the Speaker's \nown admission they are not getting anything passed, and by his own \nanalysis they are getting nothing repealed. So they are doing nothing. \nWe have known that, but it is unusual for the Speaker to acknowledge \nthat on the Sunday shows.\n  If my Republican colleagues are looking for a law to repeal, I would \nsuggest they take a look at the shortsighted and mean-spirited \nsequester law. Democrats are happy to help them roll back these \narbitrary cuts--these meat axe cuts--which threaten national security \nas well as the economy.\n  In the news today, there was a briefing by the Secretary of Defense \ntalking about how senseless the cuts are to the Defense Department. \nThey are done with a meat axe, as I said. So we need to roll back these \narbitrary cuts--not only to the military but to all of government.\n  Unless Democrats and Republicans work out a bipartisan solution that \nreplaces the sequester, crucial investments in everything from early \nchildhood to medical research to military readiness will be in \njeopardy. They are already in jeopardy.\n  It has been 122 days since the Senate passed its budget, but Senate \nRepublicans still refuse to let Democrats, led by Budget Committee \nchair Patty Murray, negotiate a budget compromise with our House \nRepublican colleagues. Senator Murray and others have been to the floor \nnumerous times. We have had Republicans come here to the floor and say \nhow foolish it is not to be able to go to conference. We have not given \nup on reversing the sequester and setting sound fiscal policy through \nregular order in the budget process. We know Democrats and Republicans \nwill never find common ground if we never start negotiating. That is \nwhat Senator Murray has said many times.\n  Sequester will cost us investments in education which helps keep \nAmerica competitive and will cost millions of seniors, children, and \nneedy families the safety net that keeps them from descending into \npoverty. Because of drastic cuts to the National Institutes of Health, \nsequester could also cost the country in humankind, in a cure for AIDS, \nParkinson's disease, or Alzheimer's.\n  Congress can stop these devastating cuts to crucial medical research \nand programs that protect low-income children. All they need to do is \nwork with us. We can't do it alone. We need the Republicans' help. The \ncost of reducing the deficit with a meat axe today is missing out on \nthe next polio vaccine tomorrow, and the price is simply way too high.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                        Welcoming Senator Markey\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I too want to welcome the new Senator \nfrom Massachusetts to the Senate. He will find presiding over the \nSenate an enlightening experience. And if tradition is followed, he \nwill get to do it a lot.\n\n\n                               The Pivot\n\n  There are many overused expressions here in Washington. Game changer \ncomes to mind. But I think the worst may be the so-called pivot. I say \nthis not just because it is used too much to mean anything, but also \nbecause it is a troubling frame of mind.\n  I mean, the idea that the White House can pivot to jobs for a day or \ntwo and then abandon it for a few weeks or months and then pivot back \nagain for a couple of days epitomizes the attitude that turns people \noff from politics. It is the notion that job creation is somehow more \nabout scoring points at convenient moments than doing what is necessary \nto get Americans back to work. This is the kind of thing that angers \nfolks in Kentucky and across the country, but it seems to be the only \nthing this administration and its allies in Congress are ever \ninterested in because here is the thing. Not only should we be focused \non jobs day in and day out around here, as Senate Republicans have been \nall along, but it is also not as though we don't know what is needed to \nget our economy back on track. It is not as though we don't know how to \nget the private sector moving again and creating jobs.\n  We don't need to pivot. We need to do the things that have been \nstaring us in the face for the past 4\\1/2\\ years. If Washington \nDemocrats are serious about turning the economy around, they would be \nworking collaboratively with Republicans to do that instead of sitting \non the sidelines and waiting to take cues from the endless political \nroad shows the President puts up whenever he feels like changing a \ntopic.\n  I mean, there are some pretty obvious things we should be spending \nour time on around here--things such as implementing a revenue-neutral \nreform of our Tax Code to make it fairer, flatter, and more conducive \nto the kind of economic growth that can generate the type of stable \nmiddle-class jobs we desperately need, things such as reimagining a \nregulatory state that was designed in the 20th century so that American \ncompanies and workers can remain competitive in the 21st. The \nregulatory state we have now is entirely geared toward the past, not \nthe present and the future--things such as developing and refining more \nenergy right here at home, instead of importing it from overseas.\n  But Washington Democrats haven't worked with us to do almost any of \nthat. Instead, they have mostly given us higher taxes, an endless \nstream of regulations, and an unwillingness to pursue commonsense \nenergy projects that could put more Americans to work right now.\n  They have given us a stimulus that ballooned the debt, maddeningly \ncomplex regulations that failed to solve too big to fail, and made \nbailouts the official law of the land. And they gave us a 2,700-page \nhealth care law that almost no one read, with a tower of at least \n20,000 pages of accompanying regulations and redtape that almost no one \ncan understand.\n  It is no wonder so many Americans remain out of work, with 54 months \nof unemployment at or above 7.5 percent. In Kentucky, the rate is, \nregrettably, even higher.\n  Meanwhile, Washington Democrats have been pivoting back and forth, \nback and forth. In fact, they pivot so much these days that they often \ndon't seem to know what to do with themselves when there is an actual \npolicy issue to be solved--an issue where you would assume many \nRepublicans and Democrats would normally agree. Take the student loan \nissue. Right now the unemployment rate for 20- to 24-year-olds is about \n13.5 percent.\n  For teens it is even worse--about 24 percent. The youth of our \ncountry are struggling. Yet, with that backdrop, Senate Democrats still \ncontinue to fight with each other over the student loan bill 23 days \nafter the deadline they themselves warned us about.\n  Congressional Republicans and President Obama have actually been more \nor less on the same page on this issue from the very start. We have \nagreed on the need to pursue permanent reform for all students, not \njust a short-term political fix for some of them. Still, Senate \nDemocrats persisted with show votes on a bill that always seemed more \nabout politics than policy--wasting precious time. Then, with the July \n1 deadline blowing past, they started bickering among themselves about \nthe\n\n[[Page S5811]]\n\nway forward and continue to do so, apparently, even now. They need to \nstop. Democrats need to finally allow the bipartisan student loan \nreform proposal to come to a vote this week so we can pass it and \nensure there is one less Washington-created problem for young people to \nworry about in this economy because it is tough enough out there for \nthem already.\n  The Obama economy has not been kind to the youth of our Nation. I \nhope the White House and Senate Democrats will help us change that \nbecause this persistently high unemployment is simply not acceptable, \nand neither is pretending it can be changed by simply executing another \npivot or delivering another campaign-style speech or just spending more \ntaxpayer money because Washington Democrats have tried all that before, \nover and over, and, in fact, it is just not working.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the leadership time \nis reserved.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 12 noon will be equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees, with Senators \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Student Loans\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise this morning in strong opposition \nto the legislation which I assume is coming to the floor today which, \nif passed, would be a disaster for the young people of our country who \nare looking forward to going to college and for their parents who are \nhelping them pay their bills. Our job is to improve the dismal \nsituation in terms of college affordability and the indebtedness of \nyoung people in this country, to improve that situation, to make it \nbetter, not to make it worse, and that is exactly what this proposed \nlegislation would do.\n  I ask for support from my colleagues for an amendment I have filed \nthat would provide a 2-year sunset to this bill, an approach that would \nprevent student interest rates from soaring and allow us the time, \nthrough the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, to deal with \nthis problem through a constructive long-term solution. This issue is \ntoo important to be rushed through this body without hearings, without \nlistening to the people who will be affected by this bill--the millions \nof young people who wish to go to college, who do not want to leave \nschool in deep debt, and their parents as well. We should be listening \nto them, not rushing this bill through today.\n  I thank Senators Leahy, Whitehouse, Gillibrand, and Schatz for their \ncosponsorship of this amendment. I look forward to widespread support \nfrom my colleagues.\n  Let's be honest about something we do not talk about enough; that is, \nin many ways our government is selling out the young people of our \ncountry. When we do that, when we ignore the needs of the young people \nof our country, in many ways we are selling out the future of the \nUnited States of America because the young people are the future.\n  If we do not turn this around, I fear very much that we will continue \non the downward spiral we have seen for the last several decades, a \nspiral in which the rich get richer, Wall Street and the multinational \ncorporations continue to enjoy recordbreaking profits, while the middle \nclass continues to disappear and poverty remains catastrophically high. \nIf we pass the legislation on the floor today without improving it, we \nwill simply be taking one more step in the wrong direction.\n  Before I get into the gist of what this legislation is about and what \nmy amendment will do, let me say a few words about where we are today \nwith regard to the young people in our country.\n  At this moment the United States has, by far, the highest rate of \nchildhood poverty of any major country on Earth--almost 22 percent. In \nmany parts of this country we are seeing a lack of social mobility, \nwhere people who are poor, who grow up poor, stay poor. That is not \nwhat this country is supposed to be about.\n  At this moment the childcare situation in this country is beyond \ndisgraceful. Millions of working families are unable to find affordable \nquality childcare, and many of our young people enter kindergarten and \nfirst grade years behind where they should be, both intellectually and \nemotionally.\n  At this moment the unemployment rate for high school graduates is \nclose to 20 percent. That is the official rate. The real rate, \nincluding those who are working part time and those who have given up \nlooking for work, is actually much higher. If you can believe this--and \nthis is a statistic that should frighten us all; it should make us all \nashamed--the official unemployment rate for Black youth age 16 to 19 is \n43.6 percent.\n  I share the concerns many people have recently expressed about the \ntragic death in Florida of Trayvon Martin. But let's not forget that \nthere are tens of thousands of other young African-American kids all \nover this country who are worried about where they are going to go with \ntheir lives. As the Bureau of Justice Statistics informs us, one out of \nthree African-American men can expect to go to prison during his \nlifetime. What a horrible waste of human potential.\n  Our goal must be to see that these young people are ending up in \ncollege or in decent jobs--not in jail, not dying from drug overdoses, \nnot involved in petty crime or self-destructive activities. This \nlegislation will simply make it harder for those kids and for all kids \nto get the higher education they need in order to succeed in life.\n  Right now, today, hundreds of thousands of young people in this \ncountry who have the ability to go to college are looking at the cost \nof college, the indebtedness they will incur, and they are saying: No, \nI am not going to go to college.\n  What does that say about the future of this country?\n  This legislation, which over a period of years will drive interest \nrates even higher than they are today, will make it harder for the \naverage kid, the working-class kid to get to college. All of us know we \nlive in a very competitive global economy. If we are going to succeed \nas a nation in this competitive economy, we need the best educated \nworkforce in the world. Unfortunately, compared to the rest of the \nworld, we are doing virtually nothing to make that happen.\n  In June the OECD--the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment--released its annual snapshot on the state of education in \ndeveloped nations. The report showed that the United States is losing \nground to other countries that have made sustained commitments in \nfunding higher education opportunities. We are losing ground, and the \nlegislation on the floor today--again, over a period of years raising \ninterest rates extremely high--will make that bad situation even worse.\n  The United States once led the world in college graduates. As a \nresult, interestingly enough, older Americans--those between age 55 and \n64--still lead their peers in other nations around the world in the \npercentage with college degrees, which is 41 percent. But, according to \na very thoughtful report from CNN, this number over the years has \nflatlined. In 2008--and this is a very sad story indeed--the same \npercentage of Americans age 25 to 34 and age 55 to 64 were college \ngraduates. In other words, in that 30-year period we made no progress \nat all. During that period, as we all know, with the explosion of \ntechnology, what we have said to our young people is, you desperately \nneed a college education. Yet, in terms of percentage of our people \nwith college degrees, we are exactly where we were 30 years ago. \nMeanwhile, other countries all over the world have significantly \nsurpassed us in terms of the number of people in those countries who \nare college graduates. In fact, right now, where once we were first in \nthe world in terms of the percentage of our people who are college \ngraduates, today we are 15th in the world.\n  Many people do not understand that today the U.S. Government is \nmaking huge profits off of higher education and\n\n[[Page S5812]]\n\nthe loans we are providing to our young people and to their parents. In \nfact, the estimate is that we will make about $184 billion in profits \nover the next 10 years. To my mind, making huge profits off of young \npeople and their families who want nothing more than to fulfill the \nAmerican dream of being able to go to college or graduate school and \nget out and earn a decent wage and make it into the middle class is \nobscene. We should not be profiteering off working families who are \ntrying to send their kids to college. Yet, with the current legislation \nthat will be on the floor, over a 10-year period we will be making $184 \nbillion in profit.\n  Some people say: We have a deficit. We need to go forward with \ndeficit reduction. This will help us to the tune of $184 billion in a \n10-year period.\n  I say: If you want to do deficit reduction, don't take it out on \nworking families, low-income families who are struggling to send their \nkids to college when one out of four major corporations in this \ncountry--many of which make billions of dollars a year in profit--is \npaying zero in taxes. If you want to do deficit reduction, ask those \nmultinational corporations to start paying their fair share of taxes, \nnot working families who are struggling.\n  Let's be clear about what this legislation that I expect will be on \nthe floor shortly will do. It provides a variable interest rate. Let's \nlook at what the CBO is telling us about where we may be going with \ninterest rates in the coming years. What the CBO tells us is that in \n2013 a 10-year Treasury note, on which this formula is based, is 1.81 \npercent; in 2014 it will be 2.57 percent; 2015, 3.35 percent; 2016, \n4.24 percent; 2017, 4.95 percent. Those are CBO projections.\n  Based on the formula in this bill, here is what Americans will be \npaying for student loans. The good news is that because interest rates \nare low now, in 2013 it will be 3.86 percent for subsidized Stafford \nundergraduate loans; in 2014, 4.62 percent; 2015, 5.40 percent; 2016, \n6.29 percent; 2017, 7 percent, according to CBO.\n  Under the graduate Stafford Loan Program, we are going to go from 5.4 \npercent to 6.1 percent, to 6.9 percent. In 2016, we will be at 7.8 \npercent and in 2017 we will be at 8.55 percent. By the way, all of \nthose figures are below the cap in the bill.\n  What about the parents who are helping their students through the \nPLUS Loan Program? In 2013 it starts at 6.3 percent; 2014, 7 percent; \n2015, 7.8 percent; 2016, 8.7 percent; 2017, 9.4 percent. In other \nwords, people will get up here and say that initially interest rates \nwill be low--because interest rates are low--but they are not telling \nus that in years to come interest rates are going to go up to \nunsustainable levels.\n  My amendment says: OK. Interest rates are low today. Let's take \nadvantage of that fact, and let's sunset this bill in 2 years, where we \ncan then have interest rates that are reasonably low--not as low as I \nwould like them--and will not be prohibitive. Then, through the \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act, we can sit down and deal \nwith two issues: No. 1, how are we, on a long-term basis, going to \nprovide affordable loans, scholarships, and grants to the people of \nthis country who need to advance their education? No. 2, how are we \ngoing to deal with the entire issue of college affordability? College \nin the United States costs much more than it does in virtually every \nother country on Earth.\n  We have over $1 trillion in debt in terms of college loans. College \nloans have tripled since 2004. Young people are graduating from college \nwith $27,000 in debt. That is average. Some students have more debt. I \nhave talked to dentists who went to dental school and are now over \n$200,000 in debt from their dental school bills.\n  We have a crisis right now, and it is a crisis which not only impacts \nthe lives of millions of people and families in our country, it impacts \nour whole Nation economically in terms of whether we are going to have \na well-educated workforce to compete in the global economy.\n  The legislation that is on the floor only makes a bad situation \nworse. The result of it will be more student debt than we currently \nhave. The result of that legislation will be more young people who say: \nI don't want to get out of college and have a $50,000 debt, so I am not \ngoing to go to college. I guess I will never make it to the middle \nclass and never be able to contribute to the country I love in a way \nthat I thought was possible. We have to do better than this \nlegislation.\n  The last point I wish to make is a political point: elections matter. \nThe Presiding Officer recently ran for office. I ran for office in \nNovember. President Obama ran for office. When we run for office, we \ntell the American people what we believe and what we are going to fight \nfor. The end result of those elections is that Barack Obama won a \ndecisive victory. He is the President of the United States. What he \ncampaigned on is: I am going stand up for the middle-class. The other \nguys aren't going to do it, so I am going to do it. What I ran on--as \nwell as many of my colleagues--was: We are going to stand up for the \nmiddle class.\n  The results came in, and you know what. Barack Obama won. We have a \nDemocratic President. As of today, the Senate has 54 Democrats. My \nquestion is: Why, with a Democratic President and a strong Democratic \nmajority in the Senate, are we looking at legislation which is \nvirtually the same as the legislation passed by an extremely \nconservative Republican House of Representatives? How does that happen?\n  What are we telling our constituents who voted for us? We said we \nwere going to stand for the middle class. If we are going to stand for \nthe middle class, we are standing for the affordability of college. We \nneed to stand up for working-class kids so they can have the \nopportunity to be the first in their family--as I was in my family--to \nbe able to go to college. We are talking to African-American kids and \nsaying: You know what. There are alternatives to crime and jail. You \ntoo can go to college. Those are the people we are supposed to be \ntalking to. I fear very much that the legislation that is coming to the \nfloor will not do that. In fact, it will make people say: What is the \ndifference? What is the difference between the House and the Senate?\n  I ask that my colleagues support my amendment. It will give us the \ntime to come up with a long-term solution to a very serious problem.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as the chair of the full \nAppropriations Committee in support of the fiscal year 2014 \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill. At \nnoon we will be voting on the motion to proceed. I am here in the \nstrongest, most affirmative way to urge my colleagues to please vote \nyes so we can get on with this very important bill that was fashioned \nwith bipartisan participation to literally get America moving again.\n  The Transportation-HUD appropriations bill for 2014, under the \nleadership of Senator Murray and the ranking member Senator Collins, is \nan outstanding effort. It shows what bipartisan consensus is and \nfocuses on two things: America's infrastructure and transportation and \nmeeting compelling human needs in housing and urban development, both \nof which contribute to creating jobs in the United States of America.\n  This is not a bill where jobs will be on a slow boat to China or a \nfast track to Mexico. It puts America on the right track to meet these \nneeds in transportation.\n  There is a very good reason we need this bill. The American Society \nof Civil Engineers says the need for physical\n\n[[Page S5813]]\n\ninfrastructure in our country is piling up. Steel rusts, asphalt wears \nout, and buildings need to be repaired, to be maintained.\n  It is not politics; it is physics. We have to make investments today \nso our Nation can grow. We still have an unemployment rate of over 7 \npercent.\n  So how do we get America moving? Public investment that creates \nprivate sector jobs.\n  That is what we like about transportation. This bill, under the \nleadership of Senators Murray and Collins, includes Federal aviation--\nthat is a word for airports--the Federal Highway Administration, in \nwhich we need to build and repair, Amtrak, and also the National \nTransportation Safety Board. When there is an accident, they are on the \njob find out what the problems are.\n  This bill keeps America moving on land, sea, and in the air. But, \nmost of all, it is about bread-and-butter issues. It meets real needs \nin real time in our communities, building roads and building community.\n  This is also why I am a strong supporter of the housing and urban \ndevelopment aspects in this bill. The Presiding Officer knows of my \nsocial work background; I know of his as a county executive--working \nhand in hand on the needs of the people in the Delmarva Peninsula. We \nknow there is prosperity and pockets of poverty. This bill, through the \ncommunity development block grants, helps meet these compelling needs--\nagain, local needs decided by local leaders in real time. It also meets \nneeds for the elderly and for the disabled.\n  The Senate bill provides an allocation, under my leadership, of $54 \nbillion in discretionary spending. This is in sharp contrast to the \nHouse bill, which provides $10 billion less than the Senate. The House \nallocation fails to provide those resources in transportation. Senators \nMurray and Collins will go into that in more detail.\n  But what I want to be able to say is, under my leadership as the full \ncommittee chair, my subcommittees have marked up--with the budget bill \npassed under Senator Murray's leadership chairing the Budget \nCommittee--a top line of $1.058 trillion. Oh, my God, $1 trillion. \nWell, remember, $600 billion goes to defense, and $400 billion comes to \ndomestic needs. If ever there were domestic needs, it is in our \nphysical infrastructure in meeting the tattered, worn aspects of our \ncommunities.\n  There is a much greater debate going on in our country now because of \nthe Trayvon Martin-George Zimmerman situation. A debate has begun, \nreally under our President's encouragement, on race, ethnicity, and \nother aspects.\n  Well, what we need to do is be able to take stock of ourselves--take \nstock of ourselves: how we treat one another, how we view one another. \nDo we view one another as enemies consistently, do we view them on \nstreet corners or in communities, or do we begin to look at how we \nbuild community in our neighborhoods, starting with housing for the \nelderly, making sure the disabled are taken care of, having respect for \none another, passing an education bill dealing with the student loans.\n  This bill will put Americans to work and also meet our compelling \nneeds, and we can do it in a way that shows we can do smart spending to \naccomplish national goals.\n  I too want to reduce the public debt of the United States, but I am \ngoing to lower our unemployment rate. I am going to lower the rate of \ndanger in our physical infrastructure. I also really want the motion to \nproceed to pass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the very able committee \nchairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee for her direction to \nour full committee to move forward on our appropriations bills. I am \nvery proud that the transportation and housing bill will be the first \nof, hopefully, many bills to move through here, but I really thank her \nfor her tremendous leadership, encouraging myself and my ranking member \nSenator Collins to move forward with our bill to the floor today. We \nwill both be giving our opening statements. I know the ranking member \non the full Appropriations Committee will be here as well.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee has asked for some time to \nspeak before Senator Collins and I move forward on our discussion of \nthis bill today. So I will yield to him, and we will speak after he \ndoes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much. I also \nthank my friend from Maine for her indulgence. Believe me, I will be as \nshort as I possibly can. I deeply appreciate their indulgence.\n\n\n                            Tax Code Reform\n\n  I am here to basically say I believe we must very aggressively reform \nour Tax Code. It has not been updated since 1986. Since that date, it \nhas built up barnacles, loopholes, deductions, credits. There have been \n15,000 changes to the Tax Code since 1986, and there have been \nadditions. There have not been subtractions.\n  Our code is out of date. Other countries have kept their tax codes up \nto date. They have ensured that their companies are more competitive \nwith changes in their tax codes. We have not done so. Our American \ncompanies are losing out. They are losing out to other companies \nworldwide because our code has not kept up to date.\n  In fact, there is a recent survey by Harvard Business School. Harvard \nBusiness School surveyed over 10,000 of its graduates over a short \nperiod of time.\n  The conclusion of that survey, from those who responded, is America \nis starting to lose its competitiveness. We are losing out. Why? Many \nreasons. But the one that bubbles up the most, the one that was most \ntelling, is our Tax Code. Two reasons: One, they said, is the high \nrates. Our Tax Code's top rate, 35 percent for corporations, is much \nhigher than is the rate for other countries worldwide. Other countries \nhave lowered their top corporate rate. We have not lowered ours. As a \nconsequence, when there is a merger, the consequence is that the \nheadquarters ends up in another country, very simply because the tax \nrate in that country is lower than it is in the United States. The \nAnheuser InBev merger is one of many examples.\n  The second reason they give to the Code, why the U.S. Tax Code is \ncausing the United States to be less competitive, is not only because \nour rates are higher but because our Code is so more complex. It is \nvery difficult for people doing business in the United States or \nAmericans doing business in the United States or people in other \ncountries who work with the U.S. Tax Code to deal with our Tax Code \nbecause it is so complex.\n  In addition, our Code needs to be updated because it is so complex, \nnot only from an international perspective but from a domestic \nperspective. Americans as individuals do not trust the Code. It is too \ncomplex. They cannot figure out their own returns. I might say, myself, \nit was not too many years ago I was sitting down at the kitchen table \ntrying to figure out my own tax returns. I am not a wealthy man. \nFrankly, I had to give up. I could not figure it out. I felt un-\nAmerican that I could not figure out my own taxes, especially as \nsomebody who went to college, went to law school, is in the Senate. I \nstill cannot do my own taxes. Something is not quite right there. Many \nAmericans believe, as a consequence, that somebody else is getting some \ndeductions and credits when they hire a fancy lawyer. They are getting \ncredits and deductions that they are not getting.\n  Then small businesses. Small business has a devil of a time keeping \nup with rules and regulations, let alone tax provisions. They spend \nmuch more of their dollars on regulations, including tax returns, \nhiring CPAs to figure out the returns than big business does. It is \nusually the big business that can deal with the complexity of the Code. \nIt is much more difficult for small businesses. The complexity of the \nCode is hurting our country because it is also hurting small business \nin America.\n  I might say too, as a couple of examples of the complexity, there are \n42 definitions of a small business--42 different definitions in the \nCode of small business. There are either three or four definitions of a \nchild. My Lord, you would think we all know what a child is. But there \nare three or four different definitions of what constitutes a child. \nThere are many--I forgot the exact number--many different provisions in \nthe Code with respect to the education deduction--education credit.\n\n[[Page S5814]]\n\n  In my hand is a 90-page document explaining the education deductions \nalone--90-page document. You think the American family, American \nstudents have the patience to go through a 90-page document that \nexplains which deductions are available and which are not? No way. That \nhas got to be simplified. So we must simplify the Code, get rid of a \nlot of the junk, frankly.\n  I believe the approach we are taking in the Finance Committee is the \ncorrect approach. We have had over 50 hearings in the Finance \nCommittee. We have had many sessions in the committee about what is \nnext, as the occupant of the chair knows. The approach we are taking is \nvery simple: We are starting with a clean slate. We are getting rid of \nall of the deductions, all of the credits. They total about $1.2 \ntrillion annually. We are getting rid of them all--$12 trillion over 10 \nyears. Get rid of them all, then start to build up which ones seem to \nmake the most sense.\n  Senator Hatch and I are working together. This is a bipartisan bill. \nThe ranking member of the Finance Committee and I are together in this \napproach. We have asked our colleagues on the committee, off the \ncommittee, all Senators both sides of the aisle: Give us your \nsubmissions. What do you want added back to the clean slate? Do you \nwant anything added back? If you want something added back, how do you \nwant to change it, how to tailor it? We are not going to stand here and \nmention lots of different ways it can be changed. Senators know what \nthey are.\n  I think by working through Senators, it is more likely to be a \nbetter, a more solid, productive product. I urge all of my colleagues, \nsend us your submissions. Send your submissions. There are a couple of \nSenators on the floor. I hope they have submitted their suggestions. \nThey indicated they have. Good. I urge my colleagues to do so, because \nwe are hearing directly from constituents.\n  We have a Web site. It is taxreform.org. There were 10,000 \nsubmissions from around the country of people telling us what they \nwant. I submit, if our constituents are telling us how they want the \nTax Code changed, at the very least we as Senators should also indicate \nhow we would like to see the Tax Code changed and be in on the ground \nfloor starting out, rather than having to come out on the floor and \noffer amendments, adding something back in that has to be paid for. If \nit is added back in, I do not think that is something Senators want to \ndo.\n  We will mark up the tax bill this fall. There is going to be a \nmarkup. There is going to be a markup this fall. I am guessing--I do \nnot like to predict dates because sometimes they change, but sometime \nthis fall, September, October, November, in there, we are going to mark \nup a tax bill.\n  I urge Senators to be ready. This is bipartisan. I have worked \noverboard. I have had meetings personally with every single Senator \nabout the Tax Code. At lunch today, for example, Chairman Camp and I--\nwe meet weekly. At lunch today, we are meeting with 10 House Members, \n10 Senators--a total of 10. We call it ``burgers and beer'' every 2 \nweeks over at the Irish Times. That is symbolic, because that is where \nthe last Tax Code in 1986 was in many respects put together. The more \nwe get to know each other, get to know House Members--I must confess \nthere are a couple of House Members whom I did not know and they did \nnot know who I was.\n  We talk about kids, we talk about tax reform. It is a bonding process \nto get to know each other better. Dave Camp and I are going around the \ncountry. We went to the Twin Cities a couple of weeks ago, met with 3M, \nwith management, with their employees, and met with a small bakery. It \nis called Bald Eagle Bakery. We are going to Philadelphia a week from \nnext Monday. I think we are going over to Delaware; I am not sure. We \nwill be up in New Jersey. I apologize to the Presiding Officer. It is \nNew Jersey. We are going to Philadelphia and New Jersey for another \nsession. There will be others. We are traveling around the country. We \nwant to talk to people to see what they have to say.\n  I think this is the way to crack some of this partisan gridlock \naround here, this partisan deadlock around here. How? We are working \ntogether, low key, building from the bottom to the top with these \nsessions, these meetings, discussions, keep talking. Because we all \nknow the Tax Code needs to be reformed. It is way dated. It is out of \ndate.\n  A small example is all of the exempt provisions, the 501(c)(4)s and \n(3)s, and so forth. This has not been addressed for over 50 years. All \nof the money since Citizens United is tax exempt, trying to find a safe \nhome; that is, where there is no disclosure of either donors or amount. \nThat has got to be maybe addressed as well. That is just one example.\n  My main point is to first indicate there is going to be a markup. It \nis an opportunity for Senators to send in their submissions. The \ndeadline is the end of this week. I urge all of my colleagues to do so.\n\n  Finally, I am very grateful for my friends from Maine and Washington \nfor allowing me to take time. I thank them very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we spend far too much time here in the \nSenate scrambling to address short-term crises and far too little time \nworking to tackle the serious long-term challenges facing our Nation. \nThat is why I am very pleased the Senate will soon be considering the \nfiscal year 2014 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development \nappropriations bill. This transportation and housing bill received \nstrong bipartisan support as it moved through the Appropriations \nCommittee. It was reported out of subcommittee unanimously.\n  On June 27, the members of the full committee voted 22 to 8 to report \nthis bill here to the Senate. This bill received this strong bipartisan \nsupport because it helps families and communities, it gets workers back \non the job, it is fiscally responsible, and it lays down a strong \nfoundation for long-term and broad-based economic growth.\n  Our transportation and housing bill is very different from the one \nthat is moving through the House of Representatives right now, which \npassed out of their committee on a strict party-line vote. The Senate \nbill funds the highly successful TIGER Program to ensure support for \ntransportation projects of national or regional significance. The House \nbill zeros out that funding and even takes away TIGER funding provided \nfor this current year.\n  The Senate bill provides $500 million to make necessary repairs to \nour Nation's bridges, when one in four bridges today across the country \nis classified as deficient. The House bill does not provide that \ncritical funding. Our bipartisan Senate bill fully funds the Essential \nAir Service Program. The House bill kicks communities out of the \nprogram and then shortchanges the program.\n  On this side, our bill protects investments in our aviation \ninfrastructure, while the House bill cuts spending we need to maintain \nand modernize the air traffic system by more than $\\1/2\\ billion, to \nthe lowest level since fiscal year 2000, more than a decade ago now.\n  The Senate bill maintains funding for the CDBG and HOME Programs, \nwhile the House bill proposes to cut both to their lowest levels ever. \nIt preserves the Federal commitment to the mostly elderly and disabled \ntenants of public housing and section 8 project-based housing, while \nthe intentional short funding of both programs in the House bill would \nultimately lead to their demise.\n  The House bill falls short in these and many other areas because its \ninvestment level is simply unsustainable. It is even lower than \nsequester levels. Without adequate resources to fund core and housing \nprograms, it cuts deeply and broadly and very few programs escape the \naxe.\n  The approach taken by the House should concern all of us, because \nthis is not about politics, it is about our country. Investing in our \ninfrastructure is something that brings together the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, major labor groups such as the AFL-CIO, economists, and \npolicy experts across the entire political spectrum because, as any \nbusiness owner will tell you, no matter how challenging the current \nenvironment, you never want to cut the\n\n[[Page S5815]]\n\ninvestments that allow you to compete and prosper once that crisis \nends.\n  There are plenty of independent assessments showing that right now as \na country we are not investing enough in our aging infrastructure, and \nno one--no one--is suggesting we invest too much. The fact is, if we \nslash our investments in infrastructure, we are not saving any money at \nall; we are making things worse. We are weakening our basis for private \ninvestment and economic growth. We are putting public safety at risk. \nWe are allowing congestion to continue taxing families with painfully \nlong commutes, long waits at airports, and health-threatening \npollution.\n  Roads are going to need to be fixed eventually. Bridges are going to \nneed to be strengthened at some point before they collapse. The air \ntraffic control system will have to be modernized before air travel \nbecomes too unreliable. Waiting will only make the work more expensive \nwhen we eventually do it. It is shortsighted and does not make any \nsense. That is why the bipartisan Senate bill supports critical \ninvestments in our Nation's infrastructure that are necessary to \nsupport and grow our economy. The investments included in our bill make \nit possible for people to get to work and products to get to market. \nBecause other countries are investing in their infrastructure as \nquickly as they can, investments here in America are a key factor in \nmaking sure our country can compete and win in the 21st century global \neconomy.\n  Our bipartisan bill also supports our local communities' efforts to \npromote economic development, supports small businesses, and creates \naffordable housing. These investments help create jobs and are \nnecessary to ensure our Nation's economic competitiveness into the \nfuture. Our bill funds a critical piece of the safety net, housing \nassistance and homeless shelters for millions of families who are one \nstep from the street. It moves us closer to finally eliminating \nhomelessness among our Nation's veterans.\n  The need for these investments far exceeds the resources in this \nbill. But here in the Senate we have been able to keep our commitment \nto our States and our communities and ensure the agencies in the bill \ncan meet their statutory responsibility. The House bill's untenable \ninvestment level and commitment to sequestration makes those \ncommitments impossible to keep.\n\n  The Senate bill also works to improve the programs funded, including \nreforms that address concerns Members raised the last time the \ntransportation and housing bill came to the Senate floor. Our \nbipartisan bill includes important section 8 reforms to reduce costs \nand create efficiencies. It contains reforms to improve the oversight \nof public housing agencies and boards, ensures accountability for \nproperty owners who don't maintain the quality of their HUD-assisted \nhousing, and increases accountability in the CDBG Program. The House \nbill doesn't include any of those reforms. Our bill also continues to \nrequire oversight by the offices of the inspectors general and GAO and \nincorporates their findings into the bill's guidance to agencies.\n  In short, our bill is a good bill, and, along with Senator Collins, I \nencourage Members to bring their amendments to the floor and to work \nwith us to make this bill even better. This bill has broad bipartisan \nsupport because it takes a practical approach to addressing the real \nneeds we find in the transportation and housing sectors. The \ninvestments it makes would create jobs and help the middle class right \nnow, it would help lay down a strong foundation for long-term and \nbroad-based economic growth, and it helps position our country and our \neconomy to compete and win in the 21st-century global economy.\n  The approach taken by our House colleagues on their transportation \nand housing bill would cut investments in a way that may make our \nshort-term budget deficit look better on paper but that would hurt our \nfamilies, cost us far more in the long run, and hollow out our long-\nterm investments and potential for economic growth. So I urge all our \ncolleagues to help support our bipartisan bill and move us rapidly to \nfinal passage.\n  Again, before I yield, I wish to thank Chairwoman Mikulski, who was \nhere a few moments ago, for her tremendous support and leadership. She \nwas, as she stated, the former chair of the VA HUD subcommittee, and \nshe really appreciates the importance of the investments this bill \nmakes.\n  This bill does include the priorities of Members on both sides of the \naisle, reflecting the bipartisan tradition in the Appropriations \nCommittee. So I especially thank my entire subcommittee for their work, \nand I would like to take a moment to especially express my appreciation \nand thanks to my ranking member Senator Collins for all her hard work \nand cooperation throughout this process. I am very proud that together \nwe have written a bill that works for families and communities.\n  Investing in our families and communities and long-term economic \ngrowth shouldn't be a partisan issue, and I think the bipartisan work \nthat went into this bill and the strong support it received in \ncommittee proves it doesn't have to be.\n  I look forward to moving to this vote at noon today to allow us to \nget on the bill, and I encourage all our Members to bring their \namendments to us. My ranking member Senator Collins and I will work our \nway through those as efficiently as we can so we can bring this bill to \na conclusion.\n  Again, I thank Senator Collins for her tremendous work and her in-\ndepth understanding of the tremendous issues within this bill, I thank \nher for working with us, and I yield to her at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am pleased to join Chairman Murray as \nwe begin floor consideration of the fiscal year 2014 appropriations \nbill for the Department of Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, and related agencies. This return to regular order in \nwhich appropriations bills are considered individually, with the \nopportunity for full debate and for Members to come to the floor and \noffer their amendments, is welcome indeed.\n  Like Senator Murray, I wish to commend the two leaders of our \nAppropriations Committee--Senator Mikulski, the chair, and Senator \nShelby, the ranking member--for their commitment to returning to \nregular order. We simply must stop the irresponsible practice of \nwaiting until the eleventh hour and then producing a bundled bill \ntotaling thousands of pages with little or no opportunity for truly \ncareful deliberation and debate.\n  I wish to thank our subcommittee chairman for working very closely \nwith me to craft this bipartisan bill. She has been a tremendous leader \nof our subcommittee and has operated in a way that has been completely \nbipartisan.\n  This bill makes responsible investments in transportation and \neconomic development and includes input and priorities from Members \nfrom both sides of the aisle. We listened to the concerns of our \nMembers, and the bill was approved by a bipartisan vote of 22 to 8 in \ncommittee.\n  The fact is that the transportation and housing appropriations bill \nhas a long tradition of bipartisan support. Every Senator has unmet \ntransportation and housing needs in his or her home State, from \ncrumbling roads and bridges, to economic development needs, to a \ngrowing population of low-income families, elderly, and disabled \nindividuals who need our help.\n  According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, the condition \nof our Nation's infrastructure remains poor. Our roads, airports, and \ntransit systems received a grade of D, while our bridges, ports, and \nrail systems received only a C. In fact, in my State of Maine the roads \nand bridges are among the worst in the Nation's rural transportation \nnetwork. This matters because we need efficient and safe transportation \nnetworks to move our people around the country and to move our products \nto market.\n  The bill before us does not begin to solve all of our Nation's \ntransportation and housing woes. We simply do not have the money to do \nthat. After all, we cannot ignore the size of our unsustainable $17 \ntrillion national debt. We also cannot ignore the need for investments \nthat will help the private sector create jobs and allow our people and \nproducts to travel safely and efficiently and our most vulnerable \ncitizens to receive decent housing.\n  I understand that some Members are very concerned about supporting \nany\n\n[[Page S5816]]\n\nfunding bill that has an allocation that is higher than the House \ncounterpart. I certainly agree it is important that we adhere to \ncurrent law, which limits spending to $967 billion. But it is our \nresponsibility to consider the merits of each of the Senate funding \nbills and produce bills based on our best judgments. Then we negotiate \nwith our House counterparts in conference. That is the way the process \nis supposed to work. That is how we produce compromises. That is how we \nproduce appropriations bills. The Senate should not be a rubberstamp \nfor the House, nor should the House be a rubberstamp for the Senate. \nEach body should come forth with its individual appropriations bills, \nand then we should meet in conference, negotiate, and produce bills \nthat can have the support of both bodies.\n  The fact is that the fiscal year 2014 House transportation and HUD \nallocation of $44.1 billion is, in my judgment, insufficient to meet \nthe true needs of both transportation and housing. In fact, the House \nallocation was $51.6 billion just last fiscal year, so this year's \nHouse allocation reflects a dramatic cut. Could there be further cuts \nin our bill? Absolutely. I am sure there will be some worthwhile \namendments offered on the Senate floor, and, more importantly, I \nbelieve that when we negotiate with our House counterparts we will \nproduce a bill that is most likely somewhere in between the two \nallocations.\n  Our bill is by no means a perfect bill, but the House bill includes \npolicy choices I believe most Senators will find problematic if they \ntake a close look at the House provisions. Let me cite one example.\n  Our bill provides nearly $3.2 billion for the Community Development \nBlock Grant Program. The CDBG Program supports economic development \nleading to job creation across the country. I want to point out that \nthe President's budget cut that program. It proposed $2.8 billion, \nwhich is the lowest funding level since 1976, when President Gerald \nFord was in office. The CDBG Program is one of the most popular Federal \nprograms because of the flexibility it gives communities and States to \ntailor their economic development projects. Yet the House bill would \ncut the program even beyond the President's budget by reducing this \nimportant program by more than $1.1 billion below the 1976 levels. That \nis when the program was first created in a Republican administration \nthat recognized that States and communities are best able to use the \nflexibility of the Community Development Block Grant Program to meet \nthe needs of their citizens, to spur downtown development, to create \nincentives for businesses to locate, and to produce good jobs.\n  Our bill also continues funding for the TIGER grant program, which \nsupports transportation infrastructure projects that have a significant \nimpact on the Nation, a region or metropolitan area. The House bill not \nonly eliminates this program but also rescinds funding for the current \nfiscal year by 50 percent. That means a round of grants that are just \nabout to be funded could not go through.\n  For aviation programs our bill provides sufficient funding to ensure \nthat the NextGen modernization efforts will continue to improve the \nefficiency, safety, and capacity of our aviation system.\n  With the lower funding levels as proposed by the House, here is the \nirony: We would simply end up paying more in the long term than we \nwould now by providing the funding when it is needed.\n  So this program isn't a matter of whether we need it; it is when are \nwe going to fund it. Funding it now, as we have been doing year after \nyear in an incremental way, allows the NextGen Program for aviation to \nstay on track, and it will end up costing less than if we cut the \nfunding and stretch it out over many more years.\n  Our bill also includes $1.4 billion for Amtrak while the House bill \nprovides only $950 million. But in no way is the Senate funding \nextravagant. In fact, it is nearly $1.2 billion less than the \nadministration's request for Amtrak, and it avoids gimmicks that the \nObama administration used in this account.\n  While the needs for Amtrak infrastructure far exceed what we were \nable to provide, our bill is a step in the right direction. Under the \nHouse proposal, Amtrak would be forced to consider cutting service, \nwhich could affect millions of passengers, diverting them to our \nalready congested highways and busy airports.\n  In reality, the overall resources provided in this bill are well \nbelow the level of investment that our Nation's infrastructure \nrequires, as the subcommittee chairman so correctly pointed out. \nNevertheless, it would spur creation by the private sector of good jobs \nnow, when they are needed most, and it would establish the foundations \nfor future economic growth.\n  Just as important to our economic future, however, is reining in \nFederal spending. Getting our national debt under control must be a \npriority governmentwide. In setting priorities for the coming year, \nthis bill strikes the right balance between thoughtful investment and \nfiscal restraint.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to present this important bill to our \nChamber, to our colleagues. As we debate this bill, I urge our \ncolleagues to support the motion to proceed to the compromises our \ncommittee worked so hard to achieve and, most of all, to come forward \nwith suggestions for improvements through amendments.\n  Let me end by emphasizing that point. I have the assurance of the \nsubcommittee chairman that Republicans will be allowed to offer \namendments. So I would say to my colleagues: Even if you don't like \nthis bill, there is no reason to oppose the motion to proceed on the \nbill. You will be given an opportunity to offer amendments, to change \nthe numbers in this bill, to cut programs if you wish. But let's get on \nthis bill so we can return to the normal process of full and fair \ndebate on individual appropriations bills, rather than waiting to the \neleventh hour, bundling them together with little review, with \ninsufficient care, deliberation, and debate or relying on continuing \nresolutions, stop-gap measures, which wreak havoc on the ability of \nprograms to be carried out in a cost-effective manner.\n  I see our ranking member of the full committee is on the floor and I \nyield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I thank the chairwoman of the \nAppropriations Committee Senator Mikulski for moving ahead to complete \naction on this, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development \nappropriations bill. This is the first bill reported by the \nAppropriations Committee to be considered by the Senate on the floor.\n  I believe it is important that Congress exercises constitutional \nauthority over the funding of government. If we do not pass \nappropriations bills, the undesirable outcome is a government shutdown, \nwhich none of us wants. I believe, however, that the Senate is still on \na precarious path.\n  The majority is pursuing a top-line discretionary spending level of \n$1.058 trillion for the fiscal year 2014. This exceeds the Budget \nControl Act level by over $90 billion. The Budget Control Act is the \nlaw that establishes and enforces, through sequestration, limits on \ndiscretionary spending.\n  In fiscal year 2013, most discretionary programs were forced to take \narbitrary across-the-board cuts. We did not have to go in that \ndirection for 2014. Over 1 month ago, all Republican members of the \nAppropriations Committee signed a letter to Chairwoman Mikulski calling \nfor a top-line number of $967 billion that complies with the law.\n  There could have been an alternative to sequestration. The \nAppropriations Committee could have written spending bills that adhered \nto the budget constraints of the law. This would have allowed Congress, \nnot an indiscriminate formula, to make spending cuts of its choosing \nand to establish priorities, which we ultimately will have to do.\n  This level would have also given Senate and House appropriators a \nbetter chance to conference individual bills. Instead, several of the \nappropriations bills between the two Chambers are so far apart that \naligning them would be difficult, if not impossible.\n  Regrettably, because of this disagreement, the endgame will probably \nbe a continuing resolution. Every year that we have a continuing \nresolution or a series of them is another year that we drift further \naway from the regular order. In addition, even a continuing resolution \nfor 2014 based on this year's\n\n[[Page S5817]]\n\ndiscretionary spending would require another sequester under the Budget \nControl Act.\n  Given the direction we are headed, I wish to vote against all \nappropriations bills that adhere to a total of $1.058 trillion. It is \nnot because the bills are entirely unworthy of support. That is not \ntrue. It is because they will ultimately lead us to a statutory dead \nend and erode the ability of Congress to control how the government is \nfunded, as we have done before.\n  Therefore, I intend to oppose the motion to proceed, not because I \ndon't think the bill has merit, as I said, but because in many ways it \ndoes. I will oppose the motion to proceed because it will inevitably \nlead us, once again, to an impasse that will result in further \ncontinuing resolutions and take us further away from any semblance of \nregular order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, shortly the Senate will move to a vote \non the motion to proceed to the transportation-housing bill.\n  This is the first appropriations bill to come before the Senate. We \nhave worked very hard, in a bipartisan way, to have a bill that invests \nin the projects that are important to this country, to move us forward, \nand help secure a strong future for this country.\n  It is a bill that was tough to write. Our allocation is much lower \nthan those of us who are working on these issues would like to see it, \nbut we have tried to be pragmatic and practical and move forward.\n  I know there are those Members of the Senate who make the argument \nthat our allocation is higher than the House and would vote against \nthese bills. I would remind all of our colleagues, I have been out on \nthis floor innumerable times urging our colleagues to let us go to \nconference on the budget so we can work out this disagreement and be \nable to have allocations be the same from the House and the Senate. But \nwe have been unable to do that because a small group of Senators on the \nother side have objected to us going to that conference. So we are at \nthe place now where we have to move these appropriations bills forward. \nIt does mean eventually we will have to get to a conference and, as my \nranking member pointed out, we will have to work out an agreement. But \nuntil we can go to conference and work out the overall number, we have \nto move forward on these bills; otherwise, we are going to face a \ncrisis come the end of September in terms of funding our government and \ngiving certainty to people across this country about whether we will be \nallocating funds for them to be able to move forward on their budgets \nat the local and State levels.\n  I urge our colleagues to vote yes, allow us to move to this bill. As \nmy ranking member has said, bring your amendments to the floor. If you \nhave an objection to something in the bill or you want to change \nsomething or you want a discussion about something, we will be here, \nready to take amendments, look at them, and have the will of the Senate \nmove forward.\n  In a few short minutes, we will move to that vote and I urge our \ncolleagues to vote yes.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                 Human Trafficking in the United States\n\n  Mr. CHIESA. Madam President, it is an honor for me to speak here \ntoday for the first time on the floor of this distinguished body.\n  I am mindful of the fact that had it not been for the passing of my \npredecessor, Senator Frank Lautenberg, I would not be here today. So I \nwant to associate myself with the tributes that have already been paid \nto his memory.\n  It has occurred to me that if I waited any longer before speaking on \nthe Senate floor for the first time, my maiden speech and my farewell \naddress would be one and the same.\n  My service representing the people of New Jersey in this great \ninstitution will be brief. Yet, for me, I know it will be one of the \nhighlights of my life.\n  I wish to express my heartfelt appreciation to my family--my wife \nJenny and my children, Al and Hannah--for enthusiastically supporting \nthe decision we made as a family to allow me to be here. As everyone in \npublic life knows, the support of our families is indispensable to our \nservice. My daughter Hannah is here with me in Washington this week \nsupporting her dad.\n  I am also incredibly grateful to Governor Christie for the confidence \nhe has again shown in me by naming me to this position. I am deeply \nhumbled by the opportunity to serve the people of my State--the State \nwhere I was born and raised and am raising my own family--here in the \nSenate.\n  Some refer to Senators who have been appointed to unexpired vacancies \nas ``caretakers.'' I reject that label for myself, as I imagine others \nhave who have found themselves in similar positions. No one who has the \nhigh honor and privilege of serving in this body should ever be content \nto serve as a caretaker--to merely ``keep the seat warm.'' Representing \nthe people even for a brief period of time demands that one work to \nmake a difference. My Senate colleagues show me that every day with \ntheir commitment.\n  Today I wish to use this great honor to help give voice to a \nshockingly large and largely unseen group of people who have no voice \nof their own. The United Nations estimates there are upwards of 27 \nmillion of them around the globe. There are believed to be at least \n100,000 of them here in the United States. They are among the most \nexploited, abused, and neglected people on the face of the Earth. They \nare the victims of human trafficking. They are, to be more direct, \nmodern-day slaves.\n  Over the course of my career, both as an assistant U.S. attorney and \nmore recently as the attorney general of New Jersey, I have come face \nto face with the terrible misery of human trafficking. The faces of its \nvictims are haunting. They are often young, and more often than not \nthey are female. They come from every corner of the world but \nespecially from those places where poverty and want define day-to-day \nexistence. They are exploited and abused by human predators that have \nno respect for the law and no respect for basic decency. Often lured by \ntheir captors with empty promises of a better life, the victims are \ninstead utterly betrayed. These victims are robbed of their youth, \ntheir freedom, their dignity, their health, and sometimes even their \nlives. They must not be forgotten. They must not be robbed of justice.\n  Human traffickers--the purveyors of the modern-day slave trade--do \nenormous harm to their victims. When these victims are used in the \npromotion of such crimes as prostitution and child pornography, they \nare also debasing our neighborhoods and our families. As they exploit \ntheir victims by forcing them to labor for little or no money in a wide \nvariety of workplaces and appalling circumstances, they are also \nexploiting employers who offer good jobs, at fair wages, in safe \nworking conditions. And as they abuse their victims in ways too \nhorrible to contemplate, they are also abusing our commitment as a \nsociety to honor the dignity of every human being.\n  My first exposure to the fight against human trafficking goes back to \nmy tenure as an assistant U.S. attorney in New Jersey. And as New \nJersey's attorney general, I made this fight a priority, issuing a \ndirective on human trafficking to sharpen New Jersey's focus in the \nfight against this terrible crime by channeling more resources and \ngreater attention to the problem.\n  This effort is already producing results. Just over a week ago the \nNew Jersey Attorney General's Office arrested six people in Lakewood, \nNew Jersey, and charged them with various human trafficking and other \noffenses. Accused of running a sophisticated network that brought \ndozens of women into the United States from Mexico to work in illegal \nbrothels, those arrested in Lakewood will also face new, tougher \npenalties if convicted. And their victims have been saved from the \ndegradation to which their captors were subjecting them. As satisfying \nas it is to see justice done to the traffickers, there is an even \ngreater sense of accomplishment in restoring freedom to those who were \nbrutally held in bondage.\n  There are, of course, efforts under way to find and prosecute \ntraffickers both at home and abroad, as well as to identify and aid the \ninnocent victims of human trafficking. The Department of State's Office \nto Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons leads our Nation's efforts \nto combat human trafficking around the world. The Department of \nHomeland Security's Blue Campaign works with law enforcement, State and \nlocal governments, various nongovernmental organizations, and other \nprivate groups to provide information, training, and outreach. \nCountless law enforcement officers and prosecutors at every level of \ngovernment are united in the fight to end human trafficking. And untold \nnumbers of organizations and caring people have committed themselves to \naiding the survivors of this terrible assault on human dignity.\n  In this body, the Senate Caucus to End Human Trafficking, led by my \ndistinguished colleagues, the senior Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nBlumenthal, and the junior Senator from Ohio, Mr. Portman, helps to \n``combat human trafficking by promoting awareness, removing demand, \nsupporting prosecution efforts, and providing appropriate service \nsystems for survivors.'' I fully support their outstanding efforts and \nlook forward to working with them on this important issue.\n  And there is more we can do. Having served recently as attorney \ngeneral, I know the States--and specifically the State attorneys \ngeneral--feel hampered in their efforts to put an end to the insidious \npractice of using the Internet to sell illegal sexual services, \nespecially when exploiting the victims of human trafficking.\n  I urge my colleagues to carefully consider any proposals that may \ncome forward to close loopholes in the Federal law that are furthering \nthe victimization of young women being held in bondage.\n  There are, unfortunately, no easy answers. Human trafficking can be \nhard to detect and even harder to prove. It is not unusual for victims \nto be unaware that they are victims of a crime. Their captors are often \nsuccessful at persuading their victims that what is happening to them \nis their own fault. And because of the incessant and violent \nintimidation to which victims are subjected, they may be afraid to even \nattempt to escape the situation in which they find themselves. Fearing \nretaliation from their captors or perhaps afraid they may be deported \nor returned to the situation they sought to escape from in the first \nplace, they are reluctant to seek help, or even to offer help in \npunishing their captors once they are freed.\n\n  The challenge faced in fighting human trafficking is compounded \nbecause not enough people--even people in law enforcement and the \njustice system--recognize it when they confront it. That is why efforts \nto promote\n\n[[Page S5819]]\n\ngreater awareness of the signs of human trafficking are indispensable \nto the success of this fight. And everyone can take up this cause in \ntheir own way.\n  One of the more inspiring efforts has been initiated by a group of \nmiddle and high school students from my State. In 2010, under the \nguidance of Dan Papa, an extraordinary social studies teacher, students \nat the Jefferson Middle School in Jefferson Township, New Jersey, \nformed an organization called Project Stay Gold. The students \nparticipating in Project Stay Gold have created a Web site, pieces of \nart, and launched an innovative mobile project to raise and spread \nawareness of human trafficking. The students and their teacher have set \nsome ambitious goals for their work. One of those goals is to enlist \nthe help of the NFL to raise awareness of human trafficking in advance \nof Super Bowl 48. As a New Jerseyan, that is a goal I share.\n  The people of New Jersey are excited to be hosting this coming year's \nSuper Bowl at the world-class MetLife Stadium. We look forward to the \nplaying of the first outdoor cold-weather Super Bowl in history. But \nNew Jersey is also determined to prevent the usual influx of victims of \nhuman trafficking who, it is widely acknowledged, have in the past been \nbrought against their will to the host cities of large international \nevents such as the Super Bowl as part of the illegal sex trade. I will \nbe working with everyone involved in presenting the Super Bowl--\nincluding the National Football League and the host committee--to raise \nawareness and to eliminate this insidious practice. I know Mr. Papa and \nthe students involved at Project Stay Gold at Jefferson Middle School \nwill enthusiastically join me in this effort.\n  Each of us has the opportunity to help give voice to the voiceless \nvictims of human trafficking. That is why I intend to focus much of the \ntime I do have in this body to advancing the goal of ending human \ntrafficking and aiding the victims of this terrible crime. I look \nforward to working with all of my colleagues and with all of those who \nshare my commitment to this fight.\n  Finally, as someone who is new here and will not be staying long, \npermit me to express my appreciation to so many of my colleagues, from \nboth sides of the aisle, who have been extraordinarily generous with \ntheir time, their knowledge, and wisdom in helping me meet the awesome \nresponsibility I have been entrusted with. Senator McConnell has been \nespecially helpful to me. He is a leader not just by title but by the \nway he conducts himself every day in this body. I also wish to thank my \nfellow New Jerseyan, Senator Menendez, whose collegiality and guidance \nhave been of great assistance to me in my transition.\n  The Senate has long been guided by ancient traditions that have \nserved the institution and the Nation well. I trust that in the months \nand years ahead, it will continue to honor the practices that have \ncaused it to be known as the world's greatest deliberative body. I will \ncertainly try to do my part during my time here to honor those \ntraditions and uphold the special and unique place this body holds in \nour system of governance.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I wish to say briefly to our friend \nSenator Chiesa how much we appreciate his remarks here today. I am \nreminded of what the author of Ecclesiastes points out: ``Time and \nchances happen to us all.'' While he may not be with us a long time \nhere in the Senate, I have every confidence, given his tremendous track \nrecord of public service and the confidence Governor Christie has had \nin him to make this appointment, that we will be hearing more great \nthings about Senator Chiesa in the future.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Madam President, President Obama is scheduled to give a major speech \non the economy tomorrow. Unfortunately, according to press reports, his \nnew ideas for bolstering job creation bear a remarkable resemblance to \nhis old ideas--ideas that have given us the weakest economic recovery \nand the longest period of high unemployment since the Great Depression. \nThe President will probably quite effectively talk about ``winning the \nfuture'' and helping America's youth compete in the global economy. But \nspeeches are more than just words; they have to be about policies. \nUnfortunately, on that count, notwithstanding the fact that President \nObama is a marvelous speech maker, his policies have resulted, as I \nsaid, in a weak economic recovery, a less prosperous America, and more \ndebt and burden for our young people looking for a way out.\n  The problem is that President Obama, not his speeches but his actual \npolicies have done tremendous damage to the economic prospects of the \nsame people he purports to be championing. Indeed, this Obama economy \nhas threatened to create a lost generation of younger Americans who are \ndrowning in debt and are unable to find good full-time jobs.\n  First, on the issue of debt, since President Obama took office, the \nFederal Government has accumulated more than $6.1 trillion in new debt. \nLet me repeat that. Since President Obama took office, the Federal \nGovernment has accumulated more than $6.1 trillion in new debt. I doubt \nanyone within the sound of my voice can actually conceptualize how much \nmoney that really is, but under the President's latest budget proposal, \nthat debt would grow even higher--by another $8.2 trillion--over the \nnext decade. The gross debt is now larger than our entire economy, \nwhich is why every American child enters the world owing $53,000. We \nmight as well call them ``generation debt.''\n  Unemployment, as I mentioned earlier, remains intractable. The \nunemployment rate among young adults age 18 to 29 is 12.7 percent. For \nthe general population it is 7.6 percent, but for those 18 to 29 it is \n12.7 percent. That figure rises to 16.1 percent when we include 1.7 \nmillion young adults who have simply given up finding a job. Of course, \nthese are real live human beings, not just statistics, but the \nstatistics are bad enough.\n  Then there is the lack of good full-time jobs. Last year the \nAssociated Press reported that half of all recent college graduates are \neither jobless or employed in positions that don't fully use their \nskills and knowledge. A separate study in 2012 found that only 4 out of \nevery 10 recent college graduates are doing a job that actually \nrequires a 4-year degree. It has been estimated that 41 percent of all \nunderemployed Americans are below the age of 31. And as we have \nlearned, because of the ObamaCare employer mandate, many full-time jobs \nare being reduced to part-time jobs, especially in the hotel, \nrestaurant, and retail industries.\n  In a new survey, 74 percent of small businesses said they are going \nto reduce hiring, reduce worker hours, or replace full-time employees \nwith part-time employees. In other words, it is not just the slowly \ngrowing economy, it is actually the policies of this administration \nwhich are making it significantly harder for younger Americans to find \ndecent employment.\n  Then, of course, there is the unkept promise of ObamaCare. The \nPresident extravagantly promised: If you like what you have, you can \nkeep it. For a family of four, your premiums are going to be reduced by \n$2,500 on average.\n  Well, we found out that for millions of Americans, if they like the \ncoverage they have, they cannot keep it and will lose it, and that \ninstead of a $2,500 reduction in premiums, an average family of four \nwill see an increase of $2,400.\n  Once it is fully implemented, younger people will be especially \nburdened. They will pay much higher health insurance premiums than they \nare today. Indeed, a recent survey of large health care insurers found \nthat premium costs for young and healthy Americans in the individual \nand small group market will ``increase by an average of 169 percent.'' \nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, ``Healthy consumers could see \ninsurance rates double or even triple when they look for individual \ncoverage'' under ObamaCare.\n  It is not hard to understand why. Under ObamaCare's provisions you \ncan wait until you actually get sick before your buy insurance under a \nconcept known as ``guaranteed issue,'' which then hardly resembles \ninsurance as any of us think about it. And then because of the so-\ncalled age banding phenomenon, where premiums for older people cannot \nbe any more than three times what they are for younger people, what is \ngoing to happen is younger\n\n[[Page S5820]]\n\npeople are going to have to pay higher premiums to subsidize the higher \ncost of caring for people when they get older.\n  Then there is the triple whammy, perhaps, of higher education costs, \nsome of which we are trying to address here with bipartisan student \nloan reform. But under President Obama, the average cost of tuition and \nfees at a 4-year public college or university has increased 27 percent. \nAgain, we have been talking about: How do we deal with the interest \nrates on that debt? But the fact is the principal has gone up 27 \npercent in the last 5 years.\n  For that matter, it is estimated that 4 out of every 10 Americans who \ngraduated from college in 2009, 2010, or 2011 have not been able to pay \noff any of their student debt. As a longtime Silicon Valley businessman \nrecently noted: The millennials are the ``most educated'' generation in \nAmerican history, but they are also the ``most indebted.''\n  Is there any wonder that only one out of every five recent college \ngraduates says their generation will be more successful than the one \nthat came before them?\n  My parents were part of the so-called ``greatest generation''--Tom \nBrokaw coined that title--the World War II generation, people who \nrisked everything they had and sacrificed all they had in order to \nensure my brother and my sister and I would have a better life and have \nmore opportunities. Unfortunately, as a result of the failed policies \nwe have seen over the last 5 years, recent college graduates actually \nbelieve they are going to have less opportunity and less prosperity \nthan generations that came before them.\n  There is no reason why that has to be the case. There is no good \nreason why the Obama economy has to become the new normal--not in a \ncountry as hard working, entrepreneurial, and innovative as the United \nStates of America.\n  Here in Washington, many policymakers seem to have forgotten the \nrecipe, the ``secret sauce,'' if you will, for long sustainable \neconomic growth. I would invite them to visit my State of Texas, which \nhas been luring job creators from all across the Nation. And, lo and \nbehold, you find that when people have opportunity and jobs, they tend \nto vote with their feet, which is one reason why, after the last \ncensus, we had four new congressional seats created in Texas, because \npeople had literally shifted from parts of the country where they could \nnot find jobs to places such as Texas where they could.\n  Here is an interesting comparison, as shown on this chart.\n  In 2010, the Texas economy grew 71 percent faster than the national \neconomy--71 percent. In 2011, it grew 125 percent faster, and last year \nit grew 92 percent faster. These numbers reflect more than just \nhappenstance. They reflect the difference between the policies that are \nembraced here in Washington, DC, and the policies embraced in my State.\n  For example, here in Washington, over the last 4 years, President \nObama's policies have actually made it harder for businesses to create \njobs because of taxes, because of regulation, because of things such as \nthe cost of ObamaCare.\n  In Texas, by comparison, we have worked very hard to make it easier. \nIndeed, if you want more of something, it seems to me you would make it \neasier to create, not harder, which is why Chief Executive magazine has \nnamed Texas the Best State for Business 8 years in a row.\n  Here in Washington, President Obama's policies have seen an increase \nin taxes by $1.7 trillion and increased our national debt by $6.1 \ntrillion, as I mentioned earlier.\n  In Texas, we have no State income tax, and we recently turned a $5 \nbillion deficit into a projected $8.8 billion surplus, thanks to the \nleadership of our Governor and the members of the State legislature.\n  Here in Washington, President Obama has presided over the weakest \neconomic recovery and the longest period of high unemployment since the \nGreat Depression.\n  In Texas, the total number of jobs has grown by nearly 32 percent \nsince 1995, while the total number of jobs nationwide has grown by 12 \npercent--32 percent versus 12 percent.\n  Here in Washington, President Obama's policies have actually hampered \none of our greatest natural resources--energy production on Federal \nlands, to be specific.\n  In my State public policies have consistently encouraged energy \ndevelopment, and total statewide oil production has increased by 94 \npercent between September 2008 and September 2012. I say that at the \nsame time we are the No. 1 producer of electricity from wind energy. We \nbelieve in truly an ``all of the above'' approach.\n  But Texans are unapologetic about our desire to create high-paying \njobs in the oil and gas sector and produce the energy needed to power \nour State and the Nation. All you have to do is look at the phenomenon \noccurring in the Eagle Ford shale in Central to South Texas and the \nPermian Basin in West Texas.\n  Indeed, the Eagle Ford shale produced 358 barrels of oil per day in \n2008. Last year, it produced more than 352,000 barrels of oil a day. \nOver that same period, the number of Eagle Ford drilling permits \nincreased from 26 to more than 4,100.\n  At a time when we see the Middle East continuing its trend of being a \ndangerous place, why in the world wouldn't we want to develop more of \nour natural resources here at home and create jobs at the same time to \nrelieve our dependency on imported oil and gas from dangerous parts of \nthe world?\n  In the Midland area, which is part of the Permian Basin, high school \ngraduates can earn $75,000 a year as a starting job driving a truck. \nMany students aspire to all sorts of other jobs, and they are trained \nfor it. But the point is energy production, taking advantage of the \ninnovation and the technological changes in oil and gas production, can \ncreate jobs and opportunities and help wean us from imported energy.\n  Here in Washington, unfortunately, the administration is still \nclinging to the misguided policies that are preventing the United \nStates from reaching its full domestic energy potential.\n  Consider these numbers: Between 2007 and 2012, total U.S. natural gas \nproduction increased by 20 percent, total U.S. oil production went up \nby 22 percent. However, oil production on Federal lands--that is \nsubject to the control of the Federal Government--actually went down 4 \npercent, while natural gas production on Federal lands dropped by 33 \npercent.\n  How do you reconcile the disparity? Well, the oil and gas and natural \ngas production occurred on private lands, owned by private parties, not \nthe Federal Government. So the Federal Government's record is actually \nquite dismal in comparison.\n  So the message to President Obama--as he pivots once again to the \neconomy--the message could not be more obvious: If the President really \ndoes care about ``winning the future'' and helping the millennial \ngeneration compete in a globalized world, he should abandon the \npolicies that have saddled younger Americans with so much debt and made \nit so difficult for them to find good jobs. In short, it is time to \nreplace the Obama model with the Texas model.\n  This chart makes the comparison I mentioned earlier. Economic growth \nin 2010--after the 2008 fiscal meltdown, we saw the national economy \ngrowing only at 2.4 percent, the Texas economy at 4.1 percent. We need \nto get the national economy growing closer to 4 percent in order to \ncreate the jobs that are necessary to give young people an opportunity \nto work and provide for their families and to build for their future.\n  In 2011, we saw, actually, the national economy slow down at 1.6 \npercent growth. Indeed, the Texas economy slowed down a little more, \nalbeit at 3.6 percent growth.\n  Then, in 2012--just last year--while we still saw the national \neconomy bouncing along at the bottom with only 2.5-percent economic \ngrowth, the Texas economy was growing at 4.8 percent.\n  I know my friends from other parts of the country might discount my \nremarks here today and say: Well, this is just a Senator from a State \nwho is proud of the accomplishments of his State and the people who \nhave made it possible. They would be right. I am. But this is also \nabout what Louis Brandeis once called the laboratories of democracy.\n  That is one reason why it is so important not to just have a national \ngovernment but a Federal government\n\n[[Page S5821]]\n\nwith national responsibilities in those areas that the States and \nindividuals cannot otherwise take care of themselves, and reserving, as \nthe 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution points out, all other power \nnot delegated to the Federal Government to the States and to \nindividuals. That is what protects our freedom, and that is what \ncreates these laboratories of democracy so Texas, so Illinois, so \nWashington State--any other State; Wisconsin--can try these policies \nand see what works and what does not, what creates the prosperity and \nopportunity for their people. And, hopefully, just hopefully, we in \nWashington, DC--those of us who happen to work here as part of our \njob--will embrace those policies and those success stories and make \nthem possible for the rest of the country as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n\n\n                       Health Care and Education\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, first, let me join the Texas Chamber of \nCommerce and everyone else and thank Senator Cornyn for his promotional \nspeech on behalf of the State of Texas. He is very proud of his State. \nI am sure I would be too if I represented it. I represent a State \ncalled Illinois, and we are pretty happy with what we have in our \nState. If the Senator's Governor comes in looking for jobs and he looks \nlongingly at Lake Michigan and they wish they had some water in Texas, \nwe have a lot of it and a lot of other things too.\n  Each of us is proud of our State, and I am not going to sit here and \ngo through a tick list, even if I could, of what is wrong with Texas. I \nwould like to speak to some of the national issues, though, that the \nSenator from Texas raised.\n  What about this ObamaCare? If you listen to the description by the \nSenator from Texas, it is the big hand of government coming down and \nraising the cost of health insurance for Americans.\n  Well, why would they do that? Why would Congress pass something like \nthat? It turns out that is not even part of the story. Here is the \nstory: Too many Americans today do not have health insurance. They \nstill get sick. And when they get sick, what do they do? They go to the \nhospital--usually the emergency room--and they get treated.\n  If they do not have the money through health insurance to pay for it, \nhow does it get paid for? Raise your hand America. If you own an \ninsurance policy, you are paying for the care of those without health \ninsurance, transferring the cost of their care to the rest of America. \nIs that fair to your family or to your business or to you? No.\n  The idea behind ObamaCare was to extend the reach of health insurance \nto more Americans. We tried this. The Senator from Texas talks about \nthe States as laboratories of experiment. We tried this experiment \nunder someone named Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts. He came up with \nthe original ObamaCare, RomneyCare in Massachusetts, and said: \nEverybody in the State is going to have health insurance. It is \nworking.\n  We are trying to do this on a national basis so everyone is engaged \nin paying for their health care and so everyone has the peace of mind \nof being protected with a health insurance policy. What about these \npolicies? There is another thing not raised by the Senator from Texas. \nWhat good is a health insurance policy if it is not there when you need \nit? What good is a health insurance policy if it has a limit on how \nmuch it will pay and someone you love in your family just got diagnosed \nwith a serious cancer illness and now faces surgeries, chemo, radiation \nthat could run into the tens of thousands of dollars well beyond the \ncoverage of your policy?\n  That is when people face reality. That is what ObamaCare was all \nabout. Take the lifetime limits off health insurance so that if some \nunpredictable accident, disease or illness comes your way, it will not \nbankrupt your family and you can still get good care. Those who want to \nabolish ObamaCare ought to answer the basic question: Do you want to go \nback to lifetime limits when it comes to health insurance?\n  There is another element too. We have some younger people in the \nSenate. But some of us have been around. Many of us are in a position \nwhere preexisting conditions apply to all of us. If you had to fill out \nthat questionnaire, there is probably something in your background, if \nyou are in your fifties, sixties or beyond, that would be characterized \nas a preexisting condition. It might mean, in the old days, health \ninsurance companies would say: No thanks. We do not want to run the \nrisk of somebody who has high blood pressure, someone who has a \nprediabetes condition, someone with a person in their family with \nmental illness.\n  So they would not sell you the health insurance--preexisting \nconditions. In America, almost every family has one, whether it is a \nchild or someone who is up in years. ObamaCare says stop discriminating \nagainst Americans under health insurance policies for preexisting \nconditions.\n  When we hear the Republicans talk about eliminating ObamaCare, do \nthey want to go back to the day when you could not even buy a health \ninsurance policy with a preexisting condition?\n  What about this issue of insurance through your business where you \nwork? It turns out 96 percent of the businesses in America today would \nnot be mandated to provide health insurance coverage. They already do \nor they would not be required under the law. We are talking about a \nsmall percentage but an important percentage. The President said he \nwill give us an additional year to make sure we get this right and work \nwith business for the right solution. I think that is reasonable. I \nhave said it before, and I will say it again, when it comes to writing \nlaws, the only perfect law ever written was written on clay tablets and \ncarried down a mountain by Senator Moses.\n  Ever since then, we have done our best and we can always do better. \nBut here is the problem: The National Restaurant Association came to \nChicago about 6 weeks ago, genuinely concerned about ObamaCare and what \nit meant to their industry. I listened to them. I said: I am willing to \nsit down with you. Let's find a way to help you and businesses just \nlike you provide health insurance that is affordable for your \nemployees, that is the right thing for them. I said: I will tell you \nwhat. I guarantee you, if you are willing to sit down and work out \nchanges in ObamaCare in a good-faith way, I will bring Democratic \nSenators to the table. All I ask you is bring Republican House Members \nto the table.\n  They cannot do it. You know why? The Presiding Officer knows why \nbecause she served in the House of Representatives. Because on 67 \nseparate occasions since we passed ObamaCare, the Republicans in the \nHouse and Senate have called for votes to abolish ObamaCare--67 times. \nSomeone--Dana Milbank, I believe, in the Washington Post--made that \ncalculation just last week--67 times.\n  They have been unwilling to sit down and talk about any changes. No, \nwe want to abolish it. Then we will talk. It does not work that way. In \nthe real world, we try to solve these problems as we go. I know this \nObamaCare is important to this country. I think it may be the most \nimportant bill I ever voted on--because I have been there. I was a \nyoung father, a law student, married with a baby with a serious medical \nproblem. I had no health insurance. If you ever felt helpless as an \nindividual, as a father, as a husband, get yourself in that position. \nThere are millions of Americans who face that every single day: no \nhealth insurance and a heartbreaking illness in their family. Let's put \nan end to that. This country is far better than that. Let's aspire to \nsomething that truly provides peace of mind to those across America.\n  There are several other provisions in this bill I will mention before \nI talk about higher education. Under ObamaCare, we make certain that \nfamilies with children under the age of 26 can keep their kids under \ntheir health insurance policy, the family's health insurance policy. \nWhy is that important? Because young people coming fresh out of college \nmay not have a job or they may have a job without health insurance. \nThese young people can now stay under their parents' policy, over \n100,000 in my State of Illinois.\n  When I hear the Republicans call for abolishing ObamaCare, I do not \nhear them calling for abolishing that. That is something families need \nand want. In our closing the doughnut hole--that is the amount of out-\nof-pocket expense seniors have to pay for Medicare prescriptions. \nObamaCare closes that so\n\n[[Page S5822]]\n\nthe out-of-pocket expenses diminish and eventually disappear. That is a \ngood thing for many seniors faced with fixed incomes. I do not hear the \nRepublicans calling for abolishing that either and they should not.\n\n  The Senator from Texas raised the question about the cost of higher \neducation. He is right. I believe he characterized it by saying, under \nthe Obama administration, the cost of higher education has gone up \ndramatically. It is true it did happen after the President was elected, \nbut I did not hear the suggestion from the Senator from Texas that \nPresident Obama mandated it or caused it.\n  What is happening across America is that States, because of their own \nbudget problems, are cutting back on aid to higher education. Colleges, \nmainly public institutions, are raising the cost of tuition, and that \nraises the debt the students end up with when they go to school. It has \nnothing do with President Obama.\n  It is a fact, a serious fact, which brings us to the issue that will \nbe on the floor this week, student loans. Currently, the student loan \ninterest rate for subsidized loans, and that is for families having \n$30,000 in income or less, is 6.8 percent. Just a few weeks ago it was \n3.4 percent. Now it is 6.8 percent. So the question is, Are we going to \nchange it? Are we going to try to bring down that interest rate?\n  Yes, we should. Students are deeply in debt, too deeply in debt. If \nwe can reduce the cost of what they borrow, we should. Let me add a \ncaveat. Students need to think twice about borrowing. Of course they \nshould go to college, but many of them are being lured into schools \nthat are dramatically overpriced. Some of them are not worth it. That \nis a fact.\n  The for-profit college industry is a good illustration. Ask a high \nschool student if they know what a for-profit school is, they will say: \nI am not sure. What is it? It is the one that hits you right between \nthe eyes on the Internet every time you log on. Those are the for-\nprofit schools that are literally companies that make money off of \noffering education.\n  The largest, the University of Phoenix. The combined enrollment at \nthe University of Phoenix is larger than the combined enrollment of the \nBig Ten schools; No. 2, Kaplan, which owns the Washington Post; and No. \n3, DeVry out of Chicago. Those are the three big ones. What about those \nschools? There are three numbers to remember about for-profit schools \nif you want to know. About 12 percent of all of the kids coming out of \nhigh school go to for-profit schools. The for-profit schools receive 25 \npercent of all the Federal aid to education. The for-profit schools \naccount for 47 percent of all the student loan defaults.\n  Why? They charge too much. Their diplomas are worth too little. The \ngood advice to young people is: Start with your community college, if \nyou do not have a clear path for higher education--affordable, many \nchoices. In most States those hours are transferable. But students are \nmaking high-cost choices and getting high-cost debt.\n  So now we are discussing what to do about it. This morning my friend, \nthe Senator from Vermont, the Independent Democrat, Bernie Sanders came \nto the floor and talked about the plight of young people. He is right. \nThey are too deeply in debt. There are too few jobs available. I worry \nabout them, as everyone should.\n  He concluded, though, at the end, we should not vote for the \nbipartisan student loan reform bill we are working on in the Senate. I \nhave to disagree with my colleague. Here is the reality. The interest \nrate today for undergraduate students is at least 6.8 percent on their \nstudent loans. Our bipartisan plan reduces that to 3.8 percent, a 3-\npercent savings for each student borrowing--undergrad student borrowing \nfor the loans they need to go to school.\n  Three percent makes a difference: 6.8, 3.8 makes a big difference. \nAlso, we make it clear that these students are going to be protected in \nthe long run from high interest rates. We put a cap on the interest \nrates that students will ever have to pay under our plan of 8.25 \npercent for undergrad students. That to me is a sensible approach to \ntake.\n  We are trying to find a way to lower this even further. I believe in \nthe premise that the Federal Government should be more actively \ninvolved to reduce the interest rate even more. But this is a good \noutcome. For the next 4 or 5 years, students at all levels are going to \nsee lower interest payments than if we do nothing. Some of my \ncolleagues are upset. They do not like this outcome. They would like to \nsee a much different relationship between the Federal Government and \nthe students and their families. I would too. But I know where the \nvotes are.\n  With the Republican House of Representatives, with the need for 60 \nvotes in this Chamber, that type of reform is not likely to occur. So I \nurge my colleagues, when the time comes to vote on student loans and \nthe student loan interest rate, do not leave us in a position where we \nkeep the 6.8 percent interest rate. Let us bring it down to 3.8 \npercent, a more affordable rate. That is good for these students and \ntheir families. Then let's join with Senator Harkin and Senator \nAlexander for higher education reform, to look at the overall cost of \nhigher education, to work with the President and find ways to reduce \nthe cost of education and to make sure we provide the education and \ntraining our students need to compete in the 21st century.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1744\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I now call up Vitter amendment No. 1744 \nto the appropriations bill currently before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1744.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit funds to be used to provide housing assistance \n         benefits to individuals convicted of certain felonies)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available under this Act \n     shall be used to provide housing assistance benefits for an \n     individual who is convicted of aggravated sexual abuse under \n     section 2241 of title 18, United States Code, murder under \n     section 1111 of title 18, United States Code, an offense \n     under chapter 110 of title 18, United States Code, an offense \n     under chapter 110 of title 18, United States Code, or any \n     other Federal or State offense involving sexual assault, as \n     defined in 40002(a) of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 \n     (42 U.S.C. 13925(a)).\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I hope this is viewed universally as a \ncommonsense, bipartisan amendment. I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment through the rollcall vote which we will have. It \nis very simple, very basic, and I think very appropriate. It says that \nfor the most serious crimes that exist--violent crimes, crimes against \nwomen and children, very serious crimes by anyone's definition--these \nwill be disqualifiers for Federal housing assistance.\n  I bring this amendment for two simple reasons. First, I think this \nshould go hand in hand with committing those extremely serious crimes. \nAgain, we are not talking about threshold crimes. We are not talking \nabout first-time drug offenses. We are talking about aggravated sexual \nabuse, murder, sexual exploitation of children, violence against women.\n  Those are the four big categories, very serious, very violent crimes. \nUsually, these are crimes focused on some of the most vulnerable in our \nsociety, such as children and abused women. I think it is very \nreasonable and common sense to say these crimes have very serious \nconsequences. One of those--the most obvious is a stiff jail sentence, \nin some cases life. But one of those consequences is also going to be \nthe Federal taxpayer is not going to give you housing or give you help \nfor housing.\n  There is a second equally, maybe more, important reason to support \nthis commonsense disqualifier. It is to protect those other folks who \nneed and use Federal housing assistance and help clean up what \nhistorically have been areas that actually congregate violent crime in \nsome of our worst social problems, in Federal housing projects.\n  I grew up in New Orleans. This has been a perennial problem in New \nOrleans. But I am happy and proud to say\n\n[[Page S5823]]\n\nit is a problem that has been getting better, being solved bit by bit, \nparticularly post-Katrina. Similar to most major American cities, in \nthe 1950s and 1960s, huge housing projects began to be built and began \nto grow in New Orleans. They were, unfortunately, centers of some of \nthe worst of some of our social ills, particularly violent crime and \ndrug abuse. And that is because we had a policy which actually \ncongregated--and I hope that wasn't the intent--the worst of those \nproblems in these housing projects. Of course, that fed on itself and \nmade many of these problems even worse and certainly subjected innocent \nfolks trapped in those housing projects to some of the worst problems \nof our big cities.\n\n  In New Orleans, since Katrina, we have taken significant steps to get \naway from that. We have instituted new policy. They are less dense--\nthese housing projects--and there are more mixed income; not 100 \npercent of the folks in these projects are subsidized. It is usually a \nmixed approach so that there are some market based, some partially \nsubsidized, some heavily subsidized, but less dense environments. So we \nhave taken specific steps to try to learn from the horrible mistakes we \nmade in Federal housing projects particularly in the 1960s and early \n1970s.\n  This commonsense test fits in exactly with that approach, and it says \nwe are not going to subject people in these centers of subsidized \nhousing to the worst violence and the worst social problems we have. We \nare not going to congregate violent criminals, drug abusers, and others \nin these housing projects.\n  So that is the second compelling reason to support the Vitter \namendment. Keep in mind the innocent folks in those housing projects \nwho get some subsidized housing help. They deserve better. They do not \ndeserve to be subjected to the worst of the worst, these horrible \nsocial problems that in the past we have actually congregated in public \nhousing projects.\n  So, again, I hope this is viewed as it should be, as a commonsense \namendment and one that deserves wide bipartisan support. I would also \nnote it is extremely similar to an amendment that passed on the recent \nfarm bill without controversy--the same basic rule with regard to the \nFood Stamp Program. So I urge all my colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to support this straightforward, reasonable amendment on \nthe rollcall vote we will, hopefully, have soon.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, let me commend the Senator from \nLouisiana for his amendment. It would restrict criminals who have been \nconvicted of certain violent or sex crimes from receiving housing \nassistance through HUD's public housing choice neighborhood and tenant- \nand project-based section 8 programs.\n  Public housing authorities and private property owners who provide \nassistance under these programs are already required under Federal law \nto deny admission or assistance to individuals who are subject to \nlifetime registration on a sex offender registry under a State program. \nHowever, when you move to the next stage, strangely enough, it is \ndiscretionary.\n  Under current law, prior violent criminal activity may be grounds for \nthe denial of assistance for public housing and the section 8 programs, \nbut it is not required to be grounds to deny that kind of assistance. \nThat is exactly the point that Senator Vitter is trying to make. So his \namendment would tighten the current law to make it very clear that \nunder certain categories--aggravated sexual abuse, murder, and murder \nin the second degree, sexual exploitation, and other abuse of children \nand violence against women--individuals convicted of those crimes would \nnot qualify for public housing assistance under the programs that I \nhave mentioned.\n  As Senator Vitter said, this is a commonsense amendment. It will help \nto make housing safer for the law-abiding citizens residing there. He \nhas targeted serious crimes, and I think his amendment should be \nadopted. I am going to support the amendment, and I will be urging its \nadoption.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, one of the issues and questions that have \nbeen raised by many of my colleagues about this bill is that at first \nglance it appears to be higher than the President's budget request for \nthese two departments--Transportation and HUD and the related \nagencies--and I want to explain why that is. It is a very legitimate \nquestion, but it has a very good answer.\n  The answer is the President's budget for the agencies and departments \nunder our jurisdiction is artificially low because it relies on \ngimmicks, and it relies on scoring differences between CBO and OMB. Let \nme explain just a couple of areas where it will become evident to my \ncolleagues why the difference exists and why the President's budget \nsubmission actually is not less than the bill that is on the floor now, \nif true budgeting principles and accounting were used.\n  First of all, the President's budget proposes to shift $2 billion in \nexisting discretionary programs to mandatory in order to appear to \nachieve savings, including $1.5 billion from Amtrak's operating capital \nand debt service grants and $450 million by removing large hub airports \nfrom the Airport Improvements Program.\n  In addition, the President's budget request assumes an increase in \nthe passenger facility charge at airports from $4.50 to $8.00. Well, we \nhave seen this movie before. When the FAA authorization was being \nconsidered just last year, Congress rejected this fee increase. There \nis no reason to believe it is going to be accepted now. Yet that is \nbuilt into the President's budget assumptions. We have seen him do this \non a host of tax issues too, so this is not unknown for this \nadministration.\n  There is another area I think is highly significant. The President's \nrequest for section 8 project-based rental assistance is insufficient \nto fully fund existing 12-month renewal contracts with the private \nproperty owners who participate in this program. In fact, it is about \n10 percent short of the amount the administration knows is going to be \nneeded to renew these contracts for the full 12 months of the fiscal \nyear. That is about $1.2 billion short. That is about half of the \ndifference we are talking about between the President's budget request \nand our bill.\n  Surely, it is not responsible to assume that somehow we are not going \nto pay these private property owners who are participating in the \nproject-based section 8 program for the full year of rental assistance. \nIt is not going to stop after 10 months. They are not going to be \nevicting their tenants who are receiving the subsidy.\n  So true and accurate budgeting would have required the President to \nput $1.2 billion into his budget request for this program.\n  Finally, CBO scored FHA receipts--the fees, the mortgage insurance \npremiums--at $1.8 billion below OMB's score, which increased the cost \nof maintaining the existing level of services in our bill.\n  We know there are disputes between CBO and OMB all the time. In this \ncase, I am not suggesting that it is a gimmick, as in the other two \nexamples I have given. I am suggesting there is an honest difference of \nopinion. But the fact is, whether we like it or not at times, we are \nbound by CBO's score, and CBO's estimate of those FHA receipts--those \nfees, those mortgage insurance premiums--is $1.8 billion below OMB's \nscore. That is quite a difference.\n  So if you add up those gimmicks, with the Amtrak program moving from \ndiscretionary to mandatory, the assumption that Congress is all of a \nsudden just months later going to change its mind on the passenger \nfacility charges and nearly double them after rejecting that idea just \nmonths ago, the failure to fully fund the project-based section 8 \nrental assistance, and the difference between CBO and OMB--the genuine \ndispute on FHA receipts--if you add all that up, it is not accurate to \nsay our bill is $2.4 billion above the President's request. What we \nemployed was CBO's estimate. We got rid of the gimmicks, and we used \nhonest\n\n[[Page S5824]]\n\nbudgeting, and that accounts for the difference.\n  I hope my colleagues will not be misled into thinking that somehow \nthis bill is above the President's budget request. When you apply \nhonest accounting principles and take into account the $1.8 billion \ndifference between the scoring of CBO and OMB, it is obviously not \ndifferent. In fact, I would argue that we are under the President's \nbudget request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak as if in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, this morning there was news that the \nPresident of the United States is going to engage in a series of \nspeeches around the country to discuss the American middle class and \nthe economy. I think that is actually a positive thing, to start to \nfocus on that a little bit.\n  The America middle class is the essence of America's greatness. I \nhave said this often before because I am a product of that working \nmiddle class--how critically different that makes us from the rest of \nthe world. Every country has rich people, and unfortunately every \ncountry has poor people. But one of the things that distinguishes \nAmerica from the rest of the world is that we have this vibrant middle \nclass.\n  I have lived that in my life. My parents were working-class people \nand came to this country with not a lot of education or many \nconnections, but they were able to provide for us a lifestyle where \nthey owned a home and were able to do vacations and provided us \neverything we needed--not always everything we wanted, of course. But \nthat really distinguishes this country from the rest of the world. That \nvibrant middle class is the essence of our economic exceptionalism.\n  I am glad the President is focused on the middle class, and I hope we \nwill begin to focus on the middle class here in our conversations as \nwell. That is why I come to the floor to speak about the middle class \nfor a moment, because I am very concerned about the impact that the \nhealth care law--ObamaCare--is having on the middle class.\n  I know Republicans have been opposed to ObamaCare from the very \nbeginning, and I understand that a lot of people out there see \nObamaCare as a bill that is going to give them access to health \ninsurance they may not have right now. But what I want people to \nunderstand from a nonpartisan basis--Republicans, Democrats, \nIndependents, no matter whom you voted for in the last election--is \nthat ObamaCare is not working out the way it was advertised.\n  What I wish to point to today is how ObamaCare is actually hurting \nthat vibrant American middle class which the President is trying to \nfocus on in his speeches and which I hope we will be focused on in our \npolicies.\n  Last week on Friday I traveled to central Florida. I went to a place \ncalled Gatorland, which is kind of an old Florida tourist attraction \nwhere kids have gone for a long time with their parents to see the live \nalligators and the shows they put on. I used that as a forum to meet \nwith several small businesses in the region, not all tourism related. I \nhad a chance to sit down and talk with them about their concerns about \nObamaCare and, importantly, not just what it means for their \nbusinesses--and these are middle-class businesses, by the way; we are \nnot talking about billionaires here--but also, more importantly for me, \nthe impact that was going to have on their employees, the people who \nwork for them, working-class, middle-class Americans who happen to live \nin Florida and work at these places.\n  First I heard from the owner of Gatorland, who pointed out that he \nhas a little over 100 full-time employees who work for him. You can \nimagine who I am talking about--the people who take your tickets when \nyou walk in, the ones who run the exhibits. These are everyday working-\nclass people. Some of them are young people who just got married and \nare trying to start a family. He gives them insurance. They have \ninsurance right now. He pays a portion of their premiums and they pay \nthe rest, and they seem to be pretty happy with that insurance \ncoverage. It is not perfect. They have to pay for part of it out of \npocket. But it is coverage they are happy with, and through that \ncoverage they have a relationship with their doctors.\n  A young couple--for example, the wife is a few months pregnant. They \nhave been going to the same OB/GYN. They get comfortable with this \ndoctor, and they are happy going to this doctor. Maybe it is the same \ndoctor who helped them with their previous pregnancies or their kids' \npediatrician who knows their family's history, so every time they sit \nwith him, they don't have to reeducate him. But the point is that they \nare happy with their insurance and also their doctor.\n  But there is a problem: Health care costs and premiums are going up \nfor this business. As they are sitting there looking into next year and \nbeyond, their insurance companies are already telling them: Your \npremiums are going to go up. We can't tell you by how much, but it is \ngoing to be by at least this much.\n  This means the amount of money they put aside every year in \nGatorland's budget to pay for health insurance for their middle-class \nemployees is going to go up big time, so this business has to find the \nmoney from somewhere. They could just raise the price of admission. But \nthey really can't do that. No. 1, people can't afford it. No. 2, they \nhave some pretty significant competition nearby from Disney World and \nUniversal Studios. So that is not really an option for them.\n\n  Their options are as follows:\n  They can take the insurance they are providing now for their \nemployees and get rid of it and replace it with another insurance that \nis cheaper and covers less. By the way, now it is new insurance, so if \nthose middle-class employees are happy with their doctors, their \ndoctors may or may not be on the new plan. So you destroy that \nrelationship as well. It will be cheaper insurance for the employer and \nthe employee, but it will cover less. But it meets the mandate, and \nobviously Gatorland can continue to operate.\n  The second option they have is to reduce a bunch of people to under \n30 hours because if they are working less than 30 hours, they don't \nhave to offer them anything. That is a big cost savings. They don't \nwant to do that, as proven by the fact that they are offering the \ncoverage now, but they may have to do that.\n  The third option is to just pay a fine and let these people go out \nand find their own insurance in the exchanges. The problem with that \nis, No. 1, the exchanges haven't even been created yet. Even though you \nare supposed to be enrolled beginning October 1, they don't exist yet. \nSo you can't even figure out what they are if you live in Florida. No. \n2--the same problem--it is a new insurance company, which means you may \nor may not have the same doctor.\n  A fundamental promise of this law when it was passed was that if you \nare happy with your doctor, you won't have to lose that doctor. If you \nare happy with your insurance, you can keep it. Obviously, for about \n100-some-odd people who work in central Florida, that is not true.\n  I also met with a young woman named Gigi Barrios. She is the owner of \nFCS Building Services. Basically, it is a company that provides \njanitors at night to come and clean your office. This is the epitome of \nthe working class. You know who I am talking about--the people who come \nin after 6:00 and vacuum the carpets and clean your offices. These are \nher employees. She also offers them health insurance, but her health \ninsurance premiums are going up next year big time. She is going to \nhave to go through the exact same choices as Gatorland. So right now in \ncentral Florida there are janitors and janitorial crews who are working \nmore than 40 hours a week, have health insurance they are happy with, \nhave doctors they have relationships with, and they are on the verge of \nlosing all of that because of this law and its impact.\n  I met with an owner of a place called Fun Spot. Fun Spot is an old \nFlorida attraction place. After 5 years of working at Fun Spot, you get \n100 percent coverage. If you work there for 5 years, they pay all of \nyour insurance; you don't pay a penny out of pocket. But their costs \nare going up astronomically--higher than anybody else's who was meeting \nthere. The same calculation is going to happen: They are going\n\n[[Page S5825]]\n\nto have to find new and cheaper insurance, which means people who have \n100 percent full coverage and are happy are going to lose it--these are \nticket takers and ride operators and people who clean up. These are \nmiddle class, working-class Americans. They will lose their coverage.\n  I can tell you, they are not going to pay 100 percent of anyone's \ncoverage moving forward because even if they wanted to at this point--\nand they do want to--they can't afford it. The premiums are going up \nbecause of ObamaCare. Or they could come up with one of these newer \nplans that costs less money, but there is the same fundamental problem.\n  Now, you may say maybe this is a Florida problem. It is not. The U.S. \nChamber of Commerce recently did a survey. They found that 75 percent \nof small businesses in America are going to have to do something like \nthis. In their survey they found that 27 percent of small businesses \nare going to cut hours just to get under the 30 hours a week to avoid \nthe health insurance mandate because they can't afford it; 24 percent \nof small businesses are going to hire fewer people--which is one of the \nproblems at Fun Spot. They actually own land, and they want to expand \nand grow Fun Spot. They want to add more rides, more attractions, more \nmiddle-class, working-class jobs. That is not going to happen now. So \n24 percent of companies are going to hire fewer people because of \nObamaCare, and 23 percent of companies plan to replace full-time \nemployees with part-time employees.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has found that at least 7 million \npeople in America are going to lose the employer coverage they have \nright now. At least 7 million Americans will have the promise that was \nmade to them broken. So if you have insurance, if you are happy with \nyour insurance, you are going to lose your insurance because of \nObamaCare.\n  Five million people will have to pay for more expensive plans because \nof ObamaCare. Because they make too much according to the law, they \nwon't qualify for a subsidy to help pay for it.\n  It is not just businesses, by the way. This is from Florida Today:\n\n       Some part-time Brevard County workers are getting their \n     hours cut so the county would not be forced by federal law to \n     pay for their health insurance. . . . Brevard County Library \n     Service Director Jeff Thompson said 37 of his department's \n     employees have had their hours cut as a result of the health \n     care issue.\n\n  So the library services department--this is the middle class, and \nthey are going to lose hours.\n  I don't care if you are a Republican, a Democrat, an Independent, \nwhom you voted for in the last election, this is a disaster for all of \nus. And rather than digging in and saying, I am going to fight to the \ndeath on this law because it has my name on it, because it was my \nsignature achievement in my first term, I wish the President and White \nHouse were more open-minded about saying this is not working out the \nway we thought. This is going to hurt way too many people at a time \nwhen people are already hurting. Let's put the brakes on this or let's \nredo this. Let's get rid of this and start over.\n  But they don't seem to be focused on that. They claim to be focused \non the middle class. Yet we know millions of middle-class Americans--\nand a few hundred whom I know now personally in Florida--are going to \nbe dramatically hurt by this law. Yet it is full speed ahead. That is \noutrageous.\n  I think we have one last chance to stop this if the White House won't \ncooperate, and that is through our budgeting process. In September we \nare probably going to have to pass a short-term budget to move forward \ninto the next year. A lot of my colleagues love to say they are against \nObamaCare, but if you vote for a budget that pays for ObamaCare, that \npays for these things I have just described, you have voted for \nObamaCare.\n  Some will say: That is crazy. You are going to shut down the \ngovernment over ObamaCare.\n  No. What is crazy is moving forward with this after all the problems. \nThis is just the tip of the iceberg. I could be here 6 hours describing \nall the problems with ObamaCare. Moving forward on that is what is \ncrazy. What is crazy is arguing that the only way we can move forward \nwith a budget is if it includes ObamaCare. What is crazy is shutting \ndown the government because the budget doesn't pay to implement this \noutrageous and broken system.\n  We need to wake up and realize what is happening. This is hurting the \nAmerican middle class, and if we lose the American middle class, we \nlose what makes our economy different and special and unique.\n  So, Mr. President, as you travel around the country this week, as you \ncome to Jacksonville, FL, on Thursday, I hope you will also explain to \nthe American people how it is that you can justify cutting hours, \ncutting benefits, taking away existing health insurance and existing \ndoctor-patient relationships from millions of working-class and middle-\nclass Americans who are going to be hurt by this law because of your \nrefusal and the refusal of many of your allies to consider suspending \nthis or permanently repealing it and replacing it with something \nbetter.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Student Loans\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, as you well know, since you worked awfully \nhard and very effectively with respect to the issue of student loans, \nwe are about to rush into a complete restructuring of the way we price \nstudent loans. I believe this is not the appropriate approach. I think \nthere are some fundamental issues with the student lending program that \nrequire a comprehensive approach. I have tried, along with many of my \ncolleagues, to at least extend the 3.4 percent for a year so we can do \nthis systematically and thoughtfully, do it in terms of not just \ninterest rate structures but in terms of incentives to keep college \ncosts down and also to deal with the increasingly difficult issue of \nthe existing loan burdens that students have so they can refinance--not \njust in the future but families of students struggling today with a \nhuge amount of student debt.\n  Student debt has exceeded $1 trillion. It has surpassed credit card \ndebt as the second largest household debt that we hold in the United \nStates. In this context, I think we have to go forward and look at this \ncomprehensively.\n  The bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act is a product of great \neffort and very sincere effort to try to deal with this problem. But I \ndo not think it will lead to a long-term stable solution that will \nbenefit students. What I think it will do is shift the costs of these \nprograms increasingly to students. This is not the way it used to be.\n  The idea that government would generate revenue from student loan \nprograms is a fairly recent one. From the first loan programs we \nestablished in the 1950s, the programs were designed as investments, \nsomething we paid for and we benefited from through increased \nproductivity, through increased education of our citizens, and \nincreased ability to compete worldwide. It was not designed to generate \nprofits. It was not designed to break even. It was designed to invest \nin the future of the country through its young men and women.\n  We invested in education because we understood educational \nopportunity was directly connected to our prosperity and our security. \nIndeed, it was the engine that was going to pull individuals up the \nranks into the middle class and beyond, and it was going to pull the \ncountry forward with increasing prosperity and increasing national \nbenefit.\n  In response to Sputnik back in the 1950s we created the national \ndefense student loan, what we now know as the Perkins loan, to expand \nthe number of college graduates, especially in the fields of math, \nscience, education, and engineering. Those are the very fields today \nwhere we see we need more people--math, science, engineering, and \neducation. Today we call it STEM, a fancy term. Back then it was just \nmath, science, engineering, and education. These were low-cost loans \nwith very generous benefits.\n  For instance, no interest accrued on the loans while students were in \nschool, and teachers could get these loans forgiven.\n\n[[Page S5826]]\n\n  In the Higher Education Act of 1965, one of the principal architects \nwas Senator Claiborne Pell, my predecessor. In that act, grants, work-\nstudy, and low-cost loans were the three pillars of student financial \naid. We gave money to the students without requiring repayments with \ngrants. We had very low cost loans relative to prevailing rates in the \ncountry, and then we had a work-study program. Providing more \neducational opportunity then was seen as a necessity, not a luxury, not \nsomething that would be nice to do. And we have all benefited from it.\n  The productivity of this country today is a direct result of those \ninvestments that were made in the 1950s and 1960s. In fact, I suggest, \nwith very rare exceptions, every person in this body benefited. I know \nI did.\n  After West Point, which was funded by the government but required at \nleast 5 years of service afterwards, I went to law school. I had to get \na loan to help me get through, and I did. In fact, I would also daresay \nthere is nobody in this Chamber today, with very few exceptions, who \nwas without the access to and benefits of very generous student lending \nthat persisted, that was part, that was a fixture of the 1950s, 1960s, \n1970s, 1980s.\n  This notion that we need to educate our young people is even more \ncompelling today than it was in the 1960s and the 1970s.\n  This is a chart, ``Jobs Requiring at Least Some College Education by \n2018.''\n  In 1973, less than 30 percent of jobs required a college education. \nYou could leave high school--if you had good work habits and good \nskills--and you could manage to make a living, buy a home, rise up \nthrough the ranks of managing production on the floor, and get into \nmanagement if you were talented, ambitious, et cetera.\n  Now, you see, by 2018 you are looking at over 60 percent of the jobs, \nnearly two-thirds, that will require some college. Here we were heavily \nsubsidizing college education. Now we are proposing to say: No, \nstudents have to absorb the costs. Families have to absorb the cost. \nThis cannot be a cost to the government in terms of our budget. That \nlogic just doesn't seem compelling to me at all.\n  We also know not only is college becoming more important in the sense \nof the jobs that need to be filled, but here is the other reality.\n\n  This is the lifetime earnings. You can see there is a huge increase \nin lifetime earnings with education. As we make it more difficult to go \nto higher education, we are basically telling people they are not going \nto earn as much as they could. When we are wondering today about why \nthere is so much inequality in this country, why wages are not going \nup, it comes back in large part to the fact that we need higher skilled \nworkers, better educated citizens.\n  As we impose more costs on students and families to go and get this \nmaster's degree or professional degree or doctorate degree or \nbachelor's degree, the market will tell us the higher the cost, the \nfewer people will do it. We are essentially telling those people they \nare locked in wherever they are. They are not going to be the ones who \nmove from that humble abode to the middle-class home and beyond.\n  That, I think, frankly, is one of the most disturbing aspects that \npeople are facing all across this country, the realization and the fear \nthat their children will not do better than they did. Our parents, all \nof them, I think, could say with great confidence: I am working hard, I \nam struggling, but I know my children will do better.\n  One of the reasons our constituents across this country are saying we \nare not getting it right is this growing perception and feeling that, \nno, their children will not do better. By the way, this vote speaks \nvolumes about our commitment to making sure the next generation of \nAmericans does better.\n  Just look at the numbers. This is how you get well compensated in the \nUnited States. Our country is based upon the notion that education is \nthe engine that will pull you forward. That is the way we are going to \ndeal with this notion of inequality of income. That is the American \nsolution. Again, I think as we depart from this tradition we are going \nto find ourselves in an increasingly difficult situation.\n  We are essentially asking in the proposal that is before us for low- \nand middle-income students to assume more of the cost of higher \neducation--and their parents. Some can, but they will have less to \ninvest in other things. Some cannot, and they will miss this train, \nliterally.\n  Even though in constant dollars the maximum Pell grant--we are still \nproviding grants--is nearly where it was in terms of the 1970s, it is \npaying for a much lower percentage of the cost of higher education. I \nthink that is an important point to note.\n  This is not just about the level of Federal support. That is why I \nhave urged us to stop and look at a comprehensive approach. What is \nhappening--these are the Pell grants indicating how they went up \ndramatically in the 1970s and then tapered off and then finally, based \nupon President Obama's initiative, I believe, in 2009, they went up \nagain based upon our changing from bank-based lending to a direct \nlending program. We shifted resources to the Pell grants. The Pell \ngrants have been going up.\n  What has also been going up is tuition. So when we are talking about \nthe road to opportunity, when we are talking about dealing with this \nprogram comprehensively, just simply restructuring rates is not going \nto get it because this is what we are looking at: average tuition and \nfees at public and private universities. The green line is the 4-year \nprivate. That is shooting up out of sight. But we also know, and this \nmight be anecdotal, those are the schools, the elite schools, if you \nwill, that in many cases provide even an express road to opportunity \nfor so many people. That is why they are so competitive to get into. \nThose costs are rocketing out of sight.\n  But just the 4-year public colleges, which used to be the backbone of \nour whole country where with a modest fee you could get a great \neducation, they are going up. We know from testimony that has been \nrecorded here, a lot of it is because, as we are pulling back from \nsupporting students and their families, guess what, States are doing \nthe same thing.\n  We had years and years of reduced budgets to our university system \nwhich have been reversed in only the last few years by the present \nGovernor. We are pulling back. What happens as a result of that? \nTuition goes up.\n  When we look back to the mid-1970s, if a student got a Pell grant, \nthat student could cover most of the cost of a 4-year education at a \nState school. Students cannot do that now. What does that mean? They \nhave to borrow. Students have to borrow if they are in a situation \nwhere they are relatively low income, very low income, or of modest \nmeans.\n  The consequence of this has resulted in an explosion of borrowing. \nThis is the total FFEL--that is the old name for the lending program--\nand DL, the direct lending program that is used today for Stafford \nloans. These are the loan amounts from 1966. At the bottom here, it is \nvery small. It is off the chart. Through the 1970s, it was rather \nconstant. It started to spike up here.\n  Here is the curve. There is a little bit of a downward spike here, \nbut that might be because people are dropping out. They cannot afford \nto borrow. I am hearing stories--and my colleagues are hearing \nstories--of people leaving school. They are saying: What is in it for \nme? I can't afford to graduate from college with a $25,000 or $50,000 \ndebt and then get a job--or maybe not get a job--that is paying $35,000 \na year. I will never get out of that hole.\n  There has been an extraordinary explosion of lending. As lending has \ngrown, there is more of a need to take steps to curtail the lending or \nto help students deal with this lending. There is over $1 trillion in \noutstanding Federal student loan debt that young people are going to \nhave to somehow amortize and pay off through their lifetime.\n  We have already had studies from the Federal Reserve and leading \nauthorities who say this will delay home acquisition and all the things \nwe thought would happen almost automatically or routinely in this \ncountry. A student goes to college, graduates, and then by their late \ntwenties they have done enough in their job to buy a home, start a \nfamily, and become a pillar of the middle class. That hope and dream is \nreceding.\n  There is another aspect of this that gets into the whole accounting \nissue\n\n[[Page S5827]]\n\nwe have to deal with. CBO looked at these issues and scored them. They \nindicated that between 2013 and 2023--and that is over the next 10 \nyears--we will generate about $184 billion worth of profit for the \nFederal Government. It is the difference between what the students are \npaying us back and what we are using to borrow. It is essentially the \ndifference between our costs and their repayment to us. This is a \nremarkable shift from investing in students throughout all of these \ndecades--post-World War II--to now essentially being able to generate \nincome from students.\n  Since 2007, we have been seeing a positive return to the Federal \nGovernment on student loans--even from loans made under the old bank-\nbased system--because of the way the interest rates have run, because \nof our borrowing costs, and because of the costs students have to pay.\n  Given the fact we are able to generate $184 billion over 10 years, I \nthink we should be able to find our way through to a 3.4-percent rate \nfor at least another year, but that has proven elusive in terms of the \nvotes on the floor.\n  I think all of this strongly suggests we have a major challenge to \nreconfigure our student lending system, our grant system, and our work-\nstudy system. We have a major challenge in lowering the cost of a \ncollege education. Rather than taking off like a rocket, the costs \nshould be coming down. We cannot do that in a matter of 2 or 3 days. It \nis going to take some comprehensive and coherent work over many weeks \nand months.\n  The problem we face in terms of looking forward and making changes is \nwe have locked the interest rate at 6.8 percent under our budget rules. \nAs a result, everything we do has to rotate around 6.8 percent.\n  The proposals by my colleagues would lower interest rates in the \nfirst few years. However, in order to make up for the 6.8-percent \nassumption in the budget, it would have to raise interest rates in the \nout-years. For the first several years we are going to provide an \nincreasingly expensive but starting relatively inexpensive--approach to \nstudent borrowing. But that has to be made up arithmetically by a \nhigher cost for those succeeding generations.\n  For example, if you are a senior in high school today, you will do \nreasonably well--not as well as 3.4 percent, but reasonably well. If \nyou have a younger sibling who is in eighth or ninth grade, he or she \nwill pay for you because those rates--just to make up the gap--will be \nmuch higher. We know it will be higher.\n  I must commend the authors of the legislation who have at least put \nin a cap for the various lending programs. Originally, as this proposal \nmade its way through the Senate, there were no caps, so rates could \nhave soared to astronomical heights. Still, even with the caps, over \nthe long term the succeeding generations of students--and this is a \nlong-term proposal and not a proposal that has a finite period of \ntime--will have rates that will go up and up and up.\n  The key aspect that is driving all of this is the assumption that we \nshould not be investing in higher education, as we have for decades, \nand that we have to have a budget-neutral solution. Rather than saying \nwe can go ahead and do things, such as close tax loopholes, let's move \nthat money into higher education, which I would argue would be \nbeneficial for everyone in the short and long run.\n  We have been locked into this budget-neutral approach, and there is a \n$715 million surplus, but it is as close to zero, as far as budget \nneutrality, as they could get.\n  I go back to the point of revenue neutral, which means that given the \npresent law of a fixed rate of 6.8 percent for undergraduate loans, 7.9 \npercent for other loans, we are going to enjoy it now and pay later. \nThat is the essence of the proposal before us. Students could pay much \nmore later.\n  I also think the idea that we are going to fix this 2 years or 3 \nyears hence is not reasonable because the cost of fixing it goes up \nwith each year. If our principle and our presumption is that it always \nhas to be revenue neutral, there might be some good ideas about fixing \nit, but where is the money? That is what is going to have to be \nincluded to fix it.\n  I think we can do better. I will be offering an amendment with \nSenator Warren which will cap this proposal at 6.8 percent for student \nloans and 7.9 percent for the PLUS family loan--the parent loan--that \nwill be comparable to what the fixed loan rates are today. This way we \ncan at least tell all of our constituents: No student will be worse \noff--not just over 3 or 4 years--over the next 10 to 20 years, or \nhowever long this legislation endures. I think that is something that \nwould be a useful improvement.\n  We are paying for it by a surcharge for people who are making over $1 \nmillion. It is a very small surcharge. We should be able to say: We can \nfind the resources to invest in the future of the country and to \nsupport and subsidize students so they can improve their skills, move \ninto the middle class, and move the country forward. We have always \ndone it. We can do it today.\n  I urge my colleagues to favorably consider the amendment when it is \nproposed.\n  Again, there have been extraordinary efforts on the part of many--\nprincipled and thoughtful--to try to deal with this issue. I go back to \nmy initial point: If we want to deal with it, we have to have time, \nand, frankly, we have to have resources. The way this is evolving, we \ndon't have time and we are unwilling, it appears at this juncture, to \ncommit significant resources to solve this problem in a comprehensive \nand coherent way that will benefit students and families and in the \nlong run will benefit this country.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Madam President, we are talking about student loans. The \nthing I have found out working this in the amount of time we have been \nworking it is we are all in the same position. We all want to help our \nstudents attain higher education, to be productive citizens, to live a \nbetter quality of life. We all know that is the most important thing we \ncan do, and we are trying the best we possibly can to come up with a \nsolution.\n  We have what we call a bipartisan bill that we have all worked on. We \nhave everyone's input. I respect everyone's position, and we are going \nto come to a comprehensive bill. I think under Senator Harkin from Iowa \nwe will have a comprehensive bill that looks at why the costs are so \nhigh and why college is so unattainable for so many families today. We \nhave to tackle that problem.\n  The problem before us now is this problem: How do we help the most? \nWhat we have before us is 6.8 percent if we do nothing, 6.8 percent \nacross. I know some people have said it is better if the 6.8 stays as \nit is. I disagree.\n  We have been working on this. Here is the difference. The 6.8 percent \nthat is basically the cap right now--the old cap we had was 3.4 percent \njust for the subsidized. If we look at the portion of people who are \nsubsidized, it is less than 1 million. If we look at the unsubsidized, \nit is less than 1 million. If we look at basically the subsidized and \nunsubsidized, that is more than 6.5 million. Our bill basically reduces \nthat 6.8 rate down to 3.86 for this coming year. Rather than leaving it \nat 6.85, we have helped this many people who are basically needing this \nmoney in order to go to school. If we left it as it is, they would be \npaying the 6.8. If we only kept the 3.4, the subsidized loan, this is \nthe amount of people we would be helping.\n  So we come as a bipartisan group saying: How can we help the most? I \nthink most of us agree with that. As we look further down these charts, \nwe have also asked: Under current law, how much would the average \ndependent undergraduate repay? Under the bipartisan bill, we can see \n2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, which we have scored out, it would be about at \n3.86, 4.62, 5.4, and 6.2. At 6.8 across the board, if it would stay, \nthere is a difference of savings of over $2,000. That we know.\n  The other argument that has been used and the point that has been \nmade is rates might go up. Yes, rates might go up. If they do go up, \nhow much would you pay? This is worst case scenario. The bipartisan \nbill, over the 10-year period, and current law if it stayed fixed over \n10 years, it is a very small possibility it would go up, and that would \nbe a $505 difference. The bottom line is we know this is a fact. This \nhas been scored and that is where these rates are going to stay. They \nthink that might be the worst-case scenario.\n\n  Let me show the difference of what has happened. CBO has not had the \ngreatest track record with scoring. In 2003, we were a little over 4 \npercent. They projected interest rates for 10 years out. If we look at \nwhat they are projecting out for 10 years, it has about the same path \nas far as what actually happened under the rates. There is a big spread \nof money that would have been spent based on fixing the rate, let's say \nback in 2003, versus what was actually occurring. We are hoping we are \nable to continue that savings.\n  We understand that what we are dealing with is an awful lot of help \nand safeguards that are built in for young students. The best safeguard \nwe have built in is the IBR, income-based repayment. The IBR Program \nallows the student who has graduated with an exorbitant amount of \ndebt--and finds a job that basically doesn't give them the type of \nmoney they would like--a cap on how much of their disposable income can \nbe paid toward the loan. The cap is at 15 percent now, I believe, and \nis going to go to 10 percent. It is also based on the amount of years. \nAfter 20 years, they are done paying. If their income did not increase \nappreciably, they are only going to pay the loan back based on their \nincome of 10 percent--10 percent of their disposable income. We think \nthat is a tremendous savings.\n  Most students who qualify for the subsidized loan get the Pell grant. \nThey don't have to pay that back. As far as the subsidized loans, \nbasically the taxpayers have invested in the students who qualify for \nthose for the first 4 years of college, and that interest is not \naccrued. The interest does not accrue until they leave. Those are the \nthings that have been built in that we think give the protections we \nwant.\n  If we do nothing, we save the students about $8 billion over 2013 \ncompared to $31 billion if we do something. If we are able to help this \nmany students, that is equivalent to a $23 billion difference in \nsavings, and that has been scored.\n  I know we have talked about the accounting procedure. I know the \nPresiding Officer has worked very hard on this and understands it very \nwell. I agree with you--if we could take every\n\n[[Page S5829]]\n\npenny of profit out and make sure the students were getting the \nabsolute lowest rate. I also know that basically market-driven rates--\nif we are going to go to market, which we are in this piece of \nlegislation--and we look at the risk factors, defaults, and all that \ngoes into that and score that normally under a market-risk value or \nmarket value, it would be different. They have shown that market value \nwould be $95 billion we will be losing and that the taxpayers would be \nsubsidizing. The way we are doing it now shows a profit of $184 \nbillion.\n  I am willing to work with the Presiding Officer to clear this up and \nget something more accurate of how we score and how we charge students. \nThat is not what we have in front of us, and I think that is the \ndifference. We are trying to move forward to get some certainty.\n  We have a lot of students in West Virginia who are deciding whether \nthey can go to college and, if they can, where do they go and what can \nthey afford. This gives them the certainty I think they have been \nlooking for and hopefully the certainty they definitely need. There are \nmore than 8\\1/2\\ million undergraduate students who take advantage of \nthe Stafford Loan Program every year and over 6.5 million of these \nstudents take both the subsidized and unsubsidized loans and that is a \nbig change.\n  Our colleagues on the other side, as we have been negotiating this, \nwe talked to them about how we didn't want any profits whatsoever, and \nthey agreed. The first bill that came from the House had $16 billion on \ntop of what the base was at $184 billion. That has been taken out the \nbest we possibly could to $700 million.\n  When you think about how we are going to run a deficit this year of \n$740 billion just in our annual budgeting here in Washington--and we \nare talking about $714 billion over a 10-year period with over $1 \ntrillion. They said that is as close as they were able to come. Even if \nthere is any of that, we are looking at--with this amendment Senator \nHarkin was able to put in--how we are able to see if that can be \nfunneled back in and reduce the loans even further.\n  I think we are doing everything we possibly can. There is going to be \nabout $1.4 trillion in loans offered over the next decade. We pretty \nmuch know that. There is $140 billion of loans every year. As a matter \nof fact, student loans are now the second largest indebtedness we are \ncarrying. It is the largest burden we are carrying next to a mortgage. \nIt just surpassed credit cards. It is unbelievable. We have to get a \nhandle on the cost of college.\n  Current students and graduates are holding at $1.1 trillion in loans. \nThe loans represent investments and will pay dividends in the form of \nhigher earnings. The best investment a youth is going to make is an \neducation, but if it becomes unobtainable, inaccessible, and \nunaffordable, it does them no good. We know that, and that is the \nbalance we are trying to find.\n  The average student loan debt--every one of these young students, \nwhen they get done with college--for those who graduated in 2011 is \nabout $26,000 that everyone is leaving college with, on average, for a \ndebt. There is only a small percentage of borrowers who have small loan \nbalances, but 11 percent, or roughly 4 million people, owe $50,000 or \nmore. It is truly unbelievable.\n  I have heard everyone here give their reasoning for this, such as not \nhaving had good consultation, good advice or good fiscal planning, and \nthat may be true. We can do much better to make sure the students are \nnot taking loans that they can do without or maybe not take too much \nout.\n  I appreciate the hard work and good faith that all of our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle have been showing to reach this compromise. \nI know it is not easy for many, and I know everybody is going to have, \nhopefully, their say and their vote on an amendment or two if they wish \nto.\n  At the end of the day, I believe we can walk away knowing we did \nbetter today than doing nothing at all. I believe that. I believe I, \nthe Presiding Officer, and all of our other colleagues are going to \ncome back and work hard whether it is the remainder of this year or \nnext year. Basically, we are going to get a program so that these young \npeople can find college attainable again and affordable. That is what \nwe have all been working on.\n\n  The plan helps everyone and not just some. It lowers rates 100 \npercent for all students. So everything we have in our compromised bill \nbrings down those rates. It provides a long-term fix. We don't have to \nkick the can down the road. We know it is there. If we can find \nsomething better between now and 4 years, 3 years, 2 years or even \nbefore this year is up, then we are willing to go back and entertain \nthat. We don't want to see loans that were supposed to help students \nmove forward end up moving them back.\n  I know what debt does; it will smother. My grandfather used to say: \nIndebtedness will make a coward out of you in the decisions you make \nwhen you are carrying so much debt. You will be robbing Peter to pay \nPaul just to survive.\n  We have found ourselves with the sequester, and with everything else \ngoing on, we ask how we are going to make it. When you find yourself \nagainst a proverbial rock, if you will, you will do things you would \nnever do normally.\n  We are trying to find a way to move forward. It shows our students \nthat the country believes in them and that we support their efforts to \nadvance their education and reach for the American dream.\n  When we, as Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, work together \nand have a real debate on a real problem--and this has been debated--we \ncan come up with commonsense solutions that truly benefit all \nAmericans. I believe we have done that. It is refreshing for such an \nimportant issue we have. We have put politics aside in the first and \nforemost thing we want to do--help the students. It doesn't matter \nwhether we are talking about a Republican, Democrat or Independent, \neverybody had the same purpose. I thought it was refreshing to see \nthat. We want to lower the rates for everybody. We want to help \neverybody, give them some certainty and make it affordable. I look \nforward to working in this more bipartisan atmosphere we have right now \non many more subjects. I know we can when we put our country first. The \nright thing to do is to put our country first.\n  We might be a ``D'' as a Democrat or we might be an ``R'' as a \nRepublican, but we are always an ``A'' first, which is an American.\n  With that, I think the students have been served. I think we will be \nable to give them consistency. This piece of legislation has been \nworked on hard. There has been a lot of input, and Senator Harkin did a \nyeoman's job on bringing some of the most important factors we had to \nthe forefront and into the bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, while my colleague from West \nVirginia is here, I wish to thank him for his leadership on this issue \nand for the very hard work he and other colleagues have devoted to this \nprofoundly difficult, challenging but important issue.\n  I rise with regret to oppose the compromise agreement that has been \nreached with the help of our colleagues from Illinois and Maine and \nacross the aisle. It is a compromise, and compromises are to be sought \nin this day and it is bipartisan and that, too, is an objective. It is \na bipartisan compromise, but the fact is, it is a bad deal.\n  We can do better. We must do better. This Nation can do better. We \nhave a moral and historic obligation to do better for the students of \ntoday and their brothers and sisters who will be following them over \nthe next 10 years.\n  This deal offers the illusion of lower rates in the short term while \ndelivering higher rates, in some cases, in as little as 2 years from \nnow. It forces students back into a system of market-based loans that \nhave failed in the past and will fail in the future. It subjects \nstudents to economic uncertainties which are wholly unrelated to the \nactual cost of higher education.\n  We know we need to reduce the cost of tuition and higher education. \nWe know we need to address the overhanging $1 trillion-plus of debt \nthat exists from past loans. This deal exacerbates the problem instead \nof easing the problem.\n  Yes, it has caps on the interest rates students may pay, but they \ncreep to\n\n[[Page S5830]]\n\nmore than double where student loan rates were at the beginning of this \nmonth. It has a low rate, but it is, in effect, a teaser rate. As the \nPresiding Officer said so well, it is a teaser rate that has nowhere to \ngo but up. It lowers the deficit, yes, but it does so by having the \nFederal Government reach into the pockets of students and take billions \nmore on top of the $51 billion already extracted in this fiscal year \nfrom them and from their hard-working parents.\n  At the heart of this bill is a mistaken premise. It is the premise \nthat it is OK to profit off the backs of students and that it is all \nright to regard students as a revenue source or a profit center. That \npremise reverses a historic promise, which is: We will invest in \nstudents, not profit from them. We will support their efforts to gain \nhigher education so they can better themselves and better the country \nwith the skills and education they acquired. We are not supposed to \nhamper or handicap them and exact from them a crushing burden of debt \nin the future. That premise reverses a historic promise, and we cannot \nallow it to go forward without a fight.\n  Every dollar we extract from those students is a dollar they can't \nspend on a down payment for a house, a car, a business or an \ninvestment. These young people are the economic drivers of our future. \nLet's be purely selfish about it. How can they build a family, buy a \nhome, start a business if they are hit with an 8-percent interest rate \nor higher at a time when we can make it more affordable? It makes no \nsense.\n\n  I have spoken to students across the State of Connecticut over these \npast weeks, and they have done the math. They know the results. As many \nas 86,000 students who attend our colleges and universities--and I have \nspoken to many of them, their families, the staff and teachers who are \nalso doing this math--and they know the best way to reduce our deficit \nis not to profit from students but to make possible their higher \neducation so they can bring their innovation and experience and \nexpertise to the marketplace, and not make the marketplace dictate the \nvariable rates they are charged, but enable them to contribute to the \nmarketplace and the American dream by going to college.\n  IS understand the temptation of this deal, but we must reject a \ncompromise that saves the American dream for one sibling in a family by \ntaking away from another. My colleague from Rhode Island made this \npoint very eloquently earlier today. If a person is a student in high \nschool right now, they will do pretty well under this bill when they \nbegin college next year, but not their younger brother and sister. The \nsister will be paying for the current student. The brother will be \npaying more and, in fact, may be denied the opportunity the present \nstudent has next year because the parents cannot afford to send him to \ncollege.\n  The issue of loan rates is complicated, but the math is pretty \nsimple. There is already more than $1 trillion of crushing loan debt \nthat this bill is not refinancing. The bill provides no debt \nforgiveness, just market rates that will lead to higher payments and \nmore student debt as we zoom past that $1 trillion mark and raise it \neven further. The irony here is that the majority of this body has \nalready voted to return to 3.4 percent. This compromise betrays the \nmajority will of the Senate. Instead, it allows rates to rise as high \nas 8.25 percent, graduate Stafford rates as high as 9.5 percent, and \nPLUS rates as high as 10.5 percent. So we are saying to parents of two \nchildren: You can send one to college now with a loan that you take out \nat current rates, but to pay for that second child, you are going to be \nseeing rates more than twice as high.\n  Do my colleagues think the income of the average middle-class \nAmerican family is going up 10.5 percent? Ask the American people. Do \nas I have done. Go around to the States and ask the students and the \nparents.\n  Let's not kid ourselves. The fact is they are not going to be able to \npay. This compromise relies on a presumption that somehow, over the \nnext 2 years, we are going to come back and revisit, revise, reshape, \nand avert disaster. I have only been here 2\\1/2\\ years, but what I have \nseen is it is better to know what the result is going to be than engage \nin potential false hope and raise the potential false expectation that \nsomehow everything will be solved next year or the year after, before \ndisaster strikes. We should learn something from our experience with \nsequestration.\n  This bill is not based on analysis of what the rate needs to be to \ncover the program's cost. In fact, it requests the GAO to examine and \nreport on what that should be. So I implore my colleagues, instead of \nvoting first and getting the facts later, that we reserve such a life-\nchanging decision until the GAO has advised us on the cost of student \nloans and we use that necessary information to set the rates going \nforward.\n  There are amendments that I believe will improve this bill, and I \nhave cosponsored them, including an amendment Senator Reed and the \nPresiding Officer, Senator Warren, have offered that would lower the \ninterest rate caps in this bill to the current statutory rate. If this \namendment is adopted, we can go back to the people of our States and \nsay: At worst, you will be no worse off than under current law. We \ncannot say as much under this compromise bill.\n  I have also cosponsored the Sanders amendment which would sunset this \nlegislation after 2 years. If interest rates rise the way they are \nprojected to do, we could be looking at dramatically higher rates \nwithin 3 years. So this sunset clause will force us to come back and \nrevisit them.\n  I have also filed my own amendment that would expand and make more \ngenerous loan repayment assistance programs for borrowers who are \nstruggling right now to make payments under existing law. At a time \nwhen outstanding student debt is $1.2 trillion, we need to make sure we \nhelp and support distressed borrowers at every stage of repayment, and \nthat is the unaddressed need this body needs to confront.\n  I am hopeful these amendments will be adopted. In the meantime, I \nmust respectfully and regretfully oppose this compromise. We are the \ngreatest Nation in the history of the world, as we are fond of saying \nrepeatedly on the floor of this body. But only one thing is certain \nabout the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act, and that is rates will \ninexorably, inevitably, inexcusably go up. They will exceed current \nrates. We must stand and fight to prevent that kind of betrayal of the \nfundamental American promise of higher education and the American \ndream.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/23/senate-section/article/S5830-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5830-S5831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BANK HOLDING COMPANIES\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, most of my colleagues might look at these \npictures and think they depict facilities owned by ExxonMobil or BP, \nbut this is, amazingly enough, a picture of Morgan Stanley. Morgan \nStanley, to most Americans and most people in this Chamber, if they \nknow of it, is a bank. Morgan Stanley used to be an investment bank and \nnow it is just considered a bank. Let me explain.\n  Morgan Stanley owns a company called TransMontaigne, a petroleum and \nchemical transportation and storage company, and Heidmar Inc., which \nreportedly manages more than 100 oil tankers--tankers that look like \nthis.\n  Today I held a banking subcommittee hearing, which the Presiding \nOfficer attended, as did Senator Merkley and Senator Toomey, to examine \nhow the line between banks and commercial enterprises is blurring. \nIncreasingly, these large institutions combine banks and trading firms \nand energy suppliers and oil refiners and warehouses, as well as \nshipping firms and oil tankers and mining companies.\n  Federally insured bank holding companies, once in the business of \nproviding checking and savings accounts to workers or loans to small \nbusinesses, are now also in the business of owning physical \ncommodities, including aluminum, oil, and electricity. Witnesses \ntestified at the subcommittee hearing that these risky Wall Street \npractices are artificially inflating prices for manufacturers and \nconsumers. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs take \ntheir cut when we fill up our tanks, take their cut when we buy a Coke \nor buy a beer in an aluminum can. They take their cut increasingly in \nthe copper\n\n[[Page S5831]]\n\nmarket, a metal that is in all kinds of industrial products.\n  A recent article in the New York Times said:\n\n       The maneuvering in markets for oil, wheat, cotton, coffee \n     and more have brought billions in profits to investment banks \n     like Goldman, JPMorgan Chase Morgan Stanley, while forcing \n     customers to pay more every time they fill up a gas tank, \n     flick on a light switch, open a beer or buy a cell phone.\n\n  For years, our Nation separated banking from traditional commerce. \nBut about 13, 14 years ago, after years of eroding that protection, \nCongress finally tore down what was left of that wall. Beyond just \ncombining commercial banking with insurance and investment banking, \nbanks are now allowed to trade in commodities and to engage in a \nvariety of nonfinancial activities. Four years later, after that 1999 \nrepeal, the Federal Reserve enabled the first financial holding company \nto trade in physical commodities.\n  The justification for this is a familiar one: Other companies were \ndoing it, they told us, and banks were at a competitive disadvantage. \nOver the next 6 years, the rules unraveled, becoming looser and looser, \nuntil the loopholes were big enough for these six megabanks--now $600 \nbillion in assets, up to $2.3 trillion in assets--the loopholes are big \nenough for these six megabanks to jump through.\n  The expansion of our financial system in traditional areas of \ncommerce--from crude oil to natural gas to mining and shipping--hasn't \nhappened in a vacuum. It has been accompanied by a host of \nanticompetitive activities. These activities threaten consumers. They \nthreaten American businesses that rely upon efficient markets and \narm's-length transactions. They especially threaten American \nmanufacturing when they buy and sell and manage and transport and store \nmetals.\n  From speculation in the oil and gas markets to inflated prices for \naluminum to energy manipulation--we know the role of banks has \nexpanded. Banks have expanded far beyond their traditional roles.\n  There has been little public awareness of or debate about the massive \nexpansion of our largest financial institutions into new areas of the \neconomy. That is, in part, because regulators have been less than \ntransparent about basic facts. We can't get the information from the \nFederal Reserve. Whether a person is a citizen or a reporter or a \nSenator sitting on the Banking Committee, we can't get from the Federal \nReserve the information we need to know about the governance and these \nrules about commodity trading by the banks. It is also because these \ninstitutions are so complex and so dense and so opaque and so \nimpossible for people to understand that we simply can't figure out \nwhat we need to figure out.\n  The six largest U.S. bank holding companies have 14,000 subsidiaries. \nThe six largest U.S. bank holding companies have 14,000 subsidiaries. \nFewer than 20 of those 14,000 are the end of our traditional banks.\n  There are three important issues here that concern me--that Morgan \nStanley can own refineries and can own the ships. Three important \nissues concern me, whether it is Morgan Stanley, whether it is Goldman \nSachs, or whether it is JPMorgan Chase, for aluminum, copper, \nelectricity, or oil.\n  The lessons of this hearing were three. No. 1, these institutions can \ncontrol physical goods and financial contracts based upon those goods, \nmeaning they know more about the trading of these goods because they \nstore the aluminum in two dozen warehouses in Detroit or because they \nare moving the oil in these tankers. They know more about transactions, \nthey know more about price, they know more about movement of goods, so \nthat means they can trade on inside information and it gives them an \nadvantage in proprietary trading. It means they can manipulate markets.\n  No. 2, these institutions--these banks that own the oil tankers and \nown the refineries--have access to cheap funding--cheaper funding from \nthe Federal Reserve--that means us, as taxpayers--that they can use to \nfinance their commodities activities. I will say that again. Because \nthey can go to the window, they can get cheaper financing. These banks \ncan get cheaper financing.\n  They say there is a wall between their traditional bank activities \nand what they are doing while owning these commodities and buying and \nselling and transporting and storing and gaming the markets, but they \ncan get money cheaper from taxpayers. They can borrow money at a less \nexpensive rate than anybody else, they and their competitors who also \nmight own oil tankers or refineries.\n  No. 3, they are exposing themselves and us--the economy--to risks \nthat can threaten our financial system. Just imagine the economic, the \nenvironmental, and the reputational impact to a megabank of an Exxon \nValdez or a BP oilspill. Think of the economic impact that could have \non the stability of the bank and the success of the bank and, \ntherefore, the stability of the whole financial system.\n  Today was the first of what I expect to be several hearings on this \nissue. Taxpayers have a right to know what is happening. American \ncitizens have a say in our financial system because taxpayers are the \nones who will be asked to rescue these megabanks yet again if the \nunthinkable--which almost inevitably happens in this world over time--\nif the unthinkable happens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/23/senate-section/article/S5831-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5831-S5832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, in 1935 Senator Robert Wagner of New York \nintroduced the National Labor Relations Act. Also known as the Wagner \nAct, this bill would prove to be one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation in our Nation's history. This desk at which I sit was used \nby Senator Hugo Black of Alabama, who was Franklin Roosevelt's favorite \nsouthern Senator, they said, who later became a member of the Supreme \nCourt. Senator Black sat at this desk and helped draft legislation with \nthe National Labor Relations Act. In fact, he did some of the early \nwork on what would be the Fair Labor Standards Act. What he proposed as \na 30-hour workweek later helped Senator Wagner pave the way for the \nFair Labor Standards Act.\n  Before President Roosevelt signed the National Labor Relations Act \ninto law, American workers were routinely harassed and fired for \norganizing unions. American workers were often intimidated and \nprevented from bargaining collectively. The Wagner Act changed that. \nOne year after its passage in 1936, this law gave rubber workers in \nAkron, OH, the legal tools needed to protect against poor working \nconditions and to protest the conditions under which they were working. \nThe bill authorized an independent Federal agency consisting of \nPresidential appointees confirmed by the Senate.\n  The National Labor Relations Board protects American workers. It \nprotects union members and private sector employees without a union \ncard--both--to work together to improve their wages or working \nconditions. Today, the NLRB is needed perhaps more than ever.\n  Let me tell you a story real quickly, Madam President. A few years \nago I was in Cincinnati at a dinner, and sitting at the table in front \nof me were six or seven middle-aged women--half White, half minority, \nperhaps.\n  They had just signed their first union contract with the Service \nEmployees International Union. These five or six women were the \nnegotiators on behalf of 1,200 janitors negotiating with the downtown \nCincinnati business owners. There was an empty seat at the table, so I \nwent and sat down.\n\n       I said: What does having this union mean to you?\n\n  They had just signed the contract that day.\n  One woman said: I am 51 years old. This is the first time in my life \nI have ever had a paid 1-week vacation.\n  Think about the number of Americans who do not have a paid 1-week \nvacation. For people in jobs that dress like me, for the pages sitting \nhere, most of their parents, I imagine, are used to working in a place \nwhere they get a 1- or 2- or 3-week paid vacation. Much of America does \nnot. That is just one of the things a union has brought to this \ncountry--giving people those opportunities.\n  The reason I say the NLRB is needed perhaps now more than ever is \nthat in 2013 State legislatures are curbing collective bargaining \nrights. Two years ago in Ohio, the State legislature and Governor \nKasich took away collective bargaining rights for all intents and\n\n[[Page S5832]]\n\npurposes for public-employee workers. The voters of Ohio said no to \nthat, and 61 percent of them struck that law down in a referendum. But \nnonetheless the antiunion efforts from the most pro-corporate, \nconservative, far-right State legislators in State legislatures across \nthe country continue unabated.\n  Workers are still being punished for discussing pay and bonuses with \none another.\n  For 78 years the NLRB has been instrumental in addressing the \nchallenges American workers faced. Senator Wagner explained on the \nfloor:\n\n       It is necessary to insure a wise distribution of wealth \n     between management and labor, to maintain a full flow of \n     purchasing power, and to prevent recurrent depressions.\n\n  We know that when workers make decent wages, workers buy the cars \nmade in this country, they buy the appliances, they go to the hardware \nstore, they pay their property taxes, they buy homes, they renovate \ntheir homes, they do things that put money into the economy. If you \nonly have a sliver of people who are very wealthy and a declining \nmiddle class, the purchasing power and the growth in the economy tends \nto diminish. That is not the kind of country we want, and it is not the \nkind of country we have had since World War II. But just a few years \nafter the great recession, there is a widening gap between the average \nwage of workers and heads of corporations.\n  For families struggling to make ends meet after a breadwinner was \nunfairly forced off the assembly line, the NLRB matters.\n  If we do not confirm the President's nominees, then workers, such as \nKevin from Akron, will have no recourse against retaliation for his \nunion activity. Kevin and his coworkers wanted to form a union to stop \na 12-hour shift policy from being put in place at their place of \nemployment. The company fired six workers, including Kevin, for this \nunion activity.\n  While the NLRB ordered the company to reinstate the workers--the NLRB \nsaid the company was wrong; under Federal law, the workers should be \nreinstated--the DC Circuit Court--in large part, with judges who almost \nalways do the bidding of the wealthiest corporations in this country--\nthe DC Circuit Court delayed enforcement of the case until the pending \nchallenge to the President's 2012 nominees is resolved in court or the \nboard has a Senate-confirmed quorum.\n  Kevin is a human face of why America needs a fully staffed National \nLabor Relations Board with the legal quorum needed to do its job. We \nshould confirm these board members. We should make sure workers such as \nKevin receive the workplace protections--whether they are union \nmembers, whether they are not union members--they deserve.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/23/senate-section/article/S5832-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5832-S5834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THUD APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise today to talk about legislation we \nare currently considering, and it is a welcome development that we are \nactually working on appropriations bills on the Senate floor. I want to \ncommend the work of Chairwoman Mikulski of the Appropriations \nCommittee, her ranking member Senator Shelby, as well as both Chairman \nMurray and Ranking Member Collins on the so-called THUD bill. \nEverything in Washington has an acronym. So it is with this, the \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill.\n  As many people know, when you consider those appropriations and you \nconsider the subject matter, it is pretty broad and diverse. I will \njust give maybe a five-part summation here of what we are talking \nabout. It means investing, of course, in transportation infrastructure; \nproviding housing and services to very vulnerable Americans; supporting \nour communities and addressing the foreclosure crisis, which is still \nwith us in so many ways, as the Presiding Officer knows so well and has \nworked so hard on over many years; ensuring the safety of our \ntransportation system; and then, No. 5, promoting sustainability in our \ncommunities.\n  I want to talk first about Amtrak. Amtrak is part of our \ntransportation infrastructure that not only is critically important for \na State such as Pennsylvania but really the entire eastern seaboard and \nreally across the whole country. It is one of the reasons we can move \nnot just people but goods and services with the transactions that occur \nwhen people are able to get from one place to another.\n  The Senate bill we are considering includes almost $1.5 billion for \nAmtrak, preserving the Federal commitments to provide safe, reliable, \nand energy-efficient passenger rail transportation for more than 31 \nmillion travelers--and that is an annual number--plus an additional 235 \nmillion commuter trips that depend upon Amtrak and its infrastructure \nalong the Northeast corridor.\n  Unfortunately, the House bill guts funding for Amtrak, cutting the \nappropriation by a third--$465 million below the fiscal year 2013 \nenacted level. This is the lowest level of funding in over a decade. It \nmakes no sense in a lot of ways to try to find savings in a bill like \nthis at such an extreme level. It makes no sense at all in terms of our \neconomy.\n  Due to contract and debt service payment commitments, this would mean \nAmtrak only has $100 million for capital investments. The Northeast \ncorridor alone needs $782 million per year to address longstanding \nstate of good repair projects, so not even one-seventh of the dollars \nwe need for state of good repair projects. This is not just a nice \nthing to do every year. You have to fix the infrastructure if you are \nrunning a transportation system and especially if you are running \nAmtrak.\n  So that is not only a safety issue, but it is a jobs issue. You could \nput at risk some 10,000 jobs and possibly eliminate some existing \nAmtrak routes.\n  In 2012 over 6.1 million Amtrak passengers traveled at Pennsylvania \nstations, and this number is expected to increase in 2013. Ridership \nhas continued to grow over the past several years. It reached an \nalltime high last year and is on track to break that record in 2013.\n  I was just talking to folks at Amtrak today, and they talked about \nthe tremendous growth in ridership. That is good for a lot of reasons. \nIt is not just nice for Amtrak. Most importantly, it is good for our \nenvironment, with fewer people driving cars that have an impact on air \nemissions. It is also probably a great stress-reliever for people. \nDriving and working is a challenge, getting from one place to another. \nRiding on a train can allow you to do work and maybe allow you to be \nmore rested, and it probably cuts down on traffic fatalities, although \nI do not have a study that backs that up.\n  But there is no question that we want to make sure we make these \ninvestments in Amtrak, and I hope we can ultimately get a bipartisan \nagreement and have some of the features of bipartisanship we have seen \nhere in the Senate.\n  We also know that Amtrak, just from a Pennsylvania perspective, is a \njob creator. It employs over 2,600 Pennsylvanians, and these jobs could \nbe in jeopardy if these cuts are maintained.\n  The other aspect--and I will end with this on Amtrak--are the \nsuppliers who are affected. And, of course, that is a big jobs issue as \nwell.\n  Let me move to the second part of my remarks today about this very \nimportant appropriations bill, and that has another acronym: CDBG, \ncommunity development block grants. A lot of people might know this \nacronym better than THUD--the Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment bill.\n  The Community Development Block Grant Program is so important for a \nvariety of reasons. One of the most important reasons we should focus \non it is that it is one of the few remaining Federal programs where the \nFederal Government says to local governments: Here are some resources. \nThese are taxpayer resources, so you have to safeguard them and spend \nthem wisely, but we are giving you these Federal funds so you can make \na decision about what is best for your community.\n  That is what community development block grants are all about. There \nis not a one-size-fits-all Federal-Washington-way to spend these \ndollars.\n\n[[Page S5833]]\n\nThat is why I cannot understand why some people here want to make the \nkinds of dangerous cuts to these block grants that some want to make.\n  We know the Senate bill includes a little more than $3.15 billion for \nthese block grants--less than the 2013 bill, but it is $352 million \nmore than the President asked for this year--``this year'' meaning \n2014. According to calculations by HUD, the funding level provided in \nthe Senate bill will support an estimated 80,900 jobs--twice the level \nin the House bill--80,900 jobs. That is a good reason to support the \nSenate bill. That is not the only reason standing alone, but that is a \nbig jobs number. The House bill contains the lowest amount ever \nprovided to the program.\n  I wish we could stand and say: You know what, communities across the \ncountry do not need block grants. They do not need to even decide what \nis best for the community because all of the problems are taken care \nof. Everything is wonderful. All of those communities are in perfect \nshape, so let's just have a big cut to the program.\n  That would be an interesting scenario if it were true. The reality is \nthat in a lot of communities they have had to deal with the ravages of \na foreclosure crisis where the greatest number of Americans ever \nprobably lost their homes--maybe the highest number since the 1930s, \nNo. 1. No. 2, they had to deal with the jobs crisis in addition to the \nforeclosure crisis. Of course the two are closely related. We just went \nbelow half a million people out of work in Pennsylvania, but we are \nstill at about 490,000 people out of work.\n  So these communities that have had to deal with several avalanches of \nproblems--foreclosure crisis, jobs crisis, and then all of the results \nof both of these, all of the trauma that has been heaped on these \ncommunities, now we are told by some in Washington: Your problems are \nsolved. You do not need any grant funding from the Federal Government \nto help you decide what is best for your community, whether you are \ngoing to use it for foreclosure mitigation or whether you are going to \nuse it for job creation, whether you are going to use that limited \nresource from the Federal Government to bring a company into your town.\n  You are being told that, in essence, by implication, you do not need \nthat. That is really an insult to local communities across the country.\n  We know that the block grant program began in 1975. In its first year \nit was funded at a $2.47 billion number. Why do I give that specific \nnumber from the 1970s? Well, up until now that is the lowest amount it \nhas ever received but still $837 million more than the level provided \nby the House bill. So what the House is doing here is setting records \nthey should not want to set to be in a race to see who can in a more \ndevastating fashion almost decapitate the block grant program.\n  Since the program started, the number of grantees has doubled, making \nthe impact of the cuts even greater on communities. These community \ndevelopment block grants allow 47 Pennsylvania communities to address \nlocal needs. They get to decide, not the Federal Government. They get \nthe resources, and they decide at the local level. We know that \ncountless communities have received these funds.\n  These funds have also been made available to State governments. \nMunicipalities depend on this funding for economic development \nprojects, which I mentioned before. To give you some examples of \nindividual cities, the city of Philadelphia, which has had an \nunemployment rate at 10 percent or above for as long as anyone can \nremember--we are into several years now where the unemployment rate has \nbeen 10 or higher, meaning that between 60,000 and 70,000 or more \npeople have been out of work in that city. CDBG funding in Philadelphia \nwas used to stem the foreclosure crisis, helping nearly 4,000 \nhomeowners avoid foreclosure through housing counseling, funded by the \nCommunity Development Block Grant Program. Prior to the funding cuts, \nthese grants provided annually enough resources that 2,818 jobs were \ncreated. Now, in a city that has had 60,000 to 70,000 people out of \nwork consistently for several years, 2,818 jobs is a lot of jobs. \nPhiladelphia is a big city, but that is still a lot of jobs that are \ndirectly a result of community development block grant funding.\n  That is why you hear from mayors that are Democrats and Republicans \nand Independents. Whatever their party, they all seem to come together \non these block grant funds because they know they are better judges of \nwhat is best for their communities.\n  The City of Philadelphia developed its own foreclosure mitigation \nprogram. They developed the program. They came up with the idea, \nimplemented it, and then used Federal money to support it. Yet you have \nsome people in Washington saying: Do not worry about it. You do not \nneed those funds. We are going to decide what the priorities in your \ntown are.\n\n  That is really what they are saying. They may not want to hear this, \nbut that is what you are saying when you tell someone: We are going to \ndrastically cut funding for a successful grant program that has funded \nprojects that you have decided are important or that you may have even \ncreated, in the case of this foreclosure mitigation program.\n  In essence, what they are saying is not just that we are going--that \nthe House or the Senate or any part of our government is going to cut \nthis program dramatically. They are making the decision for those local \ncommunities. So all of those folks in Washington who talk about local \ndecisionmaking and then gut the program have their credibility \ndramatically undermined.\n  I will give a few more examples before I wrap up. The City of \nPittsburgh directed some of its grant dollars to promote home ownership \nand affordable housing. That is our second largest city using these \ngrant funds in a way that was most important to them. The Lehigh \nValley, which is the eastern seaboard of our State, just north of \nPhiladelphia--cities such as Allentown, Bethlehem, Easton, those \ncommunities--used the funds to encourage private sector investment. So \nthey made a decision in their communities that we are not going to use \nthese funds for foreclosure mitigation or housing, we are going to \nfocus on job creation. We are going to focus on getting private sector \nbusinesses to locate in the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania. They made \nthat decision, not us. They made that decision. Some people in the \nHouse think they should substitute their judgment for the people of the \nLehigh Valley in Pennsylvania. I think that is a mistake.\n  In Lancaster and York Counties down in the southern border of our \nState, a portion of these grant funds was used to reduce blight and \nrevitalize historic downtowns. Again, they made that decision. They \nhave used these dollars for that.\n  None of those communities are saying these dollars should not be \nsafeguarded, should not be spent and treated as precious taxpayer \ndollar resources. No one is saying they should not be scrutinized. No \none is saying they should not be audited. No one is saying they should \nnot be carefully examined as to how they spend those dollars. All they \nare saying to us is let's keep the community development block grant at \na reasonable level. We are not asking for the Moon, not asking for a \ndoubling of the funding or some great amount of money that the Federal \nGovernment cannot afford. But they are saying: Let us decide that. \nWashington decides a lot of things. That is the way our system works. \nBut on this one they are saying to us: Let us decide, not Washington.\n  So we know the value of the program. We know that over the past few \nyears these grant funds have been reduced by nearly 25 percent. So just \nlevel funding, unfortunately, becomes a significant victory. Further \nloss of funds will directly harm these communities that rely upon these \ngrant funds to address their most pressing needs. As I mentioned, \nmayors across the country rely upon these grants for vital services. I \nhave heard directly from mayors in both parties about this. So further \ncuts to the block grant program will have a detrimental effect on \ncities and municipalities, some of which are the ones that have \nsuffered the most from the foreclosure crisis, from the economic \nrecession and the job-killing impact of that recession. If they are not \ndigging out, they have just gotten out of the hole. They are not \nfeeling all that secure yet. These grant funds allow them to make these \ndecisions, allow them to make the investments they want to make.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5834]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/23/senate-section/article/S5834-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    First Sergeant Tracy L. Stapley\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a recently fallen \nsoldier, 1SG Tracy L. Stapley, one of Utah's finest. He left this earth \non July 3, 2013, while serving our country at Camp As Sayliyah, Qatar.\n  First Sergeant Stapley was an Army man, and his family is an Army \nfamily. His love for our country showed through his actions. He served \nin the U.S. Army Reserve for 26 years, and was assigned to the 308th \nMedical Logistics Company. He also worked full-time for the Army \nReserve as a civilian, and his presence among co-workers will be sorely \nmissed. The 308th recently posted a tribute to First Sergeant Stapley \nonline, part of which I would like to read:\n\n       First Sergeant was an amazing leader, mentor, and friend. \n     He always placed his soldiers first and had their backs from \n     day one. To many, he was more than just a first sergeant, he \n     was a friend and a confidant. First Sergeant Stapley was the \n     glue that held the unit together. He excelled in all aspects \n     of his life; from the unit's first sergeant, to his civilian \n     employment, to being a husband and father.\n\n  Tracy and his dear wife Antionette are the parents of two beautiful \nchildren, Trase and Kennedy. Known as the ``dance dad,'' Tracey was an \nardent supporter of Kennedy's dancing. He also loved to attend Trase's \nsporting events. The unmatched pride of a father was frequently seen at \nmany recitals, and on many sidelines. I trust that all Utahns share the \npride that I feel, knowing that this fellow Utahn served not only his \ncountry, but also his family with honor and love.\n  It is comforting to me to know that First Sergeant Stapley's love for \nour country and dedication to excellence lives on through his family. \nHis son Trase is currently a cadet at the U.S. Military Academy at West \nPoint, and I am confident that he is representing Utah and the Stapley \nfamily well.\n  First Sergeant Stapley was always helping others, even when help was \nunsolicited. His son Trase wrote that Tracy was ``a man worth praising \nand a friend worth having; . . . a fun-loving jokester.'' Trase added:\n\n       He loved the family and loved being around us making sure \n     we had everything we ever needed and more. He was the best. \n     We love you Dude, Rest in Peace. Come see us sometime.\n\n  It warms my soul to witness the sustaining power of faith, and the \nlove that a son has for his father.\n  I imagine that First Sergeant Stapley, like many of our service men \nand women, would deny the claim that he is a hero. To Tracy, and all of \nour soldiers, I would say that you are among the few heroes left in our \nmodern world. As Americans, we all feel a profound sense of pride and \nhonor when we see a uniformed soldier, and we would be wise to remember \nour heroes in all that we do, especially in this body. It is true that \nwe honor those who have gone before by living our lives with excellence \ntoday.\n  I thank 1SG Tracy L. Stapley for his honorable service in defense of \nthe Constitution and our freedom, and I thank all of our men and women \nwho have also given the ultimate sacrifice. I would like to convey my \ncondolences and profound gratitude to his wife Antionette, his daughter \nKennedy, his son Trase, and his father John. Our thoughts and prayers \nare with you, and with your entire family. It is my solemn hope that \nwe, as Senators, will always remember the tremendous sacrifice, laid \nupon the altar of freedom by our brave soldiers and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/23/senate-section/article/S5834-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING PRIVATE FIRST CLASS WALTER HERBERT ANDERSON\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, today I rise to honor PFC Walter Herbert \nAnderson, who has been awarded a posthumous Purple Heart for his \nservice in World War I. He was born in Toquerville, Utah Territory, on \nFebruary 3, 1895, 1 year before Utah officially became a State. Little \ndid he know that his service would take him around the world and change \nthe rest of his life. PFC Anderson was involved in some of the largest \nAmerican offensives of the war and served his country with honor. He \nwas part of the famous 91st Division, affectionately referred to as the \n``Wild West Division.''\n  The division consisted of a group of inexperienced young men from \nseveral Western States. Although they were shipped to Europe in the \neleventh hour of the war, as all Americans were, they fought in some of \nthe most ferocious operations. Private First Class Anderson, a member \nof the 346th artillery regiment, was part of three major offensives: \nthe Saint Mihiel Offensive, France; the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, \nFrance, and the Ypres-Lys Offensive, Belgium.\n  During the Meuse-Argonne Offensive in October 1918, Private First \nClass Anderson was debilitated by a German gas attack. In World War I, \ndue to the limited knowledge regarding the effects of chemical warfare, \ngassed soldiers were not counted among the wounded in medical records \nor morning reports. According to the U.S. Army Medical Department's \nOffice of Medical History, 229 soldiers were gassed from the 91st \nDivision during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. These soldiers were not \nput in the hospitals because of gas residuals, which were active for \ndays.\n  The American casualties from mustard gas were carried to portable \n``gas hospitals.'' These consisted of temporary shelters or local \nhomes. In all, during the Meuse-Argonne campaign, there were 20,000 \nchemical warfare casualties, comprising 22 percent of all injuries \nduring the campaign. Within 24 hours of exposure, victims experienced \nskin irritations, which often turned into large blisters. If eyes were \nexposed, as Private First Class Anderson's were, resulting symptoms \nusually included swelling, pus, and temporary blindness.\n  U.S. doctors treated Private First Class Anderson in a private home \nat La-Ferte-Barnard, France, for about 6 weeks. He was not counted \namong the wounded. His injuries consisted of temporary blindness, \nsticky eyes, burning and pain, bronchial problems, and nervousness. \nSuch was the sacrifice that Private First Class Anderson, along with \nmany of his brothers-in-arms, made to defeat the despotic regimes of \nCentral Europe.\n  Private First Class Anderson was released from the Army in April \n1919. Upon release, he was told that his eye problems and nervousness \nwould go away. On April 6, 1921, Private First Class Anderson signed an \naffidavit of disability and honorable discharge, stating that he ``was \ngassed about October 2, 1918, at the Meuse-Argonne, and was treated by \nU.S. doctors in a private home at La-Ferte-Bernard, France.'' His eyes \nhad a film over them, and his eyelids were granulated. He was \nofficially diagnosed with trachoma, which was caused by exposure to \nmustard gas. He lived honorably with this disability for the rest of \nhis life.\n  Private First Class Anderson left a legacy of service and sacrifice \nto his posterity. He served as the post commander of the Utah Veterans \nof Foreign Wars, and two of his sons also served in the U.S. Armed \nForces. He was Salt Lake County commissioner from 1937 to 1938 and also \nserved as a clerk for the Utah House of Representatives. At age 57, he \nlost an eye as a result of a tumor development and subsequent \noperation. He pushed on with one eye, until in 1955, stricken with \ncancer, he left this frail existence for a more exalted sphere.\n  To Walter and his dear wife Lola and to their posterity, on behalf of \nthe U.S. Senate and the people of Utah, I sincerely thank you for your \nsacrifices, your love of country, and your honorable service. May the \nlife of PFC Walter Herbert Anderson, deserving the honor of being \nincluded in The Military Order of the Purple Heart, shine as an example \nfor us and for future generations. It is my prayer that we will always \nremember the sacrifices of our brave military men and women who have \nfought and who continue to fight in defense of our Constitution and our \nliberty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/23/senate-section/article/S5834-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5834-S5835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO ALTON ``RED'' FRANKLIN\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, on the 40th anniversary of the \nintroduction of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance \nAct in 1973, I wish to honor a distinguished advocate for Indian \nCountry and one of the key architects of the Act, Forrest J. Gerard, \nand recognize him for a lifetime committed to public service.\n  Forrest, a member of the Blackfeet Tribe, was the first American \nIndian to draft and facilitate the passage of Indian legislation \nthrough Congress. During the 1970s, Forrest partnered with Senator \nHenry ``Scoop'' Jackson to dramatically change the United States' \npolicy on Indian affairs. Together, they ended the policy of \ntermination and assimilation, and launched the era of self-governance \nand self-determination, which continues to guide Federal Indian policy \ntoday.\n  Forrest's service began with the U.S. Army Air Corps as a member of a \nbomber crew in World War II. After flying 35 combat missions over Nazi-\noccupied Europe, he became the first member of his family to attend \ncollege, receiving a bachelor's degree from the University of Montana \nin 1949.\n  Over the next two decades, Forrest worked for the State of Montana, \nthe newly formed Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs as \na legislative liaison officer, and as the Director of the Office for \nIndian Progress in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. His \ngoal was to enable future generations of Indian leaders to build \nhealthy and educated communities.\n  Forrest arrived at the U.S. Senate in 1971 to work with Senator \nJackson, then chair of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. \nSenator Jackson had become a strong supporter of self-determination, \nand believed Forrest Gerard, with his significant background with \nFederal agencies and his understanding of the American Indian \nexperience, would bring an important perspective to the debate. Forrest \nwas able to combine significant issue expertise with his solid \nrelationships with tribes to enact meaningful legislation that would \nalter the course of Indian affairs.\n  Forrest's unique skills and relationships played a critical role in \nproducing the landmark Indian Self-Determination and Education \nAssistance Act. With the leadership of Senator Jackson and Forrest \nGerard, this critical bill was signed by President Ford in 1975 and \nremains the basis for Federal dealings with tribal governments.\n  Following the success of the Indian Self-Determination and Education \nAssistance Act, Forrest worked to strengthen tribal governance by \nhelping to pass the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and the \nSubmarginal Lands Act.\n  As Native American journalist Mark Trahant put it:\n\n       Gerard did great work--subtly, without fanfare, and too \n     often without recognition or even thanks. His approach was \n     honesty and directness in dealing with Indian Country, and he \n     never wavered in his loyalty to the Tribes.\n\n  Today we recognize Forrest Gerard for his dedication, intelligence, \nand persistence, which paved the way for the political achievements \nthat transformed the landscape of Indian affairs. Tribes now have \ngreater autonomy in managing their resources, preserving their \ncultures, and utilizing their land base. And the government-to-\ngovernment relationship between the United States and tribes is now a \nmature relationship.\n  Forrest Gerard was honored for his work by the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians. In 1977 President Jimmy Carter appointed him to be \nthe first Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs. Forrest spent the \nlast 30 years advising Indian people on how to effectively participate \nin developing policy with government leaders and be part of the \npolitical process. Forrest truly has devoted his life to empowering \ntribal communities.\n  I think we are long overdue in commending Forrest for his pioneering, \nindustrious career as a voice for Indian Country. Today we celebrate \nhis leadership in charting a new path for American Indians--a path that \nwon the support of Congress, tribal governments, and the Nation.\n  Forrest Gerard is a hero among a new generation of great Indian \nleaders. And his contributions will be remembered forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/23/senate-section/article/S5835-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5835-S5836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRAIL END CENTENNIAL\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the centennial \nof the Trail End State Historic Site in Sheridan, WY.\n  John Benjamin Kendrick is one of Wyoming's most remarkable \npoliticians. As an orphan in Texas, Kendrick faced many challenges \ngrowing up. He spent much of his childhood in poverty and eventually \ntook a job trailing cattle as far north as Montana. Finally, near the \nBighorn Mountains of northeastern Wyoming, Kendrick found his home.\n  It was there that John Kendrick and his wife Eula began their family. \nThe couple had two children, Rosa-Maye and Manville. After years on the \nfamily's OW Ranch outside of Sheridan, Kendrick decided to build an \nestate in town. It took 5 tedious years to complete the dream house. \nWith superb workmanship, inspired decoration, and fine materials, the \nKendrick family finally completed the building in 1913 and named their \nhome the Trail End.\n  Kendrick and his family were only able to spend a short period of \ntime in the house. In 1914, Kendrick was elected Governor of Wyoming. \nDuring his term, Governor Kendrick was known for working with the State \nlegislature to establish a State workmen's compensation system and a \nStatewide public utilities commission. He also championed many \nimportant causes, including women's suffrage and support for struggling \nfarmers.\n  Within 2 years, he was elected to the United States Senate. He was \nWyoming's first Senator to be elected by popular vote under the 17th \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution. During his 17 years in the U.S. \nSenate, he focused on issues that are still important to Wyoming: \nIrrigation, land use, and the protection of natural resources. Kendrick \nserved as chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Lands and\n\n[[Page S5836]]\n\nSurveys. He was also a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture \nand Forestry as well as the Senate Committee on Irrigation and \nReclamation.\n  Near the end of his third term, Kendrick announced his retirement and \nhis intention to move home to Sheridan and his beloved Trail End. \nSadly, at the age of 76 before his retirement commenced, he passed away \nin Sheridan surrounded by his family.\n  Today, the Wyoming Department of State Parks and Cultural Resources \nis preserving Kendrick's heritage through the care of the Trail End \nState Historic Site, also known as the Kendrick Mansion. Visitors can \ntour the architectural gem which is completely furnished with the \nfamily's original furniture and personal items.\n  Senator Kendrick was a staunch supporter of protecting Wyoming's \nhistory and landmarks, including the beauty of Yellowstone National \nPark and the Teton Mountain Range. I rise today to ask that we remember \nanother piece of history--the magnificent house that the Kendrick \nfamily called home--the Trail End. Built by a self-made leader, \nvisitors will forever be astonished by the beauty that John B. Kendrick \nbrought to Sheridan, WY, and the entire Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/23/senate-section/article/S5836-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   RECOGNIZING THE GREAT PASSION PLAY\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nGreat Passion Play which is currently underway for its 46th consecutive \nyear in Eureka Springs, AR.\n  Since 1968, over 7.6 million people have attended the Great Passion \nPlay. The inspirational play depicting the last week in the life of \nJesus Christ is 1 hour and 45 minutes long featuring almost 200 actors, \nlive animals, and special effects on a three-story tall set built into \nthe hillside.\n  Performances of the play take place the first Friday of May through \nthe last Saturday in October.\n  This year, two big names in contemporary Christian music are joining \ntogether to host an event in the Eureka Springs Auditorium to celebrate \n``Passion Play Day'' on August 8.\n  Local resident John Michael Talbot, who is recognized as one of \nCatholic music's most popular artists and the author of 20 books, will \nbe welcoming Michael Card, who himself has recorded over 31 albums and \nauthored or co-authored over 24 books, for a performance to benefit the \nGreat Passion Play.\n  Mr. Talbot has deep ties to the area having founded his community \n``The Brothers and Sisters of Charity'' and the ``Little Portion \nHermitage/Monastery'' in neighboring Berryville, AR over 30 years ago.\n  The Great Passion Play is important for the Eureka Springs community, \nas well as the State of Arkansas.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and thank \na Nevadan who is here in our Nation's Capital this week, Mr. Robert W. \nChambers, Jr. Mr. Chambers is an artillery veteran of the United States \nArmy who served in the 196th Infantry Brigade during the Vietnam war. \nHe, along with his brother and father, is visiting from Nevada this \nweek to participate in a reunion of the 196th Infantry Brigade, and I \nwould like to thank and commend him for his service to our country.\n  The 196th Infantry Brigade was the last combat brigade to depart from \nVietnam in June of 1972. More than 1,000 soldiers who served in the \n196th were killed in action in Vietnam, and more than 5,000 others were \nwounded in action. These immeasurable sacrifices made by intrepid \nAmerican patriots are truly heroic and deserve our highest respect and \ndeepest appreciation.\n  This week will mark the 60th anniversary of the armistice that ended \nhostilities in Korea. That conflict is often tragically referred to as \nAmerica's ``Forgotten War.'' But the lives lost during that conflict, \nand during every conflict America has waged to defend freedom both at \nhome and abroad, are far from forgotten. May it never be said that any \nwar in which brave Americans like Robert W. Chambers, Jr. served, is \n``forgotten.''

Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge the \nvaluable contributions that Special Agent Kurk Broksas of the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, ATF, has made to the U.S. \nSenate as a legislative fellow to my colleague, the late Senator Frank \nR. Lautenberg. Special Agent Broksas came to the Senate on detail from \nthe ATF in January 2012 and served through the conclusion of the 112th \nCongress. Kurk became such a valued member of Senator Lautenberg's \nstaff that he was asked to extend his tenure into the current Congress, \nand he provided exemplary service until Senator Lautenberg's passing on \nJune 3, 2013.\n  Special Agent Broksas has had a long career in Federal law \nenforcement, and his experience, knowledge, and expertise served \nSenator Lautenberg, the people of New Jersey, and the Nation.\n  Kurk Broksas began his career as a U.S. Border Patrol Agent, \nenforcing Federal law against human traffickers and drug smugglers on \nthe United States/Mexico border. Agent Broksas quickly established \nhimself as a leader, becoming a field training agent and ensuring the \nnext generation of agents were highly trained and performed their \ndangerous duties with honor and vigilance. Agent Broksas ultimately \nleft the border for New York City to conduct criminal investigations as \na special agent with the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n  A desire to protect our Nation from criminals armed with firearms and \nexplosives brought Kurk to Washington, DC in 2000 to serve as an ATF \nspecial agent. His work over the past 13 years with the ATF involved \ncomplex criminal investigations into the illegal manufacture, \ntrafficking, and use of firearms by violent criminals. As ATFs \nrepresentative to the Capital Area Regional Fugitive Task Force, \nSpecial Agent Broksas worked diligently with Federal, State and local \npolice to track down and apprehend the worst of the worst. His tireless \nefforts ensured that murderers, rapists, and gang members did not evade \ncapture, and victims saw justice.\n  Special Agent Broksas' expertise was of great use during his time as \na legislative fellow in the U.S. Senate. During the past year and a \nhalf, our Nation has suffered terrible losses at the hands of criminals \nand the mentally ill in possession of firearms and explosives: 12 \nkilled and 58 injured at a mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, \nCO; 20 children and 6 adults shot and killed at Sandy Hook Elementary \nSchool in Newtown, CT; 3 people killed and hundreds wounded at the \nbombings during the Boston Marathon. While our country grieved, Special \nAgent Broksas set to work here in the Senate, working late nights \nproviding valuable technical expertise and helping craft legislation to \nprevent future tragedies. His tenacity and drive exemplified what our \nNation desires in the men and women that put on the badge and dedicate \ntheir lives to serving our Nation and keeping us safe.\n  Mr. President, Special Agent Broksas has represented the law \nenforcement agents of the ATF with distinction and honor. I thank Kurk \nfor his tremendous service to Senator Lautenberg, the United States \nSenate, and to our Nation.\n\n[[Page S5837]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/23/senate-section/article/S5837-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            TUALATIN, OREGON\n\n Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the \ncentennial anniversary of the city of Tualatin, OR.\n  Since its founding, the city of Tualatin has exhibited continued \ngrowth and increasing prosperity. The city began as the small town of \nGalbreath in 1853, comprising just 23 families. With the construction \nof the first bridge across the Tualatin River in 1856 and the arrival \nof the Portland and Willamette Railway Company in 1866, which attracted \nbusiness from Portland and throughout the Willamette Valley, the town's \npopulation and economic importance increased.\n  Over the 100 years since its incorporation on August 18, 1913, the \ncity of Tualatin grew from a rural suburb to a vibrant urban city that \nsupports 27,000 residents and 20,000 jobs. Located only 12 miles south \nof Portland and bisected by two major railways, Tualatin hosts new \nhigh-tech industries and upscale shopping centers such as Bridgeport \nVillage.\n  The city's economic success is complemented by city officials' \nimpressive leadership on environmentally aware urban development \ninitiatives, enhancing residents' quality of life and providing an \nexample to other Oregon cities of responsible urban planning. The \nTualatin Commons, a public/private partnership featuring a three-acre \nmanmade lake, a wide public promenade and plaza, and an interactive \nfountain provides recreational and entertainment opportunities. With \nover 200 acres of parks, trails, and natural areas, Tualatin also \npreserves green spaces for the public to enjoy.\n  The citizens of Tualatin are engaged and motivated, fostering a \nclose-knit and thriving community. Each year area organizations \norganize the Crawfish Festival, which attracts an estimated 12,000 \npeople and features local food, crafts, and music. The locally \ndeveloped Citizen Involvement Organization program encourages residents \nto further improve life within Tualatin by funding community projects.\n  Throughout the last 100 years, the leaders and citizens of Tualatin \nhave made invaluable contributions to the Portland metropolitan region \nand to the State of Oregon as a whole. I offer my sincerest \ncongratulations during this celebration and look forward to many more \nyears of prosperity for Tualatin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/23/senate-section/article/S5837-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ST.

In 2012 and 2011, St. Francis \nMedical Center was honored as a Best Employer for Healthy Lifestyles by \nthe National Business Group on Health's Institute on Innovation. Also, \nU.S. News and World Report rated St. Francis as one of the best \nhospitals in Louisiana.\n  St. Francis Medical Center has been a cornerstone of the medical \ncommunity of Northeast Louisiana, and it is my honor to recognize their \n100th anniversary as they prepare to enter their second century of \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/23/senate-section/article/S5837-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.

A bill to protect the information of livestock producers, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Donnelly in \nintroducing legislation that will prevent the EPA from distributing the \npersonal information of farmers. This legislation comes in direct \nresponse to\n\n[[Page S5843]]\n\nthe EPA releasing personal information on over 80,000 farmers \nnationwide and over 9,000 farmers in Iowa. After the initial data \nrelease, I wrote a letter that was signed by 23 of my colleagues to the \nEPA asking them to explain their rationale for releasing the addresses, \nemails and phone numbers of so many producers. Their response was \nunsatisfactory to me so I am introducing this bill to stop the EPA from \ndoing this again.\n  The EPA's interpretation of the information which can be provided \nunder a Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, request is simply too broad. \nOur Nation's farmers operate unique businesses in that their homes are \noften at the same location as their farming operation. When the EPA \nreleased this data, activist groups attained contact information and \naddresses for farm families whose way of life they oppose. This is \nunacceptable.\n  I would also like to point out that this bill does not prevent the \nEPA from collecting the information about where farmers' operations are \nlocated. It also does not prevent EPA from disclosing information in \nthe aggregate. The legislation simply prevents them from releasing \npersonal information to the public. Furthermore, I am pleased to have \nsupport for this bill from 16 agriculture groups who agree that we \nshould not enable activist groups with personal information. If we want \npeople to trust our government, agencies like the EPA must quit taking \nactions that shake the confidence of our citizens. I urge my colleagues \nto join us in supporting this commonsense bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/23/senate-section/article/S5843-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1739.
