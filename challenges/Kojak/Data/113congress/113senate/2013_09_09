Mr. President, this evening the Senate will proceed to \nexecutive session to consider a couple of would-be judges, Caproni and \nBroderick, both from the Southern District of New York, at 5:30 p.m., \nand then there will be two rollcall votes on the confirmation of those \nnominations. We may only have one rollcall vote and one voice vote, but \nwe will get both of them done today.\n  I just moved to proceed to the joint resolution reported last week by \nthe Foreign Relations Committee to authorize the limited use of force \nagainst Syria. This matter demands the attention of the Senate and this \ncountry. It is this resolution the Senate will turn to. Regardless of \nwhere Senators stand on the merits of this issue, we should have this \ndebate. I hope all Senators will support proceeding to this measure. \nThat vote will occur sometime on Wednesday on the motion to proceed.\n  Under a previous order, at 11 tomorrow morning, the Senate is to have \na motion to proceed to the energy efficiency bill. It is obvious we are \nnot going to be able to do that. I will work with the Republican leader \nto reach a consent agreement to defer consideration of that bill to a \nlater time.\n  On the Syria resolution, I intend that the Senate should have a full \nand open debate. I encourage Senators to come to the floor to begin \nthat debate.\n  Also this week, President Obama will come to the Capitol to address \nthe Democratic caucus. He has also extended his invitation to the \nRepublicans. I have not heard back from the Republicans as to whether \nthey wish to hear from the President.\n  President Obama will address the Nation tomorrow evening. Senior \nadministration officials will brief all Senators in a classified \nsession on Wednesday. There will be other meetings in the White House \ntoday with Democratic and Republican Senators. The Senate will give \nthis matter the serious attention it deserves.\n\n\n                            Chemical Weapons\n\n  Mr. President, the first large-scale military use of deadly military \nweapons occurred almost 100 years ago when the Germans deployed \nchlorine gas during World War I. During that war,\n\n[[Page S6274]]\n\nWorld War I, there were 1,200,000 casualties from attacks with deadly \ntoxins--chlorine gas, mustard gas, and other deathly and destructive \nchemical agents. Great Britain, Austria, Hungary, France, Germany, \nItaly, and the United States all suffered losses.\n  ``This is a horrible weapon,'' wrote German Major Karl von Zinger, \nwho reported a firsthand battlefield account of the carnage to his \nsuperior officers.\n  One hundred thousand soldiers died, and most of the other casualties \nwere debilitated for life by the exposure to these deadly toxins. The \neffects of these killers were horrific. Those who didn't die suffered \nblindness, burns, blisters, and labored breathing. For those dying, it \nwas as terrible as anyone could imagine. The great World War I era poet \nWilfred Owen from Great Britain wrote that gassed soldiers cried out \nlike men on fire as they drowned in air thick with poison. The world \nwas horrified by the gruesomeness of these new evil weapons of war, and \nso, as a global community, we agreed these weapons should be banished \nfrom the battlefield forever.\n  Despite the success of global efforts to eliminate their use, today \nthe Syrian Government is the second largest holder of chemical weapons \nin the world--only shortly behind North Korea. The well-documented use \nof these toxic and unsavory stockpiles by President Bashar al-Asad's \nregime is a certain violation of the overwhelming international \nconsensus forged against these weapons nearly 10 decades ago. It is a \nclear violation of human decency. This is not the first time Asad has \nused chemical weapons against his own citizens. We all heard in our \nclassified briefings that these weapons have been used a number of \ntimes, but this is the most gruesome and extensive.\n  This morning I watched some film in my office. The film takes about \n13 minutes. It was pictures that were taken following the dropping of \nthose horrible weapons. I will never get that out of my mind. There \nwere little baby boys and girls dressed in colorful play clothes. Some \nof the boys and girls looked like teenagers. They were retching and had \nspasms with their arms. Of course there were older people as well. \nThese poisons kill the kids first. Their little bodies cannot take this \nas well as older folks. It kills the older people also but more slowly.\n  The well-documented use of these unsavory stockpiles by Asad is a \ncertain violation, I repeat, of the overwhelming international \nconsensus forged against these weapons 10 decades past. I have talked \nabout human decency. It is a clear violation of human decency.\n  The August 21 attacks killed more than 1,000 civilians--including \nhundreds of these children. This week we will further examine the \nevidence that is growing which proves the viciousness of these attacks \nand discuss their brutal results.\n  The innocent civilians who were killed by the Syrian Government \nduring those attacks died terrible deaths. Their death was just as \npainful and shocking as those suffered on the battlefields of World War \nI. These deaths were just as terrible as those that convinced the \nglobal community to outlaw the use of such brutal tactics against \nsoldiers, and, of course, against innocent civilians such as those Asad \nmurdered last month.\n  The evidence of the Asad regime, and their using outlawed nerve \nagents against its own citizens, is clear and very convincing. The \nSyrian Government has worked to hide the gruesome evidence. They have \ndone it a number of different ways. After the bodies had been cleared \naway, they sent a barrage of weaponry in there--artillery and tanks--\nand blasted the ground and destroyed the evidence. They couldn't \ndestroy it; it is still there, but they did try. They worked very hard \nto hide these gruesome attacks by repeatedly bombing the site of these \ngrisly and unforgettable occurrences. Without question, this brutality \ndemands a response. The satellite imagery and amateur video shot by \neyewitnesses--and I talked about that--paint a clear picture of the \nbrutality of this awful regime.\n  President Obama sought approval 2 weeks ago for targeted military \naction--action that will hold President Asad accountable for these \nheinous acts. Congress has done its due diligence. Since President \nObama announced he would seek congressional approval for the limited \nmilitary action against Syria, the Senate has held many committee \nhearings and briefings as well as five classified all-Members \nbriefings. There are more briefings and much debate to come this week--\nincluding open debate here in the Senate.\n  On a bipartisan basis the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a \nresolution that restricts the use of military force to 60 days, with a \nsingle 30-day extension. The resolution reflects President Obama's \nproposal for limited military action--including strikes of limited \nduration and limited scope.\n  The resolution plainly states there may be no U.S. military boots on \nthe ground. America's intention, as specified in the resolution, is not \nto engage in an open-ended conflict or invasion. Nor is it the \nCommander in Chief's intention to commit ground troops to this conflict \nor to effect regime change. Rather, the Senate will be voting to uphold \nthe century-long international consensus that chemical weapons have no \nplace on the battlefield and certainly no place in attacking innocent \ncivilians. This standard demands any government--a dictator or any \nother government--that has used chemical weapons to be held \naccountable.\n  Some may disagree with my conclusions. I don't expect everyone to \nagree with the statement I am giving here today, as is anyone's right, \nbut this is my firm conviction.\n  Today, many Americans say that these atrocities are none of our \nbusiness, that they are not our concern. I disagree. Anytime the \npowerful turn such weapons of terror and destruction against the \npowerless it is our business.\n  The weapons in question are categorically different. Chemical \nweapons, we know, can kill not just dozens or hundreds of people but \ntens of thousands of innocents in a single attack--tens of thousands. \nThese weapons don't just pose a threat to the Syrian people or to our \nallies in the region; they pose a threat to every one of us, every \nAmerican, and, in particular, every member of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  If we allow Asad's use of chemical weapons to go unchecked and \nunanswered, hostile forces around the world will also assume that these \nterrible tactics of demons such as Asad are permissible, that they are \nOK. That America cannot allow. That is why the massacres in Syria are \nour business and our concern, both as humans and as Americans. \nAmerica's willingness to stand for what is right should not end at its \nborders.\n  Our intervention on behalf of those in danger hasn't always been \npopular. Look back at history. There has always been part of our \nsociety that prefers isolation. Look prior to World War I. Look prior \nto World War II. Some prefer isolation. That is the easy thing to do. \nBut sitting on the sidelines isn't what made the United States of \nAmerica the greatest Nation in the world in years past and, yes, today, \nand sitting on the sidelines won't make us a better Nation tomorrow.\n  As America faces yet another crisis of conscience, another \nopportunity to intervene on behalf of humanity, my mind returns to that \nturning point in the world's history when the United States of America \nfaced down an evil regime that murdered millions of innocent citizens. \nMillions of civilians and prisoners of war were murdered by gas in Nazi \ndeath camps--Belsen, Treblinka, Auschwitz. Never again, swore the \nworld. Never again would we permit the use of these poisonous weapons \nof war.\n  Fourteen blocks from here, down Constitution Avenue, is the Holocaust \nMuseum. We walk in there and see a quote on the wall from Dante's \nfamous ``Inferno.'' Here is what it says: ``The hottest places in hell \nare reserved for those who, in times of great moral crisis, maintain \ntheir neutrality.'' I repeat: ``The hottest places in hell are reserved \nfor those who, in times of great moral crisis, maintain their \nneutrality.'' I have thought about those words very often--and very \noften lately--as I have considered whether America should take action \nto avert further atrocities in Syria.\n  In Europe, in World War II, far too many were neutral. Far too many \naround the world were neutral. Far too many in America were neutral, \nand in Europe, in World War II. Six million\n\n[[Page S6275]]\n\nJews and tens of thousands of gypsies, disabled people, gay people, and \npolitical dissidents were murdered. Never again.\n  Now we are faced with that choice again. Some say it is not our \nfight. Some say Syria is too far away. Some say it is not in our \nsecurity interest. Russia, China, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and \nthe United States--we should all remember our history. There were 1.2 \nmillion casualties in World War I from these poisons.\n  We should remember our history. Rabbi Hillel, a respected and famous \nscholar, said more than 2,000 years ago: ``If I care only for myself, \nwhat am I? If not now, when?''\n  I, Harry Reid, say: If not now, when?\n  I believe America must set the example for the rest of the world. If \nAmerica must once again lead--as we have before and we will again--to \nset an example for the world, so be it. This is America. It is who we \nare as a country. That is what we do as a country. That is where we \nstand as a country. That is the American tradition of which I am proud \nand a tradition which I have faith will continue.\n  We are the United States of America.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is an order outstanding. I ask \nunanimous consent that the order until 5 o'clock today be modified on \nthe motion to proceed, with the other aspects of the order remaining in \nplace.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will be in a period of debate on the motion to proceed to S.J. \nRes. 21 until 5 p.m., with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 \nminutes each.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak to the \nissues the majority leader just addressed. I don't anticipate speaking \nfor more than 12 to 15 minutes. I know the minority leader is delayed \nin being able to be here. I would be happy to defer to him when he \narrives or I would be happy to defer to someone coming back to speak on \nthe business of the day.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, President Obama will finally make his case \nto the American people tomorrow, explaining why he wants to take \nmilitary action against Syria. His explanation is long overdue.\n  I think I have a pretty good idea of what I expect he will say. \nFirst, he will explain that we have compelling evidence that it was \nAsad himself who used long-banned chemical weapons to murder his own \npeople. This is not seriously contested. Neither I nor perhaps I think \nany of my colleagues here dispute these sad facts. It has been well \ndocumented by our intelligence sources. As a member of that committee, \nI have had access to those sources, and I don't doubt the conclusion of \nthe President and others that Asad is responsible for this attack.\n  The President will also most likely explain that such a horrendous \nviolation of international norms deserves a worldwide response of \ncondemnation. Who could possibly look at those standards and those \nrooms full of dead children and not agree that the perpetrators have to \nface consequences for their crimes?\n  The President will also surely discuss the issue of credibility. He \nis likely to maintain, as he did recently in Stockholm, that it is not \nhis own credibility at stake, nor even American credibility, but the \ncredibility of the international community that will be harmed by \ninaction.\n  I agree with those who say the President's credibility and our \nNation's credibility are linked. They are. However, with his now \nnotorious and, I believe, ill-considered ``red line'' comment, \nPresident Obama has forced us to debate a military attack in yet \nanother Middle Eastern country. Unfortunately, it appears that the \npurpose of this military attack first and foremost is perhaps to defend \nhis own credibility. I am certain that if the President had not drawn \nhis red line, we would not be having this discussion. In that case, \nAsad's use of such weapons would be roundly condemned as yet another \nexample of his horrendous brutality, but we would be no more eager to \nengage militarily in his civil war than we have been as the other \n100,000 Syrian people were being slaughtered by more conventional \nmeans.\n  Make no mistake--it is the credibility issue that has brought us to \nthis pass, and the credibility issue is of President Obama's own \nmaking--his and his alone.\n  So tomorrow evening the President will need to explain to the \nAmerican public exactly what will be achieved by this limited, focused \nattack, as described by the administration, beyond simply a token \npunishment for a horrendous crime in defense of his credibility. The \nPresident has said the proposed limited attack is to be a ``shot across \nthe bow.'' His Secretary of State, Secretary Kerry, has said it is \ngoing to be unbelievably small. We need to know what the plan is, and \nwill be, should President Asad be undeterred by this unbelievably \nsmall, shot-across-the-bow attack. What if he isn't? What then? What do \nwe do next? The President needs to explain that.\n  We need to know how this escalation is likely to influence extremist \nradical fighters now active in Syria--extremist radical fighters. There \nis not a line between good guys and bad guys here. There is the \ninfiltration of Al Qaeda, al-Nusra, and other terrorist organizations \nand individuals with those seeking to overturn Asad. So it is not clear \njust how Syria will turn out should Asad be deposed. I don't think \nthese extremist fighters will be overly concerned with an \n``unbelievably small, shot across the bow'' response by the United \nStates.\n  What will Hezbollah and Hamas and Al Qaeda affiliate fighters do when \nthis ``show of force'' is over? What is the President's plan of action \nif the chemical weapons fall into the hands of these anti-American \njihadists? And how about the always-threatened spillover of the Syria \nconflict into Lebanon or Turkey or Jordan? Will an attack intended to \nslap Asad's wrist while defending President Obama's credibility make \nexpansion of the conflict more likely or less likely? Most importantly, \nthe President needs to explain to the American people more thoroughly \nexactly how America's national security and best interests will be \nserved by this response.\n  The President, in my opinion, must also address additional concerns \nthat are widely--almost universally--shared by the American people. We \nall know that taking America to war without support from the people is \nthe surest path to disaster. I suggest this must be avoided, and the \nPresident is going to have to make his case as to how to avoid that.\n  Over this last week I visited with Hoosiers from across Indiana to \ngather their input. Through these visits, as well as calls and e-mails \nby the thousands, the vast majority--shockingly, the majority of \nHoosiers I have heard from are opposed to U.S. military engagement in \nSyria. As all conscientious lawmakers, I know I have to balance the \nviews of my constituents with my own judgment on how best to represent \ntheir interests and the interests of our country.\n  In this case, I must first ask myself, what do the people back home \nin my State know that many of the rest of us here in Washington perhaps \ndo not, or at least have expressed?\n  First, the people back home know that America has been at war in far-\noff lands for more than a decade--12 years on. They have seen long \nrepeated deployments of their loved ones, and they have seen the body \nbags come home. They are aware of sacrifices that have been made in the \nname of protecting our interests, but they are less aware of positive \nresults of those sacrifices.\n  They see Iraq descending again into conflict as its own citizens \ncontinue to slaughter one another because of different interpretations \nof the Koran or different political motivations or just pure outright \nquests for power. They see a corrupt government there that authorizes \noverflights of Russian aircraft bringing modern weapons to Syria to \nfuel a similar conflict.\n  Hoosiers see an Afghanistan so deeply corrupt and ungrateful to the \nUnited States that the current regime tries to extort huge ransom \npayments simply\n\n[[Page S6276]]\n\nto permit us to remove equipment and personnel from that sorry country. \nThey do not see meaningful progress toward a democratic, stable, and \nhumane government that was to be the objective of American sacrifice of \nblood and treasure. They do not see how our 12 years of effort have \ncontributed to our own national security interests.\n  Hoosiers look at the spiraling disaster in Egypt, where the choices \nhave been an extremist, deeply anti-American Islamic radicalism or a \nbrutal and undemocratic military dictatorship. both benefiting from \nbillions of American taxpayer dollars spent on weapons or lining \nuniform pockets. In the meantime, fellow Christians are being killed in \ntheir churches.\n\n  Simply put, the people of Indiana do not see that American policy and \naction have attained meaningful results in the Middle East. Instead, \nthey see a region of continuing and increasing violence, chaos, and \ndisintegration. They are war weary and they are discouraged after more \nthan a decade of wars that have not produced the desired outcomes.\n  What they do not see is an articulate response. They do not know what \nour regional strategy is in the Middle East because no one is \nexplaining it, much less pursuing it. They cannot measure progress \nbecause they do not know the destination. And they cannot evaluate this \nlatest proposal for a fourth military engagement in the Middle East \nbecause they cannot see how it contributes to our own security here at \nhome.\n  More importantly, they worry that a focused, limited attack on Syria \nwill end up being something else entirely because so little thought has \nbeen devoted to potential unintended consequences. Yes, they are war \nweary, but the American people are also war wise.\n  In addition to the above unanswered questions, for me, one of the \nmost important questions is how this proposed limited strike will \naffect Iran's perception of our resolve and our ability to prevent that \ncountry from acquiring nuclear weapons capability. It is not so much \nwhat we do or how we do it but how Iran perceives the action we take. \nThis may be the most significant question of all because, unlike Syria, \nIran poses threats to our core national security interests.\n  Part of the administration's argument is that to do nothing would \nembolden the Iranian regime as they pursue their own weapons-of-mass-\ndestruction programs. But I think we have to raise the question, is \nthat really so, or is it, perhaps, the reverse? Will a limited punitive \nattack discourage the mullahs in Iran because of some degree of \ndestruction--remember, unbelievably small--or will it actually \nencourage the Iranians because there is no followup option or broader \nstrategic context informing our policy? If an attack is ineffective in \naltering Asad's behavior or fortune, will it not actually encourage \nIran in pursuing its own weapons program? I have not heard the \nadministration address this question.\n  Also, will a fourth military engagement in the Middle East make it \nharder to assemble popular and political support for action should \nIran's behavior make that necessary? My constant fear here during the \npast several years, as I have been engaged on the Iranian issue of the \npursuit of nuclear weapons, has been that our country will be too \nmilitarily, politically, and economically exhausted to confront the \nreal strategic enemy when our core interests require it. I fear a Syria \nattack will make this problem even more difficult. To my knowledge, no \none has yet to address this question within the administration, which \nPresident Obama, like the previous three Presidents, has declared a \nnuclear-weapons-capable Iran to be ``unacceptable.''\n  I think this is a critical question we must have to ask ourselves. \nFor all of those who are saying: We will change the perception of Iran \nto the point where they will change their behavior in the pursuit of \nnuclear weapons by a, quote, unbelievably small shot across the bow or \na military response that could lead us into further conflict in the \nMiddle East--I think this undermines our credibility. I think the \nquestion has to be asked: Is the reverse going to happen as a \nconsequence of all of this?\n  This is a deeply historic and profound moment for our Nation. It \ncarries an importance that goes well beyond Syria or even the Middle \nEast. This debate carries important consequences for the relationship \nbetween the executive and legislative branches of our government.\n  To refuse the Commander in Chief war-making authorities when he has \nasked for them is not a decision any of us can take lightly.\n  We must all balance the views of the people we represent--even when \nthey have been nearly unanimous--with other elements, such as the \nabstract, unknowable geostrategic factors that could carry profound \nconsequences not just for this year or next year, for this generation, \nbut for many generations; and such as the compelling moral arguments \nthat resonate with special strength in our unique Nation guided from \nbirth by moral principles; and now even the constitutional challenges \nthat could affect the delicate balance we have maintained for two \ncenturies.\n  I will weigh all I have said before I announce how I intend to vote \non the resolution before us. I will defer to the President's request to \naddress the Nation. In my opinion, consequential actions proposed by \nthe President need to be clarified and numerous questions need to be \nanswered before we grant the authority to the President to engage \nAmerica in yet another Middle East conflict.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I wish to address the subject of Syria.\n  First of all, I wish to commend to anyone who is listening to my \nvoice to view the videos the intelligence community has released. They \ncame from social media. There are 13 videos that came from a body of in \nexcess of 100 videos, but they show the horror of what happens to the \nhuman body with an attack by a weapon of mass destruction--in this \ncase, chemical weapons, a gas called sarin.\n  It is my hope the President, when he speaks to the Nation on Tuesday, \nwill show clips of those videos because I think very few Americans have \nseen the extent of those videos, even though they have been shown on \nsome cable shows in some limited amounts. They could see the range of \nwhy, almost a century ago, in 1925, the nations of the world came \ntogether in a treaty after the use of chemical weapons in World War I. \nThis treaty banned the use of chemical weapons anywhere, any time, \nincluding in war, because of the horrific nature their use causes. In \nthe 1990s this was subsequently reaffirmed in a convention or some kind \nof conclave which the nations of the world--I believe in excess of 180 \nnations--signed banning the use of chemical weapons.\n  If you watch the videos, you will see why. You will see what happens \nto innocent human beings as they struggle for life before the throes of \ndeath overtake them. You will see this on the videos. Of course, \nparents may wish to use discretion because it is going to make a \nlasting impression. You will see how the body starts to shut down by \nthe nerves being attacked.\n  Interestingly, for the first time in a CBS interview today, President \nAsad of Syria has said, has admitted, today, that Syria has chemical \nweapons. Up to this point that was denied. No wonder he would want to \ndeny, because when you see what happens in the use of them and what it \ndoes to the human nervous system--and I don't wish to be graphic, \nbecause I want anybody listening to what I am saying to watch them. I \nhope the President will show them Tuesday night, to see how the human \nbody convulses when it attacks the nervous system--the convulsions, the \ntwitching, what happens to the face, the respiratory system, and all of \nthe evidence that comes from that.\n  The American people need to know what we are dealing with, not only \nin Syria but in other nations that possess chemical weapons. This is \nnot only sarin, which was the gas used here, but also mustard gas and a \ntoxin called VX that directly attacks the nervous system. It does not \nhave to be inhaled,\n\n[[Page S6277]]\n\nlike mustard gas or sarin, to do its evil deed. Instead, VX can be \nabsorbed through the skin.\n  If the American people understand the consequences of the use of \nthis, they will understand why it is classified as a weapon of mass \ndestruction, along with biological weapons of mass destruction \nintroducing some plague among a community of innocents and, of course, \nthe weapon of mass destruction that most everybody recognizes, the \nnuclear weapon.\n  There are three weapons of mass destruction: chemical, biological, \nand nuclear. This is why, in the family of civilized nations, we have \nsaid their use is so abhorrent that civilized humans say they should be \nbanned. But they weren't. They were used extensively on August 21.\n  Before I give the unclassified evidence, I wish to point out that \nmaybe there is a little opening on the occasion of the Russian Foreign \nMinister today, since our Secretary of State, almost in an offhanded \ncomment a few days ago, said it would certainly be a game changer if \nhe, Asad, would allow the international community to come in and take \ncontrol of his Syrian chemical weapons. The Russian Foreign Minister \ntoday picked that up. Supposedly there is a comment by an official out \nof Syria who says that is worth looking into. I can't speak to the \nauthenticity of that comment. I have heard it was said.\n  Whatever it is, of course, Asad is the decisionmaker and it is \nultimately going to come down on him. But in the meantime, what the \nUnited States ought to do--and the Congress of the United States ought \nto authorize what the President of the United States has requested, \nthat the Congress back him in giving him the authority to use a \nlimited, short duration retaliation in degrading Asad's capability of \nutilizing these weapons in the future.\n  If Congress will give the President that authority, it may well be \nthe additional incentive for the ultimate decisionmaker, President \nAsad, to do what the Russian Foreign Minister has suggested. That would \nbe a good thing.\n  In the meantime, they are going to be debating this and we are going \nto be put to the question: Do we support the President in this time of \nperil?\n  Let us look at the facts. I think when you see the videos, clearly, \nmost every reasonable human being is going to conclude chemical weapons \nwere used on innocents in the Damascus suburbs on the night of August \n21.\n  The question then, of course, is, is there a chain of custody to show \nin fact they came from the Syrian army? There is an unclassified body \nof evidence that clearly shows, to put it in the speak of the \nintelligence community, we have high confidence. That means it \nhappened.\n  How did that happen? The assessment is the Syrian chemical weapons \npersonnel, who are associated with the chemical weapons part of the \nSyrian command, were preparing chemical munitions prior to the attack. \nThis is all unclassified. There were streams of data of human signals \nand geospatial intelligence that revealed regime activities that were \nassociated with the preparations for that chemical weapons attack. \nSyria chemical weapons personnel, we know, were operating in the \nDamascus suburb from August 18 all the way through August 21. That was \nthe suburb that was attacked. Multiple streams of intelligence indicate \nthe Syrian army executed the rocket and artillery attack against those \nsuburbs in the early morning hours of August 21. We have satellite \ndetections that corroborate those attacks from a regime-controlled \nneighborhood to where the attacks landed. At the same time, social \nmedia reports started exploding about a chemical attack in the Damascus \nsuburbs. Those social media reports started coming at 2:30 in the \nmorning. Three hospitals in Damascus received approximately 3,600 \npatients displaying the symptoms of a nerve agent exposure, and they \nreceived them in less than 3 hours on the morning of August 21.\n\n  As I said earlier, there have been over 100 videos attributed to the \nattack. This has been distilled down into 13 videos, many of them \nshowing large numbers of bodies exhibiting the physical signs of nerve \nagent exposure. Any Member of the Senate will have access to the \nclassified information that shows the Syrian opposition does not have \nthe capability to fabricate those videos or the physical symptoms \nverified by the medical personnel.\n  So when we put all of this together, with past Syrian practice and \nsome of the small-scale attacks they have done previously, the \nconclusion is obvious: The Syrian regime of Bashar Asad was willing and \ndirected the attack on August 21.\n  To this Senator, who has had the privilege of seeing and hearing \nclassified information--and I have visited with President Asad three \ntimes, the last time being 6 years ago where the two of us had a sharp \nexchange over what was happening in Lebanon and the fact he was \nharboring Hamas and Hezbollah, which of course he denied--the \nconclusion is obvious: There is a substantial body of information that \ncorroborates that the Syrian Government was responsible for the \nchemical weapons attack on August 21.\n  There is additional information for the Senators to see, but the \nquestion is, Are we going to agree to the President's request that we \nauthorize him to attack? If we don't, where does that leave the \nPresident on any kind of negotiations in the future? If the President \ndecides to go ahead and attack, we automatically give to the opponents \nin these countries--especially President Asad and North Korea and \nIran--the obvious scenario that the American people are so divided that \nthey won't support the President. So if he were to decide to attack--\nknowing it is his responsibility to provide for the national security, \nand he has sworn to provide for that national security--we will look so \ndivided at that point, whatever the scenario is for the future.\n  What about the mindset of other people who want to do harm to the \nUnited States? Does it give additional license to North Korea if we \nwere to do nothing? North Korea is sitting on a huge stockpile of \nchemical weapons, not to mention their nuclear weapons. What about \nIran? We are very concerned as they continue to energize weapons \nmaterial and march down the road perhaps to building a nuclear weapon. \nWhat kind of message does it send to Iran? Just game that out. If Iran \nhad a nuclear weapon or felt free to use chemical weapons, what would \nthat do to the interests of the United States in that region of the \nworld, not to mention our allies in the region, of which there are \nmany.\n  So it is clear to this Senator. I will admit I don't know why the \nPresident did not keep his own counsel and make the decision without \nsaying he wanted to come to Congress, but he made that decision, and \nnow it is up to us.\n  Hopefully, there may be some validity to this report coming from the \nRussian Foreign Minister, but we won't know that for a long while, \nuntil, as we say, the proof is in the pudding with Asad turning over \ncontrol of all the chemical weapons to an international body. In the \nmeantime, are we going to support the President? Clearly, in the \ninterest of the national security of this country and our allies, I \nthink that is a position we must take. I will vote yes on the \nresolution.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is on the motion to \nproceed to S.J. Res. 21.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Which is?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Syria resolution.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, it is to that ominous resolution that I \nwould like to speak.\n  Within a few days the Senate will be called upon to vote on whether \nto give the President of the United States limited authority to use \nmilitary action in response to Syrian President Asad's use of chemical \nweapons against his own people. It is an enormous and grave decision. \nIt is the most serious vote I can take.\n  When a U.S. Senator is called upon to authorize America's use of \nmilitary action or military might, it calls for the\n\n[[Page S6278]]\n\nmost sober reflection, the most due diligence analysis of the facts and \nthe compelling need because once you vote to authorize the use of \nmilitary might, you cannot take it back. It is one of the few votes you \ncan't take back. We can vote on our budget this year, but there will be \nanother vote next year. You can vote to confirm a member of the \nCabinet, but they serve at the pleasure of the President. But once you \nvote to use military might or military action, it is irrevocable, so I \ntake it very seriously.\n  I say to the men and women of our military that we owe them a \ntremendous debt of gratitude. I think that should not only be with \nyellow ribbons, but we also owe it to them to do the due diligence to \nchoose the wisest, most prudent course.\n  This is what I have done as I have contemplated my vote on the Syria \nresolution. I went to numerous briefings before Asad used chemical \nweapons, and I have gone to all of the briefings since then. I \nparticipated as a member of the Intelligence Committee in a variety of \nmeetings. I went to a classified House and Senate briefing. I have \nlistened carefully to the President, to the Secretary of State, to the \nSecretary of Defense, and even had the opportunity to sit with the Vice \nPresident of the United States in the Situation Room at the White House \nto go over this situation and what options are available to the United \nStates of America.\n  In addition to listening here in Washington, I have also listened to \nmy Marylanders, whether at events or meetings going around the State, \nwhether it has been grocery shopping or just being out in the Maryland \ncommunity. I have also gotten thousands of e-mails and calls from \nMaryland constituents, and I want to thank them for their civic \nengagement. They overwhelmingly oppose military action in Syria. My \nconstituents have spoken loudly and clearly. They don't want a war. \nThey don't want boots on the ground. They don't want an all-in effort. \nThey don't want to use or expend America's talent and treasure on \nanother military expedition. They don't want war, and neither do I.\n  Yet the use of chemical weapons--a weapon of mass destruction--grim \nand ghoulish, mandates a response. The use of chemical weapons flies \nagainst all international law and international norms. It is an act \nthat should have consequences or I believe it surely will happen \nagain--in Syria, possibly in Korea, possibly used by Iran.\n  Since the attack, I have been waiting and hoping for a worldwide \nreaction because if it is serious enough for the world to be aghast, \nthen it is serious enough for them to respond.\n  I have been waiting to hear from the 189 countries that are \nsignatories to the Chemical Weapons Convention. I believe if you sign a \ntreaty or a convention, you sign up for the responsibility that comes \nwith that, which means stop proliferation of the weapons you signed \nagainst; stop the proliferation of chemical weapons; also, if \nnecessary, to take action if mandated.\n  I am waiting to hear from the Arab League. I wanted to hear from the \nArab League, beyond: Yes, we want Asad to be accountable. I don't know \nwhat that means--hold him accountable. What does that mean? Does it \nmean if we use missiles they will send in Arab men to defend Arab women \nand children? I have not quite heard that.\n  I have waited to hear from our allies, and there are a hearty, \nreliable few who have supported us. Are they going to help support the \nchemical weapons treaty? Are they going to help support the moderates \nin the opposition? Have they called for a donor conference on refugees? \nHello out there.\n  Then there is the U.N. Security Council. By the way, I applaud the \nwork of the U.N. weapons inspectors and the U.N.'s work on refugees, \nbut where is the Security Council? People will say: Oh, we can't act \nunless the Security Council acts. Three times Asad enablers at the \nU.N., Russia and China, have vetoed every effort to move to a political \nsolution--vetoed three times efforts to move to a political solution. \nThe U.N. seems paralyzed in this effort.\n  In deciding my vote, I had to be sure that chemical weapons were used \nby the Asad regime. I was 1 of 19 Senators who voted against going to \nwar in Iraq. I did vote after 9/11 to use lethal action against the \nTaliban, but when it came to the Iraq war, as a member of the \nIntelligence Committee I had reviewed these briefs and I did not \nbelieve Saddam Hussein had nuclear weapons so I voted no. I was right.\n  This time is different because, after extensive briefings and the \nevidence that has been outlined to members of the Intelligence \nCommittee, I am satisfied that, indeed, chemical weapons were used in \nSyria and I am satisfied the Asad regime gave the order to do so.\n  There are those who say to me: Senator Barb, aren't you concerned \nabout the risks and the retaliations if we take action? You bet I am. I \nworry about that. I worry about my own country. I worry about our own \nmilitary. I worry about treasured allies such as Jordan, Israel, \nTurkey. But I also worry about the risk of doing nothing because, as I \nweigh this, I believe the risk and retaliatory possibilities are the \nsame even if we do not act because if they do not use them in \nretaliation against us there is a very good chance that if we leave it \nunresponded to, they will use them anyway. There is no guarantee that \nby doing nothing the bad guys, who have chemical weapons, will do \nnothing. In fact, I fear that Asad, Iran, and North Korea will be \nfurther emboldened.\n  Last, I had to review the President's resolution that is pending \nbefore us, that came out of the Foreign Relations Committee, modified, \nand the President's plan. The President's plan is very straightforward, \nhis proposal is very straightforward, a targeted limited attack. His \npurpose is to deter and to degrade; to deter Asad from using those \nweapons again and to degrade Asad's capability and capacity to use \nthem.\n  I also listened to the President's promise--and I take him at his \nword--that any action would not be boots on the ground; that it is not \nan extended air campaign; that it is not another Iraq or Afghanistan; \nthat we are not in it to try to do regime change. That must come from \nthe Syrian opposition themselves, and I hope others help do that. It is \nmeant to deter the use of chemical weapons and to degrade Asad's \ncapability.\n  I believe the President's plan is the best response to protect U.S. \nsecurity interests in the region and to show commitment to our common \nsecurity interests with allies such as Turkey, Jordan, and Israel. \nTherefore, after great reflection and as much due diligence as I could \ndo, I want to announce today to my colleagues, and most of all to the \npeople of Maryland who supported me, that I will support the \nPresident's request for a targeted, limited military action against the \nSyrian President Bashar Asad's regime in response to the horrific, \ngrim, and ghoulish use of chemical weapons.\n  Let me be clear: I have no grand hopes or illusions about what this \nstrike will do. I do not believe this strike will stop Syria's brutal \ncivil war. I do not believe this strike will stop Asad from being a \nruthless, brutal dictator. I do not believe a strike will eliminate all \nof his chemical weapons. But I do believe it will deter and degrade his \ncapability to strike again, and I do believe when you sign up for a \nconvention to ban the use of chemical weapons, the United States of \nAmerica acts in accordance with its responsibility.\n  Syria is one of the toughest foreign policy issues on which we have \nfocused; there are not many good options. Yet I believe the President's \nplan is the best way and, as of this moment, the only way forward. He \nhas my support.\n  In today's late-breaking news, I understand Russia has now said: Oh, \nlet's put these weapons under international control. Where were the \nRussians during the U.N. Security Council meetings on those three other \noccasions? Is this another tactic for delay? Is this just another \ntactic to enable Asad to have more time to focus?\n  I remain skeptical, but I will leave that to the President to analyze \nthe Russians' intent about what their followthrough is on that. Today \nis not to mandate the strike. My vote does not mandate a strike. But my \nvote is to say: Mr. President, you are the Commander in Chief. We can \nonly have one at a time. You analyze the situation and if you think it \nis necessary to protect the security of the United States of America \nand to fulfill our responsibilities under the conventions we\n\n[[Page S6279]]\n\nhave signed on chemical weapons, you have my support to act in what you \nthink is the best way and in our best interests.\n  I look forward to additional debate with my colleagues and also \nfurther in this debate, in coming to closure, hopefully this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the situation in \nSyria and the historic choice facing this Congress and America. I have \nbeen deeply concerned about the situation in Syria since March of 2011, \nwhen thousands of Syrians from all backgrounds peacefully protested for \na change in the politics and the economy of their country. I think many \nof us believed these peaceful protests would lead to the end of an \nautocratic Asad regime, just as other despots have fallen in other \nparts of the Arab world.\n  Yet President Bashar al-Asad, like his father before him, Hafez al-\nAsad, instead responded with horrific violence to suppress the \naspirations of his own people. With the disturbing help of Russia, \nHezbollah, and Iran, Asad has managed to hang on to power and turn his \ncountry into a humanitarian nightmare.\n  I met with the Russian Ambassador to the United States here in my \noffice in Washington on this issue. I visited the refugee camps along \nthe Turkish border. I talked with the moderate Syrian opposition in \nIstanbul. I discussed this situation with the Turkish President, Mr. \nGul, and their Foreign Minister, Davutoglu, and met with many Chicago-\narea Syrian Americans.\n  I hoped diplomatic and economic pressure would bring an end to the \nmayhem and human suffering in Syria. I know the American people feel a \nresponsibility for those overseas in need and those who are struggling \nto find freedom. But I also know something else about the people of my \nState of Illinois, and I believe of this country: They are weary of \nwar.\n  Then came the August 21 chemical attack in the suburbs of Damascus in \nthe middle of the night. At that moment an important challenge was \nthrown down to the international community. That is not in any way to \ndiminish the violence that has taken place in Syria over the last \nseveral years. Over 100,000 died in that violence.\n  But when it comes to the use of chemical weapons, the world made a \ndecision almost 100 years ago about their use--even in war. How did we \nreach this international consensus on this horrible weapon? We saw \nfirsthand what it could do. The large-scale use of chemical weapons in \nWorld War I killed many and left many wounded and disabled.\n  Those who have some memory of this war--either from a history class \nor having spoken to someone who served there--understand what it meant. \nThese photos can't do justice to the devastation of chemical weapons \nand poison gas, but this is a German gas attack on the Eastern Front in \nWorld War I. We can see that as the gas billowed, the victims were \nanyone who happened to be in its wake.\n  This is also a photograph of British troops from World War I who were \nsubjected to the poison gas, the chemical weapon of the day, and \nblinded during the battle of Estaire in 1918. These photos show just a \nsnapshot of the use of poison gases which don't reach the level of \nvirulence of those used today. Yet maybe even more poignant are the \naudio recordings of the actual former World War I British soldiers \nmaintained by the BBC for generations so the experience would not be \nforgotten.\n  This is one excerpt of British troops struggling to cope with the \neffects of chemical warfare:\n\n       Propped up against a wall was a dozen men--all gassed--\n     their colours were black, green and blue, tongues hanging out \n     and eyes staring--one or two were dead and others beyond \n     human aid, some were coughing up green froth from their \n     lungs--as we advanced we passed many more men lying in the \n     ditches and gutterways--shells were bursting all around.\n\n  This BBC report went on to say:\n\n       My Respirator fell to pieces with the continual removal and \n     readjustment--the gas closed my eyes and filled them with \n     matter and I could not see. I was left lying in the trench \n     with one other gassed man and various wounded beings and \n     corpses and forced to lie and spit, cough and gasp the whole \n     of the day in that trench.\n\n  Another soldier recorded by the BBC said:\n\n       . . . the faces of our lads who lay in the open changed \n     colour and presented a gruesome spectacle. Their faces and \n     hands gradually assumed a blue and green color and their \n     buttons and metal fittings on their uniform were all \n     discoloured. Many lay there with their legs drawn up and \n     clutching their throats.\n\n  As a result of the horrors of World War I, in 1925 the Geneva \nProtocol prohibited the use of chemical and biological weapons in war. \nIt was drawn up and signed at a conference held in Geneva under the \nauspices of the League of Nations, the precursor of the United Nations. \nThis happened in June of 1925, and it became a force of law in February \nof 1928. Syria was a signatory to this agreement.\n  Let me read the opening of this protocol. It is even relevant today.\n\n       Whereas the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other \n     gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices, \n     has been justly condemned by the general opinion of the \n     civilized world; and\n       Whereas the prohibition of such use has been declared in \n     Treaties to which the majority of Powers of the world are \n     Parties; and\n       To the end that this prohibition shall be universally \n     accepted as a part of International Law, binding alike the \n     conscience and the practice of nations.\n\n  What the world was saying in 1925 was clear: These chemical weapons \nwould never, ever be accepted in the civilized world. This message was \nreaffirmed by the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, \nProduction, Stockpiling, and Use of Chemical Weapons, which went into \neffect in 1997 and to which almost every country in the world has \nsigned--almost every country. Those who have not signed: Angola, Egypt, \nNorth Korea, South Sudan, and Syria.\n\n  While not completely taken off the world's battlefields--notably in \nthe case of Iraq, which used poison gas against Iran and its own \nKurdish people in the 1980s--the global prohibition against using \nchemical weapons has been largely upheld for almost a century, that is, \nuntil last month in Damascus, Syria. Syria has one of the largest \nstockpiles of chemical weapons in the world.\n  At our hearing last week, I asked General Dempsey whether the reports \nwhich we have from the French were accurate. They reported the Syrians \nnow have almost 1,000 tons of chemical agents and hundreds of tons of \nthe deadly gas sarin, which has been detected in the pathological \ninvestigation of those who were victims on August 21 in Damascus, \nSyria.\n  Despite all international warnings not to do so--the Syrian \nGovernment is literally a superpower when it comes to chemical weapons \nand has an arsenal on such a large scale--on August 21, in the \ndesperation of war, Bashar Asad unleashed these chemical weapons in his \nown city on his own people.\n  These are horrible pictures of what happened as a result of that \nattack. I have seen worse. One room of children stacked like cordwood--\nvictims of these chemical weapons. We don't believe it was the first \ntime he has used them, and his father used them before him. But it is \nthe largest scale we have ever seen of the use of chemical weapons by \nAsad in Syria.\n  Syria has crossed the line the civilized world said must never be \ncrossed. Not only has the community of nations agreed that such weapons \nare never to be used but other regimes with weapons of mass destruction \nor plans for such weapons--including North Korea and Iran--are \nundoubtedly watching to see what the world will do now.\n  Now that Bashar Asad has used chemical weapons in Syria, now that the \nworld has reported it, now that the photos are there for the world to \nsee, and now that the pathological investigations are completed, what \nwill the world do? Ideally there is a place to resolve it--the U.N. \nSecurity Council. But, sadly, both Russia and China have said they will \nveto not only any effort\n\n[[Page S6280]]\n\nto hold Asad to account, they have literally vetoed efforts to even \npass resolutions condemning the use of chemical weapons without \nspecificity in Syria.\n  Russia's behavior is incredible and particularly perverse given the \nthousands of Russian soldiers who were victims of chemical weapon \nattacks in World War I. In May 1915 alone, Russian soldiers on the \nEastern Front suffered 9,000 casualties--1,000 of them fatalities--as a \nresult of German chemical weapons.\n  Today I was in the airport in Chicago, and the news was flashing \nabout an overture made by President Putin to try to put an end to this \ncontroversy. I, of course, salute and applaud any effort to resolve \nthis the right way and verifiable way, and to do it with dispatch.\n  What I understand this proposal to be is that the Syrians will \nsomehow destroy their cache of chemical weapons and, of course, \nforswear never to use them. That would be a good opportunity, but it \nwill be a difficult outcome because investigating with a third party, \nsuch as the United Nations, verifying where these weapons are, removing \nthem from Syria in the midst of a civil war, is particularly \nchallenging. If there is a way to do this diplomatically, safely, and \nto do it in a fashion where we can be certain this type of atrocity \nwill not occur again, we absolutely have a responsibility to pursue it.\n  I don't understand how Russia and China can be signatories to the \n1925 Geneva Protocols and the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical \nWeapons, and then turn around and protect Syria in the Security Council \nof the United Nations. If there is one international agency that should \nbe involved in any major diplomatic effort to resolve this peacefully, \nit should be the United Nations.\n  We should call on Mr. Putin to step forward with the leaders in China \nand say they will work with the Security Council to execute any \ndiplomatic policy that can avoid further military confrontation. Until \nthen, make no mistake, President Putin's proposal today, and the \nactivities we are seeing and hearing from Syria, are a direct result of \nPresident Obama's leadership. He has stepped up--even though it is an \nunpopular position with some in this country--and said we cannot ignore \nthis redline created by the world when it came to chemical weapons. It \nis time for others to stand and join us in stopping the advancement and \nuse of chemical weapons once and for all.\n  I have been listening to this Syria debate, and I cannot say how many \ntimes I have harkened back to that time 12 years ago when we debated \nentering the war in Iraq. It was another one of those votes that come \nalong in the course of a congressional career that keeps you awake at \nnight.\n  I was serving on the Intelligence Committee in the Senate. I sat \nthrough hour after hour of hearings about the suspected weapons of mass \ndestruction in Iraq, but it never came together in a credible way as \nfar as I was concerned. There was such a rush to war 12 years ago. \nTwenty-three of us voted no--22 Democrats and 1 Republican. I can \nrecall the scene. It was late at night, after midnight, right here in \nthe well of the Senate when three of us were left. It was Kent Conrad \nof North Dakota and, of course, from Minnesota our friend, the late \nSenator who served with so much distinction and spoke out so many times \non issues of morals and ethics. We cast the vote no and waited in this \nempty Chamber.\n  I thought about that vote so many times. I think it was the right \nvote to vote no, but there comes a moment in history when we have to \nstand as civilized nations and say to those who are willing to ignore \nthe rules and to break the rules that a line cannot be crossed. I hope \nwe can get that done, and not just for the memory of Senator Wellstone \nand Senator Conrad, but in memory of so many who served here and faced \nthese challenges in the past in our history. I hope we can find a \ndiplomatic solution that will avoid any military use, but I know the \nreason we have reached this point in diplomacy with this Putin overture \nhas more to do with the President being determined to stand for a \nmatter of principle than almost anything else. We have to continue to \nmake it clear that we find it unacceptable to use these chemical \nweapons. We paid a bitter price for the war in Iraq as a nation when we \nwere misled as to weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  I have seen the evidence in briefings of this deadly attack in \nDamascus. I think the evidence is overwhelming and convincing. I think \nat this point many Americans are reluctant to even consider the use of \nmilitary force. So we sat down and drew up a resolution in the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee last week. There are strict limitations \nwithin this resolution about the President's authority and power. He \nhas 60 days to execute a military strategy--if nothing else intervenes, \n60 days. He can extend it 30 days, but even Congress can object to that \nif it wishes. He can use military weapons but only for the purposes \nspecified. No troops on the ground. No troops in combat operations. As \nSenator McCain said yesterday, that will be part of the law. The \nPresident has already said that is his standard as well. So for those \nwho are worried about mission creep and where this might lead us, if, \nGod forbid, we are faced with that possibility, this resolution \nstrictly limits what the President can do.\n  It was about 8 days ago that I got a phone call I will never forget \nat my home in Springfield late on a Sunday night from the President \nhimself. We talked for about half an hour. We talked about a lot of \nthings because we go back a long way. He talked to me about his thought \nprocess and what he is taking under consideration in trying to lead the \nworld in this response to chemical weapons.\n  I was one of the early supporters of this President. I believe in \nhim. I believe in his values. I believe he has been honest with me and \nwith the American people about the situation we face. I know the \noptions are not good. They never are under these circumstances. But I \nalso know that if we turn our backs on this situation, there will be \nsome dictator in Iran or North Korea who will be emboldened to do even \nmore--to perhaps use not just chemical weapons but even nuclear \nweapons. There comes a point when we have to take a stand.\n  I understand when the people I represent across Illinois have said to \nme so many times in the last week: Why is it always the United States? \nWhy is it that we have to be involved in this so many times? Why do we \nhave to be the policemen to the world?\n  Well, there is a basic answer to that. I would like to believe we \nhave values the rest of the world looks up to. Oh, we have stumbled in \nour own history, and we will continue to do so, but we continue to \nfight for those basic values all around the world.\n  Secondly, if someone is in trouble in their country somewhere in the \nworld and they have one 9-1-1 call to make, they pray to God the United \nStates will answer because we have the best military in the world. We \nhave responded to challenges around the world throughout history, and \nseldom do we leave a residual power base behind. We go in, we do the \njob, we come home. That is something we can't say for a lot of nations. \nIt is an awesome responsibility.\n  I think the President is doing the right thing. I think his appeal to \nthe leaders around the world and his appeal to the American people is \nconsistent with our values as a nation.\n  The President doesn't come quickly to war. He is a person who \nunderstands, as I do, the heavy price that has to be paid, and he \nunderstands there are moments when a leader--a commander in chief, a \nperson with the responsibility of protecting his nation in a dangerous \nworld--has to step forth and lead. If the United States did not take \nthis onerous leadership role, I doubt anyone else would have.\n  I take very seriously the President's promise that he won't be \nputting boots on the ground in Syria. I have been to too many funerals \nand visited too many disabled veterans to ever want to see us do that \nagain, except when it is absolutely necessary for America's survival.\n  I think what we are doing this week in the Senate is a step in the \nright direction, and I believe it is a step that can move us toward a \nsafer world. If we can find, because of the President's leadership, a \ndiplomatic response that avoids further military conflict but keeps us \nsafe from these deadly chemical weapons, we should pursue it.\n\n[[Page S6281]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, almost all of this week on the floor of \nthe Senate will be dedicated to one of the most serious, if not the \nmost serious, matters this body ever considers--that of war and peace \nand the question of whether we engage American military assets in \nconflicts across the globe. I am sure I will be back to the floor later \nthis week to speak on that weighty matter. I appreciate the very \npassionate remarks of the Senator from Illinois on this subject.\n  Almost every week over the last several months when the Senate has \nbeen in session, I have come to the floor to talk about another subject \nof life-and-death consequence; that is, the growing number of \nindividuals across this country who have been killed by guns. We are \ngoing to debate life and death on the Senate floor this week as we try \nto figure out what the course of American intervention may or may not \nbe in a place on the other side of the Earth in which far too many \ninnocent people, little babies and adults alike, are being killed. We \nalso need to debate what we are going to do to prevent the fact that \nbabies and teenagers and adults right here in the United States of \nAmerica are being killed. So I have brought this poster down--or a \nvariant of it--a couple of times a month every single month since about \nApril of this year, and it shows a number. The number is a pretty \nsimple number. It represents the number of people in the United States \nwho have been killed by guns since December 14.\n  As we get further away from that date, maybe people forget what it \nis, but in Connecticut we will never, ever forget what that date means. \nDecember 14 is the date on which 20 little 6- and 7-year-old boys and \ngirls were killed inside Sandy Hook Elementary School, along with 6 \nteachers and professionals who protected them, as well as the gunman \nand his mother. Twenty-eight people in all were killed that day. It has \nlit a spark under the American consciousness about this issue, which \nhas frankly been lingering for far too long.\n  Twenty-eight people died in Newtown on December 14, but every day \nacross this country, on average, 30 people die due to homicide from \nguns. So I am back here today to try to tell the stories of just a \nhandful of the 7,907 people who have been killed at the hands of gun \nviolence since December 14. When I started back in April, I think this \nnumber was somewhere around 4,000. It has marched upward and almost \ndoubled since then.\n  This has been a really bad summer in Connecticut. For instance, in \nplaces such as New Haven and Hartford and Bridgeport, we thought we \nwere making some real progress when it came to the number of homicides \nby guns. This summer, unfortunately, we saw far too many, people such \nas Devaante Jackson, 18 years old, who was killed on August 15 of this \nyear in New Haven. He was killed in a driveby shooting while simply \nstanding on a sidewalk just after 8 o'clock on the evening of August \n15. A friend of Devaante's said:\n\n       I don't understand why somebody would do this to him. He's \n     real good. I never knew he had any problems with anybody \n     because he always (got) along with everybody.\n\n  Another friend said:\n\n       He wasn't a bad kid; he was just in the wrong spot at the \n     wrong time . . . everybody should know . . . stop the \n     violence, put the guns down.\n\n  A few days later in Hartford, at the same nightclub, in two separate \nincidents, two young men--Miguel Delgado, age 21, and Brian Simpe, age \n19--were killed. Disputes started in the nightclub and spilled out onto \nthe streets of Hartford--two different disputes, two different \nincidents, and both of these boys were killed.\n  Brian was 19 years old. He graduated from Manchester High School and \nattended Manchester Community College. He worked at ShopRite in order \nto make enough money to go to community college. He wanted to start his \nown business. He was a kid who wanted to do something great with his \nlife. Before he headed out that night, he tweeted, ``Just another \nsummer night out.'' Unfortunately, in places such as Hartford and New \nHaven and Bridgeport and Baltimore and Chicago and Los Angeles, this is \njust another summer night out. Too many people are being killed simply \nas a result of common disputes, this time happening in a nightclub in \nHartford.\n  Domestic violence, as we know, unfortunately, often leads to tragic \nhomicidal incidents. Janice Lesco, from Coventry, CT, died on August \n24--just a few weeks ago--from a gunshot wound to the chest. Her \nhusband, who shot her, then committed suicide. Her husband had a well-\ndocumented and decade-long history of threats and abuse. Ms. Lesco was \na mother and a grandmother. She had lived in Coventry for most of her \nlife.\n  Luckily, in Connecticut we have an agreement that people who have a \nhistory of domestic violence shouldn't get their hands on a gun, but \nthey can if they walk into a gun show or if they buy their gun on the \nInternet. We can't simply make the decision here that if a person buys \na gun online or a person buys a gun at a gun show, they should be \nstopped from doing so if they have a history of domestic violence.\n  Frankly, I was struck by this one newspaper article describing one \nnight in New Haven. This is even earlier--on August 11, 2013. It starts \nby talking about Torrance Dawkins, a 22-year-old Waterbury man who was \ncelebrating his birthday in a New Haven nightclub when he was shot and \nkilled at about 1:30 on August 11.\n  The article goes on and sort of casually says that later that day New \nHaven police responded to more gun violence. A local rapper was putting \nup sheets on an upcoming concert he was going to be holding in town, \nand he suffered a single gunshot wound to his neck. Davon Goodwin, who \nwas 18 years old, was later that day shot in the thigh on Hamilton \nStreet. And just before 5 p.m. that day, police were called to an area \nnear Dixwell Avenue and found out that Jermaine Adams, 41, had received \na gunshot wound to his face. Those last three people miraculously \nsurvived. But we can see how casual gun violence can be on a summer \nSunday in New Haven, CT. One young man died as a consequence of a \ndispute at a nightclub, and three other people luckily survived who \nwere shot later in the day.\n  Every single day in this country--in the United States of America--30 \npeople are dying due to gun violence. Almost 8,000 people have died \nsince the tragedy in Sandy Hook, and this body has done nothing to stop \nit. We have had commonsense legislation before this Senate that would \njust say: You know what. If you have a criminal history, you should not \nbe able to buy a gun, no matter where you buy it--at a gun show, from a \ngun dealer, online.\n  We have had commonsense bipartisan legislation on the floor saying: \nYou know what. It should be a crime to buy a whole mess-load of guns \nfrom a gun store and then go out and intentionally sell them to \ncriminals. We cannot get that passed either.\n  We even tried to just say: Let's beef up our mental health system to \nmake sure people who have serious mental illnesses get the treatment \nthey need so they do not resort to violence--the very few who do. That \nwas part of the bill we could not get passed.\n  So I am going to continue to come down to the floor to give voices to \nthese victims, to talk about the real people, the stories behind the \ndozens of people who are killed every day by guns and the 8,000 people \nwho have been killed since Sandy Hook. We are going to make an \nimportant decision this week about whether we are going to commit \nmilitary assets to the Middle East, and maybe that debate will stretch \ninto next week and the week after. But we should not forget that while \npeople are dying overseas, people are dying due to gun violence right \nhere in the United States, and before it is too late--before another \n8,000 people\n\n[[Page S6282]]\n\ndie from guns in this country--we should do something about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, we come to this Chamber as we have many \ntimes before--to make one of the most difficult decisions we are tasked \nto make: the authorization of the use of American military power--this \ntime in Syria, to respond to the horrific attack, including the use of \nchemical weapons, of August 21 that took the lives of 1,429 Syrians, \nincluding at least 426 children.\n  The world is watching, America is waiting to see what we do in this \nChamber in response to the threat the world faces from those who cross \nthe line of human decency and use chemical weapons against anyone, \nanywhere in the world.\n  The images of August 21 were sickening and, in my view, the world \ncannot ignore the inhumanity and horror of what Bashar al-Asad did.\n  As I have had to say too many times before as a Member of Congress: I \ndo not take the responsibility to authorize military force lightly or \nmake such decisions easily. I voted against the war in Iraq when it was \npopular, according to the polls, to vote for the war and strongly \nsupported the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. But today I \nurge my colleagues to support this tightly crafted, clearly focused \nresolution to give the President authorization to use military force in \nthe face of this horrific crime against humanity.\n  Yes, there are clearly risks to any action we authorize, but the \nconsequences of inaction--the consequences of standing down from fully \nupholding the norms of international behavior--are greater and graver \nstill: further humanitarian disaster in Syria, regional instability, \nthe loss of American credibility around the world, an emboldened Iran \nand North Korea, and the disintegration of international law.\n  This vote will be among the most difficult any of us will be asked to \nmake. But the American people expect us to make the hard decisions and \ntake the hard votes. They expect us to put aside political differences \nand personal ideologies, forget partisanship and preconceptions, forget \nthe polls and personal consequences.\n  This is a moment for a profile in courage--a moment for each of us to \ndo what we know is right--based on what we know is in the best interest \nof the United States, regardless of the polls or pontifications of \npolitical pundits.\n  To be clear, the authorization Senator Corker and I seek is for \nfocused action, with a clear understanding that American troops will \nnot be on the ground in combat.\n  We have worked closely to put politics aside, weigh the facts, search \nour consciences, and pass a resolution in committee that we believe is \nin the national security interest of the American people.\n  I have said before and will say again: This is not a declaration of \nwar but a declaration of our values to the world.\n  I want to thank Senator Corker for being a close partner in helping \nto tailor and focus the language of this resolution so it reflects the \nwill of the committee, the interests of the American people, and gives \nthe President the authority he needs to respond to Syria's use of \nchemical weapons against its own people.\n  What we know. What we know is clear, notwithstanding Asad's interview \nand his denials.\n  According to the declassified intelligence assessment, we know--with \nhigh confidence--that the Syrian Government carried out a chemical \nweapons attack in the Damascus suburbs on August 21.\n  We know that the buck stops with Asad--his interview-denials aside. \nWe know that he controls the regime's stockpiles of chemical agents, \nincluding mustard, sarin, and VX gas, and has thousands of munitions \ncapable of delivering them, again, under his control.\n  It is inconceivable--and defies all logic--that he would not know \nabout the preparations and deployment of these horrific weapons.\n  We know that personnel involved in the program are carefully vetted \nto ensure loyalty to the regime and the security of the program.\n  We know that chemical weapons personnel from the Syrian Scientific \nStudies and Research Center, subordinate to the regime's Ministry of \nDefense, were operating in the Damascus suburb of `Adra from Sunday, \nAugust 18 until early in the morning on Wednesday August 21 near an \narea the regime uses to mix chemical weapons including sarin.\n  Human intelligence, as well as signal and geospatial intelligence \nhave shown regime activity in the preparation of chemicals prior to the \nattack, including the distribution and use of gas masks.\n  Some may still be skeptical about Asad's direct involvement, but \nclearly the buck stops with Asad when it comes to the use of these \nweapons.\n  Some may also be skeptical that we have not done enough to allow \ndiplomacy to work, but the fact is we have tried diplomacy. We have \ngone to the UN on many occasions, and it has only bought Asad more \ntime.\n  Notwithstanding Russia's belated offer today to take action, which, \nby the way, only be on the table today specifically because of the \nthreat of the use of force, let us not forget it has been their \nintransigence that brought us to this point in the first place.\n  The fact is, on August 28, a week after the attack, Russia blocked a \nUN Security Council resolution that called ``for all necessary \nmeasures'' to be taken, and simply called for any state that used \nchemical weapons to be held accountable.\n  On the day of the attack, August 21, Russia blocked a Security \nCouncil press statement simply expressing ``concern'' that chemical \nweapons might have been used.\n  On August 6, Russia blocked another press statement welcoming the \nnews that a UN investigations team would investigate three sites, and \ncalling for their full and fettered access to those sites.\n  Russia has also vetoed a Security Council resolution enshrining the \nJune 30 Geneva Communique brokered by Kofi Annan, vetoed a resolution \ncalling for an end to violence in Syria, vetoed a draft resolution \nendorsing the Arab League's plan of action that would have condemned \nhuman rights violations.\n  They blocked a press statement calling for humanitarian access to the \nbesieged city of Homs, and one calling for Syrian authorities to \nprovide the UN with humanitarian access.\n  Over the course of the conflict in Syria, the United States \nGovernment, specifically the State Department, has met consistently \nwith its close allies and partners, as well as with Syria's neighbors, \nto help prepare the region to detect, prevent, and respond to potential \nuse or proliferation of chemical weapons.\n  As Ambassador Power acknowledged in her remarks at the Center for \nAmerican Progress on September 6, the United States has regularly \nengaged with the Russians and Iranians to attempt to get them to use \ntheir influence to stop the Asad regime from using chemical weapons.\n  The same day, September 6, the United States and 10 other countries \nissued a joint statement condemning the Asad regime's use of chemical \nweapons. They were: Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the \nRepublic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey, and Great Britain. \nSince then 14 other nations have also signed onto that statement: \nAlbania, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Honduras, Hungary, Kosovo, \nLatvia, Lithuania, Morocco, Qatar, Romania, and the United Arab \nEmirates.\n  It is only the threat by the President, and this resolution, that \nwould drive both Russia and Syria to the negotiating table.\n  The facts are clear. We have tried diplomacy.\n  Let us understand that this action is not a choice of force or \ndiplomacy. It is about both.\n  It is about enforcing international norms that will, at the end of \nthe day, leverage necessary UN action and help bring about a political \nsolution.\n  For those who want to see UN Security Council action, those who want \nto\n\n[[Page S6283]]\n\npush Syria to sign a chemical weapons agreement and give up their \nweapons, this resolution is the best path to getting there.\n  Let me say to my colleagues who believe that the authorization of the \nuse of military force will be nothing more than a pin-pick. This \nresolution will have clear and verifiable consequences.\n  It will help keep these weapons in check, degrade Asad's ability to \ndeploy them, and prevent the proliferation of chemical weapons and \ntheir use by anyone, anywhere in the world.\n  The resolution will have clear consequences, but it is also not open-\nended.\n  It appropriately narrows the scope, duration, and breadth of the \nauthority granted to meet Congressional concerns, and the concerns of \nthe American people.\n  It is tightly tailored to give the President ``necessary and \nappropriate'' authority to use military force to respond to the use of \nweapons of mass destruction by the Syrian government; protect the \nnational security interests of the United States and our allies and \npartners; and degrade Syria's capacity to use such weapons in the \nfuture.\n  It has a requirement for determination that the use of military force \nis necessary, that appropriate diplomatic and other peaceful means to \nprevent the deployment and use of chemical weapons by Syria have been \nused, and that the United States has both a specific military plan to \nachieve the goal of responding to the use of weapons of mass \ndestruction by the Syrian government and that the use of military force \nis consistent with the broader goals of U.S. strategy toward Syria, \nincluding achieving a negotiated settlement to the conflict, and a \nlimitation that specifies that the resolution ``does not authorize the \nuse of United States Armed Forces on the ground in Syria for the \npurposes of combat operations'' assuring there will be no ``boots on \nthe ground.''\n  The authorization would end after 60 days, with the President having \nthe ability to request and certify for another 30 days, and with \nCongress having an opportunity to pass a resolution of disapproval. It \nprovides for an integrated United States Government strategy for Syria, \nincluding a comprehensive review of current and planned U.S. \ndiplomatic, political, economic and military policy towards Syria, and \nrequires a Report to Congress on the status of the military operations. \nI know my colleagues on both sides will want to offer a range of \namendments.\n  Let me say in conclusion, history has taught us harsh lessons when it \ncomes to the use of chemical weapons.\n  The images we saw of children lined on the floor on August 21 were \nnot the first images the world has ever seen of the horrors of chemical \nattacks.\n  We saw them almost 100 years ago in World War I.\n  If we do not learn from and live by the lessons of the past, if we \nfail the test of history then we are destined and doomed to repeat it.\n  If we allow the use and proliferation of chemical weapons despite the \nworld's horror at the gruesome and horrific use of mustard gas, \nphosgene, and chlorine at the beginning of last century, then we risk \nthe same horrors again in this century.\n  Let us not fail the test of history.\n  Let us say to the world that we cannot allow anyone to use chemical \nweapons again, and that we can never allow such weapons to fall into \nthe hands of stateless-actors and terrorists who would unleash them \nagainst America or American interests around the world.\n  I repeat what I said earlier: Let us understand that this action is \nnot about force or diplomacy. It is about both. It is about enforcing \ninternational norms that will, at the end of the day, leverage \nnecessary UN action and help bring about a political solution.\n  For those who want to see UN Security Council action, those who want \nto push Syria to sign a chemical weapons agreement and give up their \nweapons, this is the best path to getting there.\n  Make no mistake, the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime \nultimately represents a national security threat to the United States, \na global security threat we cannot ignore.\n  Let me read what our former colleague and respected Chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar, recently said in the press: \n``We are talking about weapons of mass destruction. We are talking \nabout chemical weapons in particular which may be the greatest threat \nto our country of any security risk we have--much more than any other \ngovernment, or another nation--because they can be used by terrorists, \nby very small groups.\n  The use of those weapons has got to concern us to the point that we \ntake action whenever any country crosses that line and use these \nweapons as we have seen in Syria.''\n  Senator Lugar is right. We must be concerned--deeply concerned--and \nthat is why we must act. The danger of proliferation is too great--too \nmuch of a risk--for us to stand silent and stand down.\n  I urge my colleagues to put aside politics, polls, and preconceptions \nand do what we know, at the end of the day, is in the national security \nof the American people.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Corker and members of the committee \nfor working quickly together to respond to this crisis with a well-\ncrafted resolution that is a declaration of our values and will send a \nclear message that we--and the world--cannot and will not tolerate the \nuse of chemical weapons anywhere--by anyone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman for his \ncomments for a historical analysis of what has occurred and his \ncomments regarding our ability to work together. I do wish to reiterate \na point that the chairman made partially through his comments. I do not \nthink any of us know at this time whether the offers that today have \nbeen made from Russia and responses that have been given from Syria, I \ndo not think we have any idea whether there is credibility at present.\n  What I do know is there would be absolutely zero conversation about \nthat had our committee not passed an authorization out on a 10-to-7 \nvote and if we were not taking this up this week. So I wish to commend \nthe chairman for his leadership on this issue. I have enjoyed working \nwith him. I have enjoyed working with him on all the issues relative to \nSyria and all the other things we have done in a bipartisan way.\n  I think it has been the tradition--I know it has been the tradition \nof this body, when it comes to issues beyond our shorelines, to set \naside partisanship, as was mentioned a moment ago, and do things that \nare in the best interests of our Nation. There is nothing more \nimportant that each Member of this body will take up than the \nauthorization for the use of military force. I sensed it the other day \nin our committee. I have sensed it with those whom I have talked to \nsince. Each Member is looking at this with a sense of humility and \nsoberness. I truly believe it is up to each Member to make this \ndecision.\n  I will say the issues of Syria are something I am familiar with. I \nhave traveled to the region, as I know the chairman and many others \nhave. I have traveled three times this year. I wrote an op-ed in the \nNew York Times in April regarding what our response to Syria should be. \nOur committee thankfully passed, on a 15-to-3 vote on May 21, with the \nchairman's leadership, the Syria Transition Support Act.\n  This was to support the vetted moderate opposition and require the \nadministration to develop a comprehensive strategy. I know Members of \nthis body know I support this authorization. I helped write it with the \nchairman. I am very comfortable with my position in supporting this and \nbelieve what we have done with this authorization we have done in the \nright and correct way.\n  I will say I have been very dismayed at the administration's lack of \nresponse after stating publicly that they were going to support the \nvetted moderate opposition in certain ways. I have been very frustrated \nat the response and the lack of support in that way. As I mentioned, I \nwas just in the area 3 weeks ago. I visited the same refugee camp in \nTurkey on the Syrian border and in Jordan on the Syrian border. I saw \nsome of the same refugees whom I saw there less than 1 year ago.\n  Candidly, I am dismayed we have not supported the vetted opposition \nin a better way. I know we have urged out of our committee that we have \na much\n\n[[Page S6284]]\n\nmore comprehensive strategy. I wish that bill had come to the floor. I \nwish the Senate had taken action. But, candidly, I also am dismayed \nthis administration has not taken action to do something in a more \ncomprehensive way.\n  No question the introduction of chemical weapons has changed the \ndynamic tremendously. I think the chairman was very articulate in \nexplaining why this is important. I wish to say to everybody in this \nbody, to me an equally important issue for our Nation is the \ncredibility of the United States of America. I believe our President, \nwhether you support him, whether you like him, I believe the President \nspoke for our Nation when he established a red line some months ago \nregarding the use of chemical weapons.\n  I believe it is very important for our Nation's credibility in the \nregion and in the world that we have an appropriate response when we \nhave a dictator such as Asad take the actions he has taken against \ninternational norms the way he has but especially when the Commander in \nChief of our Nation has spoken the way he has about this issue. To me \nthis is twofold. Certainly, it is about the international norms that \nhave been spoken to eloquently by many, but to me it is also an issue \nof this Nation's credibility of the response as people are looking on \nto what we are going to do.\n  That is why I support this authorization. I do wish to go back over a \ncouple points the chairman referred to relative to the substance of the \nauthorization. I think most people know the White House sent over an \nauthorization that to me was very broad. It did not define what we were \ngoing to do in a specific way.\n  I know the chairman just talked about the fact that this \nauthorization is tailored. It is specific. Let me go over again \nspecifically what this authorization does. It is specific purposes \nonly: to respond to the use of weapons of mass destruction to dissuade \nfuture use, degrade ability, and to prevent transfer, no boots on the \nground for combat operations.\n  I know there have been some discussions about that in our committee. \nVery emphatically, this authorization eliminates and keeps any boots on \nthe ground for combat operations from occurring.\n  This has a time limit of 60 days with a 30-day extension which \nCongress can disapprove. It is geographically limited to Syria only, \nwhich the original authorization was not. It is against legitimate \nmilitary targets only, which again the original authorization was not.\n  There are a series of determinations the President has to make prior \nto taking action with this authorization, including that it is in the \ncore national interests of the United States and that he has a military \nplan to achieve the objectives.\n  In addition, this authorization requires a comprehensive strategy for \na negotiated end to this conflict.\n  I wish to refer to something else the chairman mentioned; that is, \nthe type of activity. I know there have been a number of editorial \ncomments in papers and publications around the country referring to \nthis as a pinprick. There have been other concerns by Members of this \nbody as to the duration of this effort, as to how long it will be.\n  I have had the privilege, because of the position I serve in on the \nForeign Relations Committee, to be involved in multiple phone calls and \npersonal meetings. There was one last night that lasted at great length \nwith the President and Vice President.\n  I wish to say to every person in this body, I have no belief \nwhatsoever that if military action is taken, it is going to be a \npinprick--none. The American military has incredible ability to deal \nwith issues in a forceful way but also do so in a very short timeframe.\n  I do believe, based on the many meetings we have had, both with \nmilitary and civilian leadership, that to characterize what is proposed \nas a pinprick or to characterize what is proposed as inserting \nourselves into a long-term civil war, I think both of those \ncharacterizations are wrong.\n  Obviously, one of the dilemmas people here deal with is that we write \npolicy and then it is up to the administration to carry that out--and \nno question, none of us will be involved in the direct carrying out. \nBut it is my firm belief that there is not a thread of thinking by the \nadministration that what they are considering is a pinprick.\n  On the other hand, I have not a thread of thought that they are also \nconsidering doing something that is going to involve us in a long-term \ncivil war. Obviously, conflicts such as this are complex.\n  In closing, let me say this. Each Senator has to make their own \ndecision. This is one of those things where lobbying is not something \nthat is going to make up the minds of Senators. I think each Senator \nhas to make up their own hearts and minds.\n  What I can say is we are going to have an open process. I know we \nhave talked about the process going forward. I hope Senators will keep \ntheir amendments germane. I hope we have a sober debate about an issue \nthat is the most important type of decision any Senator will make.\n  I am thrilled the President decided to come to Congress for an \nauthorization. I know a lot of people have made many comments regarding \nthis. Candidly, I am pleased the President has come to us for a debate. \nIt is my hope the Senate, after hearing the facts and after having a \nthoughtful debate, will approve the authorization for the use of \nmilitary force.\n  I couldn't agree more with the chairman that if people wish to see a \ndiplomatic solution--which is the only way we are going to end this \nconflict--I do not think this conflict ends militarily. I believe we \nhave learned a lot from the last two episodes we have been through.\n  I believe it is important for us to have this authorization because I \nbelieve it is the only thing at this point, the fact that we passed it \nout of committee, the fact that it is on the floor, that might possibly \nlead to a diplomatic settlement.\n  I also believe it is time for the President to lead. I know there \nhave been a lot of statements over the last week, and the President had \nmultiple audiences in which to speak. I understand this, and I \nunderstand reports out of these meetings can come in many ways not to \nbe accurate.\n  The President is coming to the Hill tomorrow. He will be making a \nmajor speech to the United States, the citizens of our country, \ntomorrow night. I know many of them have lives, where all of them, most \nof them, get up in the mornings, go to work, they raise their families, \nand they haven't had the opportunity to spend as much time on these \nissues. That is why we are elected to do this.\n  I will say this. It is very important for the President of the United \nStates to come to Congress and for the President of the United States \nto make his case to the American people.\n  He is asking for this authorization. I believe it is important for us \nto give him this authorization.\n  Again, I wish to thank the chairman for working with us to make sure \nwe have narrowed this authorization in such a way that I think it meets \nthe test of what the American people and what all of us wish to see \nhappen. But I do believe now it is up to the President, over the next \nseveral days and this week, to make his case to the American people as \nto why the Senate should give him this authorization for the use of \nmilitary force, which I hope we will do.\n  I thank you for the time, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/09/senate-section/article/S6284-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6284-S6287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF VALERIE E.

BRODERICK TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                 FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnominations, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nominations of Valerie E. \nCaproni,\n\n[[Page S6285]]\n\nof the District of Columbia, to be United States District Judge for the \nSouthern District of New York, and Vernon S. Broderick, of New York, to \nbe United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes for debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask that all time during this debate on the Executive \nCalendar be equally divided on both sides and any quorum call that is \ncalled be equally divided as well in terms of charging time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we will be voting on just 2 of the 11 \ndistrict and circuit nominees left pending on the Senate floor prior to \nthe August recess. Ten of these nominees had been reported by voice \nvote, and there was no good reason we could not have confirmed them \nthen and allowed them to get to work on behalf of the American people. \nI hope that Senate Republicans will not seek to drag out the nominees \nwho will be left pending on the floor after today, as they did for the \nnominations left pending at the end of last year. It took us until May \nof this year to confirm 9 of the 10 circuit and district nominations \nthat were ready for votes last year, and it will likely take us another \nmonth or two to work our way through this new backlog.\n  One effect of this obstruction is that for the first time in nearly 2 \nyears, our Federal district courts are again facing what the \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service calls ``historically high'' \nvacancies. This could have been avoided if Senate Republicans had \nsimply followed Senate tradition and allowed votes on the nine \nconsensus district nominees before the recess.\n  The Republicans' effort to obstruct and delay the confirmations of \nnominees means that over the course of President Obama's administration \nthe number of judicial vacancies nearly doubled. In January 2009, there \nwere 53 Federal district and appellate court vacancies. Today, there \nare 94 Federal district and appellate court vacancies--37 of which have \nbeen designated as judicial emergency vacancies by the nonpartisan \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts. This is unacceptable. We have \nthe nominees we need to make progress, but we do not have the consent \nwe need from Senate Republicans.\n  Republicans have argued that we do not need to pick up the pace of \nconfirming Federal judges, because we have confirmed more of President \nObama's nominees than at the same point in 2005, the fifth year of \nGeorge W. Bush's Presidency. The facts tell a different story. \nPresident Bush made just 5 new circuit and district nominations in \n2005, compared to 43 new circuit and district nominations by President \nObama this year. With more nominees to consider, it only makes sense \nthat we have held more hearings and confirmed more judges this year \nthan in 2005.\n  Today the Senate will vote on the nominations of Valerie Caproni and \nVernon Broderick to fill vacancies in the Southern District of New \nYork. Since the time of her nomination until today, the seat to which \nMs. Caproni is nominated has been added to the list of judicial \nemergency vacancies by the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the \nCourts. Ms. Caproni is currently vice president and deputy general \ncounsel for Northrop Grumman Corporation. She has served the public in \nvarious capacities, including as General Counsel of the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation from 2003 to 2011, as Regional Director of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission's Pacific Regional Office from 1998 \nto 2001, and as a Federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office for \nthe Eastern District of New York from both 1985 to 1992 and 1998 to \n2001. During her tenure as a Federal prosecutor, she served as Chief of \nthe Criminal Division, Chief of the Organized Crime & Racketeering \nUnit, and Chief of the Special Prosecutions Unit. Ms. Caproni also has \nextensive experience in private practice, having served as counsel in \nthe New York office of Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett and as an associate \nat the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore. Following law school, Ms. \nCaproni clerked for the Honorable Phyllis Kravitch of the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\n  Mr. Broderick has split his career between Weil, Gotshal & Manges \nLLP, where he is currently a partner and was previously counsel and an \nassociate, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of \nNew York, where he was an assistant U.S. attorney. A graduate of Yale \nUniversity and Harvard Law School, Mr. Broderick has extensive \nexperience in Federal court. He has also tried 11 jury cases to \nverdict. Since he was appointed in 2003 by Mayor Bloomberg, Mr. \nBroderick has served on the Commission to Combat Police Corruption.\n  Both nominees have the support of their home State Senators, Senator \nSchumer and Senator Gillibrand. Both nominees were also unanimously \nrated ``well qualified'' by the nonpartisan ABA Standing Committee on \nthe Federal Judiciary, its highest rating. They were reported by the \nJudiciary Committee by voice vote nearly 3 months ago.\n  I hope the Senate moves to confirm these nominees, but reducing \nFederal judicial vacancies from 94 to 92 is not enough. It is well past \ntime for the Senate to get serious about giving our Federal courts the \nresources they need to provide justice for the American people. In July \nthe Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Bankruptcy and the Courts \nheld a hearing on the impact of sequestration that highlighted the \ndamage that these senseless cuts are doing to our justice system. \nTomorrow, Senator Coons will chair another hearing in that subcommittee \nto evaluate the judgeship needs of Federal courts across the country \nand hear testimony on the Coons-Leahy Federal Judgeship Act of 2013, \nwhich would implement the judicial conference's recommendations for \ndesperately needed new judgeships. I hope that Senators from both sides \nof the aisle will support this bill, which is based on what judges \nacross the Nation believe they need to administer justice effectively. \nAddressing the resources of a coequal branch of our government should \nnot be politicized. We need to end sequestration and act responsibly in \naddressing the staffing needs of our justice system so that it can \ncontinue to serve the American people and be a model for other \ncountries.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will not support the nomination \nValerie E. Caproni to be U.S. District Judge for the Southern District \nof New York. However, I expect that she will likely be confirmed, as \nwill Mr. Broderick. These will be the 30th and 31st judicial \nconfirmations this year. With today's confirmations, the Senate will \nhave confirmed 202 lower court nominees; we have defeated 2. That is \n202-2 for President Obama. That is an outstanding record. That is a \nsuccess rate of 99 percent. I think we have had a pretty outstanding \nrecord this Congress.\n  And we have been doing that at a fast pace. During the last Congress \nwe confirmed more judges than any Congress since the 103rd Congress, \nwhich was 1993-94.\n  So far this year, the first of President Obama's second term, we have \nalready confirmed more judges than were confirmed in the entire first \nyear of President Bush's second term.\n  At a similar stage in President Bush's second term, only 10 judicial \nnominees had been confirmed. So we are now at a 31 to 10 comparison, \nwith President Obama clearly ahead of where President Bush was at a \nsimilar time frame.\n  And, as I said, we have already confirmed more nominees this year--\n31--than we did during the entirety of 2005, the first year of \nPresident Bush's second term, when 21 lower court judges were \nconfirmed.\n  So I just wanted to set the record straight--again--before we vote on \nthese nominations.\n  I also want to explain why I oppose the confirmation of Ms. Caproni. \nFrom 2003 to 2011, she served as the General Counsel of the Federal \nBureau of Investigation. During that time, she was involved in the \nnational security letters--NSL--program at the FBI. This program was \nthe subject of a report by the Office of Inspector General--OIG--within \nthe Department of Justice--DOJ, published in 2010.\n  In that report, the FBI was criticized for its role in the potential \nabuse by the FBI's use of national security letters. The report also \ndetailed her office's knowledge of the use of exigent\n\n[[Page S6286]]\n\nletters to short-circuit the NSL process. The IG also found problems \nregarding the inaccurate reporting of NSLs.\n  When the Committee reported out her nomination earlier this year, I \nvoiced my concern over the fact that I had made a request to the FBI \nover 6 years ago, asking for documents regarding exigent letters.\n  In March 2007, Chairman Leahy and I requested copies of unclassified \nemails related to the use of national security letters issued by the \nFBI. I only received a few of these emails, and they were heavily \nredacted, so in 2008 I asked for the rest.\n  Ms. Caproni was general counsel of the FBI at the time and told me \nthat the documents I was waiting for were on her desk, awaiting her \nreview. Well, in 2013 as we approached her hearing, I still had not \nreceived those documents.\n  I asked Ms. Caproni about this in her hearing and she had no specific \nrecollection of this request. So, I asked her again in writing. This \nled to a set of FOIA documents being produced, which are a poor \nsubstitute for properly answering a Committee request. It also raises \nfurther questions as to why it took 6 years and why Ms. Caproni told me \nyears ago that she was working on responding to our request.\n  I subsequently followed up with the FBI with specific requests \nregarding Ms. Caproni's involvement in the matter. The FBI has not \nresponded to my requests.\n  I also made requests from the DOJ Inspector General. While the IG did \nmake some materials available to me, there are outstanding requests to \nwhich they have not responded.\n  At issue is the correspondence between Ms. Caproni and OIG about the \nOIG's draft report. These are not ``internal documents'' as the IG has \nclaimed which relate to the internal deliberative process of the OIG. \nThey are not ``internal'' communications because the Inspector \nGeneral's office is supposed to be separate and independent from the \nFBI, and Ms. Caproni was the FBI's counsel.\n  They are, however, a critical component required both for oversight \nof the underlying program as well as to ensure that the back-and-forth \nbetween an independent IG and the agency is transparent and arms-\nlength.\n  At the time we reported her nomination out of Committee, I stated \nthat while I would not hold her nomination in Committee, I reserved my \nright to do so on the Senate floor. So now, even though I have \nconsented to the vote going forward, I will not support the nomination.\n  Ms. Caproni received her B.A. at Tulane in 1976 and her J.D. from the \nUniversity of Georgia School of Law in 1979. Upon graduation, she \nclerked for 1 year for the Honorable Phyllis Kravitch, United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Following her clerkship, she \nentered private practice as a civil litigator for Cravath, Swaine & \nMoore focusing on defense work on behalf of large companies primarily \nwith respect to libel, antitrust, and securities matters. She was in \nthis position from 1980 to 1985.\n  In 1985 Ms. Caproni became an Assistant U.S. Attorney where she \nprosecuted a number of narcotics and other criminal cases. In 1989, Ms. \nCaproni became the General Counsel of the Urban Development Corp--now \nEmpire State Development. There her primary responsibility was to \nprovide legal advice to the executives and directors of the \ncorporation, focusing on administrative law, banking and bankruptcy \nlaw, environmental and land use, real estate, and products liability. \nShe returned to the U.S. Attorney's Office in 1992 where she prosecuted \ncriminal cases and became part of the administration of the Criminal \nDivision. She served as Chief of the Criminal Division from 1994 to \n1998. In 1998 Ms. Caproni became the regional director of the SEC's \nPacific Regional Office where she worked on enforcement of Federal \nsecurities laws.\n  From 2001 to 2003, she returned to private practice at Simpson \nThacher & Bartlett where she worked on white collar criminal defense. \nAfter this she became General Counsel of the FBI where her primary \nresponsibility was to provide legal advice to executive management. She \nserved there from 2003 to 2011.\n  In 2011 Ms. Caproni was hired by Northrop Grumman to be vice \npresident and deputy general counsel where she remains today. She is \ncurrently responsible for supervision of all litigation and internal \ninvestigations, specializing in civil litigation and investigations and \nsetting strategy in cases and investigations that affect the \ncorporation. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary gave \nher a unanimous ``Well Qualified'' rating.\n  Vernon S. Broderick is also nominated to be U.S. District Judge for \nthe Southern District of New York. Mr. Broderick received his B.A. from \nYale University in 1985 and his J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1988. \nUpon graduation, he joined Weil, Gotshal & Manges as an associate. His \npractice there mainly focused on civil litigation, specifically large \ncommercial disputes that involved breach of contract, products \nliability, patent and bankruptcy.\n  In 1994, he joined the United States Attorney's Office, first in the \nGeneral Crimes Unit, then in the Narcotics Unit and the Violent Gangs \nUnit. He was Chief of the Violent Gangs Unit from 1999-2002.\n  Mr. Broderick rejoined Weil, Gotshal & Manges as a Counsel in 2002 \nand was made a Partner in 2005. His practice focused on white collar \ncriminal investigations and prosecutions, regulatory investigations and \nproceedings, and business litigation. The ABA Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary gave him a unanimous ``Well Qualified'' rating.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. In view of the fact I don't see any Members at this \npoint, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to support Valerie Caproni for U.S. district judge \nfor New York's Southern District. I know Ms. Caproni to be a woman with \nimpeccable credentials, incredible intellect, and the kind of fair-\nminded judgment we need on the Federal bench.\n  Ms. Caproni serves as vice president and general counsel for Northrop \nGrumman Corporation, where she leads all aspects of litigation. Ms. \nCaproni joined Northrop Grumman from her former position as general \ncounsel to the FBI, a position Director Robert Mueller personally asked \nMs. Caproni to serve in, in the wake of the horrific attacks of \nSeptember 11. Ms. Caproni knows full well the task at hand for the FBI \nis never easy--from protecting America from terror and other attacks--a \nbalance of defending our civil liberties and civil rights. But as she \nputs it:\n\n       They always strive to do the right thing, and to maintain \n     as a loadstar fealty to the Constitution and the rule of law.\n\n  That is what Ms. Caproni believes to her very core.\n  Ms. Caproni also served in the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nwhere she enforced regulatory programs in the nine-State Pacific \nregion. She and her staff strengthened cooperation between the SEC and \nthe U.S. Attorney's Offices to crack down on financial fraud.\n  Ms. Caproni also served as Chief of the Criminal Division for the \nU.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York and in \nprivate practice at several top firms.\n  Through her breadth of experience, her talent, her intellect, and her \nstrong character, I know Ms. Caproni will be an outstanding jurist.\n  I strongly believe this country needs more women such as she serving \nin the Federal Judiciary, an institution that I believe needs more \nexceptional women.\n  I have no doubt that having Ms. Caproni serve in the Federal \nJudiciary will bring us closer to achieving that goal of a Federal \njudiciary that reflects our Nation.\n  I was honored to recommend her for this position, and I urge all my \ncolleagues to vote in support of her confirmation.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of another outstanding New \nYorker, Vernon Broderick, to also be a U.S. district judge for the \nSouthern District of New York.\n  Mr. Broderick served as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern \nDistrict\n\n[[Page S6287]]\n\nof New York, where he helped protect New Yorkers by prosecuting cases \ninvolving organized crime, international narcotics trafficking, and \nviolent crimes. I urge the Senate to vote in full support of Mr. \nBroderick's nomination.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the nomination of \nValerie Caproni to serve as a judge on the U.S. District Court for the \nSouthern District of New York.\n  When the Senate Judiciary Committee considered Ms. Caproni's \nnomination on June 13 and reported her nomination out of committee, I \nasked to be recorded as a ``pass'' on the vote. I did so because I \nwanted to meet in person with Ms. Caproni to discuss matters that she \nworked on when she served as general counsel of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation from 2003 to 2011.\n  During Ms. Caproni's tenure, the FBI adopted controversial new \ninvestigative policies and implemented sweeping new surveillance \nauthorities granted by the USA PATRIOT Act.\n  For example, revised Attorney General's guidelines for FBI \ninvestigations and the FBI's Domestic Investigations and Operations \nGuide allow the FBI to conduct ``assessments'' using intrusive \nsurveillance techniques on innocent Americans with no indication of \nwrongdoing or other factual predicate. And while the Justice \nDepartment's ``Guidance Regarding the Use of Race by Federal Law \nEnforcement Agencies'' prohibits the use of profiling by Federal law \nenforcement in ``traditional law enforcement activities,'' this ban \ndoes not apply to profiling based on religion and national origin, and \nit does not apply to national security and border security \ninvestigations.\n  The Justice Department's Inspector General concluded that the FBI was \nguilty of ``widespread and serious misuse'' of the National Security \nLetter authority when Ms. Caproni was general counsel. Also during Ms. \nCaproni's tenure, the FBI interpreted section 215 of the PATRIOT Act to \npermit the collection of noncontent ``metadata'' on every phone call of \nevery American, including the numbers of both callers and the time and \nduration of the call.\n  As general counsel, Ms. Caproni would have been the final word in the \nFBI on the legality of these and all other Bureau activities.\n  As a result of my concerns about Ms. Caproni's involvement in these \nactivities, I asked for her commitment, if confirmed, to recuse herself \nfrom matters on which she had been involved or provided legal advice \nwhile working for the FBI or on which her impartiality might reasonably \nbe questioned.\n  I met in my office with Ms. Caproni on June 25, and on July 8, Ms. \nCaproni sent me a letter memorializing her commitment to recuse herself \nfrom such matters. I appreciated receiving this letter, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  In light of our meeting and Ms. Caproni's commitments to me, I will \nnot oppose her nomination to the district court.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 8, 2013.\n     Hon. Richard Durbin,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: Thank you for the opportunity to meet \n     with you to discuss my nomination as a judge for the United \n     States District Court for the Southern District of New York. \n     It was a pleasure to meet with you and your staff.\n       As I indicated in my Senate Judiciary Committee \n     Questionnaire, if confirmed, I would follow the Code of \n     Conduct for United States Judges, as well as any other \n     applicable ethics rules or federal statutes to resolve any \n     potential conflicts of interest. As I further stated, if I \n     had personal or supervisory involvement in a matter while at \n     the FBI or Northrop Grumman, I would not participate in it as \n     a judge.\n       To follow up on our conversation and to be more specific, \n     as required by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 455, I would recuse myself from \n     any case in which my impartiality could reasonably be \n     questioned. I would certainly recuse myself if I were \n     presented with a case that would require me to rule on the \n     legality of a national security program as to which I \n     provided legal advice while I was a government employee, \n     unless there were controlling precedent already in place \n     regarding such a program. If such precedent did exist, I \n     nonetheless would consider recusal on a case-by-case basis, \n     carefully considering any arguments and consulting with \n     appropriate experts on judicial ethics and, if appropriate, \n     my colleagues. In those cases in which I did not recuse, I \n     would apply controlling law.\n       Please let me know if you have any other questions or \n     matters you would like to discuss.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Valerie Caproni.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN.

Mr. President, tomorrow the President is going to brief the \nDemocratic caucus and the Republican caucus separately. He is going to \naddress the Nation tomorrow night. As we all know, there are \ninternational discussions relevant to the matter in Syria.\n  Normally what I would do in a situation such as this is file cloture \ntoday, but I don't think that is to our benefit. I don't think we need \nto see how fast we can do this; we have to see how well we can do this, \nso I will not file cloture this evening on the Syria resolution.\n  I have spoken to the Republican leader. I have talked to virtually \nall of my Democratic Senators. We have enough votes to get cloture, but \nI don't think we should be counting numbers tonight. I think what we \nneed to do is to make sure the President has the opportunity to speak \nto all 100 Senators and all 300 million American people before we do \nthis.\n  As I have said before, when we get on this, we are going to deal with \nthis in a manner that is dignified and move forward in a way that is \nexpeditious, yet thorough.\n  I have discussed this with the President and other people in the \nadministration. I repeat: I wish to make sure the President has a full \nopportunity to make his case to the Senate and the American people \nbefore we vote on this matter.\n  As always, I will continue to discuss this with Senator McConnell, \nand we will see if we can reach some kind of agreement to move forward \nwithout cloture. If that doesn't work out, I will file cloture when it \nis appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, most of us were in our States over Labor \nDay. I usually come to the floor a few days after Labor Day to talk \nabout the importance of Labor Day and what it means to working \nAmericans, what it has meant to our country, and what it has meant to \nbuilding a strong middle class.\n  I would like to read a letter sent to me by Bill Ross, who is an Ohio \nbusiness leader. Mr. Ross writes:\n\n       I grew up in a first generation immigrant family in a small \n     Ohio town.\n       My father, who obtained only an 8th grade education (not \n     uncommon for his generation), worked hard in an industrial \n     job.\n       My mother worked at home to care for our family of 5 \n     children. When able to do so, she went to work outside the \n     household too.\n       We rented a home for $25 a month, ate nutritious meals at \n     home, and all walked to school with clean clothes each day.\n       All five children went to college, obtained post-graduate \n     professional degrees, and pursued rewarding professional \n     careers in law, education and business.\n       How did that happen?\n       Because, first and foremost, my father had a job with a \n     living wage and health care for his family that his union \n     protected. Because we had access to good quality public \n     education. Because we had access to affordable state \n     universities and student loan programs that we could later \n     afford to repay. Because blue collar working people had a \n     chance.\n       I hope we can restore all that in America again.\n\n  Bill Ross's story is very much like my wife Connie's story. Bill Ross \nwas born in Ashtabula a bit before my wife who was also born there. \nBill Ross's dad carried a union card and his mother went to work when \nshe could. My wife's father carried a utility worker's union card for \nmore than 30 years in Ashtabula, OH. Her mother was a home care worker \nwho worked, when she could, after the children were a little older.\n  My wife, as did Bill Ross, was able to go to school with minimal \ndebt. She graduated from Kent State University in the 1970s with not \nmuch more than $1,200 in student debt.\n  The ability of a living wage and carrying a union card gave them a \nreason to celebrate Labor Day because it gave so many working families \na chance.\n  The Presiding Officer comes from a State much like mine. He \nunderstands the importance of carrying a union card and getting a \nliving wage gives people the kind of opportunity that people in this \ncountry deserve.\n  For generations hard-working Americans left their homes every \nmorning, and some at night, to earn an honest living. They bent with \nswollen knees to put on steel-toed work boots to provide for loved \nones. They put up with calloused hands to build a better life for their \nchildren.\n  Middle-class Americans and people struggling to enter the middle \nclass labored to ensure that children have enough food and clean \nclothes and an adequate education to thrive.\n  We know steelworkers, nurses, mechanics, teachers, and plumbers are \nnot always treated with the dignity they deserve--especially, far too \noften, from our elected officials.\n  American history is a history of struggle for working people--\nfighting for representation and fair wages, for access to good-paying \njobs, and for the dignity every human being deserves. It is about \nfighting for democracy and civil rights--as we were reminded a few days \nago when we marked the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for \njobs and freedom.\n  More than a century ago, when John Patterson Green, an Ohioan, and \nCedarville native John Henderson Kyle introduced a bill to establish \nLabor Day as a State holiday in Ohio, they were not thinking of any one \nsegment of the population. They were focused on the rights of all \nAmericans who work hard and play by the rules.\n  Since then, we have seen how the middle class grew when we ensured \nthat hard work is rewarded with fair pay and decent benefits.\n  Seventy-five years ago, President Roosevelt signed the Fair Labor \nStandards Act, which ultimately ensured that American workers would \nreceive a minimum wage, reasonable work hours, and an end to child \nlabor.\n  One of the authors of that bill, Senator Hugo Black, sat at this \nspecific desk in the Senate and supported Social Security, minimum \nwage, and paying for overtime. He initially introduced that legislation \nin 1932.\n  President Roosevelt led us to decades of prosperity by ensuring that \nhard work is met with fair wages and decent working conditions. A \nminimum wage helped to lift millions of Americans from poverty and \nallowed them to join the middle class.\n  Today workers face new challenges. While corporate executives and \nWall Street banks are earning record profits, too many families in \nOhio, Indiana, Oklahoma, and across the country are still struggling. \nSome politicians have used the recession and the budget crisis it \ncreated as grounds for attacking worker's rights. We have seen vicious \nattacks on workers' rights across the country. We have seen it in North \nCarolina. We saw it last year in Indiana and Michigan. We have seen it \nover the last 3 years in Ohio.\n  Ohio passed one of the worst attacks on collective bargaining rights \nin Ohio's history, trying to convince people that public employees \ncaused the financial crisis, not Wall Street. Workers fought back and \nshattered a record for signatures needed to establish a ballot \ninitiative and energized 2 million voters who came out to overturn that \nwrong-headed law.\n  Today, because the unity of not just labor union members but the huge \nmajority of voters in Ohio, police officers, firefighters, sanitation \nworkers, teachers, and other public sector workers continue to have the \nright to bargain and work with management through collective bargaining \nto ensure safety and fairness on the job.\n  In Akron, OH, UAW workers at Meggitt do high-quality and efficient \nwork which allows them to be competitive with workers in Mexico and has \nprevented operations from being outsourced and helped to attract new \ninvestment in Ohio.\n  In Toledo, Youngstown, Cleveland, and beyond, union autoworkers \nhelped bring back the American auto industry. They are building the \ncars of the future that people want to drive. I met with business \nowners across Ohio over this August and the month before and the month \nbefore and the month before\n\n[[Page S6289]]\n\nthat--during my 7 years in the Senate--Ohio business owners who want to \npay their workers a fair wage and have joined in efforts to raise the \nminimum wage. They know increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour \nwill increase domestic production by nearly $33 billion over 3 years as \nworkers spend their raises in their local businesses and communities. \nThis economic activity would generate 140,000 new jobs over the course \nof 3 years.\n  It is no surprise that the American public is anxious about our place \nin an increasingly multipolar, complicated, dynamic global economy. \nPeople know that after NAFTA and CAFTA and permanent China trade \nrelations were passed, plants closed and we lost 5 million good \nmanufacturing jobs. Never in history has company after company \nimplemented a business plan where they close down production in \nStuebenville or Toledo or Dayton, OH, to move overseas to Wuhan or \nShanghai, China, and sell the products back to the United States. That \nbusiness plan led us to this.\n  In 1977 manufacturing was 20 percent of our GDP and financial \nservices represented significantly less. That flipped by 2010, where \nmanufacturing is now only about 11 percent of GDP. Between 2000 and \n2010, because of wrongheaded trade agreements, because of tax policy \nthat has given incentives to move offshore, our country lost 5 million \nmanufacturing jobs and 60,000 plants closed down.\n  Since 2010 we have seen manufacturing jobs grow by more than 500,000. \nThat is not good enough. We have to enact an agenda that includes the \nbest trained workers, the most developed and sophisticated \ninfrastructure, the most robust manufacturing base, and the strongest \ndefense against currency manipulation. Until every American worker is \nable to rise out of poverty, we still have work to do. Labor Day, \ncelebrated last week, shouldn't simply mark the end of summer; it \nshould mark the beginning of a renewed commitment to fighting for \nAmerican workers, American businesses, and strengthening our middle \nclass.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/09/senate-section/article/S6289-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6289-S6290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 SYRIA\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank my friend the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio for including me in his unanimous \nconsent request. I will briefly speak about an amendment.\n  We all understand that the issue is going to come before this body to \nsend activity into Syria. I am very much opposed to any kind of force \nin Syria, but if it happens, we want to be sure there is some \nprotection there. So I have an amendment that even if my amendment \npasses, I will still oppose the effort of this President to send \nactivity into Syria, and I believe it would precipitate a war.\n  My amendment is very simple. If the President takes military action \nagainst Syria, sequestration of our Armed Forces would be delayed for 1 \nyear. We are talking about the fiscal year where we would take another \n$52 billion out of our military.\n  What Asad has done and continues to do is reprehensible, but the \nUnited States can't afford another war given the current state of our \nmilitary. The threats from Syria and the Middle East are not emerging \nthreats. These threats have been around for decades. We knew they were \nthere. There is nothing new about them. Yet the readiness capabilities \nof our military continue to be decimated by drastic budget cuts.\n  Sixteen Air Force combat flying squadrons have been grounded. We \nfinally, after 3 months, put them back in the air again, and right now \nwe know it costs more to get them back in a state of readiness than the \nmoney we saved from grounding them for 3 months. Our naval fleet has \nbeen reduced to historically low levels, the end strength of our ground \nforces has been cut by more than 100,000 personnel, and hundreds of \nthousands of DOD civilian employees have been furloughed. Just in my \nState of Oklahoma, in one of my installations, 14,000 civilian \nemployees have been furloughed.\n  We can't have it both ways--continuing to cut the funding of our \nmilitary while still expecting to meet our national security \nrequirements. As military readiness and capabilities decline, we accept \ngreater risk, and, as I have always said, risk equals lives. Every time \nwe have a hearing, we have our combatant commanders come in and talk \nabout the risks. Risk means lives. As I have always said, risk equals \nlives, and allowing these cuts to continue while proposing to send our \nforces into harm's way is immoral and reprehensible.\n  Over the last week I have heard a lot from the President and his \nadministration about how any action in Syria will be limited. I suggest \nthere is no such thing as limited war. Once we decide to strike, we \ncan't predict where it will end or how the situation might escalate. \nLet's not forget that we have troops currently on the ground in Jordan \nand Turkey, marines guarding our Embassies, and sailors and airmen \nstationed around the region. We have already heard that Iran is \nordering its terrorist proxies to retaliate by attacking U.S. interests \nin the region, including our Embassy in Iraq. The State Department has \nordered nonessential personnel to evacuate our Embassy in Lebanon. The \nthreats to our forces are real.\n  I wish to read for my colleagues excerpts from a letter that was \nwritten by two ladies, Rebekah Sanderlin and Molly Blake. These are \nspouses of two of our servicemen. They are responding--much more \neloquently than I could ever hope to--to the immense hardship our \nmilitary is enduring under sequestration and to the misguided belief \nthat a military strike on Syria can be done in isolation--that it won't \naffect our troops and their families.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              An Open Letter to CNN Reporter Barbara Starr\n\n            [From The Huffington Post, posted Sept. 4, 2013]\n\n       Dear Ms. Starr: We are writing to let you in on a secret. \n     It's a big one--so get to a fresh page in your reporter \n     notebook and have your pen poised and ready.\n       You told your viewers last Thursday that there was ``no \n     question'' that the military could afford to go into Syria \n     and that you ``don't think it's really going to affect \n     military families at all.''\n       Here's some inside information for you: There is no such \n     thing as a person-less war. Our military cannot afford for \n     Americans to forget that wars and battles and military \n     strikes are fought by troops, that troops are people, and \n     that those people have families.\n       In our military communities this summer we couldn't even \n     afford to pay federal employees for a five-day work week. \n     Military families can't get doctors' appointments and can't \n     get the counseling services needed to grapple with the \n     problems we already have, problems largely created by almost \n     12 years of war. And while Congress was busy sending a \n     warning letter to the president to ensure they get to sign \n     off on whether or not we go to war, they managed to ignore \n     military families when the sequester hit. Today clinic hours \n     are being slashed--along with pretty much every other service \n     military families need. Walking around our communities \n     lately, it doesn't look like we can afford much of anything--\n     and certainly not a whole new war.\n       And that's just taking `afford' literally.\n       Figuratively, the picture is even grimmer. An entire \n     generation of military kids have grown up with a parent they \n     know primarily through Skype. Couples are trying to piece \n     together marriages that have been badly fractured by more \n     years spent apart than together. We grew hopeful that better \n     days were coming as we watched the end of the Iraq war, and \n     we're thrilled that the end of our involvement in Afghanistan \n     is nigh, and yet now all of cable news is breathless and \n     giddy with talk of war in Syria.\n       You boast, in your bio, that you have exclusive access to \n     Lt. Gen. Russel Honore and you've interviewed several \n     secretaries of defense and other important people at the CIA. \n     You may very well have Sec. Hagel on speed dial--but that \n     doesn't give you the right to toss around your thoughts on \n     how military families may or may not be affected by military \n     action. Not until you've stood in our shoes for longer than a \n     three-minute live shot.\n       You see, Barbara, there's no such thing as `no boots on the \n     ground.' We in the military community sigh and shake our \n     heads when we hear talk like that from the people on TV. \n     Perhaps you consider a relatively small number of troops to \n     be the same as zero--but we don't. We know that each of those \n     service members is somebody's somebody.\n       As journalists, we like to show both sides of the story. So \n     we would like to also voice our thanks. For your careless \n     words have aimed a giant floodlight on the military-civilian \n     divide. Blue Star Families Director of Research and Policy, \n     Vivian Greentree said it best:\n\n[[Page S6290]]\n\n       We hear a sense of angst in our membership and throughout \n     the military community. How can we be in the middle of the \n     fall out of sequestration--furloughs, program cuts, loss of \n     mission readiness--we have families who can't get medical \n     appointments. They are all wondering how they will manage if \n     the situation in Syria continues to escalate. They wonder how \n     will it affect them. Not, if it will affect them. But, how.\n       ``That statement, in all its small-minded glory, captures \n     the civilian-military divide more clearly than any survey \n     ever could.''\n       And maybe someday we will be able to fight whole wars \n     without using a single human . . . And Rosie the Robot will \n     clean our kitchens while we tackle our morning commutes in \n     flying cars. But today, in 2013, we can't have a `surgical \n     strike' without someone saying where to drop the bombs or \n     where to aim those missiles. And those planes that drop the \n     bombs? The destroyers that carry the missiles? They have \n     pilots, captains and crews. All humans. Even the ``unmanned'' \n     drones have human pilots, and the psychological wear and tear \n     on them is staggering. Planes take off from airfields in \n     foreign lands or from aircraft carriers, both of which are \n     staffed by thousands of American somebodies, just like those \n     destroyer ships. At every turn in a military operation you \n     will find people. Intel analysts, linguists, flight crews, \n     and cooks. Even war plans, regardless of whether they were, \n     as you stated, ``on deployment anyway'' rely on thousands of \n     people who will be pulled to a new duty, which causes \n     reshuffling far and wide in the military community.\n       And this, most definitely, affects military families.\n       The big question is, as you said, ``will it work?'' and, as \n     we learned from the most recent wars, it bears recalling that \n     things don't always go as planned. But that's not the only \n     question. Do not kid yourself, Barbara, and don't you dare \n     kid the viewers who trust your reporting.\n           Sincerely,\n                                Rebekah Sanderlin and Molly Blake,\n                                                 Military Spouses.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to quote from the letter I just \nsubmitted for the Record, and I ask my colleagues to listen to the \nquote. These are two ladies who are spouses of servicemen. They said:\n\n       There is no such thing as a person-less war. Our military \n     cannot afford for Americans to forget that wars and battles \n     and military strikes are fought by troops, that troops are \n     people, and that those people have families. In our military \n     communities this summer we couldn't even afford to pay \n     Federal employees for a five-day work week. Military families \n     can't get doctors' appointments and can't get counseling \n     services needed to grapple with the problems we already have, \n     problems largely created by almost 12 years of war. Today \n     clinic hours are being slashed--along with pretty much every \n     other service military families need. Walking around our \n     communities lately, it doesn't look like we can afford much \n     of anything--and certainly not a whole new war.\n\n  I am still quoting now these wives of our military men:\n\n       And maybe someday we will be able to fight whole wars \n     without using a single human, but today, in 2013, we can't \n     have a surgical strike without someone saying where to drop \n     the bombs or where to aim those missiles. And those planes \n     that drop the bombs? The destroyers that carry the missiles? \n     They have pilots, captains, and crews. All humans. Even the \n     ``unmanned'' drones have human pilots, and the psychological \n     wear and tear on them is staggering. Planes take off from \n     airfields in foreign lands and from aircraft carriers, both \n     of which are staffed by thousands of American somebodies, \n     just like those destroyer ships. At every turn in a military \n     operation you will find people. Intel analysts, linguists, \n     flight crews, and cooks. Even war plans . . . rely on \n     thousands of people who will be pulled to a new duty, which \n     causes reshuffling far and wide in the military community. \n     And this, most definitely, affects our military families.\n\n  Again, that is a quote from two of the wives of our current \nservicemen. I hope all of my colleagues will read this letter. I hope \nthey understand that the decisions we make this week about whether to \ngo to war in Syria have a human dimension.\n  If we expect the brave men and women in our military to go to foreign \nlands and risk their lives on our behalf, we have a moral obligation to \nensure that they and their families have the support and the resources \nthat are required. Sequestration has already inflicted severe damage on \nour military, and we are now only a couple of weeks from another $52 \nbillion being slashed from an already devastated military budget.\n  I have been clear that I don't support the President's call for \nmilitary action in Syria. He still hasn't presented Congress and the \nAmerican people with a plan for what he wants to accomplish, how he \nintends to accomplish it, or how he intends to pay for it. Will the \nPresident pay for this operation with more furloughs and by grounding \nmore squadrons again? The CNO has already come forward and stated that \nif operations against Syria extend into October, he won't be able to \nafford it and will likely require supplemental funding from Congress.\n  Furthermore, the President hasn't told us how a strike in Syria fits \ninto a broader strategy for the Middle East. What we decide to do is \nnot just about Syria. It is bigger than that. This is about the growing \nthreat from Iran, stability in the Middle East, and our commitment to \nIsrael and allies and our ability to respond to other contingencies \nthat are there.\n  I recall knowing what was going to happen. This is 4\\1/2\\ years ago, \nback when President Obama was first elected, his first election. I knew \nthat when he came out with his first budget, he was going to do \nsomething devastating to the military. So I put myself into \nAfghanistan, knowing, with the tanks going back and forth, that I would \nbe able to get the interest and the attention of the American people, \nand it worked. So in that very first budget 4\\1/2\\ years ago, he did \naway with the early fifth-generation bomber then, the F-22; did away \nwith our future combat system--the first ground capability increase in \nabout 50 years; did away with our lift capacity, the C-17. Then, the \nworst thing, which I hope doesn't turn out to create the worst problem \nfor America, he did away with the ground-based operation in Poland. \nThat was just the first budget. That was 4\\1/2\\ years ago. Since that \ntime, in his extended budget, he has taken $487 billion out of the \nmilitary, and with sequestration it will be another $\\1/2\\ trillion. \nThis just can't happen.\n  It is not just me who is saying this. People would expect it more \nfrom me. I am the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. I have gone there and worked with these guys and noticed the \nproblems they have. I would suggest that not just me but Admiral \nWinnefeld, who is the second highest military guy, the Vice Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, said:\n\n       There could be, for the first time in my career-- An \n     admiral speaking now, the second highest person in our \n     military--\n       instances where we may be asked to respond to a crisis and \n     we will have to say we cannot.\n\n  And then we go to the very top person, General Dempsey, the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said, ``Our military force is so \ndegraded, so unready, it would be immoral to use force.''\n  I only say this because we are going to be facing this, and I would \nbe opposed to this even with my amendment to postpone the sequestration \nof the military for 1 year. However, if that passes, I will still \noppose this taking place. I don't think many people in America realize \nwhat has happened to our military under the Obama administration.\n  Well, I have just stated what has happened. This is certainly not a \ntime when we would use force in Syria. Keep in mind that General \nDempsey said it would be immoral to use force, we are so degraded, and \nthat is exactly what we will be voting on in the next couple of days.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/09/senate-section/article/S6290-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6290-S6291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CHIRIBIQUETE NATIONAL PARK\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr President, I want to speak briefly about a recent \ndevelopment in Colombia of which many Senators may not be aware.\n  Colombia is ranked as the second most biologically diverse country in \nthe world. The variety of plant and animal life is staggering, which \nreflects its similarly diverse geography--from Amazon rainforest to \nglacier-covered mountains, and Caribbean and Pacific coastlines.\n  To its credit, Colombia has an extensive system of national parks and \nbiological reserves. I have long been convinced that as security \nimproves in that country and long after the oil wells are depleted, its \nnational parks and other protected areas will be among Colombia's \ngreatest resource, attracting eco-tourists from around the world.\n  On August 21 President Santos took an historic leap forward by \ndoubling the size of Chiribiquete National Park, which is home to a \nmyriad of species including jaguars and is comprised of extraordinary \nrock formations and\n\n[[Page S6291]]\n\ndense jungle. Chiribiquete was already Colombia's largest park, and it \nhas now become the size of Belgium.\n  There is more that needs to be done to protect Colombia's \nenvironment, particularly from the damage caused by mining and other \nextractive industries which has often occurred in, or adjacent to, \nenvironmentally fragile areas or indigenous reserves.\n  But President Santos' single stroke of the pen has done more for \nenvironmental conservation and species protection than what most heads \nof state do in a lifetime. I commend him for it and congratulate the \nColombian people. Colombia has set an example for all of us who care \nabout the environment and recognize that we have a responsibility to \nprotect it for future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/09/senate-section/article/S6291-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH ROBERTS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, Today I wish to \nrecognize one of my staff members who is currently battling cancer. \nJoseph F. Roberts has worked in my Rapid City congressional district \noffice since September 2002. Combined with service in the Peace Corps \nand the U.S. Air Force, Joe has served our Nation for approximately 19 \nyears in Federal and military service.\n  As a member of my staff, Joe has provided exemplary constituent \nservice to veterans and their families, as well as servicemembers and \nconstituents facing numerous issues. He has always approached his work \nwith a high degree of professionalism and a genuine caring attitude. \nThat caring attitude stems from years of therapy and counseling \nservices in the private sector he provided to the people of western \nSouth Dakota.\n  His service in the U.S. Air Force has served him well in working with \nveterans, and he has taken particular interest with veterans who suffer \nfrom military sexual assault, Traumatic Brain Injuries, and Post-\nTraumatic Stress Disorder. Veterans and their families know they have a \ntrue advocate with Joe in their corner when it comes to obtaining \nanswers and decisions on claims, searches for records and medical care \nissues. Joe's time in the Peace Corps brought him to Romania and Guyana \nwhere he served in a number of capacities including education and \ntraining on domestic violence, sexual abuse, substance abuse and \ncommunication, as well as working on infrastructure issues and \nproviding psychotherapy and other counseling assistance. These \nexperiences helped him greatly in my district office as he assisted \nconstituents with local, State and Federal issues and problems, \nincluding a wide array of immigration and passport issues.\n  I have always been impressed by Joe's sense of dedication and \ncommitment to helping people. One of the great rewards in life is \nhelping others and whether it has been his work in the Peace Corps, his \nprivate work as a therapist and counselor, or his work in constituent \nservice in my office, Joe has helped many people. Over the years, I \nhave received numerous thank you notes and letters from constituents \npraising the work of Joe Roberts.\n  And he has approached his battles with cancer over the years with \ncommitment, humor and perspective, always sharing, teaching and \ncounseling despite the challenges of the disease.\n  I take this opportunity to thank Joe for his service and his work on \nmy behalf with the people of South Dakota. I congratulate him on his \nmany years of service to the people of South Dakota and to his country \nand commend him for a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/09/senate-section/article/S6291-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING THE ORPHEUM THEATER CENTER\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \nhonor the Orpheum Theater Center in Sioux Falls, SD on its centennial \nanniversary. Since 1913, the Orpheum Theater has established itself as \na place of excellence in the arts.\n  On a breezy Thursday evening in October, exactly 100 years ago today, \nthe Orpheum Theater opened its doors and charged patrons an unheard of \nprice of $5 per seat. The opening night performances stunned the \naudience with a broad spectrum of entertainment including the Orpheum \nConcert Orchestra, two comedy acts, and headlines from around the world \nvia a state-of-the-art newsreel.\n  Over the past 100 years, the Orpheum Theater has changed owners \nseveral times and has undergone many renovations, most recently in \n2009. Thanks to its dedicated staff and exceptional volunteers the \nOrpheum Theater has consistently provided a superb place to experience \nperforming arts and annually 100,000 people visit this world-class \nvenue.\n  South Dakotans have congregated at the Orpheum Theater for elegant \nperformances by entertainers both from within our community and around \nthe world. I congratulate the Orpheum Theater Center on reaching this \nmilestone, and wish it continued success.

Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the 50th \nanniversary of the dedication of the Cadet Chapel at the U.S. Air Force \nAcademy. In the half century since its founding, the Cadet Chapel has \nbecome a National Historic Landmark and the most popular manmade \nattraction in Colorado. Each year more than 750,000 visitors explore \nthis iconic and unique building.\n  Today, the Cadet Chapel is a multifaith house of worship specifically \ndesigned to provide multiple distinct worship areas under a single \nroof, meeting the spiritual needs of the Academy's cadets. The chapel's \naluminum, glass and steel structure features 17 spires that soar 150 \nfeet toward the Colorado sky.\n  Annually, over 4,000 cadets are provided 850 religious worship and \neducational opportunities to practice their personal faith. The chapel \nalso provides religious rites and observances such as baptisms and \ndedications, weddings, funerals and memorial services. Most worship \nservices are open to the general public and thousands of visitors each \nyear attend worship.\n  The Cadet Chapel fosters outstanding civic involvement by partnering \nwith the local community to host four annual free concerts with over \n2000 attendees. The U.S. Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel is truly \nunique. Its iconic architectural structure serves as a symbol of the \nAcademy and is recognized worldwide. Most important, the Cadet Chapel \nenables the free exercise of religion for cadets in this unique campus \nsetting and aids the Chaplain Corps at the Air Force Academy to inspire \nmen and women to become leaders of character through spiritual \nformation.\n  In the 50 years since the Cadet Chapel was dedicated our Nation has \nsent Air Force Academy graduates to serve in the skies and jungles of \nVietnam and the deserts of Iraq. Those that once bowed their head \nbeneath the spires of the Chapel served our country in the former \nYugoslavia and in the mountains of Afghanistan, and they continue to \nserve the cause of freedom around the globe today. We thank them for \ntheir service, and we congratulate the Air Force on the 50th \nanniversary of the dedication of the Air Force Academy's Cadet \nChapel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/09/senate-section/article/S6291-4", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6291-S6292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:04 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 367.
