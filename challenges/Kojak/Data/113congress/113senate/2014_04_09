Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 345, S. \n2199, the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to S. 2199, a bill to amend the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide more effective \n     remedies to victims of discrimination in the payment of wages \n     on the basis of sex, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks and those of Senator \nMcConnell, the time will be equally divided and controlled until 11 \na.m., and at that time there will be a cloture vote on the motion to \nproceed with the legislation now before us.\n  Additional votes are expected today on confirmation of nominations. \nFloor staff is working to come up with convenient times for everyone in \nthat regard and will notify Senators when we have those votes \nscheduled.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on whether to end debate on \nthe paycheck fairness legislation. This much needed legislation \nprovides important protections for women. It addresses wage disparity, \nhelping women negotiate for equal pay, and it empowers workers to fight \nback against wage discrimination--women in particular.\n  It is a good and important bill, and it helps American women in many \ndifferent ways, but for reasons known only to them, Senate Republicans \ndon't appear to be interested in closing the wage gap for working \nwomen, such as my daughter and my grandchildren, the Presiding \nOfficer's wife and daughter, friends and neighbors.\n  Four years ago the Republicans filibustered this exact same \nlegislation. Two years later the Republicans filibustered this \nlegislation. Now for a third time the Paycheck Fairness Act is before \nus and it appears it is going to be filibustered again. They have \nindicated that they will likely not let us begin work on this important \npiece of legislation or this debate.\n  If they are ideologically opposed to equal pay for equal work, they \nare free to vote against paycheck fairness, come down here and give \nspeeches as to why it is such a bad idea, but we haven't heard any.\n  Today's vote is simply to begin debate on the bill. Are they so \nrepulsed by equal pay for hard-working American women they again will \nnot debate equal pay for equal work, but they will obstruct equal pay \nfor equal work?\n  The Republicans come to the floor and try to offer amendments that \nhave\n\n[[Page S2294]]\n\nnothing to do with equal pay--nothing. I am at a loss as to why anyone \nwould decline to debate this important issue or, if you don't like it, \ncome and tell us why. Debate is what this institution is all about. It \nis the U.S. Senate.\n  Hubert Humphrey said once: ``Freedom is hammered out on the anvil of \ndiscussion, dissent and debate.'' That is what he said. So we should \ndebate this bill. Together we can find a solution to this unfair wage \ndisparity that costs average working women $464,324 over a lifetime, on \naverage.\n  American families want us to debate and hopefully pass this \nlegislation. This legislation overwhelmingly is supported by the \nAmerican people. People in support of the Paycheck Fairness Act are \ncalling on us to pass this legislation. They are writing letters, they \nare posting on social media, and they are attending rallies. Our \nconstituents have made their feelings known, but the Republicans have \nnot gotten the message.\n  Henry David Thoreau said:\n\n       It takes two to speak the truth. One to speak and another \n     to listen.\n\n  The Senate Democrats have heard the truth about giving women a fair \nshot at equal pay for equal work. The truth is that working women make \nan average of 77 cents for every dollar their male colleagues make for \ndoing the exact same work. That is not fair.\n  Today we will see if Republicans will give working women and their \nfamilies a fair shot when voting on debate for this important \nlegislation. Millions of American women and men--everyone in America--\nare hoping that a third time will be the charm for Senate Republicans.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Obama economy has had a devastating impact on the \npeople we represent. It has hurt millions in the middle class and \npeople from every region of the country in almost every walk of life. \nWhen we consider the debate in the Senate, a few statistics jump out in \nparticular.\n  Under this President's watch more than 3.7 million American women \nhave fallen into poverty. The average American woman now makes about \n$730 less than when the President took office. If she is a college \ngraduate, she has actually seen her income shrink by about double that \namount. In other words, when it comes to American women overall, what \nwe have seen over the past 5\\1/2\\ years is less income and more \npoverty. That is the story Senate Democrats don't want to talk about.\n  Perhaps that is why for weeks now they have blocked the efforts \nRepublicans have made to improve the picture. Senate Democrats want to \ncontrol this debate from start to finish and basically do nothing to \nhelp with our efforts to expand opportunity and jobs for women and for \nmen. It would appear, as some have put it, they have no interest in \nsolutions or any concern for the consequences of their actions. We see \nthat in how uninterested they seem to be in the statistics I just \nmentioned, and we can see it in some other policies they have been \ndefending literally for months.\n  Take Obama's 30-hour workweek rule, which is basically forcing \nemployers to slash workers' hours. Who is impacted the most by it? As \none study pointed out, it is women. Nearly two-thirds of those \nadversely impacted by this arbitrary provision of ObamaCare are women, \nbut Washington Democrats don't seem to care about that. They don't seem \nto care about the ways people we represent are being hurt by their \npolicies.\n  As I said, they continue to block all the innovative ideas that \nRepublicans have been offering to turn the tide. Just look at what \nhappened on the Senate floor yesterday. I, along with several other \nRepublican colleagues, offered a series of measures that would not only \nhave helped the jobs picture in our country, it would have provided \ngreater opportunities for men, women, and families desperate to get \nahead. Had Democratic Senators not blocked these ideas, they would have \npassed.\n  Why did Senate Democrats object to Senator Collins' proposal to \nrestore the 40-hour workweek? Do they think it is fair that Obama's 30-\nhour workweek discriminates against working women? Do Democrats think \nit is fair to protect the rules that disproportionately reduce their \nwages?\n  Why do they object to the workplace flexibility proposal that Senator \nAyotte and I offered? Here is legislation that would have given working \nmoms and dads the option to take time off to help them find a better \nwork-life balance--flexibility that is more critical than ever now that \nObamaCare's 30-hour work rule is forcing people to pick up a second or \nthird job just to scrape by.\n  Why are Democrats so opposed to a policy that a lot of working women \nsay they want, a policy that is tailored to the needs of the modern \nworkforce and that many government employees already enjoy?\n  Why do Senate Democrats object to our job creation legislation, which \nincludes so many smart ideas from so many different Senators? Here is a \nbill that strikes right at the heart of what has ailed our country for \n5\\1/2\\ years, a lack of jobs and opportunity. Passing it should have \nbeen a no-brainer.\n  But Senate Democrats blocked all of it, every last one of our \nproposals, just like they shut down the proworker legislation Senator \nPaul and I offered last week. The Right to Work Act is smart policy \nthat promises to boost competitiveness while advancing workers' rights, \nensuring they are not limited by the dictates of a union.\n  It is similar to another bill I am proud to cosponsor: Senator \nRubio's RAISE Act, which would allow workers to get a raise even if \nunion bosses didn't want them to. Take for instance a worker who \noutperforms her colleagues and then is told by a union boss to sit down \nand accept less pay than she deserves--not a dime more than the \ncoworker she is outperforming. It is completely and totally unfair, and \nworkers such as she shouldn't be penalized by some archaic rule dreamt \nup before the age of ``Mad Men.''\n  These are the ideas that everyone who claims to stand for workplace \nfairness should want to help us pass. Yet Washington Democrats always \nseem to find some excuse not to. Maybe the Big Labor bosses they are \nanswering to are telling them they cannot. Who knows. Or maybe it is \nthe trial lawyers they seem to be so attentive to these days.\n  It makes sense when we consider what Senate Democrats have been \ntalking about this week, a bill that even publications such as the \nWashington Post, the Chicago Tribune, and the Boston Globe have said is \nbad policy. At a time when the Obama economy is already hurting women \nso much, this legislation would double down on job loss, all while \nlining the pockets of trial lawyers. In other words, it is just another \nDemocratic idea that threatens to hurt the very people it claims to \nhelp.\n  It is time for Washington Democrats to stop protecting trial lawyers \nand start focusing on actually helping the people we were sent to \nrepresent. We have already seen what 5\\1/2\\ years of Washington \nDemocratic control has meant: more poverty and lower wages for women. \nSo they need to stop blocking innovative ideas that would move us \nfurther along the path to opportunity because, look, the college \ngraduate who has seen her annual paycheck decline by $1,400 over the \npast several years is counting on Senate Democrats to change their game \nplan. The part-time worker who cannot imagine how she is going to make \nends meet under ObamaCare's 30-hour work rule is counting on Democrats \nto think outside the box.\n  The American people are tired of Washington Democrats' 5\\1/2\\ years \nof failed policies and all the political games that helped us get here \nin the first place. Americans actually want solutions and they want \nthem now and we owe it to them to start passing the kinds of innovative \nideas Republicans are committed to pursuing, no matter how many times \nthe majority tries to shut us down.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 11 a.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees. Under the previous order, the leadership \ntime is reserved.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S2295]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, this week President Obama has been \nholding what appear to be made-for-TV events to talk about the economy. \nHe has been talking about the policies he wants Congress to enact, \npolicies that he says will finally get America's economy going again.\n  President Obama has been in the White House now for more than 5 \nyears, so I think it is fair to ask: What has this administration--the \nObama administration--been doing for the economy over the past 5 years? \nWe know that the recession actually ended almost 5 years ago. Since \nthen, our economy has not bounced back the way it should have or the \nway it typically does after a deep recession.\n  The Obama administration has spent a lot of money on failed ideas \nsuch as the so-called stimulus package. Since the recession ended, \nWashington has racked up more than $6 trillion worth of additional \ndebt, and it has not gotten us nearly the kind of growth we should have \nhad as a result of this spending.\n  Now the President has come out with a budget in which he has asked \nfor tax increases of over $1.7 trillion--nearly $2 trillion in higher \ntaxes over the next decade. Taxes are already too high. When I go home \nto talk to my constituents--as I would think most Members of this body \nhear from their folks at home--they say taxes are already too high.\n  Americans are now preparing to file their taxes. Income tax day is \ncoming--April 15. As Americans prepare to file their taxes, they are \ngetting a reminder of just how much of their hard-earned money \nWashington is taking from them. Next Tuesday, April 15, is the deadline \nfor most of us to fill out the forms and send everything off to the \nInternal Revenue Service, the IRS. According to the Tax Foundation, \nAmericans will spend more on taxes this year than they spend on food, \nclothing, and housing combined.\n  We now know how much President Obama is spending, but what kind of \neffect have his policies been having on our American economy? We know \nthat the economy is still not producing the number of jobs we need for \na real recovery. We know if we want to look for the reasons why that \nseems to be the case, we could talk about the two million jobs \nDemocrats are blocking with their restrictive energy policies.\n  We could talk about the minimum wage bill that Democrats are pushing \nright now. The Congressional Budget Office says that would reduce \nemployment in the United States by one-half million jobs--they say \nmaybe as many as 1 million jobs. Yet the majority leader comes here and \nsays it is the best thing we can do for the economy. Again, according \nto the Congressional Budget Office, it will cost the economy one-half \nmillion jobs and maybe up to 1 million jobs.\n\n  But probably the largest and most harmful thing the administration \nhas done--not just with regard to the economy, but to other factors, \nincluding the lives of the American public--is the President's health \ncare law. This law is hitting people across the country. There are \nfolks who are seeing their premiums go up, losing access to their \ndoctor, getting cancellation notices from their insurance companies, \nand it is also having an effect on our economy.\n  Today we had our usual Wyoming Wednesday where people from around the \nState of Wyoming come to Washington and meet with their two Senators \nfrom Wyoming so we can talk to people from our communities. Today I \nheard another horror story related to the President's health care law. \nA family had insurance that worked for them, and it worked for them for \na long time. It fit their budget, and it fit their needs as a family. \nBut, of course, it was canceled as a result of the President's health \ncare law and the mandates where the President believes he has a better \nidea of what works for their family than they know in terms of their \nfamily.\n  This husband and wife have a couple of young children, and they lost \ntheir insurance. They tried and tried again to get reinsured through \nthe exchange. It took them months. They finally went with paper forms \nto apply. The stories go on and on, and it is horrible to listen to \nwhat American families have had to go through as a result of the \nPresident's health care law. This is a family that was hurt as a result \nof the President's health care law in terms of what they are paying for \ninsurance, in terms of the deductibles that are now in place, and in \nterms of not being able to go to the doctor of their choice.\n  We have the effect on the family and the effect on the economy. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, the health care law is \ngoing to lead to 2\\1/2\\ million fewer people working over the next \ndecade. These are not my numbers. These are the Congressional Budget \nOffice's numbers. Because of the warped incentives that are built into \nthis law, some people will have to choose between working more and \ngetting higher wages or working less so they can collect government \nsubsidies.\n  Remember Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House on the Democratic \nside. When this law was jammed through and down the throats of the \nAmerican people, she was saying: First you have to pass it before you \nget to find out what is in it.\n  I actually read the whole thing, and it continues to astonish me how \nfew Members of this body and the body across the way actually read it \nand instead just took her for her word. Now what we are seeing are \nthese unintended consequences continuing to show up.\n  Even some Democrats have had to admit as much about this issue of \npeople having to work more and getting higher wages or choosing to work \nless so they can collect greater government subsidies.\n  One liberal columnist wrote in the Washington Post back in February \nthat ObamaCare is ``a drag on economic growth.'' He said it was ``a \ndrag on economic growth.'' It is a drag on economic growth ``as more \npeople decide government handouts are more attractive than working more \nand paying higher taxes.'' The President wants higher taxes, but he \nsets into place a health care law that discourages the work and \nadditional income because the government subsidies get greater if you \nwork less and have a lower income.\n  That is one way that the President's health care law has been \nharmful, and there is another way as well. Remember, this law requires \nemployers to pay for insurance for anyone working 30 hours per week or \nmore. Thirty hours per week or more is considered a full-time job. \nThere is bipartisan legislation in an effort to try to actually \noverturn that and get that back to the 40-hour workweek, which is what \nmost Americans think of as a full-time job.\n  How do people have to respond to the health care law that is out \nthere? What are towns doing with their town budgets? What are counties \ndoing in States all across the country? What are school districts \ndoing? We see what they are doing, and they are talking about it. \nTowns, communities, counties, school districts, and universities are \ncutting back on the hours of their part-time bus drivers, librarians, \ncoaches, and other middle-class workers. They are cutting back to get \nthem below 30 hours a week so they don't fall into the mandates of the \nPresident's expensive health care law.\n  What does that mean? It means it hurts people's take-home pay. If \nsomeone is working 32 or 33 hours a week and finds that their hours \nhave been cut to 29 hours--regardless of what the majority leader wants \nto do with minimum wage--their paycheck is going to get smaller. Their \npaycheck is going to be smaller because of the health care law. Their \npaycheck will be smaller because of policies that Democrats have voted \nfor--many of whom never read it in the first place.\n  Is this just a Republican versus a Democratic idea? Not necessarily, \nbecause a group of labor union leaders who supported the law initially \nhave said that this health care law will ``destroy the foundation of \nthe 40-hour workweek that is the backbone of the American middle \nclass.''\n  The House of Representatives voted last week to do something about \nit. They passed--in a bipartisan vote--a\n\n[[Page S2296]]\n\nbill that would change the definition of full-time work under the \nhealth care law from 30 hours to 40 hours.\n  Senator Susan Collins introduced a bill to do the same thing here in \nthe Senate. So what has happened with it? Well, the Democratic majority \nleader isn't allowing a vote on that bill.\n  This is a commonsense way to reverse some of the harm the President's \nhealth care law is doing to hard-working Americans--how it is impacting \ntheir take-home pay, how they are seeing smaller paychecks and \nimpacting their quality of life. But the Senate majority leader has \nblocked the vote. So the health care law hurts patients, it hurts \nhealth care providers, and is hurting the economy.\n  It is interesting, because the President said all he wanted to do was \ninsure the people who didn't have insurance. So we have an exchange. We \nhave turned the whole health care system upside down. We have impacted \none-sixth of the economy. And the whole purpose: to take people who \ndidn't have insurance and get them insured.\n  What does the Wall Street Journal say about it today in the headline \ntalking about the newest statistics in the RAND study? They say most \nwho bought policies through the new exchanges--most who bought policies \nthrough the new exchanges--already had insurance. They weren't \nuninsured. These people had insurance already.\n  Many lost their insurance because of the President's health care law. \nYet we have turned upside down one-sixth of the economy in an effort to \nhelp some but have hurt so many in the process. That is one of the \nfundamental flaws and problems of a health care law where the President \npromised, if you like your coverage, you can keep it; if you like your \ndoctor, you can keep him or her. Now we have millions of people whose \ncoverage has been canceled. We have many people who can't keep their \ndoctor, can't go to their hospital. They are seeing higher premiums, \nhigher copays, higher deductibles, more pain because of what the \nPresident and the Democrats have forced through the Congress, forced \nthrough the House, forced through the Senate.\n  The American people wanted to change the health care system in this \ncountry and they knew what they wanted. They wanted the care they need \nfrom a doctor they choose at lower cost. They didn't get that in this \nhealth care law. Many Americans have seen their costs go up--their \ninitial out-of-pocket costs--to buy the insurance on the exchange. They \nhave seen their copays go up. They have seen their deductibles go up. \nAnd they can't keep the doctor of their choice. So they know what they \nwanted, and this is not what they wanted, but it is what they have \ngotten instead. People understand that.\n  That is why this health care law is still so very unpopular across \nthe country. People see how bad this health care law is in terms of \ntheir own lives and how bad it is for the American economy. They see \nhow 5 years of this administration and the policies have held back our \neconomic recovery.\n  Tax day, April 15, coming next week, will be another opportunity for \nAmericans to reflect on how much of their money Washington has been \ntaking from them and what they have gotten in return. I would say, as \nthey reflect upon that, they will continue to say they are not getting \nvalue for their money. They are not getting value for their money.\n  Polling shows that--and I hear this at home in Wyoming--for every \ndollar people send to the government, they think they are getting less \nthan 50 cents on the dollar in value. They don't like it because it \nmeans when the government takes more, they have less to spend.\n  The government is deciding where the money is spent, not families. \nAnd it is families who want to make decisions for themselves about \ntheir freedoms, about their health care, about their financial \nchoices--what they want, what they need, and what works best for them.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. What is now the pending business on the floor?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The motion to proceed to S. 2199.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I believe the number of that bill refers to the \npaycheck fairness bill; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, what a bloodless way to talk about such \nan important public policy issue--to use the motion to proceed--and \nvery few people realize this. To simply get a bill on the Senate floor, \nwe have to vote on a motion to proceed on whether we are going to take \nit up. And because this is now going to require a 60-vote majority, \nbecause of the invocation of this fog of filibuster, we can't even get \nto a majority vote on how to make sure women get equal pay for equal \nwork.\n  No wonder people are fed up with us. They wonder why, when all is \nsaid and done, more gets said than gets done. I travel the State of \nMaryland in the United States of America, and people want us to do our \njob, to work on a bipartisan basis, hands across the aisle, work across \nthe dome, to solve national problems.\n  We heard this morning the talk about the economy. One way to help the \neconomy is for people to make more money. Do we know what is one of the \nbest ways to make more money? Pay women equal pay for equal work. Also, \nenforce the law, the Equal Pay Act, that was passed in 1963. But we \nhaven't been able to do it for several reasons, and this is what the \npaycheck fairness bill deals with.\n  Right now, there is a veil of secrecy in businesses all over \nAmerica--a veil of secrecy about the fact that an employee cannot ask a \nfellow employee what they are making. An employee is not supposed to \ntalk about their salary. They can talk about anything, but they can't \ntalk about what the person next to them is making.\n  The second issue is if an employee in any way, particularly if that \nemployee is a woman, tries to speak up for their rights to get equal \npay for the same job--same pay, same job--an employee is often \nretaliated against. Then, businesses come up with lots of loopholes, \nwhich are bad. They use business explanations as bad excuses to avoid \npaying equal pay for equal work.\n  We want to pass this legislation to end the retaliation, close the \nloopholes, and lift the veil of secrecy. This, in many ways, will give \nAmerican women not a raise but what justice demands.\n  I am here this morning to keep up the momentum which we have been \nable to maintain in this Senate. I am very proud of the fact that in \n2009 we passed the Lilly Ledbetter Act which opened the courthouse \ndoors to women. Now, as we continue 5 years later, we are listening to \nstories--terrible stories--about what has happened.\n  There was Kerri Sleeman--a mechanical engineer in Michigan--who was \ntold that men had to be paid more in her company because they were \nbreadwinners. She was a mechanical engineer doing the same job.\n  Latoya Weaver, a Marylander who wrote me, learned that the males at \nthe hotel where she worked were being paid $2 more an hour than she \nwas, which meant a total of several hundred dollars a year.\n  We want to end that discrimination--no retaliation, no loopholes, no \nveil of secrecy.\n  This has been going on a long time. In 1964, President Lyndon \nJohnson, as part of the great civil rights movement that was sweeping \nour country, wanted to pass three civil rights bills: the Equal Pay \nAct, the Civil Rights Act, and the Voting Rights Act.\n  He started with the Equal Pay Act because he thought it would be the \neasiest to pass and the easiest to enforce. Fifty years later, we are \nstill fighting the battles on all three of those pieces of legislation, \nand today we are talking about equal pay.\n  (Ms. HEITKAMP assumed the Chair.)\n  Right now women are an emerging force in the workplace. Way back in \nthe 1950s, only 11 percent of women were in the workplace, although \nmany had been there during World War II as Rosies and kept our economy \ngoing.\n\n[[Page S2297]]\n\nNow they are the breadwinners in 40 percent of households. Women make \nup 40 percent of the households in which she is the head of the house \nor the prime or the breadwinner, and it is time to make the labor \nmarket reflect that--most of all the pay market.\n  When the Equal Pay Act was signed in 1963, guess what women made. \nFive cents for every $1 men made. Everybody said: We have to fight \nthat. Fifty years later--now--women make 77 cents for every $1 men \nmake. Over a 50-year period we closed the gap by 18 cents. Now what do \nyou think about that? I think that is pretty unjust. I do not think it \nis even American.\n  We like to say: If you work hard and play by the rules, America will \nwork for you. Well, women work hard. They play by the rules. Yet they \nwork but America does not work for them.\n  For women of color, it is even worse. If you are an African-American \nwoman, you earn 64 cents for every $1 a man earns. If you are an \nHispanic woman, you earn 54 cents for every $1 a man earns.\n  You like to hear: Oh, you've come a long way. But I do not think we \nhave come a long way with an 18-cent improvement in a 50-year period. \nWho in this Chamber thinks that earning 1 cent more every 5 years \ncounts as ``coming a long way''? Maybe if we made 1 cent more every \nyear since 1964 we would not think it is so terrific.\n  My constituents do not go for this--either men or women. Women want \nto stand up for their rights, and men want to stand up for the women \nthey love. There are men all over this country, right this minute, who \nare in jobs they hate so their daughters could have the job they love, \nworking hard so they can help them go to school, get the education, get \nthe skills to be able to take care of themselves. This is why they have \nspoken up for dads.\n  Every week, in every month, as families sit down to pay their bills, \nhusbands are looking at their wives and saying: Tell me about the pay. \nIt doesn't seem right. I heard that George is making--I heard that Tom \nis making--but what about us? So men are outraged about this too. They \nsee it as a fundamental fairness issue. They see it as a fundamental \njustice issue. And guess what. It is a family pocketbook issue.\n  We want change, and we want change today by voting for this bill. \nThis way we will change the Federal lawbooks so we can help change the \nfamily checkbooks. This bill, as I said, will close the loopholes in \nthe law which allow pay discrimination to continue to occur.\n  I will repeat, paycheck secrecy--making it harder to uncover pay \ndifferences--is hard to fight when you are prohibited from even talking \nabout it. Businesses are under a gag rule. Then there is the \nretaliation. And then there are the loopholes.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act is quite simple. They say: Well, didn't you \ndeal with this with Lilly Ledbetter? Well, Lilly Ledbetter dealt with \nthe statute of limitations. This bill is dealing with other issues. No \nlonger can workers be retaliated against for sharing wages.\n  For years, Lilly--and she tells her own story, but it is the story of \nmany--was harassed and humiliated for asking questions about coworkers' \nsalaries. She found out that the guys were making more because of an \nanonymous note that was sent to her. Somewhere in the vast corporation \nof Goodyear, for whom she worked, a contractor--a Federal contractor, \nby the way--there was somebody, probably a wonderful man who worked \nwith her, who wanted to help her out and told her.\n  But then she went on to try to do something. Well, guess what. She \nfaced retaliation. First she faced verbal harassment. She faced threats \nto her very safety. She faced sexual intimidation. She really got it \nthrown right back in her face, and every day it became a torture in the \nworkplace. But she pressed on.\n  That happens to women all over America. We cannot allow that. When \nyou stand up for your rights in America, you should not be harassed.\n  There is much said about the First Amendment. Yes. There is much said \nabout the Second Amendment--the right to carry a gun. Women would like \nto be able to carry a law to be able to fight for themselves.\n  No longer will employers also be able to use just any reason to \njustify paying a woman less. Oh, he is the breadwinner. Oh, they do a \nharder job. Well, when you talk to Kerri, the mechanical engineer, they \nwere doing the same job. In fact, in some instances she was the actual \nsupervisor. For Latoya, working in the hotel, they were doing exactly \nthe same job, and the EEOC verified that. So this is why it is \nimportant.\n  The other thing is, no longer will women be limited just to backpay. \nThey will be able to get punitive damages. Because in many businesses, \nwhen they are caught, the current law catches up with them, they just \npay a fine and see it as a cost of doing business. Well, that is not \nfine with us. We want to make sure if you feel you have suffered these \ninjustices, you will be able to seek redress through punitive damages. \nAnd no longer will women be on their own.\n  The consequences of the pay gap are significant. Let's take a college \ngraduate--a woman who has had the benefit of an education. For women \nbetween ages 25 and 29, the annual pay gap now is about $1,700 a year. \nFor women closer to retirement age, it is more like $14,000 a year. \nOver a lifetime, for many women, it is $400,000.\n\n  This has enormous consequences. When you are paid less--when you are \npaid less--it affects not only your paycheck that you take home, but it \nwill affect your retirement because Social Security is pegged to \nearnings. So when you pay women less, they are going to get less in \nretirement. This is not fair.\n  Now, I will tell you what I am tired of hearing--that somehow or \nanother we are too emotional when we talk. When we raise an issue, we \nare too emotional. Well, I am emotional. I am so emotional about this. \nI am telling you, if we do not pass this bill, I am so emotional I am \ngoing to press on. It brings tears to my eyes to know how women, every \nsingle day, are working so hard and are getting paid less. It makes me \nemotional to hear that.\n  Then, when I hear all of these phony reasons--some are mean and some \nare meaningless--I do get emotional; I get angry; I get outraged; I get \nvolcanic. And the way I want to channel my emotions is by doing \neverything we can do to be able to pass this bill.\n  There are those who say: This is a lawyer's dream. It is not a \nlawyer's dream; it is a family's dream. If they are afraid of lawsuits, \nthey ought to follow the law. The best way not to have a lawsuit is to \nfollow the law. So do not retaliate against a worker, because if you \ndo, you are going to have to pay up. If you have loopholes that are \nmean or meaningless, yes, that employee might sue. But guess what. The \nway to avoid the lawsuit is do not be mean, do not be cruel, do not be \nunfair, do not be unjust. And if you think we are emotional, wait until \nyou see what happens if this bill fails. We are pretty emotional about \nthis.\n  Madam President, you and I have talked about this. Whether it is in \nNorth Dakota or north Baltimore, we feel the same, that when you work \nhard, play by the rules, do the same job, you want the same pay. \nAmerican women need a fair shot at equal pay for equal work--the same \npay for the same job. We need to pass this legislation today.\n  Let us adopt the motion to proceed so we can get actually on the bill \nto discuss it, offer amendments. There are those, I know, who have \nother ideas and suggestions. We look forward to that. And then, at the \nend of the day and the end of the week, let's pass it.\n  I think today is a day of reckoning: Do you want equal pay for equal \nwork? And I want men and women all across America to be emotional about \nit.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I would like to take a few minutes to \nspeak on the bill being considered today, the Paycheck Fairness Act. \nThe proponents of the Paycheck Fairness Act argue that many women \ncontinue to earn significantly less pay than men for equal work. I am \nafraid the effort to consider this bill is nothing more than election-\nyear politics aimed at scoring political points.\n\n[[Page S2298]]\n\n  Equally unfortunate, the bill will do nothing to address our Nation's \nanemic economic growth. It will not create a single job for the more \nthan 10 million unemployed Americans. This bill does nothing for the \nmillions of Americans who have become so discouraged with this economy \nthat they have completely given up on looking for work. This political \nshow-vote will not help the millions of women who have lost their jobs \nor who are now living in poverty as a result of the Obama economy.\n  Let me be clear: I strongly support equal pay for equal work. I \nsupport equal employment opportunities. I abhor discrimination of any \nkind. Discrimination in the workplace is unacceptable, and must not be \ntolerated. Workers have been protected against sex-based pay \ndiscrimination since the passage of the Equal Pay Act in 1963. Title \nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides additional protections and \nremedies for discrimination.\n  Many have concerns that the Paycheck Fairness Act would undermine a \nbusiness's defense even when the pay disparity is legitimate. The bill \nwould allow unlimited punitive and compensatory damages, while also \nautomatically including employees in a class-action lawsuit unless they \nspecifically choose to opt out. This bill would be a boon to trial \nlawyers at the expense of job creators and job seekers.\n  A Washington Post Editorial from September 28, 2010, stated, `` the \nproposal, which builds on the existing Equal Pay Act, would allow \nemployees and courts to intrude too far into core business decisions.'' \nIt further stated, ``Discrimination is abhorrent, but the Paycheck \nFairness Act is not the right fix.''\n  Rather than consider a politically motivated measure, we should be \nworking together to create good-paying jobs and grow the economy. \nInstead, the Democratic leadership has chosen to disregard the welfare \nof struggling Americans and pursue messaging bills. If the majority in \nthe Senate truly cared about helping the middle class, they would allow \nconsideration of Republican amendments that would actually help \nworkers, help the unemployed find work, and grow the economy.\n  But just like consideration of the unemployment insurance extension \nbill, the Senate majority has no interest in considering amendments \nthat would actually grow the economy and create jobs. During \nconsideration of that bill, Republicans offered a job-creating \namendment that would have repealed provisions of ObamaCare that are \nproven job killers. It would have spurred job creation through energy \ndevelopment, including authorizing the construction of the Keystone XL \nPipeline. It would have provided small businesses, who are responsible \nfor creating 70 percent of jobs in our economy, with permanent tax \nrelief aimed at incentivizing new investments. A version of this \namendment has been filed to this bill. Unfortunately, the majority \nleader is again blocking consideration of any amendments.\n  While the majority leader pushes ahead with his political agenda, \nRepublicans continue to propose measures that will create jobs and grow \nthe economy. Senator McConnell and Senator Ayotte have put forward an \namendment to allow voluntary flexible workplace arrangements such as \ncompensatory time and flexible credit hour agreements for hourly \nworkers. This amendment would provide much needed flexibility for \nworking moms, but was immediately blocked by the majority leader. Why \nwould the majority leader block consideration of such a reasonable \nproposal?\n  Senator Alexander has also proposed an amendment that seeks to \nprovide working parents more flexibility in the workplace. Senator \nRubio has proposed an amendment to allow employees to seek fair wage \nincreases and remove obstacles for employees to earn merit-based pay \nraises. In addition, Senators Fischer, Collins and Ayotte have filed an \namendment to reaffirm existing laws prohibiting pay discrimination and \nwould prohibit retaliation against employees who inquire about, discuss \nor disclose their salaries.\n  Sadly, none of these reasonable, thoughtful amendments to address job \ncreation and workplace flexibility will be considered because the \nmajority leader has already signaled that this debate is not about \nlegislating. It's about political messaging. For these reasons, I must \nvote against the procedural motion to proceed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, today we will decide whether to begin \ndebate on the Paycheck Fairness Act. I am an original cosponsor of this \nbill, I strongly support it and the ideals that motivate it, and I hope \nthat someday we can pass this legislation. But today's vote is not on \nfinal passage. It is not even a vote on whether to end debate on this \nmeasure. It is a vote on whether to begin the debate. Those who vote \nagainst cloture on this motion to proceed are not just saying they \noppose equal pay for women; they are saying they do not even want to \ndiscuss it.\n  But a refusal to debate this measure will not make this issue go \naway. The fact remains that in our country today, women make 77 cents \nfor every dollar men earn. Some of our Republican colleagues suggest \nthere's nothing we can do about it.\n  As a Democrat I believe that our prosperity rests on a principle--the \nidea that if you work hard and play by the rules, you should have a \nfair shot to provide for your family, your future and your children's \nfuture. The promise of that better future is part of what gets us up \nevery morning, gets us on the bus or in the car, and gets us to the \noffice or the shop or the factory floor. It is the promise that our \nwork will be rewarded.\n  The obvious and persistent pay gap between men and women does \nviolence to that promise. Under current conditions, the message we send \nto women is this: ``Work hard, play by the rules, and you'll get three \nquarters for every dollar's worth of work you do.'' Democrats believe \nthat is unfair--unfair to the women it shortchanges and to the families \nthey support. And we believe that even those of us who are not working \nwomen lose something when we do not live up to the principles of \nfairness and opportunity that give all of us hope for that better \nfuture.\n  And we Democrats want to do something about it. When you think about \nit, what we want to do should not be that controversial. Here is all \nthis bill does: It requires employers to ensure that when men and women \nare paid differently, that the difference is related to factors such as \neducation, training and experience, and not merely based on gender; and \nit strengthens protections against retaliation by employers for women \nwho file discrimination complaints.\n  Surely we can all agree that pay differences should be limited to \nfactors that truly reflect qualification and performance, and not \ndetermined by gender. Surely we can all agree that when an employee \nbelieves she or he is being treated unfairly, or that their employer \nhas violated the law, they have the right to seek redress without fear \nof retribution.\n  Those who care about the 60 percent of American households that \ndepend partly or entirely on a woman's income should support this bill. \nThose who care about the 6.9 million women trying to raise a family on \nwhat is now three-quarters of what they have worked for should support \nthis bill. Those who care about making this a society that lives up to \nour professed goals of equal opportunity should support this bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, 5 years ago, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct was signed into law by President Obama. That bill--necessary \nbecause of a divided decision by the Supreme Court to strike a blow to \nthe rights of working families in Vermont and across the country--was a \nfirst step in closing the still-existing gender wage gap. Today, one \nday after commemorating Equal Pay Day, Senators will once again have \nthe opportunity to stand with working families and support equal pay \nfor equal work, regardless of gender.\n  I am proud to cosponsor the Paycheck Fairness Act, which Senator \nMikulski--a trailblazer herself--has once again introduced to close \nloopholes that allow employers to unfairly discriminate workers based \non gender. Thanks to the hard work and perseverance of earlier \ngenerations, working women today have career and business opportunities \nnever before available. Yet, despite the gains we have made, there \nremains a troubling constant--women continue to earn less than men. \nAccording to the Census Bureau, women still only earn 77 cents for\n\n[[Page S2299]]\n\nevery dollar a man earns. This disparity has real-world, financial \nconsequences: on average, women are paid more than $11,000 per year \nless than men. And of American households with children under the age \nof 18, 40 percent list women as their sole or primary earners. The wage \ngap based on gender is hurting low- and middle-income families who, in \ntoday's economy, still wrestle with putting food on the table, heating \ntheir homes, paying the mortgage, and saving for college.\n  Vermont has been a national leader in addressing equal pay for equal \nwork. In 2002, Vermont adopted its own Equal Pay Act, making it illegal \nfor employers to offer anything less than equal pay for equal work. \nStill, in Vermont, where 22,000 households are headed by women, the \nyearly gender pay gap is nearly $6,000. More needs to be done, and we \ncan do better.\n  Our national march toward equality continues. The Paycheck Fairness \nAct builds on efforts that date back more than 50 years to ensure a \nbalanced and equal playing field in the workplace for both men and \nwomen. The Paycheck Fairness Act will require employers to show a \ndifference in pay is truly linked to job performance and not to gender. \nIt will protect employees from being retaliated against by their \nemployers for discussing salaries with colleagues, and remove obstacles \nto challenging pay discrimination in a court of law. It will provide \nemployers with assistance to create equal pay practices and recognize \nthose who already adhere to such practices. These are commonsense \nprovisions we can all support.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act has twice before been filibustered in the \nSenate. Meanwhile, hard-working families across the country, anchored \nby the incomes of hard-working women, continue to struggle. Equal pay \nfor equal work is a matter of simple fairness, and the Paycheck \nFairness Act is an important step towards just that. I urge all \nSenators to support this bill.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we just lost the vote today on a \ncloture vote to proceed to the Paycheck Fairness Act, but I want \neveryone to know--everyone in the Senate and everyone in the United \nStates of America--although we lost the vote, we refuse to lose the \nbattle. We are going to continue the fight. We are going to continue \nthe fight to get equal pay for equal work, to lift the veil of secrecy \non pay in the workplace, to end the retaliation if you fight for your \nrights, and to close loopholes that are mean or meaningless.\n  We have been here before. I remember when we had the first vote on \nthe Lilly Ledbetter bill. We lost that vote, but we pressed on. Women \nall over America expressed their frustration and their outrage. In 2009 \nwe were able to right that wrong and pass the Lilly Ledbetter bill and \nopen the courthouse doors.\n  So here we are again. We are ready to continue that fight. We are \nready to turn our biggest noes into our biggest yeses. We will continue \nthe war against the wage gap and wage discrimination against women.\n  Women of America, I say to you, join us in this fight. Make your \nvoices heard if you want to change the Federal lawbooks so we can make \na change in your family checkbook.\n  We are going to finish what we started with Lilly Ledbetter and bring \nthe Paycheck Fairness Act back to the\n\n[[Page S2300]]\n\nfloor. When Senator Reid voted no, it was so that he could bring up \nanother vote on the motion to proceed. But this is not about \nparliamentary procedure; this is about how we will press the fight.\n  When we lost Lilly Ledbetter, I came to the floor then, and I come to \nthe floor now, to say that when we continue this fight, I will remind \nmy colleagues about what Abigail Adams once said to her husband: As you \nare making those laws down there, she said, ``do not forget the ladies. \nFor we will foment a revolution of our own.''\n  So women of America--and the good men who support us--keep the \nrevolution going. I said then, as I say now, let's suit up, let's \nsquare our shoulders. For the women, put on your lipstick and let's \nfight on. We will be back another day for another vote.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I applaud my colleague Senator Mikulski \nfor her great work, in spite of the result today.\n\n\n                    Congratulating the UConn Huskies\n\n  I am here on the floor, however, to congratulate my UConn Huskies for \na double national championship. It has only been done once before in \nthe history of college basketball--the men winning a national \nchampionship and the women winning a national championship in the same \nyear--and the last time it was us too, in 2004 and now in 2014. So, \nvery briefly, I wish to add my congratulations to those offered by \nSenator Blumenthal.\n  Our new coach, Kevin Ollie, when he took the job, went on TV and said \nthat despite some of the tough times surrounding the UConn program, his \nintent was for UConn basketball to take the stairs and not the \nelevator.\n  He said elevators were for cowards, and they were going to walk one \nstep at a time towards a national championship.\n  Given the fact our long-time Hall of Fame coach had just left, we had \nsanctions which didn't allow our team to play for a year in the \npostseason. People thought it just wasn't possible that UConn was ever \ngoing to be able to return to the greatness we have seen over the last \n20 years. But in Coach Ollie's first tournament, he brought his team to \na victory led, of course, by our great point guard Shabazz Napier--\nanother Connecticut first and second. There are only two players who \nwere national champions in the men's tournament who scored 125 points, \nhad 25 assists and 25 rebounds. Shabazz Napier is the second because \nKemba Walker was the first in UConn's last national championship.\n  The women, of course, are even more impressive in what they have done \nbecause they managed to win their national championship this year by \ngoing undefeated and beating another undefeated team in the national \nchampionship game. Of course, that has become kind of old hat for the \nUConn women. This is the third time they have gone undefeated in the \npast 6 years, and it is their fourth title in 6 years--Geno Auriemma's \nninth title overall, now eclipsing the great Pat Summitt.\n  Watching the game last night, we saw Coach Auriemma in an uncommon \ndisplay of emotion at the end of the game. He is a very emotional guy, \nbut he very rarely breaks down in tears--which he did, talking about a \ncouple of his seniors, Stefanie Dolson and also Bria Hartley. He has a \nlove for those players.\n  We saw Kevin Ollie's love for his players, especially the guys who \nstuck it out who could have transferred to other programs but decided \nto stay with him and stay with the program.\n  What Geno said after the game is he is flattered: ``I'm flattered and \ngrateful, and all the things that have come with this kind of \naccomplishment . . .'' But he also said: ``I'm more proud of the legacy \nthat exists and what Connecticut basketball is as opposed to the number \nof championships.\n  When we watch these championship games that now add up for both the \nmen and the women, we see throughout the stands former players by the \ndozens--maybe even by the hundreds--who come back because of the legacy \nthat has been created in 20 years of nine national championships for \nthe women and four national championships for the men.\n  Even though, as Kevin Ollie said, UConn got there the hard way. We \ndon't have the 100-year legacy of basketball such as Kansas or Kentucky \nhas. We have built this over the past couple of decades. Just as Kevin \nOllie has done over the last 2 years, UConn over the course of the last \nthe 2 decades, in registering 13 national championships, has always \ntaken the stairs rather than the elevator.\n  Congratulations, as a diehard Husky fan, to our twin national \nchampionship teams.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                          Congratulating UConn\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, this is not easy for me to do, but I am \ngoing to do it in good grace here. I congratulate my colleague from \nConnecticut on The University of Connecticut's victory over the \nUniversity of Notre Dame last night.\n  He watched in joy and exuberance, and I watched in dismay. But I do \nwant to congratulate the Senator and those from Connecticut for the \nsingular achievement of having both men's and women's basketball \nchampionships.\n  Those of us in Indiana are deeply immersed in the basketball culture. \nStatewide, we didn't have the best year or the kind of year we would \nhave liked. But we were very proud of the University of Notre Dame \nwomen and the accomplishments they made--in an undefeated season until \nlast evening.\n  It probably is not politic for me to say this, but it is unfortunate \nthat our all-American center, who was one of the keys to the success of \nthe team, unfortunately had a knee injury which prevented her from \nplaying. I am not saying we would have won had she played because I \ndon't want to take anything away from the Huskies. On the other hand, I \nthink it could have been a more contested contest had she been able to \nbe a part of that.\n  Either way, both teams deserve congratulations for the phenomenal \nseasons they had. It was a joy to watch from Indiana our Notre Dame \nwomen do so well, just as it was a joy for Senator Murphy to watch his \nmen and women do so well. So I congratulate him for that.\n\n\n                           Russian Aggression\n\n  Madam President, I rise to advocate for something obviously far more \nserious and threatening to us than basketball contests, and that is our \nresponse to Russia's recent unlawful takeover of Crimea. I urge, and \ncontinue to urge, the President as well as our colleagues in the Senate \nto take more vigorous action to deter further Russian aggression.\n  As I speak, anxieties are building that Vladimir Putin's first big \nbite out of Ukraine has not satisfied him and he hungers for more. Many \nsigns indicate Russian aggression threatens further incursions into \nEastern Ukraine and possibly beyond.\n  Troops are positioned on the border, logistics for an invasion are \narranged, and the Russian propaganda machine is once again ginning up \nthe excuses needed to justify unjustifiable actions. The only thing I \ncan conclude is that the lack of an effective, forceful response by the \nUnited States and by our allies--particularly our European allies--has \ngiven President Putin reason to expect that further aggression will not \nbe punished. Despite all the rhetoric, despite all the tough talk, very \nlittle has been done, and--with what little has been done--there has \nbeen no effect to deter and to condemn what has taken place and deter \nfurther aggression.\n  From the beginning of this blatant act, I have waited for the \nadministration to impose real costs on Russia for its illegal \nterritorial aggression. So far, I have waited in vain.\n  For the past month, in two separate resolutions which I have offered \non the floor, several speeches, and numerous opinion columns I have \nwritten in the media, I have consistently attempted to make the case \nfor hard-hitting sanctions on Russia. I joined Senator Durbin, my \ncolleague from Illinois, to achieve a unanimous bipartisan passage of \nan initial list of sanctions which would signal to Putin that the \nSenate was unified in condemning and sanctioning Russia for its blatant \ntakeover of Crimea.\n  I stated at the time that this was an initial list and much tougher \nsanctions needed to come. But I wanted to give\n\n[[Page S2301]]\n\nthe administration time to fashion those, to work with our allies \nacross the ocean and to stand strong for the type of hard-hitting, \nhard-biting economic sanctions which would make Russia pay a real \nprice, as we had said we were going to do.\n  The administration has to take the lead on economic sanctions because \nto implement the steps needed to ensure maximum effectiveness we need \nto coordinate with our friends and our allies. But I have seen little \nevidence that the administration is leading our European friends in the \ndirection of such sanctions. I have not seen evidence that our European \nallies are willing to take the lead. I am therefore wondering if anyone \nis willing to take a lead in this effort.\n  More needs to be done--and more needs to be done now. With Russian \ntroops mounting their vehicles on the Ukrainian border, the United \nStates should be using every means available to press for firm \nmeasures, and our European allies should be joining us in this cause. \nThose measures should include imposing serious costs so such behavior \nwill not be repeated.\n  Further, we should defend our allies and reassure them that we have \ntheir backs. We need to isolate Russia and prevent it from \nparticipating in organizations that give Putin credibility and \nstrength. We should impose obstacles to prevent Russia from taking \nmaterial advantage of their conquest, and we should convince other \nnations, businesses, and individuals to follow our lead.\n  I think recent history shows that in conflict issues around the \nworld, if the United States does not take a firm and a strong lead, \nother nations simply do not feel they have the strength or the backing \nto take that lead. So it is imperative the United States takes that \nlead, steered by our President, and supported by a bipartisan Congress \nto send a unified message that we are willing to address egregious \nbreaches of international law and lead the way in doing so.\n  The first task, as I see it, is to make sure we and others do not \naccept this aggression and annexation--what some others are already \ncalling a fait accompli. Since the United States' refusal to recognize \nSoviet annexation of the three Baltic states 74 years ago, we have \nfirmly and consistently refused to recognize such annexations. We must \ndo the same in this case.\n  Unfortunately, words and actions from this administration and from \nmany of our European allies continue to focus on threatening \nconsequences for future Russian incursions, rather than on the illegal \nannexation that has already taken place. It is exactly this reluctance \nto impose costs for the annexation of a portion of the Ukraine that \npaves the way for further Russian aggression.\n  I sadly note that some of our best European friends are downplaying \nthe importance of the invasion and annexation which have already taken \nplace.\n  Just as Chancellor Merkel from Germany was showing signs of a more \nforceful German foreign policy in defense of European territorial \nintegrity, it now appears Germany is showing more interest in dialogue \nand restraint, backing down from the tough talk about making Russia pay \na price for the actions it has taken. I am convinced there is very \nlittle reason to believe that further aggression will be adequately \ndiscouraged or punished.\n  In this policy vacuum, if we don't find leadership from our \nadministration or from the Europeans, I believe it is imperative that \nCongress act--and act now. So today, I am introducing yet another \nresponse in addition to those I have previously introduced addressing \nthis situation in Ukraine.\n  I will be introducing to the Senate the Crimea Annexation Non-\nRecognition Act--legislation which would mandate an official policy of \nnot recognizing Russian sovereignty over Crimea, its land, airspace, \nwaters, and resources.\n  The purpose of this act is to ensure the United States will not \nrecognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea nor take any action which \nwould imply such recognition. Further, my bill imposes obstacles to \nRussian exploitation of Crimean resources by taking greater legal \ncertainty about investing in Crimea, and it restricts foreign aid to \ncountries which recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea.\n  I will illustrate some of the specific proposals I have introduced.\n  First, establish firm policy that the United States Government does \nnot recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea, its territory, airspace, \nand territorial waters, and may take no action that implies any \nrecognition of Russian sovereignty.\n  Second, prohibit the United States from financing or guaranteeing \ninvestments in Crimea with Russia as an intermediary.\n  Third, oppose international financial institutions' assistance \nprograms for Crimea that go through Russia as an intermediary.\n  Fourth, require the Department of Justice to affirm this \nnonrecognition policy upon request, in order to create greater legal \nuncertainty for those who hope to contract with Russia for exploitation \nof Crimean resources.\n  Fifth, deny entry to vessels sailing from Crimea with Russian customs \ndocumentation.\n  Sixth, prohibit U.S. ships and aircraft from taking action that imply \nRussian sovereignty over Crimea, its airspace or territorial waters.\n  And, seventh, prohibit some forms of foreign assistance to countries \nthat recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea.\n  There are very few precedents in postwar history where a state has so \nboldly and aggressively used force against a neighbor for the purpose \nof territorial acquisition. What has happened in Crimea is a crime left \nover from an earlier age. We, together with our European friends, must \nmove aggressively to oppose it before it becomes repetitive.\n\n  At a time when so much depends on Vladmir Putin's unspoken plans, it \nis not hard to guess how he will respond to meekness. The American \nresponse must be much greater if we want Putin to understand that his \nactions in Ukraine are unacceptable and will not be tolerated. At a \nminimum, I would suggest, Congress must refuse to recognize Russian \nsovereignty over Crimea by passing my legislation. I have proposed a \nnumber of sanctions which were added to other measures I have \nintroduced and hopefully will convince this administration and our \nEuropean allies to take a much tougher stance and provide much more of \na penalty to Russia over the actions it has taken. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in this effort.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I wish to speak a little bit about the \nletters I have received and the emails and the calls over the last few \ndays about the health care plan.\n  The numbers signed up or whether the Web site worked--and I have said \nrepeatedly--aren't the test here. The test is, is this a better plan? \nDoes it allow more people to have better coverage or does it allow more \npeople to have lesser coverage? I am becoming more and more convinced \nthat the latter might be the case: the high deductibles, the increase \nin premiums, the benefit of a couple of years, actually, where the \ntrajectory of health care costs were still going up but were beginning \nto flatten out, and now they are projected to go up pretty dramatically \nover the next few years based on the recent projections.\n  So the real test is, is this plan a better plan, not does the Web \nsite work. The fact that the Web site doesn't work sort of shows the \nineptitude of government. The easiest thing in the world to do today--\nor should have been in 4 years--would be to figure out how to develop a \nWeb site. So I would say the Web site shouldn't be the test of whether \nthe health care plan works because the Web site will work. Apparently a \nnumber of States are having a problem, the Federal Government had a \nvery obvious problem, but the Web site will eventually work. Surely \nthat can't be a long-term problem. Given no other alternatives, people \nare going to eventually sign up in some numbers.\n  I am not interested even in finding out whether the numbers are real. \nI did\n\n[[Page S2302]]\n\nnotice that the President, as with most of the people I work for, in \nhis announcing the numbers the other day, referred to the plan as \nObamaCare again. I noticed he quit doing that since the election. He \nsaid he kind of liked ``ObamaCare''--in one of the Presidential debates \nin 2012 he said he liked the term--and then he pretty well quit using \nit. But with the signup numbers, he said some people call it ObamaCare, \nin his announcement the other day. So I guess if he can call it that, \nthe people I work for can call it that as well.\n  So we have premiums rising, deductibles going up, and hospitals \nseeing, in many cases, their fastest growing column of unpaid debt is \npeople with insurance. Not too long ago, we said: That doesn't make any \nsense. How did people with insurance wind up in the fastest growing \ncolumn of unpaid debt? It is because people's deductibles are, for many \nfamilies now, well beyond a deductible they can pay. If a person had a \n$500 deductible a few years ago and they have a $3,000 deductible \ntoday--if they had a hospital bill, they might be able to put $500 \ntogether and think that gets this bill paid. Nobody is going to call me \nanymore. I am not going to get this repeated notice. But if a person \nhas a $3,000 deductible, they might decide: I can never pay that, so I \nam going to let them do whatever they are going to have to do, and \nhopefully my insurance company pays enough of the bill that the \nhospital decides they are not going to bother me. But that is the \nfastest growing debt in many hospital accounting offices right now--\npeople who have insurance, who aren't paying their part of the bill.\n  But whether it is increases in premiums or increases in deductibles \nor they can't see their doctor, the people I work for in Missouri tell \nme every week a series of stories that I absolutely believe are true. I \nbasically verify with people before I come to the floor, before pulling \na few of these stories out: Do you mind, Timothy from Kirksville, if I \nmention that you have contacted us? I am not going to give your last \nname or put that on the record, but I would like to show that there is \nsome dispersing around our State of this problem. They say, yes, this \nis absolutely true, and I told you because I want people to know about \nthis.\n  Timothy from Kirksville, MO, said his premiums went up drastically in \n2013. If premiums continue to rise, he says his family will have to \nmake sacrifices elsewhere in their budget.\n  Kim from Frankford, MO, said she and her husband's deductible \nrecently increased dramatically to $6,000. So far, she says, it feels \nlike we don't have insurance because we have such a high deductible. We \ncouldn't pay it if we ever had to use it, so do you really have \ninsurance? Kim's parents recently tried to find a plan on the exchange \nand were shocked to learn that the cheapest plan they could find \noffered premiums of $1,200 a month with a $12,000 deductible. Yearly \npremiums were equal to 20 percent of their income.\n  Mike from Columbia, MO, said his health insurance premiums shot up by \n$1,000 this year--and $1,000 matters to families. Based on the letters \nI get, there would be some temptation to contact Mike and say, if you \nwant to look at a whole stack of letters here, $1,000 is not the worst \nstory people have to tell, but for a working family it is almost $100 a \nmonth. It is whatever you were going to do with that $100 a month that \nyou are not able to do because your insurance just went up $100 a \nmonth. Mike doesn't say anything about his deductible or what his \npremiums are, but he just says it is $1,000 more than it was last year.\n  Lisa from Jefferson City, MO, the State capital, said she and her \nhusband own a small business, and even though they don't have to \nprovide health insurance for their employees, they have done so and \nthey have chosen to pay 100 percent of the cost up until now.\n  Actually, until January of this year, no employer had to provide \ninsurance for their employees but most employers did. Eighty-five \npercent of everybody who had insurance got insurance at work. Ninety \npercent of them thought what they had at work was great for what they \nneeded to have for themselves and their family. We had a system that \nwas working pretty good, where almost everybody had it. Instead of \nfiguring out how to expand that system so other people could get in, I \nam afraid we have made it more difficult for everybody involved.\n  Lisa, the business owner, says her premiums went up 35 percent last \nyear, and they have been told already that they will go up even higher \nnext year. She says if the premiums continue to increase, they will \nsoon not be able to cover their employees.\n  Carol from Cameron, MO, said her coverage has gone down and her out-\nof-pocket costs have increased significantly. Her deductible is now \n$3,500 and she has to pay $65 every time she goes to see a doctor. She \nworries she will never be able to use the coverage she is paying for \nbecause the out-of-pocket costs are too high, and if she ever actually \ngot sick or had to go to the hospital or had a significant condition, \nshe is worried she can't pay the deductible, even though she is paying \nevery month to have this coverage and feels as though the coverage is \nnot truly insurance for her at all.\n  Merl and his wife in Cape Girardeau, MO, are in their late sixties. \nThey have Medicare and a supplemental policy, but their copays have \nincreased. One of their primary doctors has stopped taking Medicare. He \nand his wife are concerned they can't see the doctor they would like to \nsee, that their copays have increased, and their doctor left the \nprogram.\n  By the way, the administration, I guess the day before yesterday, \nannounced we weren't going to have the reductions in Medicare Advantage \nnext year as we had this year. We will still have this year's increase, \nbut we will not have next year's increase. Whoever thought that paying \nfor a new health care program out of Medicare was a good idea anyway? \nSo $500 billion out of Medicare, which has bigger and bigger problems \nall the time as more and more people enter Medicare--$500 billion out \nof Medicare to pay for yet another new system. Apparently, even the \nadministration, at least between now and the election, doesn't think \nthat is a good idea because they just suspended one of the pay-fors. \nThey said: We did that once, and that was kind of painful because \npeople could see what was going to happen to their Medicare Advantage, \nso we don't want to do that between now and election day--although I \nthink in fairness they didn't mention election day in the rule, they \njust mentioned it wasn't going to happen in this even-numbered year.\n  Mike from Kansas City, MO, says his premiums went from $600 a month \nto $700 for him and his wife. The deductible went from $5,000 to \n$7,500--he says all because of the new requirements and what has to be \ncovered.\n  Mark from Columbia, MO, says the doctor he has had for 18 years \njoined a network of concierge doctors because he is afraid of the \nPresident's health care plan limiting his ability to provide quality \ncare to his patients. Unfortunately, now that his doctor is part of a \nprivate network, Mark is no longer able to afford him--or to afford to \nsee him, and the doctor does not accept the insurance Mark is covered \nby.\n  All kinds of unintended consequences appear to be happening when the \ngovernment decides not only can it begin to involve itself in 17 \npercent of the economy of the country but in virtually everybody's \nhealth care decisionmaking process. This would be a big job for a very \nefficient government in a very small country. In a federalist system \nwhere we have 50 States and territories to deal with, in a big country, \nthis is very hard to do. It is unfortunate that all of the warnings \nabout the unintended consequences about people in the workplace will \nbegin to have part-time jobs instead of full-time jobs or people who \nhad less than 50 employees wouldn't want to go to 51 because they would \nthen be covered by a law they were not initially covered by--all of \nthose warnings have turned out to be at least as bad as those people \nsaying this could happen were saying they could be.\n  John in Overly, MO, went to healthcare.Gov to find a plan. The \ncheapest quote he could find for his family of four was $750 a month, \nand in John's case that is almost 30 percent of his income. He has \nlooked at the numbers and has decided it would be more affordable to go \nuninsured. He said:\n\n       I am self-employed, married, and have two children, and \n     though I am self-employed, I never had any trouble affording \n     health insurance for me and my family [until now].\n\n\n[[Page S2303]]\n\n\n  Richard is from Stoutsville, MO. His wife's premium last year was \n$359 a month, with a $5,000 deductible. This year it is $800 a month, \nand since they are on a fixed income, they have just decided they can \nno longer afford to pay for her individual insurance because they had \nto buy it as individuals.\n  I would just say that we need to look at these cases. Surely somebody \nout there has benefited from the system. There are people who were able \nto stay on their family policies longer. A piece of legislation I wrote \nwhen I was a Member of the House--it was 3\\1/4\\ pages long--apparently \nit would have added about as many people as any other single thing did, \nand it would have added those people whether you had the rest of this \nhealth care bill or not, at no cost to any taxpayer anywhere and no \ndisruption of anybody else's insurance coverage.\n  Those are the kinds of things we should have looked at. But we need \nto look at what it takes now to be sure we have a system that is not \nmeasured by whether the Web site works and not measured by an argument \nabout whether people who signed up paid but is measured by whether this \nreally does provide better health care.\n  Health care is critical to families. Somebody told me one time: When \neverybody in your family is well, you have lots of problems; when \nsomebody in your family is sick, you have one problem. That is how \nimportant health care is. We need to be sure this is a system that does \nnot meet some numerical or technical ``check the box'' but really does \nprovide access to what was the greatest health care system in the \nworld.\n  There are ways to encourage more access to that system and more \nchoices, not fewer choices and less access and more people who feel as \nthough they are paying a premium every month but if they ever really \nget sick, they really will not have insurance.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in the morning hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Alzheimer's Disease\n\n  Mr. MORAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, nearly every minute someone in America develops \nAlzheimer's disease. More than 5 million Americans suffer from this \ndisease and more than 35 million individuals worldwide. If trends \ncontinue, the number of individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease \nafter the age of 65 is expected to double every 5 years, while the \nnumber of people 85 years and older with this disease will triple by \n2050.\n  Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, \nand there is currently no cure, no diagnostic test, and no treatment \nfor this terrible disease.\n  As a nation, we must remain committed to defeating one of the \ngreatest health threats to the health and well-being of all Americans. \nCaring for those with Alzheimer's and other dementia is expected to \ncost $214 billion this year--$214 billion this year alone, with $150 \nbillion covered by the Federal Government through Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  A recent study outlined that the cost of care for those struggling \nwith dementia is projected to double over the next 30 years, surpassing \nhealth care expenses for both heart disease and cancer. Without a way \nto prevent, cure, or effectively treat Alzheimer's, costs will only \ncontinue to climb.\n  Alzheimer's has become a disease to define our generation. But if we \nfocus and prioritize our research capabilities, it need not remain an \ninevitable part of aging. There is reason for newfound hope. Over the \nlast 5 years, significant strides have been made in understanding how \nAlzheimer's disease affects the brain and body. This new understanding \nhas the potential to lead to new research opportunities and to better \nmanagement of the disease.\n  In February, the Senate Appropriations health subcommittee held a \nhearing on the impact of Alzheimer's--both economic and personal--and \nthe state of these current research initiatives. I am the ranking \nmember of that subcommittee. Chairman Harkin and I held this hearing to \nraise awareness of the threat to America's health, the impact on the \nfinancial well-being of our country, and to highlight the \ngroundbreaking research initiatives currently taking place.\n  For example, until 2009, only one genetic variant was known to \nincrease the risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. However, through \nadvances in genome studies and other technologies, the list of known \ngene risk factors has grown substantially. Now researchers have \nidentified 11 genetic risk factors.\n  The National Institutes of Health is supporting research that has \nestablished methods and standards for testing for biomarkers for \nAlzheimer's disease. Changes in these biomarkers may precede the onset \nof the disease and could be a key to unlocking the causes and \nprogression of the disease.\n  NIH has also made significant progress over the last several years \nand we continue to support them moving more aggressively toward \ndeveloping new treatments for Alzheimer's and related dementia. Several \ninnovative studies, ranging from research on the most basic \nunderpinnings of the disease to early-stage clinical trial of promising \nagents, are now underway.\n  A sustained Federal commitment to research for Alzheimer's will \nimprove health outcomes for people living with the disease both today \nand in the future, and it will also lower health care costs. I have \nbeen and remain committed to prioritizing the funding for Alzheimer's \nresearch.\n  Recently, I and other members of the Appropriations Committee worked \nto include a $1 billion funding increase for the National Institutes of \nHealth in the 2014 Omnibus appropriations bill. This amount includes a \n$100 million increase in funding for the National Institutes of Aging \nwithin NIH, as well as the initial year of funding for the new BRAIN \ninitiative to map the human brain. These research investments are \ncritically important because they will increase our understanding of \nthe underlying causes of Alzheimer's, help unlock the mysteries of the \nbrain, help bring us closer to an effective treatment and one day a \ncure.\n  Alzheimer's is a defining challenge of our generation. We must \ntogether commit to defeat this devastating disease by supporting the \ncritical research carried out by scientists and researchers across our \nNation. The health and financial future of our Nation are at stake, and \nthe United States cannot afford to ignore such a threat. Together, we \ncan make a sustained commitment to Alzheimer's research that will \nbenefit our Nation and bring hope to future generation of Americans. \nThe challenge is ours and the moment for us to act is now.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Oligarchy\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I hear more and more from people in my \nown State of Vermont and from people, in fact, all over the country via \nemail, through my Web site, who are wondering whether this great \ncountry is evolving into an oligarchic society.\n  Historically, as I think most people know, the United States was the \nenvy of the world for so many reasons. But one of the reasons, \neconomically, is that in our country there was always the belief that \nregardless of your income you have the opportunity to move up the \neconomic ladder. There was the reality--not just the belief--that we \nhad a great and expanding middle class; that if your dad and your mom \ndidn't go to college--which, in fact, was the case in my family--you \nwould have that opportunity to go to college and move up the \neducational ladder or the business ladder or professional field. There \nwas the feeling that economically what America was about, and what we \ncelebrated, was the great middle class. People today, both from an \neconomic perspective and from a political perspective, are beginning in \na\n\n[[Page S2304]]\n\nvery serious way to question that reality.\n  What they are looking at is that today in our country we have the \nmost unequal distribution of wealth and income of any major country on \nEarth. I think a lot of young people say, well, how could that be? In \nEngland you have the Queen of England, all the lords, all the royalty \nall over Europe, and we don't have that in the United States.\n  Yet the truth is that over the years we have moved to a situation \nwhere in terms of wealth and income, we are now the most unequal \nsociety of any major industrialized nation on Earth.\n  I keep mentioning one statistic, because I don't hear too many other \npeople talking about it, but we need to talk about it. That is, in \nterms of wealth. Wealth is what we own. Wealth is what we have \naccumulated over a lifetime of work. In terms of wealth, the top 1 \npercent in our Nation owns 38 percent of the financial wealth of \nAmerica.\n  I would ask those people back home who might be listening, what does \nthe bottom 60 percent own? The top 1 percent owns 38 percent of the \nwealth. What do you think the bottom 60 percent owns? They own 25 \npercent, 20 percent, 10 percent? What do they own? The answer is they \nown all of 2.3 percent--all of 2.3 percent is what the bottom 60 \npercent of Americans owns in terms of total wealth.\n  If you had a big pizza with 100 slices in it, 1 person would get 38 \npercent of those pieces of pizza if we looked at wealth, and the bottom \n60 percent of the people would have to share 2.3 percent of the pizza. \nI don't think that is what America is supposed to be about and that \nsituation is getting even worse.\n  In terms of income now--all right, everybody goes out and works--we \nhave millions of people today who are working longer hours and their \nincome is going down. Their wages are going down. Maybe they are paying \nmore for health care. Their pensions are going down.\n  But in terms of all new income--new income generated in this \ncountry--from the last statistics we saw, which were from 2009 to 2012, \nin terms of all new income, 95 percent of all new income went to the \ntop 1 percent. So more and more income goes to the millionaires and \nbillionaires while millions of people are working longer hours for \nlower wages, and while we have the highest rate of childhood poverty, \nat 22 percent, of any major country on Earth.\n  Since 1999, the typical middle-class family has seen its income go \ndown by more than $5,000. Do you want to know why people are angry, why \npeople are concerned, and why people are worried what is going to \nhappen to their kids? It is because the median family income has gone \ndown by $5,000 since 1999.\n  Let me break it down even further. The typical male worker, that guy \nright in the middle, made $283 less last year than he did 44 years ago. \nImagine that. In the last 44 years, with all of the increase in \nproductivity, with all of the robotics, with all of the space \ntechnology, all of the iPhones, iPads, and everything else where people \nare now producing much more, the typical male worker made $283 less \nlast year than he did 44 years ago. The typical female worker earned \n$1,775 less last year than she did in 2007.\n  Today in America we have more people living in poverty than ever \nbefore, and that is 46.5 million people. Here is a fact that should \nfrighten everybody; that is, half of Americans have less than $10,000 \nin their savings account right now. Can you imagine that? That means if \nyour car breaks down and you need that car to get to work or you have a \nserious health problem and you don't have particularly good health \ninsurance, there it goes. It goes.\n  Then you talk about people who are older who have to retire. How do \nyou retire with dignity if you have less than $10,000 in the bank? \nWell, you are going to get Social Security. Thank God, you, I, and \nother Members have fought hard to make sure there were not cuts in \nSocial Security that many people wanted. But is Social Security alone \nenough? No. The answer is it is not.\n  What is happening in this country is that while the middle class \nshrinks, there is another reality; that is, the people on top are doing \nphenomenally well. Today we see a situation in which some of the \nwealthiest families in America--the Koch brothers come to mind, and I \nwill talk about them in another context. They are now worth $80 \nbillion. In the last year alone their wealth went from $68 billion to \n$80 billion--in 1 year a $12 billion increase in their wealth.\n  Sheldon Adelson--another billionaire who has had his name in the \npaper a whole lot recently by bringing prospective Republican \ncandidates for the Presidency to Las Vegas to talk to them and see what \nthey have to offer him and how much money he will contribute to their \ncampaign--also saw a huge increase in his wealth over the last year.\n  What is the face of oligarchy? The face of oligarchy is what we see \nin Russia. When many people refer to oligarchy, they think of Russia. \nIn Russia, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, a small number of \nbureaucrats were able to steal a lot of public property, and they \nbecame multibillionaires. They controlled oil companies, banks, gold \nmines, aluminum companies, television stations, and other state-owned \ncompanies, and that is how they became oligarchs.\n  By 2001 5 oligarchs controlled 95 percent of Russia's aluminum \nproduction, 40 percent of its copper, and on and on it goes. People may \nsay: Oligarchy has to do with Russia; what does it have to do with the \nUnited States of America? Well, it has everything to do with the United \nStates of America because that is the direction in which we are moving.\n  Now, let me cite some examples of what oligarchs do. When we think of \noligarchies we might want to think of a gentleman named Hank McKinnel, \nJr., who was the CEO of Pfizer--a major drug company--from 2001 to \n2006. When he retired, he received a $188 million golden parachute--\n$188 million--at the same time as the people in our country are paying \nthe highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. That is \noligarchy.\n  When we think about oligarchy, we may want to think about a gentleman \nnamed Lee Raymond who served as the CEO of ExxonMobil from 1993 to \n2005. When he retired--and remember, this is at a time when the vast \nmajority of the American people did not have the resources to retire \nwith a shred of dignity--Mr. Raymond received from ExxonMobil a golden \nparachute, retirement benefits, of more than $320 million--$320 \nmillion. That is at the same time as people in Vermont and all over \nthis country are finding it harder and harder to pay for gas at the \npump.\n  What oligarchy is also about is that in 2009 ExxonMobil, maybe the \nmost profitable corporation in the history of America, did not pay any \nFederal income taxes, even though in that year it earned $19 billion in \nprofits.\n  When we talk about oligarchy we might want to think about somebody \nlike Jamie Dimon, who is the CEO of JPMorgan Chase. He recently \nreceived a 74-percent increase in pay--more than $20 million in total \ncompensation. Interestingly enough, that is a pretty big salary--$20 \nmillion--but what did he do to earn it? During that same period, over \nthe last year, the bank he runs, JPMorgan Chase, paid out over $20 \nbillion in penalties to the Federal Government for financial fraud. So \nafter paying out $20 billion to the Federal Government in penalties for \nfinancial fraud, he still got a $20 million compensation package. That \nis called oligarchy. No matter what you do, if you are at the head of a \nlarge financial institution, you are going to get rewarded for that.\n  Oligarchy has a lot to do with a gentleman named William Mcguire, the \nCEO of UnitedHealth Group from 1991 to 2006. Everybody knows of the \ncrisis we are facing in health care. Everybody knows that tens of \nmillions of Americans today, despite the Affordable Care Act, are still \nuninsured. Everybody knows we spend more per capita on health care than \ndo the people of any other nation. Yet when this gentleman retired from \nUnitedHealth Group in 2006, he received a $285 million golden \nparachute. So here we have the most dysfunctional health care system in \nthe world, the most expensive health care system, with tens of millions \nof people uninsured, yet the head of a major insurance company gets \n$285 million in retirement benefits. That is called oligarchy.\n\n[[Page S2305]]\n\n  Let me take oligarchy away from the economic realm and turn it into \nan area that I am--and many Americans are--very concerned about. \nRecently, we saw an interesting spectacle relating to politics that \ntook place in Las Vegas. A gentleman named Sheldon Adelson--who is \nworth some $38 billion, and who is maybe the world's largest casino \nmagnate not only in Las Vegas but off the shores of China as well--held \na meeting in Las Vegas in which he brought forth Republican candidates \nwho are interested in running for President. Now, here is the point. In \nthe last Presidential election, both President Obama and Mitt Romney \nspent a little over $1 billion in their campaigns. Sheldon Adelson, if \nhe provided more money into a campaign than both Obama and Romney \nspent, would still have $9 billion more in wealth than he did in 2013.\n  What am I saying? What I am saying is that we are moving toward a \nsituation where people such as the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson \nhave so much money it would hardly matter to them to write a check for \nmore than both Obama and Romney spent in the last Presidential \nelection. They could write out a check for $2 billion, and it would be \ninsignificant, a fraction of their increase in wealth over a 1-year \nperiod.\n  As bad as that situation is, because of the disastrous Citizens \nUnited Supreme Court decision, we may not have seen the worst yet. \nJudge Thomas, of the Supreme Court, the most conservative member of a \nvery conservative Supreme Court, wrote an opinion which said: Maybe we \nshould look at doing away with all limitations on campaign finance. \nMany Republicans think that is a great idea. Let us do away with all \nlimitations.\n  In the real world, what does that mean? It means that billionaires--\npeople who are worth $20 billion and, in the case of the Koch brothers, \n$80 billion--if we moved in that direction and ended all limitations on \ncampaign spending, could sit in a room--and the Presiding Officer comes \nfrom the State of Wisconsin, a moderate-sized State--and they could \nwrite a check for $50 million or $100 million for a candidate for \nSenate or Congress or Governor of Wisconsin or of Vermont or anyplace \nelse, and it would not matter at all.\n  So I want people to take a deep breath and think about whether that \nis what we believe American democracy is supposed to be. When I grew \nup, we believed what American democracy was about--and we still \npractice it to a large degree in the State of Vermont, where we have \ntown meetings. On the first Tuesday in March people come out, and they \nargue about the school budget, and they argue about other budgetary \nitems, and every person has a say and every person has a vote. In my \ncareer, I have done hundreds and hundreds of town meetings, where \npeople from any walk of life can walk in the door and can ask any \nquestion they want. I think democracy is about elected officials \ntalking and communicating with people, regardless of their income, and \nlistening to their comments and answering their questions. That is what \ndemocracy is about.\n\n  I do not believe democracy is about a handful of billionaires, such \nas the Koch brothers or Sheldon Adelson, being in a position in which \nthey can spend as much money as they want on any political race in this \ncountry. It is very hard for me to imagine how anybody could defend \nthat as being democracy. It is not. It is oligarchy. It is the power of \na handful of billionaires to control the political process.\n  So both in terms of economics, where so few own so much and so many \nhave so little, and in terms of politics, where a handful of \nbillionaires increasingly are able to determine the nature of politics \nin America and who is elected and who is defeated, I think we as a \nnation have a lot of hard thinking in front of us. We have to ask \nourselves: Are we going to fight for our democracy and an expanded \nmiddle class? Are we going to fight for a democracy where one person \nhas one vote and billionaires cannot fight elections? To my mind, that \nis the most important issue we face as a nation.\n  I hope the American people become engaged in that struggle and are \nprepared to take on the billionaires, who, apparently, are not content \nto have $10 billion or $20 billion in wealth. They feel the need to \nhave more and more and more and to take that money out of the hides of \nworking families, the elderly, the children, the sick, and the poor. \nThey want more tax breaks for billionaires, and then they want to cut \nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicaid, education, and every other program \nthat is of importance to working families.\n  So we need a very serious debate about these issues. We need millions \nof Americans to stand and fight with us to defend American democracy \nand to stop this country from evolving into an oligarchic form of \nsociety.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I come to the floor about an hour or \nso after a vote on a motion to proceed to take up the Paycheck Fairness \nAct. I struggled with my decision as to whether to move to this measure \nthat I feel was flawed in terms of its approach to a solution or to \nrecognize that perhaps this measure was more of an exercise in \npolitical messaging rather than an effort to resolve what I believe is \nan issue.\n  In sorting through all aspects of not only the merits of the \nlegislation, but also the facts as they exist back home, the facts as \nthey exist around this country, where we see pay disparity between men \nand women, I had a lot on my mind. I had a lot to weigh. I did not come \nto the floor yesterday to speak with the many who rose to either offer \nproposed amendments to the Paycheck Fairness Act or those who rose to \nspeak to defend the act. I don't want my silence yesterday to be \nconstrued that I don't think there is an issue here; that I don't think \nthis is something that needs to be addressed.\n  Yesterday was national Equal Pay Day, the day when, according to the \nDepartment of Labor, women's wages supposedly catch up to men's wages. \nWe can argue and we can debate what that gap is--whether it is 77 \ncents, whether those statistics are outdated, whether it is closer to \n82 cents or what the raw statistics are. We can debate that. But the \nfact is--and I think the Presiding Officer and I would agree--if there \nis any discrepancy there, it is worth looking at. Why does a \ndiscrepancy exist? Is there disparity that stems from discrimination? \nBecause if it stems from discrimination, it should not be allowed--\npretty simply.\n  In Alaska, the statistics are a little bit different than what we \nhave on the national level. In my State, Equal Pay Day is not going to \noccur until May 5.\n\n  As an Alaskan, as a woman, and as one who has been in the Alaska job \nmarket, I want to know: Why the greater disparity in my State?\n  We had a women's summit in Anchorage, AK, last October. I worked with \na former colleague in the Alaska State legislature to host a summit \ndesigned to look at many of the issues women face in Alaska, whether it \nis pay disparity, childcare affordability, access to health care--so \nmany of the issues and concerns women all over the country deal with \nday to day. We relied on a study from the state Legislative Research \nServices. A portion of the research tried to drill down into some of \nthe pay disparities we have in the State.\n  In 2010 our State Department of Labor reported a wage gap of 67 cents \nor 33 percent. This statistic is different from the overall national \naverages because that review conducted by Legislative Research Services \nincluded part-time as well as full-time workers and part-time workers \ngenerally receive lower salaries. That may be one reason for the \ndisparity.\n  But when we look at some of the areas where there are discrepancies, \nit really does cause one to say: Wait a minute. In areas where \noccupations are significantly male-dominated--crab fishermen, for \ninstance, welders on the pipeline--occupations where the pay is really \nquite substantial, we might look at that and say, OK, I understand why \nthere might be a discrepancy. But there are other occupations that have \nsome surprising statistics. For example, back in 2010 the average \nearnings for a male physician were $229,312, but the average for a \nwoman physician was $166,000. It doesn't make sense.\n  In certain areas, women out-earn men--dietitians, for instance. The \nratio of women's to men's earnings is 170 percent, according to the raw \nnumbers. For legal secretaries, the ratio of women's to men's earnings \nis 132 percent.\n\n[[Page S2306]]\n\nFor teachers, the ratio of women's to men's earnings is 125 percent.\n  We need to peel back the onion to understand what we are dealing \nwith--is this a situation where it is the difference in the career \nchoice that has made the distinction with the pay disparity? If that is \nthe case, what are we doing to encourage women to go into areas where, \nquite clearly, earning opportunities are better?\n  When we look at occupations, I think it is something that needs to be \nconsidered. When we talk about a wage disparity, a pay disparity, I \nthink we need to look very critically at whether there are other \nfactors that come into play. Is it a career choice? Is it the need or \ndesire for flexibility?\n  Starting out as a young lawyer in Anchorage, I was making what the \nyoung men in the firm were making. But when my husband and I decided \nthat I wanted to spend more time at home with our boys, I negotiated \nfor that level of flexibility. That put me behind my male counterparts \nin the firm. I was good with that. That was a choice I made. I wanted \nthat flexibility.\n  Are there other nonmonetary forms of compensation that perhaps the \nwage gap statistics don't necessarily respect? We don't know. So this \nis where I came down in my decision process as to which direction to \ntake on the Paycheck Fairness Act vote that we had just an hour or so \nago. Do we want to try to address what I believe is an issue in that we \ndo have a disparity but how we understand what causes that disparity \nand, then, what we do with that going forward is an important \nconsideration.\n  We have the Equal Pay Act of 1963 that imposes strict liability for \nwage disparity based on gender. It is in law. We have title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964 that protects against all forms of employment \ndiscrimination, including on the basis of sex. But maybe we are not \nenforcing these Federal laws as we need to. If after all these years we \nare still seeing areas of disparity that we cannot reconcile based on \noccupation or based on desire for flexibility, does there continue to \nbe discrimination? That is what we need to get to.\n  That is why I and many of my colleagues supported some of the \namendments that were presented yesterday and I think were important to \npresent--to make sure there is no retaliation for a woman when she \ninquires as to what others are making to determine whether there is \ndiscrimination, so making sure we are able to access that information. \nHowever, when we take a proposal like the Paycheck Fairness Act that \nhas an initial presumption that the employer has unlawfully \ndiscriminated against an employee if there is a difference in pay--if \nwe start off with a presumption of discrimination, it is pretty hard \nfor an employer--particularly a small employer--to deal with that, to \ndefend that, to present the case, to really work through this issue.\n  The solution should not be more litigation as the Paycheck Fairness \nAct response is here. The solution needs to be more all-encompassing \nbecause we have laws on the books that already say it is illegal to \ndiscriminate. If we are still seeing instances of discrimination--and, \nagain, let's figure out where and why and how--then let's honestly try \nto address that rather than through messaging efforts that are designed \nto elevate the issue, which is fair, but then not be pragmatic about \nhow we approach the solutions.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from \nthis morning's Washington Post titled ``President Obama's persistent \n`77-cent' claim on wage gap gets a new Pinocchio rating.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 9, 2014]\n\nPresident Obama's Persistent `77 cent' Claim on the Wage Gap Gets a New \n                            Pinocchio Rating\n\n                           (By Glenn Kessler)\n\n       ``Today, the average full-time working woman earns just 77 \n     cents for every dollar a man earns . . . in 2014, that's an \n     embarrassment. It is wrong.''\n       --President Obama, remarks on equal pay for equal work, \n     April 8, 2014\n       In 2012, during another election season, The Fact Checker \n     took a deep dive in the statistics behind this factoid and \n     found it wanting. We awarded the president only a Pinocchio, \n     largely because he is citing Census Bureau data, but have \n     wondered since then if we were too generous.\n       We also called out the president when he used this fact in \n     the 2013 State of the Union address. And in the 2014 State of \n     the Union address. And yet he keeps using it. So now it's \n     time for a reassessment.\n       The Truth Teller video above also goes through the details.\n\n\n                               The Facts\n\n       Few experts dispute that there is a wage gap, but \n     differences in the life choices of men and women--such as \n     women tending to leave the workforce when they have \n     children--make it difficult to make simple comparisons.Obama \n     is using a figure (annual wages, from the Census Bureau) that \n     makes the disparity appear the greatest-23 cents. But the \n     Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the \n     gap is 19 cents when looking at weekly wages. The gap is even \n     smaller when you look at hourly wages--it is 14 cents--but \n     then not every wage earner is paid on an hourly basis, so \n     that statistic excludes salaried workers.\n       In other words, since women in general work fewer hours \n     than men in a year, the statistics used by the White House \n     may be less reliable for examining the key focus of the \n     proposed Paycheck Fairness Act--wage discrimination. For \n     instance, annual wage figures do not take into account the \n     fact that teachers--many of whom are women--have a primary \n     job that fills nine months out of the year. The weekly wage \n     is more of an apples-to-apples comparison, but it does not \n     include as many income categories.\n       June O'Neill, a former director of the Congressional Budget \n     Office, has noted that the wage gap is affected by a number \n     of factors, including that the average woman has less work \n     experience than the average man and that more of the weeks \n     worked by women are part-time rather than full-time. Women \n     also tend to leave the work force for periods in order to \n     raise children, seek jobs that may have more flexible hours \n     but lower pay and choose careers that tend to have lower pay.\n       Indeed, BLS data show that women who do not get married \n     have virtually no wage gap; they earn 96 cents for every \n     dollar a man makes.\n       Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis \n     surveyed economic literature and concluded that ``research \n     suggests that the actual gender wage gap (when female workers \n     are compared with male workers who have similar \n     characteristics) is much lower than the raw wage gap.'' They \n     cited one survey, prepared in 2009 for the Labor Department, \n     which concluded that when such differences are accounted for, \n     much of the hourly wage gap dwindled, to about 5 cents on the \n     dollar.\n       ``This study leads to the unambiguous conclusion that the \n     differences in the compensation of men and women are the \n     result of a multitude of factors and that the raw wage gap \n     should not be used as the basis to justify corrective action. \n     Indeed, there may be nothing to correct,'' the report for the \n     Labor Department said. ``The differences in raw wages may be \n     almost entirely the result of the individual choices being \n     made by both male and female workers.''\n       A 2013 article in the Daily Beast, citing a Georgetown \n     University survey on the economic value of different college \n     majors, showed how nine of the 10 most remunerative majors \n     were dominated by men:\n       1. Petroleum Engineering: 87% male\n       2. Pharmacy Pharmaceutical Sciences and Administration: 48% \n     male\n       3. Mathematics and Computer Science: 67% male\n       4. Aerospace Engineering: 88% male\n       5. Chemical Engineering: 72% male\n       6. Electrical Engineering: 89% male\n       7. Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering: 97% male\n       8. Mechanical Engineering: 90% male\n       9. Metallurgical Engineering: 83% male\n       10. Mining and Mineral Engineering: 90% male\n       Meanwhile, nine of the 10 least remunerative majors were \n     dominated by women:\n       1. Counseling Psychology: 74% female\n       2. Early Childhood Education: 97% female\n       3. Theology and Religious Vocations: 34% female\n       4. Human Services and Community Organization: 81% female\n       5. Social Work: 88% female\n       6. Drama and Theater Arts: 60% female\n       7. Studio Arts: 66% female\n       8. Communication Disorders Sciences and Services: 94% \n     female\n       9. Visual and Performing Arts: 77% female\n       10. Health and Medical Preparatory Programs: 55% female\n       The White House discovered this week that calculations \n     using average wages can yield unsatisfactory results. \n     McClatchy newspapers did the math and reported that when the \n     same standards that generated the 77-cent figure were applied \n     to White House salaries, women overall at the White House \n     make 91 cents for every dollar men make. White House \n     spokesman Jay Carney protested that the review ``looked at \n     the aggregate of everyone on staff, and that includes from \n     the most junior levels to the most senior.'' But that's \n     exactly what the Census Department does.\n       Betsey Stevenson, a member of the White House Council of \n     Economic Advisers, acknowledged to reporters that the 77-cent \n     figure did not reflect equal pay for equal work. ``Seventy-\n     seven cents captures the annual earnings of full-time, full-\n     year women divided by the annual earnings of full-time,\n\n[[Page S2307]]\n\n     full-year men,'' she said. ``There are a lot of things that \n     go into that 77-cents figure, there are a lot of things that \n     contribute and no one's trying to say that it's all about \n     discrimination, but I don't think there's a better figure.''\n       Carney noted that the White House wage gap was narrower \n     than the national average, but the White House actually lags \n     the District average calculated by the BLS: 95 cents.\n\n\n                           The Pinocchio Test\n\n       From a political perspective, the Census Department's 77-\n     cent figure is golden. Unless women stop getting married and \n     having children, and start abandoning careers in childhood \n     education for naval architecture, this huge gap in wages will \n     almost certainly persist. Democrats thus can keep bringing it \n     up every two years.\n       There appears to be some sort of wage gap and closing it is \n     certainly a worthy goal. But it's a bit rich for the \n     president to repeatedly cite this statistic as an \n     ``embarrassment.'' (His line in the April 8 speech was almost \n     word for word what he said in the 2014 State of the Union \n     address.) The president must begin to acknowledge that \n     average annual wages does not begin to capture what is \n     actually happening in the work force and society.\n       Thus we are boosting the rating on this factoid to Two \n     Pinocchios. We were tempted to go one step further to Three \n     Pinocchios, but the president is relying on an official \n     government statistic--and there are problems and limitations \n     with the other calculations as well.\n\n\n                             Two Pinocchios\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Included in this article is the following quote \nreferencing a study by the Census Bureau:\n\n       This study leads to the unambiguous conclusion that the \n     differences in the compensation of men and women are the \n     result of a multitude of factors and that the raw wage gap \n     should not be used as the basis to justify corrective action. \n     Indeed, there may be nothing to correct.\n\n  I don't know that. There indeed may be more that we can correct. I am \nwilling to look to see, to continue to peel back this onion to see if \nwe can do more than we did with the Equal Pay Act of 1963, do more than \nwe did with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, do more than we did with the \nLilly Ledbetter Act that I supported several years ago. If there is \nmore that needs to be done, I am willing to work on it because I don't \nwant to be in a State where men are viewed as being paid $1 to the 67 \ncents that a woman is being paid. I don't want those statistics to be \nvalid. I don't want them to play out in my State. I want to understand \nhow we ensure that there is a level of fairness. I think we need to \nmake sure we look keenly to the issue of whether there is \ndiscrimination at play or whether, in fact, there are a host of other \nissues we need to consider as well. I am willing to work in good faith \nwith my colleagues to do just that.\n  I see the chairman of the Judiciary Committee is with us.\n  (Mr. MARKEY assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Alaska for yielding. I was interested in hearing her speech too.\n\n\n                               Landmines\n\n  The Presiding Officer represents the beautiful Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts. But consider if 15 percent of the land area of \nMassachusetts was littered with 100,000 landmines or if my State of \nVermont, with a slightly larger land area, was littered with landmines. \nEach one a tiny explosive buried a few inches beneath the surface of \nthe ground, and it explodes when an unsuspecting person steps on it. \nEach one capable of killing a child or blowing the legs off of an \nadult.\n  This may sound far-fetched, but it is not. It is the reality today \nfor many countries--from Vietnam to Angola to Colombia. But if that \nwere the reality in our States, I think we would all agree that these \ninherently indiscriminate weapons--designed to be triggered by the \nvictim regardless of whether it is a civilian or combatant--do not \nbelong in the arsenal of a civilized country.\n  In fact, 161 nations have already agreed, and they have joined \ntogether in an international treaty banning antipersonnel mines. They \ninclude every member of NATO except one--the United States. They \ninclude every country in this hemisphere except two--the United States \nand Cuba.\n  We condemn the use of IED's against our soldiers and civilians in \nAfghanistan, and of course we should. But why not condemn antipersonnel \nlandmines? There is really no appreciable difference.\n  I am hoping some will be listening to me at the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue because I ask this: If landmines were littering \nthis country--in schoolyards, along roads, in cornfields, in our \nNational Parks--and hundreds of American children were being crippled \nlike this Cambodian girl who lost her left foot, how long would it take \nbefore the White House sent the Mine Ban Treaty to the Senate for \nratification? Two days? Two weeks? It wouldn't take any longer than \nthat, I am sure. Yet we hear the same excuses year after year.\n  I look at my five beautiful grandchildren and I ask, what if they \nwere living in a country where simply by walking across a field, going \nto a playground, or walking down a road, they might lose their lives? \nThey are not combatants. It is usually civilians who are injured and \nkilled by these landmines. We hear the same excuses year after year--\nwhy the most powerful Nation on earth cannot join its NATO allies, why \nthe most powerful Nation on earth is the only country other than Cuba \nin this hemisphere not to sign it. What do we get? The same talking \npoints, the same power points. It is really bureaucratic inertia. It is \nalso a lack of leadership.\n\n  For 20 years the Pentagon insisted that Korea was the problem. But 20 \nyears later, there is absolutely no evidence they have done anything to \nrevise their Korea war plans without antipersonnel mines or that any \nPresident, Democratic or Republican, has ever told them to do so.\n  The U.S. Government deserves credit for spending hundreds of millions \nof dollars to clear mines and help mine survivors, and the Leahy War \nVictims Fund has been an important part of that, including the money I \nhave gotten through appropriations to clear land mines.\n  But this girl--and there are countless more like her--we are told \nthere are thousands of new mine victims each year, show the other \ntragic side of the story.\n  I mentioned on the floor the other day about talking to a young \nteenager in the hospital about the Bosnia war. She had been sent away \nby her parents to a safe place during the fighting. The war ended. She \ncould come home. She was running down the road calling out to her \nparents and stepped on a land mine and lost both her legs. She wasn't a \ncombatant. She became a victim. There are so many innocent victims.\n  Americans overwhelmingly condemn the use of landmines, and they \nexpect more than they are getting from their government, and so do I, \nand so, too, should every Member of Congress.\n  It has been 20 years since President Bill Clinton at the United \nNations called for the elimination of antipersonnel landmines. I \ncheered him when he did. Two years later in 1996 he said: ``Today I am \nlaunching an international effort to ban antipersonnel landmines.'' And \nI cheered that. But 18 years later we are still waiting. We are waiting \nfor action, not words. We haven't signed the landmine treaty. We didn't \nsign it during the Clinton administration or the George W. Bush \nadministration or this administration.\n  I have spoken to President Obama about this. I was encouraged when, \nin accepting the Nobel Peace Prize, he said:\n\n       I am convinced that adhering to standards, international \n     standards, strengthens those who do and isolates and weakens \n     those who don't.\n\n  I told the President how much I agreed with his words. \nCoincidentally, when he received the Nobel Prize it was a decade after \nthe Nobel committee awarded the prize to the International Campaign to \nBan Landmines. How fitting it would be after all these years if my \nfriend, President Obama, gave real meaning to the words he said when \naccepting the Nobel Peace Prize by putting the United States on a path \nto join the Mine Ban Treaty, and joining our NATO allies. This is what \nthe President needs to do. More importantly, it is what America and the \nworld needs.\n  I will speak further about this on another occasion, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n[[Page S2308]]\n\n                     Franklin Regional H.S. Tragedy\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on S. 1596, the Protecting \nStudents from Sexual and Violent Predators Act.\n  Before I do that, though, I want to say a few words about a terrible \nevent that occurred this morning in Pennsylvania. The students at \nFranklin Regional High School in Murrysville, PA, suffered a terrible, \ndevastating tragedy this morning. A person--and this person is believed \nto be a fellow student--took out a knife and attacked his fellow \nstudents before the start of the school day. It appears that as many as \n20 people were injured, some severely. Our thanks go out to the first \nresponders who did respond as rapidly as they could, and our prayers go \nout to those who were injured and their families at Franklin Regional \nHigh School.\n\n\n       Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act\n\n  Mr. President, I want to turn to this bill that I have introduced, \nthe Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act, S. 1596. \nI want to thank my cosponsors, Senator Joe Manchin and Senator Mitch \nMcConnell.\n  The inspiration for this bill begins with a story of a boy named \nJeremy Bell. The story begins in Delaware County, PA. One of the school \nteachers in the school in Delaware County was found to have molested \nseveral boys and raped one of them. Prosecutors decided there was not \nenough evidence to bring a case. The school knew about what was \nhappening and decided to dismiss the teacher for this appalling \nbehavior. What was so amazing and disturbing is the school also helped \nthis predator land a job at another school in West Virginia, even \npassing on a letter of recommendation so they could move their problem \nsomewhere else.\n  The story ended in 1997 when that teacher, by then a school \nprincipal, raped and murdered 12-year-old Jeremy Bell in West Virginia. \nJustice finally caught up with that teacher who is now in jail serving \na life sentence for that murder. But for Jeremy Bell justice came way \ntoo late. Jeremy Bell's father wouldn't rest until he knew he had done \nall he could to help to ensure that no child or parent would ever \nexperience a similar tragedy.\n  Roy Bell, Jeremy's father, worked with Congress to create protections \nfor children to ensure they were not victimized at school. I think for \nhim it was some consolation for his loss. The House of Representatives \nresponded to this terrible, terrible tragedy. On October 22 of last \nyear, the House unanimously passed the Protecting Students Against \nSexual and Violent Predators Act. But again, sadly, justice came too \nlate. Jeremy Bell's father passed away just 3 days before the vote.\n  So we are now in the Senate with a chance to pass the same bill, a \nbill that has already passed the House unanimously. It is a bipartisan \nbill. The bill that I introduced is a companion legislation. As I \nmentioned, we have bipartisan support for this bill, but I hear some \npeople suggesting that maybe we should wait, maybe now is not the right \ntime. Maybe we need more time.\n  I want to say as strongly as I can that we have had enough waiting. \nWe have wasted enough time. Let me explain why we cannot wait another \nday. I want to start with 2 numbers, the first is 130. Since January 1 \nof this year, 130 teachers have been arrested across America for sexual \nmisconduct with children. That is more than 1 teacher arrested for each \nday of the year so far. And that is, of course, only those who have \nbeen caught and arrested. Every moment that we delay we are delaying \nrooting out some of these problems.\n  The other number is 73, and 73 is the number that comes from the \nGovernment Accountability Office. GAO says that the average pedophile \nmolests 73 children over the course of that pedophile's lifetime. These \npredators actively seek out the environment where they can find \nvictims. That is what they do. What better place for them than schools. \nThey go from school district to school district, sometimes from State \nto State, methodically looking for victims. Every moment we delay we \nlet a predator move on to the next of his 73 victims.\n  The damage that these predators do is just enormous. It is damage far \nbeyond what any number can convey. Over the past few months I have had \na chance to visit a number of child advocacy centers around \nPennsylvania, meeting with the men and women who work with abused \nchildren, whether it is helping them through the criminal justice \nsystem or just helping them to start the healing process. These folks \ndo some incredibly important and very, very good work. But again, you \ncannot visit one of these centers without being profoundly impacted by \nhow devastating the abuse is.\n  I cannot come up with the words to convey how devastating it is, but \nI can let some of the children speak for themselves. I am going to \nquote from two students who were victims. Shannon was raped by a \nteacher. The teacher was later convicted of sexual assault and \nsentenced to life in prison. Nine years later here is what Shannon \nwrote:\n\n       When I was a senior in high school, Mr. Peterson approached \n     me and said I would need to go to night school if I wanted \n     enough credits to graduate on time. And of course he taught \n     those courses--a computer class.\n       I was 17, and he raped me four times over the course of the \n     year. He said he would fail me if I ever told. He also hit me \n     and made threats against me and my family. So I didn't tell. \n     I held it in for a year and a half.\n       In the end 66 people offered to testify against Peterson. \n     His first victim dated back to the year I was born. Some of \n     those who spoke up were parents. Their daughters had \n     complained at the time but nothing was done. That made me \n     very angry. It still does. I learned that a handful of \n     teachers and two principals knew about him. And his teaching \n     license had been revoked in Michigan years before, but no one \n     knew why.\n       I am different because of what happened. I have to watch \n     people all the time, analyze them. I can't be carefree.\n       Now I have a 7-year-old son and two daughters, ages 3 and \n     1. I will home school my girls.\n\n  Next is a case of a boy from South Carolina named Gary, one of at \nleast 29 boys abused by a teacher, Mr. Fisher, over the teacher's 37-\nyear career. The teacher is serving 20 years in prison. Two school \nprincipals were sued for allegedly covering up the abuse.\n  What Gary wrote is as follows:\n\n       I was 9 when it started. The abuse was frequent and long-\n     term--until I went to college. I knew there were others, too, \n     but until it all came out I never knew how many. You feel so \n     guilty, so ashamed. It's frightening now to look back and see \n     how calculating Fisher was. I did everything I could to get \n     kicked out of school. I was in the guidance counselor's \n     office all the time. Finally, in tenth grade I got myself \n     kicked out for cheating.\n       By the time I went to college I was drinking all the time. \n     I was terrified to quit because then I would have to feel. \n     But I couldn't drink and do school, so I entered rehab. I was \n     18. It took me a year and a half, and I've been sober since.\n       My life is good now for the first time. You can survive it, \n     but you have to deal with it.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I always felt that what the school did was far worse than \n     what Fisher did. Fisher was sick, an evil monster. But [the \n     school] just calculated the damage to its public relations. \n     We kids were disposable, which is a whole other category of \n     evil.\n\n  So the question before us is what are we going to do about this? What \ncan we do? What are we going to do?\n  My bill, the Protecting Students From Sexual and Violent Predators \nAct is a sensible first step in protecting these kids. It would require \na mandatory background check for existing and perspective employees, \nand the checks would have to be periodically repeated. There are five \nStates today that don't require any background check at all.\n  The second thing my bill would do is it would check all employees or \ncontractors who have unsupervised contact with children--not just \nteachers, coaches, and school bus drivers. Anybody who has contact with \nkids in my view should undergo this background check. There are 12 \nStates in which there is no such requirement from contractors.\n  My bill would also require a more thorough background check. It would \nrequire a check of four major databases, both State and Federal. In \nPennsylvania, for instance, if an employee has been living in the State \nfor 2 years or more, there is no Federal background check at all, only \nthe State check, and I don't think it is adequate. The way these \npredators move from State to State, I think it requires that we check \nthe Federal database.\n  Importantly, my bill would also ban what we call ``passing the \ntrash.'' This is the horrendous practice whereby the school discovers \nthey have a predator and they intentionally ease the predator out and \nsometimes actually facilitate that predator getting a job somewhere \nelse. That should be illegal, and my bill would make it illegal.\n\n[[Page S2309]]\n\n  The fifth thing that my legislation does is it would stipulate that \nschools cannot hire a person who has ever been convicted of any violent \nor sexual crime against a child. I think that is a very reasonable \nfirst step.\n  In addition, it would ban hiring of a number of specific felonies--\nnot all felonies, but felonies such as homicide, child abuse or \nneglect, crimes against a child including pornography, spousal abuse, \nrape, sexual assault, and kidnapping. Any of those felonies are so \negregious it would qualify to keep a person excluded from working with \nchildren.\n  In addition, anyone convicted of a felony physical assault or battery \nor a felony drug-related offense would be prohibited for 5 years, \ncouldn't be hired for 5 years. The enforcement of all of this would be \nthat if a State refused to adopt these very commonsense measures to \nprotect kids, then they would get no Federal funding from the EASA. I \nthink the States would adopt these reforms.\n\n  I would point out there is nothing the least bit radical about these \nproposals. In addition to having passed the House of Representatives \nunanimously, we in the Senate just passed virtually an identical \nbackground check requirement on the Child Care and Development Block \nGrant legislation we adopted last week or perhaps the week before--very \nrecently. That bill essentially had identical background check \nprovisions for daycare workers, and that is very sensible. That is an \nimportant and good step. It makes sense to protect children in daycare, \nbut it makes no sense whatsoever to protect kids in daycare and then \nleave them defenseless when they move on to an ordinary school.\n  Finally, I want to emphasize that this bill has broad bipartisan \nsupport manifested in the House and here in the Senate. More than that, \nI think it is a moral imperative. Our children deserve to be protected \nnow. If that is not a responsibility we have, I don't know what is. The \nprotection didn't come soon enough for Jeremy Bell or Shannon or Gary, \nbut we don't have to fail other children by delay.\n  I ask any of my colleagues who object to this legislation that passed \nunanimously in the House--legislation that is completely consistent \nwith what we passed a couple of weeks ago--to please come forward with \ntheir concerns or issues. I welcome hearing any objections, if there \nare any, but I want to see a very speedy passage of this legislation.\n  It is my intention tomorrow to come down here to the Senate floor and \nask for unanimous consent from my colleagues to pass this legislation \nhere on the Senate floor. That will expedite this process and that will \nassure we put this important safeguard in place as soon as we possibly \ncan.\n\n\n                               Ex-Im Bank\n\n  I have one other issue I want to address briefly before I yield the \nfloor, and that is about the Ex-Im Bank. I believe this afternoon we \nwill be considering a nominee to a very senior post at the Ex-Im bank. \nMy focus is not principally on this particular candidate, but I think \nwe need to ask ourselves some important questions about the way the Ex-\nIm Bank operates and what it does and how it does it. I hope we will \nmake some very significant changes when we get to the reauthorization \ndebate in the fall.\n  First of all, I should point out this is an institution--the Ex-Im \nBank--that gives rise to a very substantial taxpayer risk, and it is \nlarge and growing. In 2007, Ex-Im Bank's total exposure was $57 \nbillion. Today it is almost precisely twice that amount. It is $113 \nbillion, and the Ex-Im Bank wishes to increase that exposure further.\n  In 2013, the GAO, after doing an audit, found multiple weaknesses in \nEx-Im's risk management processes, failures to account for changing \nenvironments that could lead to higher losses, lapses that would not be \nacceptable in fully private institutions.\n  Another point I wish to make is--I hope we don't kid ourselves about \nthis; I know sometimes people suggest to the contrary--taxpayers are \nsystematically subsidizing the activity of the Ex-Im Bank, and the risk \nthat taxpayers are taking is not adequately compensated. How do we know \nthis? We know this because buyers of products that are subject to Ex-Im \nBank financing get the Ex-Im Bank financing because no private lender \nis willing to make the loan or, if they are, they are not willing to do \nit under terms as generous as the Ex-Im Bank. That is all the evidence \nwe need to confirm that they are systematically underpricing the risks \nthey are taking, and I find that very objectionable.\n  There is another concern I have, and that is the nature of the \nactivity, the financial subsidization it provides for certain overseas \nbuyers of some American exports. The nature of this process inevitably \ncreates winners and losers back here in the United States.\n  The Ex-Im Bank effectively subsidizes--and I will give one example. \nIndian Airlines gets a subsidy to purchase Boeing jets, and that is \nvery nice, except that Indian Airlines competes directly with some \nAmerican airlines and American companies. They are direct competitors, \nbut they don't get the advantageous funding. Yet their foreign-based \ncompetitor does. How can that possibly be fair? How can that possibly \nmake sense?\n  My final point is that one of the most predictable things in the \nworld is that when we create a government entity to engage in an \neconomic activity, that entity will be politicized. It is a creature of \nCongress and the government. It is going to be affected. Sure enough, \nit didn't take long for that to happen. It already happened in the Ex-\nIm Bank.\n  I have seen Members of this body come down to this floor and attempt \nto offer amendments that would require, for instance, certain quotas \nthat the Ex-Im Bank must lend to certain places in the world that are \ngeographically favored by particular Members for whatever reasons.\n  There are other mandates on Ex-Im Bank's financing, such as that it \nmust accommodate certain economic activities or certain products. This \nhas nothing to do with market forces or general exports. This has \neverything to do with the politics that individual cares about. This is \nthe kind of politicization and distortion that inevitably occurs.\n  In my view, we ought to make it a high priority of our trade \ndiscussions to insist with our trading partners around the world that \nwe have a mutual and reciprocal phasing out of these counterproductive, \ntaxpayer-subsidized export entries. While we will not have the \nopportunity to do that with respect to this nominee we are going to \nconsider this afternoon, we will have the opportunity to do it when the \nreauthorization debate begins in the fall, and I hope my colleagues \nwill engage in that debate.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                          Veterans Health Care\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I think we are prepared to have several \nunanimous consent requests regarding the issue of how to care for \nveterans in our country. I first want to begin by thanking Senator \nSanders for his extraordinary leadership on the issue of caring for and \nsupporting veterans, their families, their dependents, and the \ncommunities in which veterans live. There has been no stronger voice on \nthe Senate floor for veterans on either side of the aisle than Senator \nSanders, and I appreciate his leadership. He has been spending a great \ndeal of time on the floor explaining the importance of his legislation. \nHe has joined me today to talk further about it.\n  Inside of this very important and major piece of legislation, there \nis a piece of it that passed the House unanimously that would authorize \nthe construction of 27 major medical facility leases in 18 States and \nin Puerto Rico, two of which would be in Louisiana--one in Lafayette \nand one in Lake Charles. I have been leading the effort--contrary to \nthe testimony put on the Record by the junior Senator from Louisiana--\nwith Congressman Boustany, whose district this is in, and he has been \nthe leader of our delegation. There is no hesitation among our \ndelegation about who the leader has been about getting these clinics \nbuilt.\n  We have been working with the veterans office for years. We got them \nto admit that they actually made the mistake that caused our clinics to \nhave to be delayed in their construction because of a mishap of great \nproportion in the way these contracts were bid. The veterans in our \nState--and Senator Sanders knows this--have rightly been complaining \nfor years that they have been left out and left behind.\n\n[[Page S2310]]\n\n  Our entire delegation, Democrats and Republicans, has been fighting \non their behalf vigorously. We have written letters, made phone calls, \nand made multiple visits to the region. Contrary to the testimony by \nthe junior Senator from Louisiana, the fact is everybody has been \nworking well together.\n  Congressman Boustany got to pass this piece of legislation out of the \nHouse that basically says: Yes, let's go forward and build these \nclinics and not require an offset.\n  I ask unanimous consent right now to do just that and take the House \nbill that has passed with no amendments, no modifications, and pass \nthis bill so it doesn't have to go back to the House. It can go right \nto the President's desk for signature. It costs $1.8 billion, and there \nis no offset. As I have said, in my view--and this is only my view--the \nveterans this is going to help have already paid the price. They have \nalready paid the price. They should not have to pay twice.\n  I agree with the House of Representatives. There doesn't need to be \nan offset to this. I don't agree with Senator Vitter's amendment that \nthere needs to be an offset. I think we just need to go ahead and \nunanimously decide to send this to the President's desk for his \nsignature. I am confident he would sign this, and it would authorize \nthese clinics not only in Louisiana but in the States around the \ncountry.\n  I understand there is some opposition from outside of our State. I \ndon't understand any opposition from within the State.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Veterans' Affairs Committee be discharged \nfrom further consideration of H.R. 3521, the bill read three times and \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Coburn, who is not here \ntoday, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEE. My understanding is that Senator Coburn's objection is based \non the lack of a pay-for in this proposal. There is, however, an \namendment that has been introduced by Senator Vitter that addresses \nthis concern and fills this gap.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 3521, and \nthat the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration. I also ask \nunanimous consent that the Vitter amendment, which is at the desk, be \nagreed to, that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, \nand that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Is that an order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEE. Yes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I understand that the House of Representatives passed \nthis bill, H.R. 3521--and I will get the exact vote in a minute--with a \nvote of 346 to 1. They passed this bill, H.R. 3521, with a vote of 346 \nto 1, that has no offset.\n  Does the Senator from Utah have any reason to know why Senator Coburn \nwould now require an offset since the bill and the politics is \ncontrolled by the Republican leadership in the House?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I don't mean to cut my colleague off, but \nSenator Lee is here on behalf of Senator Coburn, who has been more \ninvolved, and so I will give the history of it. Some folks in the \nSenate had concerns about the bill and the fact that, in their view, it \nwas not paid for. I met with them and talked through all of these \nconcerns. I could not convince them to drop those concerns completely, \nso instead we found a solution, which is the Vitter amendment that is \nat the desk. That amendment has been cleared within its four corners. \nNobody in the Senate--no Republican or Democrat--opposes the amendment. \nWe found that solution in order to pass the bill through the Senate, \nand that addressed Senator Coburn's objections to the bill alone. That \nis the solution we worked out.\n  I can't fully walk through all of Senator Coburn's thoughts about the \nbill on its own and whether it was paid for. I can just tell the \nSenator that I met with him exhaustively, was not able to get him to \ncompletely drop his objection, but was able to agree on this \ncompromise--this solution to the pay-for issue. So that is why the \namendment, which is at the desk, was proposed, which removes the Coburn \nobjection and thereby fixes the problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Utah?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont, objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Louisiana has the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, that is very good to know that Senator \nCoburn is objecting--or not objecting--to an offset that is not a real \noffset.\n  The reason there is some objection from our side, and I think from \nSenator Sanders as well, is because the Vitter offset is not real. It \ndoesn't generate $1.6 billion in savings. So I think we should go \nforward with no offset because the $1.6 billion is not a real offset.\n  The CBO analysis of this offset basically says, from our preliminary \nestimate of the amendment, based on information from the Department of \nDefense, there are no savings--there are no savings--for drug-related \npurchases to the current law. The preliminary estimate is zero.\n  With that, I wish to reiterate my unanimous consent request--please \ndon't interrupt--I would like unanimous consent for my amendment, which \nhas no offset--and the bill does not have to go back to the House of \nRepresentatives. The bill can go straight to the President's desk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. VITTER. I would like to ask through the Chair, because this is \nsignificant information, whether Senator Sanders would object to \npassing the bill without amendment, because in all previous discussions \nto date, I understood he would object to that. But that is very \nsignificant information, so I would ask that of Senator Sanders through \nthe Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not a parliamentary inquiry. However, \nif the Senator chooses to respond, he may.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I will respond later.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reclaiming the floor and reclaiming my \ntime, that is very significant information that can guide us with \nregard to any path forward. So I would like to know from the Senator \nwhether he would or would not object to a UC to pass the bill without \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, that is a fair question. Let me ask my \ncolleague from Louisiana--as he knows, I will be speaking more to this \nin a moment. I wish to thank Senator Landrieu for her strong support of \nlegislation I introduced and for her support not only for veterans in \nLouisiana but for every veteran in this country. This legislation is \nsupported by virtually every veterans organization in the United States \nof America.\n  I will respond at this point to my colleague from Louisiana to say \nthat if I were prepared to support the Landrieu amendment, which has no \noffsets--and she makes a good point, that veterans have paid for this \nlegislation in their blood already--would the Senator from Louisiana \nobject to an amendment I offered for the comprehensive bill that had no \noffset as well?\n  Mr. VITTER. If I could address the Chair, I am happy to answer the \nquestion.\n  As Senator Sanders knows, I have serious concerns with his much \nbroader bill. So I am not agreeing to his far broader bill. He knows \nthat. We have talked about that. We have talked about those concerns. I \nam happy to restate that.\n  Having answered his question, I would like to reask through the Chair \nif Senator Sanders is objecting or would object to a UC request to pass \nthis veterans clinics bill without the amendment at the desk.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Reserving the right to object, let me again thank \nSenator Landrieu, who has raised this issue with me on numerous \noccasions. The\n\n[[Page S2311]]\n\nissue we are talking about--I think Senator Vitter referred to it--is \nclearly not just an issue for Louisiana, it is an issue which addresses \nthe need to see built 27 major medical facilities in 18 States and \nPuerto Rico. To my mind, this is a very important provision, which is \nin fact why I put it in a very prominent place in my legislation.\n  What I would say to my friend from Louisiana is that as important as \nthat provision in the bill is, there are many other provisions of equal \nor greater importance. What I would say to my friend from Louisiana is \nthat organizations--and, again, virtually every veterans organization \nin America, representing millions and millions of veterans, wants this \nbody and Members of the Senate to not just give speeches on Veterans \nDay or Memorial Day about their concerns for veterans, they want this \nbody to start acting on behalf of the veterans in this country.\n  What they want us to do, among many other things, is an advanced \nappropriations. I know my friend from Louisiana isn't a member of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, and maybe he does not know that in the \nlast government shutdown we were 10 days away from veterans--disabled \nveterans--not getting the checks they live on. This bill I have \nintroduced addresses that.\n  Maybe the Senator from Louisiana does not know we have a major \nbacklog problem; that while the VA is making good progress and \nsignificantly reducing that backlog, I as chairman of the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee want to make absolutely certain that when a \nveteran applies for a benefit, that benefit is adjudicated in a rapid, \nefficient, and accurate way, and my legislation deals with that issue.\n  I don't know if the junior Senator from Louisiana knows we have a \nreal problem for veterans in Louisiana and across this country who are \ntrying to take advantage of the post-9/11 education bill. Over 1 \nmillion veterans and their families are taking advantage of it but \nsuddenly find themselves, if they move from Vermont to Louisiana or \nLouisiana to Vermont, they may not be able to take advantage of instate \ntuition. Our bill addresses that issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators are advised that subject to a \nprevious order, the Senate was to proceed to executive session at 2:30.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that the previous order be \npostponed for an additional 10 minutes so we can simply round out this \nvery important discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANDERS. None whatsoever.\n  Mr. VITTER addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I think I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. VITTER. I believe I made an inquiry through the Chair, so I \nbelieve I have the floor and I would like to reclaim it if that is \nappropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont currently has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the point I am making is that \nfurthermore, not only are we dealing with the instate tuition issue, \nwhich impacts veterans from Louisiana and Vermont and every other \nState, we are dealing with another issue in that we are going to extend \nfor 5 years to 10 years unfettered access to VA health care for \nrecently separated veterans. At a time when real unemployment in this \ncountry is close to 12 percent and many veterans are coming home from \nIraq and Afghanistan and they are looking for work and work is hard to \nfind, this legislation renews our vow to hire heroes because we believe \nit is important that veterans get back to work and take care of their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. VITTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. I apologize for interrupting, but I just want to ensure \nthat of the additional 10 minutes that were granted, I would have 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is dividing the time equally.\n  Mr. VITTER. I apologize for interrupting.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Not at all.\n  I wanted to mention to my colleague from Louisiana, which he may or \nmay not know, that we have a very serious problem in the military \nregarding sexual assault, and it is terribly important that the men and \nwomen who were sexually assaulted get the help and the treatment they \nneed in a VA facility and we address that issue.\n  The Senator from Louisiana may or may not know that 2,300 veterans--\nthese are men and women who suffered injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan \nand came back home--are unable, because of their wounds, to have \nbabies, and this legislation is going to help them start the families \nthey want.\n  The Senator from Louisiana may or may not know--and I know the \nSenator from Illinois Mr. Durbin does know--that in this legislation we \ndeal with the caregivers act; that right now we have 70-year-old women \nwho have taken care of their husbands who lost their legs in Vietnam or \nin Korea or whatever war, and they are crying out for us to give them a \nmodest degree of help.\n  What I say to my friend from Louisiana: Now is the time to stand with \nthe veterans of this country. If he thinks it is too expensive, then \ndon't send them off to war. Don't send them off to war. Taking care of \nveterans is a cost of war. They paid for it. I am very proud, again, \nthat this legislation has the support of the American Legion, VFW, DAV, \nGold Star Wives, Vietnam veterans organizations, Iraq, Afghanistan \nveterans organizations, and all the others--virtually all of the other \nones.\n  I implore my friend from Louisiana to do the right thing and support \nthis comprehensive legislation which addresses his concerns in this \nprovision, but it does a lot more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I think this discussion has been very \nimportant and very instructive because it underscores that not only \ndoes the distinguished Senator from Vermont object to my efforts to \npass the veterans clinics bill with the amendment at the desk by \nunanimous consent, but he also objects to Senator Landrieu's efforts to \npass the same veterans clinics bill, in her case, without the \namendment, without the offset. I asked him that direct question. He \nmade it very clear that he continues to demand that we pass his entire \nmuch broader bill and will not let this hostage go.\n  I think that is very sad and very inappropriate for him to object to \nmy effort, for him to now object to the efforts of Senator Landrieu. \nShe made the unanimous consent request to pass the clinics bill, the \nfocused clinics bill. He is objecting to that as well.\n  It is also completely contrary to what Senator Sanders has said \nbefore, working on these and related issues. In another instance in \nlate 2013, November, Senator Sanders himself, talking about our \ncolleagues, said:\n\n       I'm happy to tell you that I think that was a concern of \n     his.\n\n  Another colleague--\n\n       We got that UC'ed last night. So we moved that pretty \n     quickly, and I want to try to do those things, where we have \n     agreements, let's move it.\n\n  Where we have agreement, let's move it. We do not have agreement \nabout the significant details of the much broader Sanders bill. It is \nnot 1 Senator objecting about that, it is 43, but we do have agreement \nabout this clinics issue. No one, including Senator Sanders, objects to \nthe substance of the clinics bill. We have worked out every issue, \nincluding through my discussions with Senator Coburn, about the pay-\nfors. The amendment at the desk solves that.\n  So when we take that bill and the amendment, no one objects to that \nsubstance. No one objects to it within the four corners of that \nmaterial. The only objection constantly on the floor for the last \nseveral weeks--today again toward me, today again toward Senator \nLandrieu's UC--is, no, I need my whole bill.\n  We will continue to discuss those important issues and disagreements, \nbut 43 Senators disagree with Senator Sanders. Sixty are needed to move \nforward. In the meantime, can we at least agree what we agree on and \nnot hold veterans hostage? They have had guns pointed at them before, \nbut they don't expect U.S. Senators to hold guns to their head and hold \nthem hostage over veterans clinics.\n  So where we have agreement, let's move it. We have agreement about \nthe\n\n[[Page S2312]]\n\nveterans clinics. Let's move it. That is my effort. That is Senator \nLandrieu's effort, which again is being objected to, moving this \nfocused clinics bill, by the Senator from Vermont. I find that very \nunfortunate, but I will certainly continue to demand that we pass this \nand continue to talk regarding all of the other important veterans' \nissues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we talk \nabout holding hostage. The distinguished junior Senator from Louisiana \npointed out that 43 Senators voted against comprehensive legislation \nthat is supported by virtually every veterans organization in this \ncountry. The arithmetic is 43 voted against it, that is true. How many \nvoted for it? Fifty-six voted for it and 1 was absent who would have \nvoted for it. Fifty-seven voted for comprehensive legislation, 43 voted \nagainst it.\n  So when the Senator talks about holding veterans hostage, I would \nsuggest to my friend from Louisiana that maybe instead of filibustering \nthis bill and requiring an undemocratic 60 votes, let the majority \nrule.\n  The American people want us to pass this legislation. If you choose \nnot to vote for it, that is your right. But I do urge you not to hold \nus hostage by demanding 60 votes when a very strong majority wants to \nsee it passed.\n  With that, Mr. President, I would object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, can you tell me the order of business we \nare in now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 40 seconds remaining on the current \nissue, following which we will proceed to executive session.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield back that time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/09/senate-section/article/S2312-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2312-S2315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF WANDA FELTON TO BE FIRST VICE PRESIDENT OF THE EXPORT-\n                    IMPORT BANK OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Wanda Felton, of New \nYork, to be First Vice President of the Export-Import Bank of the \nUnited States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The remaining time until 3:30 p.m. will be for \ndebate on the Felton nomination.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           American Cures Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, a generation ago, an AIDS diagnosis meant \na sure and agonizing death. It was 23 years ago, when I was in the \nHouse of Representatives, when I was walking to the Chamber for a vote \nwhen I saw a colleague and friend, Tom McMillen, a Congressman from \nMaryland, coming my way. You would not miss Tom McMillen. He played in \nthe NBA. He was tall. As he passed by on the sidewalk, he stopped and \nsaid: Magic has AIDS. It was a stunning announcement that Magic Johnson \nhad been diagnosed with AIDS. The reality is that was 23 years ago. At \nthe time we felt this was a death verdict, there was no way to escape \nit.\n  Last month American researchers revealed that a second American baby \nborn with HIV has apparently been cured of the virus with drugs \ndelivered just minutes after birth.\n  How far we have come in 23 years--from an AIDS diagnosis meaning \ncertain death to being able to cure for the second time a baby born \nwith HIV with drugs delivered minutes after birth.\n  These babies were treated as part of a research program at the \nNational Institutes of Health. Their apparent cures offer real hope for \na quarter of a million babies who were born into the world this year \nwith HIV--many of them in desperately poor nations.\n  It is not the only happening when it comes to medical research, by a \nlong shot. In my home State of Illinois, Dr. Jose Oberholzer from the \nUniversity of Illinois-Chicago and Dr. Xunrong Luo from Northwestern \nUniversity are among scores of researchers throughout the country on an \nNIH-sponsored project to find a cure for Type 1 diabetes.\n  Do you know anyone with type 1 diabetes? I do. To think that we are \nclose enough to even consider the possibility of a cure should spur us \nall on to want more research in this area done as quickly as possible.\n  These two doctors are part of an effort called the Clinical Islet \nTransplantation Consortium. Islets are a group of beta cells in the \npancreas that produce insulin. Type 1 diabetes destroys these cells. \nTransplanting healthy beta cells into the liver of someone with type 1 \ndiabetes can enable the person's body to start producing insulin on its \nown--a functional cure for type 1 diabetes.\n  This is not just a theory; it is starting to show results when it \ncomes to this clinical research.\n  Why do I raise these amazing medical research stories on the floor of \nthe Senate? Because the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives \neach year vote on how much money we are going to put into the National \nInstitutes of Health, and we have had some sad outcomes in recent \nyears.\n  Did you know that over the last 10 years we have been unwilling to \ngive the National Institutes of Health even a cost-of-living \nadjustment? So each year they have fallen behind in medical research \njust because of inflation. They have fallen behind 22 percent in \nawarding research grants such as the ones I just described because we \nhave failed to provide a cost-of-living adjustment for them.\n  Does anyone believe we are saving money by cutting back on medical \nresearch? If they do, they are just plain wrong.\n  They had a program announced about a month ago at NIH called the AMP \nProgram. It is a new undertaking. The 10 largest pharmaceutical \ncompanies have put up $150 million--not a great amount of money for \nsuccessful pharmaceutical companies but an investment--to be matched by \nNIH, and they are setting out to use human genomic mapping and cell \ninformation to find cures for Alzheimer's, type 1 diabetes, and \nrheumatoid arthritis.\n  Can we afford this? Can we afford this research? Do you know what we \npaid last year in Medicare and Medicaid just for Alzheimer's patients? \nIt was $203 billion--1 year. If we can, through our research, find a \nway to at least delay, if not cure, Alzheimer's, think of the misery \nthat will be spared these poor families who suffer from Alzheimer's and \nthink of the money we will save.\n  Are we so shortsighted as a nation that we have forgotten that \nmedical research not only finds cures but saves us money that would \notherwise be spent for medical care?\n  That is why I introduced, 2 weeks ago, the American Cures Act. It is \ndifferent. There are not a lot of proposals like it before Congress. \nWhat I am doing with this proposal is trying to get Congress, on both \nsides of the aisle, in both Chambers, to make a commitment to American \nmedical research, American cures.\n  Here is the commitment: Over the next 10 years, I want a commitment \nthat we will increase the funding in medical research beyond inflation \n5 percent a year--5 percent--for the National Institutes of Health, for \nthe Centers for Disease Control, the Department of Defense medical \nresearch, and the Veterans' Administration medical research.\n  What is the cost of that? The cost of that is $150 billion over 10 \nyears--to make a commitment to go forward on medical research. It is a \nlot of money. It is a lot of money until you consider what the cost is \neach year of Alzheimer's--$200 billion--not to mention the cost of \ndiabetes, arthritis, and so many other illnesses and diseases that call \nfor huge investments when it comes to medical care.\n  Where in the world can we get $150 billion over 10 years? Where could \nwe possibly find it? Let me give you a starting place. Increase the \nFederal tax on tobacco products by 95 cents. I am for that. I will tell \nyou why I am for it. I have been fighting tobacco as long as I have \nbeen in Congress--the House and Senate--and what I have discovered is, \nif you want to discourage young people from smoking, taking up tobacco \naddictions that will ultimately cost them their lives, raise the price \nof the product. They stop buying it.\n  In my lifetime, we have seen the percentage of Americans smoking cut \nin\n\n[[Page S2313]]\n\nhalf. So raising that tobacco tax gives us money for medical research \nand reduces the likelihood that people will become addicted to nicotine \nand tobacco.\n  Mr. President, 700,000 Americans will not take up the tobacco habit \nif we raise that tax 95 cents. It is money well spent on medical \nresearch.\n  If we do not do this, what happens? We fail to find the cures for \ndiseases, we continue to make massive expenditures in Medicare and \nMedicaid and other health programs, and we watch the world pass us by.\n  If the United States decides to retreat when it comes to biomedical \nresearch, other countries are ready to step in. Now, today, China is \ninvesting 12 to 20 percent more each year in government research and \nmedical research--each year. In 8 years China will surpass the United \nStates in dollars spent on government research and medical research. \nAre we ready to let that happen? I hope not.\n  For the sake of the people who live in this country who need cures \nfor these diseases, and help, for the sake of the cost to our health \ncare system that all of this medical challenge presents, and if we want \nto maintain a lead when it comes to researchers and doctors and \nhospitals, it is time for us on a bipartisan basis to make a commitment \nto medical research.\n  I hope others will join in cosponsoring this American Cures Act. A \nnumber have done this already, and I thank them for joining me. One of \nthem is on the floor, my colleague from California Mrs. Boxer. She is \nalways by my side. We have fought a lot of these battles together. And \nthe list goes on: Senators Reed, Brown, Hirono, Feinstein, Gillibrand, \nCardin, Hagen, Casey, Markey, and Mikulski, and we are just getting \nstarted. I might also say that Congresswoman Anna Eshoo is cosponsoring \nthis measure in the House.\n  I cannot think of a more important thing that we can do to make this \na better, safer nation, to reward research, to find cures for diseases, \nand to make sure our country continues to lead the world when it comes \nto biomedical research.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Illinois \nfor his leadership in making our people healthier than they otherwise \nwould be. He talked about the battles we have had making sure that we \ncrack down on the tobacco companies that told us for years smoking was \nsafe--as a matter of fact, do it, it will relax you--and they denied \nthe science.\n  We lived through those years. Many years ago, I worked with then-\nSenator Lautenberg--and Senator Durbin led the charge in the House--to \nstop smoking on airplanes. I remember coming home from these long trips \nand literally reeking of cigarette smoke--I never smoked in my life, \nbut just sitting around it in the airplanes.\n  Now we are working together on NIH issues. We are very upset about \nsome of the false claims that are being made about ecigarettes, and we \nwant the truth out.\n  So before he leaves the floor, I want to thank the Senator.\n\n\n                         Paycheck Fairness Act\n\n  Mr. President, I am here for only a couple minutes to express my \nchagrin, my disappointment, my shock that not one Republican voted with \nDemocrats to make sure women have equal pay to men. What a simple \nconcept: If you work a job that is the same as a man, the pay should be \nequal, and that means women can get a fair shot in the workplace. And \nhow do we know it is not happening? We know because there are \nstatistics that prove that women are earning, on average, $11,000 less \nthan a man for the same job; and that is $11,000 a year. Over the \ncourse of a lifetime, it is over $400,000.\n  Our Republican friends, in searching to come up with a reason--I do \nnot know their reason; I do not get their reason--but this is what they \nsaid. They said--Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, said in a \npress conference--and I just read it; I hope I am wrong, and maybe he \ndid not say this--but he said: We are hurting the very same people we \nare trying to help in this legislation.\n  Now, somebody explain to me how it hurts a woman to have equal pay \nwith a man for the same job. How does it hurt a woman to be able to \nafford a better place to live with that $11,000 a year, or a better \nschool, to send her child to college, or just to enjoy a family \nvacation or a used car that maybe they want to buy--or, or, or.\n  It is unbelievable to me. Every Republican voted against equal pay \ntoday for women. What is even more disturbing, every Republican voted \nto filibuster equal pay for women, meaning they voted against our even \ntaking up the subject. They stopped us. We had a good, solid majority \nof Democrats--54. We just wanted to take it up and work on it and get \nit through. They filibustered this. It is, to me, amazing.\n  Senator McConnell said that Democrats are obsessed with this issue of \nequal pay for equal work. OK, I will take it. I am obsessed. I want \nequal pay for women.\n  We are here in the U.S. Senate. Everyone knows what we earn, and \neveryone knows that a woman Senator makes the same as a man Senator. We \nhave the same pension options and health care options, and that is the \nfair way. All the equal pay for equal work act says is: We want to \nenforce the civil rights laws that demand it. But employers now harass \nyou, fire you, stop you from finding out what your colleague across the \naisle makes.\n  If you even ask someone: I want to just check, am I getting paid \nfairly? I am getting paid $45,000 a year, and we do the same job. Can \nyou tell me?--that alone--that alone--makes that worker a target for \ndismissal, harassment, et cetera.\n  This should not be. We should be able to find out and ask. That is \nall we are trying to do here. We are trying to make sure that the Civil \nRights Act which passed in the 1960s actually works. Because the Civil \nRights Act said: equal pay for equal work. But then all these rules \ncame down and loopholes came down, and employers can fire you, harass \nyou, or do whatever, if you even ask about it.\n  Everyone knows--I should not say ``everyone''--a lot of people \nunderstand the Lilly Ledbetter case. Lilly Ledbetter worked at a tire \ncompany. She was a manager. She was considered one of the top people in \nthe company who did this work. She found out she was getting paid \nthousands of dollars less by the owner of the tire factory. She sued.\n  She won her lawsuit at the lower level. Then it went all the way to \nthe Supreme Court. They said: Sorry, you waited too long to file your \nlawsuit. What? She said: I could not find out about it. I did not find \nout about it, she said, until a coworker left me a note and said:\n\n       Lilly, I admire you. You're great. Do you know you're \n     getting paid X thousands less a year than your male \n     counterpart?\n\n  But she did not find it out for many years. So we had to fix that \nproblem. Barbara Mikulski led us, and the President led us. He signed \nthe bill, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which expands the statute \nof limitations so when you find out you have been discriminated against \nyou can bring a lawsuit.\n  All this is, is you can find out for sure earlier by asking someone. \nSo I am in shock. Do not tell me women do not want fair pay, all they \ncare about is flexibility. You cannot buy groceries with flexibility. \nIf you want flexibility in the workplace, you can work that out. But \nset your pay first. I have employees, men and women, who want to get \ntheir pay settled. Then they will say: Is it okay if I work 4 days at \nthe same level, but then I do not get paid for that fifth? That is fine \nif that is the flexibility workers want. But do not substitute \nflexibility and say: Well, if you want to work 4 days a week, we will \ngive you that, but, guess what, you are going to be paid less for the \njob than a man. Please.\n  Yes, we are obsessed with this. We are because we Democrats believe \nin justice and fairness and equality, not just in words and speeches \nand reading great quotes from our Founders, but in reality.\n  That means, in reality, we want a woman in the workplace to be able \nto find out if she is getting paid fairly. I am disappointed, but I am \nalso excited that Harry Reid is going to bring this back again and \nagain and again in the hopes that our Republicans in the Senate relent \nand understand this is about\n\n[[Page S2314]]\n\nfairness and justice and equality and the right thing for women in this \ncountry. Not only women in this country, but for their families, their \nchildren. Two-thirds of women either are the sole supporters of their \nfamilies or they are cosupporters of their families. This is an \neconomic issue.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the American economy is the envy of the \nworld, primarily because it is still seen as a place where anyone--\nregardless of who you are or where you come from--can work hard, play \nby the rules, and succeed. That belief is predicated on the notion that \nAmerica has a thriving, competitive, and free enterprise economy in \nwhich the best ideas and hardest workers win the day, while those who \nare less successful always have a fair chance to try again.\n  The free enterprise system is not perfect, by any means, but it is \nfair. Unfortunately today, Americans increasingly believe our system is \nrigged. In President Obama's America, they have good reason. From the \nstimulus to Cash for Clunkers, from the bailouts to cap-and-trade, from \nDodd-Frank to ObamaCare, every namebrand initiative of the President's \nterm of office has distorted public policy to privilege well-connected \ninsiders and elites at the expense of taxpayers and consumers.\n  The Export-Import Bank is another taxpayer-funded example of \ndistorted public policy that further erodes Americans' confidence in \nour markets and our system. In short, the Ex-Im Bank exists to dole out \ntaxpayer-backed loan guarantees to help American exporters. Most of the \nbenefits go to large corporations that are perfectly capable of \nsecuring private financing anywhere in the world. That is to say, \nCongress allows Ex-Im Bank to risk taxpayer money unnecessarily to \nsubsidize well-connected private companies.\n  This kind of public policy privilege, best described as crony \ncapitalism, is a threat to the free market and to its moral \nunderpinnings. Crony capitalism corrupts the free market by rewarding \npolitical connections over competitive excellence. It subverts the rule \nof law by codifying inequality. It undermines social solidarity by \npitting citizens against one another, twisting cooperative communities \ninto rival special interests.\n  That is why in Obama's crony economy, we are seeing record corporate \nprofits but stagnant middle-class wages and an anemic, jobless \nrecovery. Cronyism has promoted and exacerbated inequality. It has \nisolated the poor and it has squeezed America's middle class.\n  There are three principal reasons why we should start making this \ndiscussion part of the public debate and why we should start doing it \nright now: First, we should do this to fix the economy. Nearly all of \nour Nation's net job creation comes from firms that have existed for 5 \nyears or less. But cronyist policies tilt the playing field against \nthose very firms, and make it next to impossible for those companies to \nsucceed, to grow, and to create new jobs that we so badly need, and \nthat the American people so significantly deserve. Leveling the playing \nfield creates competition in both directions. It allows smaller, \nyounger firms to compete, and it forces larger, older firms to do the \nsame. That dynamic competition is what creates new jobs. It is what \ncreates new economic growth. It is what gives rise to new opportunities \nup and down the economy on every step on the economic ladder.\n  Second, this is a matter of basic justice. The American people have a \nfundamental right to equal opportunity under the law, and it is the job \nof the government to protect equal opportunity. If the very people who \nwork hard and play by the rules are forced by government to bail out, \nprop up, and subsidize elite insiders who do not, then the land of \nopportunity, well, is not.\n  Third, as those who most support free enterprise and equal \nopportunity, Republicans must bear the burden of reform. We believe in \nthe power of free markets and a voluntary civil society to expand, lift \npeople out of poverty, and support a secure and prosperous middle \nclass. So it is our responsibility to follow through on our own \nconvictions and close our own branch of the beltway favor bank. It \nstarts with conservatives having an agenda to reform government and to \nend cronyism. Fortunately, some of us have already started working on \nit.\n  These proposals focus on protecting the American people from the \neconomic harm that comes from the collusion of big government, big \nbusiness, and big special interests.\n  For example, we have policy reforms that force Congress to \nperiodically reevaluate expensive regulations; level the playing field \nfor all energy producers; open our higher education system to new \nstudents, teachers, and competition; give Americans the right to choose \nwhether to join a union; cut out the bureaucrats who waste critical \ninfrastructure funding; and, yes, eliminate taxpayer subsidies to \norganizations such as the Ex-Im Bank.\n  This agenda will create jobs, grow the economy, increase \nopportunities by allowing small businesses and forcing big businesses \nto compete on a level playing field where success depends on customer \nservice and not on political connections. A conservative agenda to get \nright on cronyism will be good for jobs, for the economy, and above all \nit will be the right thing to do.\n  Eventually, later this year, the reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank \nwill be before the Senate, and I hope my colleagues will keep these \npoints in mind. But before us today is the nomination of Wanda Felton \nto be First Vice President of the Export-Import Bank. This is a \nposition she already holds, but it is being renominated so that she can \ncontinue holding that position.\n  Ms. Felton, significantly, sat on the board of the Ex-Im Bank, and \nshe did so at a time when the Ex-Im Bank declined to take several \nrecommendations from its own inspector general to lower its risks, \nwhich, in turn, put taxpayers at greater risk.\n  The Ex-Im Bank has also continued to make claims about the importance \nof Ex-Im on job creation without necessary caveats or references to the \nbank's methodology--claims the GAO has heavily criticized.\n  I cannot support putting someone back into this position after that \nperson largely ignored these recommendations by government watchdogs.\n  For all the reasons I have mentioned, I respectfully and strongly ask \nmy colleagues to oppose the renomination of Wanda Felton to be the \nFirst Vice President of the Export-Import Bank of the United States.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to consider the McSweeny nomination, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Terrell McSweeny, of the \nDistrict of Columbia, to be a Federal Trade Commissioner for the \nunexpired term of seven years from September 26, 2010.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today the Senate is voting to confirm \nTerrell McSweeny's nomination to an open seat on the Federal Trade \nCommission. This vote is long overdue as the FTC has lacked a full \ncomplement of Commissioners for more than a year. The confirmation of \nMs. McSweeny will bring the Commission to a full complement of \nCommissioners and ensure that the mission of consumer protection can be \nfully realized.\n  Ms. McSweeny is a highly qualified candidate. She has already served \nas Domestic Policy Advisor to Vice President Joe Biden. She has worked \nhere in the Senate--first as a page while still in high school and \nlater as then-Senator Biden's Deputy Chief of Staff and Policy \nDirector, and she has been a lawyer in private practice. She is a \ngraduate of Harvard University and Georgetown University Law School. I \nhave had the privilege of knowing Terrell McSweeney for a number of \nyears, and I have every confidence that she will make an excellent FTC \nCommissioner.\n  The FTC undertakes critical work to ensure that Americans are \nprotected from deceptive and misleading advertising and marketing and \nto ensure that American businesses do not engage in unfair and \nanticompetitive practices. I would like to commend the Senate for \ntaking up her nomination and urge my colleagues to support Ms. \nMcSweeny's confirmation as a Commissioner on the Federal Trade \nCommission.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Minimum Wage Fairness Act\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Minimum Wage \nFairness Act, which I strongly support. The minimum wage, first \ninstituted in 1938, has served as a key way to protect workers in our \neconomy, ensuring they are able to earn enough money to provide basic \nliving necessities. However, the current minimum wage set at $7.25 \nfails to do that.\n  The Federal minimum wage has not been increased since 2009. Today an \nindividual who works 40 hours per week, 52 weeks a year at the Federal \nminimum wage earns $15,080 per year. This is nearly $5,000 below the \nFederal poverty level for a family of three and almost $9,000 below the \npoverty level for a family of four. This means we have hard-working \nAmericans who put in full-time work every week for the entire year yet \nstill live in poverty. This is unacceptable.\n  If we fail to act, the Federal poverty level will rise with inflation \nwhile the minimum wage will not. As a result, families earning $7.25 \nper hour will continue to fall further and further below the poverty \nline.\n  The value of the minimum wage peaked in 1968, and it is now much \nlower due to inflation. If the minimum wage had kept pace with \ninflation, it would currently pay $10.74 per hour. While the value of \nthe minimum wage has been on the decline, worker productivity has been \non the rise, and that is a disconnect. Increased productivity usually \nmeans there are increased wages that reflect that productivity, but \nthat is not the case with the minimum wage. If the minimum wage had \nincreased with rising productivity, it would be worth over $21 per hour \ntoday. Yet the minimum wage still stays stuck at $7.25.\n  If we were paying workers based on the 1968 level, it would be much \nhigher. If we were paying workers based on their productivity and their \nability to do the job, it would be exceptionally high.\n  The bill that will come before us shortly will increase the minimum \nwage in three installments until it reaches $10.10 per hour and then \ntie the Federal minimum wage to inflation. This would ensure that the \nvalue of the minimum wage will not be eroded over time as it has been. \nThe bill will also increase the minimum wage for tipped workers, whose \nminimum wage has been fixed at $2.13 for over two decades. I must \nsalute the Presiding Officer for his insistence that this provision be \nincluded in the minimum wage bill.\n  Over 3.5 million Americans currently work at or below the current \nminimum wage, and there are millions more who work just above it. \nRaising the minimum wage would therefore increase the wages of everyone \nmaking between the current minimum wage and the $10.10 mark.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 16.5 million Americans \nwould see their wages increased by this legislation. The Council of \nEconomic Advisers estimates that 28 million people would benefit from \nthe wage increase.\n  According to researchers at MIT, a Rhode Island worker supporting a \nfamily of four would need to earn $19.17 per hour to have a living \nwage, a wage in which he or she could adequately support their family. \nYet the current minimum wage lags woefully behind, thereby putting many \nworking families in dire financial situations.\n  The Economic Policy Institute estimates that raising the Federal \nminimum wage to $10.10 per hour--I would point out that our minimum \nwage in Rhode Island is $8 and that is higher than the Federal minimum \nwage--would give over 90,000 Rhode Islanders a raise. That would \nimmediately translate to economic activity in Rhode Island, and it \nwould immediately translate into growth in Rhode Island. That raise \nwould affect almost 20 percent of our workforce. This is a critical \nway--in order to give families the ability to support themselves--to \nincrease economic growth and also significantly begin to bring together \nworkers at every level. We have seen extraordinary gains at the top \nlevel. We have extraordinary stagnation at the mid-level and the low \nlevel. We have to start bringing ourselves together rather than pulling \nourselves apart.\n  Providing a raise to these Rhode Island workers would also impact an \nestimated 40,000 children in those families. Over 3 years, the Economic \nPolicy Institute estimates this will cause the Rhode Island economy to \ngrow by $77 million and support 300 additional jobs. We are talking \nabout economic growth as well as fairness to working Americans.\n  The benefits of raising the minimum wage are vast both in my State \nand across this country. According to the CBO, this legislation would \nlift an estimated 900,000 people out of poverty. It would also help low \nand middle-income families who have been struggling in this economy. \nThis would have a huge impact--and a positive impact--across the \ncountry.\n  Increasing the minimum wage is especially important to women who \ndisproportionately work minimum wage jobs. Fifty-five percent of all \nminimum wage workers are women, including over 70 percent of the tipped \nworkers.\n  Again, thanks to the efforts of the Presiding Officer, we are \nfocusing on this issue of the tipped worker and their minimum wage.\n  While some have suggested otherwise, this legislation is also good \nfor business. Studies show that higher wages allow businesses to save \nmoney because they have less turnover and lower training costs, which \nleads to increases in worker productivity that helps businesses \nsucceed. An increased minimum wage can also help our Nation's small \nbusinesses to compete. It forces the big-box stores to pay wages that \nare comparable to those that are paid by many small businesses, which \nlevels the playing field in the marketplace.\n  Finally, this bill will save billions of dollars on the Federal \nbudget. By raising the minimum wage to $10.10, Federal need-based \nprograms would have fewer enrollees and the costs of these programs \nwould drop significantly. Researchers at the Brookings Institution \nestimate that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 will save at least \n$11 billion annually in the Federal budget,\n\n[[Page S2317]]\n\nand these savings come both from the lower costs of Federal programs \nand increased revenues from taxing a higher base salary.\n  Some critics have suggested that increasing the minimum wage only \nhelps teenagers, but in fact the average age of individuals who will \nbenefit from this legislation is 35 years old. Nationally, over 84 \npercent of those directly affected by this legislation are at least 20 \nyears old and nearly half are at least 30.\n  In my State, according to the estimates by the Economic Policy \nInstitute, 77 percent of workers who would see a raise under this bill \nare at least 20 years old. This is not just the part-time high school \nstudent who works a few hours a week making the minimum wage; these are \npeople who are, on average, 30 years or older who are working and \nstruggling not only for themselves but, in many cases, for their \nfamilies. This bill is something that is beneficial to workers \nthroughout this country.\n  Opponents of the minimum wage have also argued that increasing the \nminimum wage will decrease jobs, citing a recent CBO report. However, \nthe CBO report was generated without any new analyses on the part of \nthe CBO, and their estimates are stated with a great deal of \nuncertainty.\n  In fact, the CBO's own numbers suggest there is a 16-percent chance \nthat increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 would actually increase \nemployment. Economists at Goldman Sachs and at the Brookings \nInstitution say that the CBO report overstates the likely negative \nimpact on jobs.\n  Further, over 600 economists, including 7 Nobel Prize winners, sent a \nletter to President Obama and congressional leaders urging them to \nsupport this bill, saying that ``the weight of evidence now [shows] \nthat increases in the minimum wage have had little or no negative \neffect on the employment of minimum-wage workers, even during times of \nweakness in the labor market.'' They go on to add that it could help \nstimulate the economy as higher wages will lead to increased consumer \ndemand and spending.\n  The most recent research suggests that rather than having job losses, \nthis will contribute to a growing economy. The benefits of raising the \nminimum wage are immense for families, workers, and the economy as a \nwhole.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation to help \nrestore the minimum wage as a safeguard for workers and their families \nin this country.\n\n\n           Recognizing 99th Anniversary of Armenian Genocide\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this month we solemnly recognize the 99th \nanniversary of the Armenian genocide. Ninety-nine years ago the Young \nTurk leaders of the Ottoman Empire summoned and executed over 200 \nArmenian leaders and intellectuals, beginning an 8-year campaign of \noppression and massacre. By 1923, nearly 1.5 million Armenians were \nkilled and over a half a million survivors were exiled. These \natrocities affected the lives of every Armenian living in Asia Minor \nand, indeed, throughout the world.\n  Henry Morgenthau, Sr., who was the U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman \nEmpire during President Wilson's administration and who had urged \nintervention, later remembered the events of the genocide, saying:\n\n       I am confident that the whole history of the human race \n     contains no such horrible episode as this. The great \n     massacres and persecutions of the past seem almost \n     insignificant when compared to the sufferings of the Armenian \n     race in 1915.\n\n  The survivors of the Armenian genocide, however, persevered due to \ntheir unbreakable spirit and steadfast resolve. They went on to enrich \ntheir countries of emigration, including the United States, with their \ncenturies-old customs and culture. That is why today we not only \ncommemorate this grave tragedy, but we celebrate the traditions, the \ncontributions, and the bright future of Armenia.\n  In particular, I wish to note the incredibly strong Armenian-American \ncommunity in my home State of Rhode Island. The Rhode Island Armenian-\nAmerican community, as it does each year, holds events in commemoration \nof this grave tragedy. One will take place this year at the Martyrs' \nMonument at the North Burial Ground in Providence. This monument was \nbuilt 38 years ago in memory of those who were lost in the genocide.\n  This year I once again join with my Senate colleagues on a resolution \nthat encourages the United States to officially recognize the Armenian \ngenocide. Denial of this history is not consistent with our country's \nsensitivity to human rights, ethnic cleansing, and genocide. We must \ncontinue to educate our young people against this type of hatred and \noppression so that we can seek to prevent such crimes against humanity \nin the future.\n  I also remain committed to supporting efforts as a member of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee to provide foreign assistance to \nArmenia to promote economic growth and business competitiveness, \nstrengthen military and security assistance, and support democratic \nreforms and sustainable development.\n  I also wish to express my concern regarding the recent fighting and \nviolence that is endangering the Armenian community in Kessab, Syria, \nand has forced many to flee. This community and so many others continue \nto struggle in the midst of this conflict.\n  We must find a way to recognize what happened 99 years ago and show \nour steadfast support to those who are currently being impacted by \npersecution. I hope we can come together and do that.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today on three matters. First and \nmost importantly is the issue of pay equity. Frankly, we should not be \ntalking about this in 2014--the fact that women still too often do not \nget equal pay for equal work. Senate Republicans showed this morning--\nit is disappointing--that too many in this Chamber simply do not think \nclosing the wage gap between men and women--closing the wage gap by \nwhich working women are victimized--is that important.\n  Think back to 1963, the beginning, not of the civil rights movement, \nof course, but of Congressional action in 1963, 1964, and 1965 on \nvoting rights and civil rights. In 1963, the Equal Pay Act came up \nfirst. President Kennedy signed it. Women were earning 60 cents for \nevery dollar men earned. Now, 50 years later, that figure has increased \nonly 17 cents.\n  How many more years should people in this country wait? In 2012, \nmedian earnings for men working full time in Ohio were $46,700; for \nwomen $35,900, an earnings ratio of about 77 percent. The Paycheck \nFairness Act would shore up the Equal Pay Act and create stronger \nincentives for employers to follow the law while helping women fight \npay discrimination.\n  The pay gap persists across all occupations and educational levels. \nFrom the outset women are paid less than men just 1 year after college \nin nearly every occupation. The gap grows from there. As the gap grows \nin pay, the gap grows in pensions. Lilly Ledbetter taught us that. The \ndecidedly lower pay that she received working at Goodyear showed up in \na significantly lower pension when she retired. Over the course of a \n35-year career, a woman with a college degree will make about $1.2 \nmillion less than a man with the same level of education.\n  As I said, women make less, their families have less, and the \nretirement income and savings are smaller. For Women 65 and older, \ntheir annual median income from all retirement sources--Social \nSecurity, pensions, and private savings--is about $11,000 less than men \nin the same age group. It is even more discouraging for African-\nAmerican women, who make 64 percent less, and Hispanic women, who earn \n53 percent less. That is so, so unacceptable.\n  As a father of daughters, as a husband, as a grandfather of 2-week-\nold Jacqueline Sally, I know--and so does America--this pay gap \ndevalues women's work and discourages economic growth because women \nmake up nearly half of today's workforce. At a time when families are \nstruggling to make\n\n[[Page S2318]]\n\nends meet, equal pay for equal work is not just a gender issue; it is a \nfamily issue.\n  In more than one-third of families, women are the primary wage \nearner. As the main breadwinner, women are asked to carry a greater \neconomic load while making less than they deserve and, frankly, less \nthan they have actually earned.\n  Many of these woman get up early, they take the bus to work, they \nstand on their feet all day, they come home, they take care of their \nchildren, and they do not ask for a handout. But they are asking for \nequal pay. If the wage gap were eliminated, an Ohio woman working full \ntime would have enough money for 88 more weeks of food for her family, \n9 more months of mortgage and utility payments, 15 months of rent, and \n3,000 additional gallons of gas. Our economy would grow, boosting GDP \nby 2.9 percent, or $450 billion.\n\n\n                            The Minimum Wage\n\n  Senator Jack Reed was in the Chamber 45 minutes or so ago when I was \nthe Presiding Officer. Senator Reed talked about Rhode Island and the \nminimum wage and the impact of a lower minimum wage than it should be. \nThey have a bit higher one in Rhode Island than in some States, and we \nhave a bit higher one in Ohio than in some States. But raising the \nminimum wage to 10.10 an hour nationally would mean--he said 90,000 \npeople in Rhode Island. It would be way more, hundreds of thousands in \nOhio who would get an increase in the minimum wage and would get a pay \nraise if this body did what it should, which we are going to try to do \nin the next 3 or 4 weeks; that is, to raise the minimum wage.\n\n  The impact of the minimum wage is especially important for women. \nWhat is especially important for women is the so called ``tipped \nwage.'' This is the tipped wage for people who work in jobs where there \nare tips. It could be a valet, it could be a waitress or a server or it \ncould be somebody pushing a wheelchair at an airport. Their minimum \nwage is only $2.13 an hour, plus tips, if people know to tip the man or \nwoman who is pushing the wheelchair in the airport.\n  I watch pretty closely. I spend a lot of time flying between \nCleveland and Washington or Columbus and Washington. I notice that more \noften than not, people who ride in the carts or are sitting in a \nwheelchair do not tip the worker whose minimum wage is $2.13 an hour. \nThey do not tip the worker because I think they do not know to tip the \nworker. I do not think they are cheap. They do not know that worker may \nbe only making $2, $3, $4 or $5 an hour.\n  But the minimum wage for that tipped worker is only $2.13 an hour. \nWhether they work in a diner in Gallipolis, or Chillicothe, whether \nthey are working at the Toledo or Cleveland airport driving a cart or \npushing a wheelchair, whether they are working as a valet in Cincinnati \nor Dayton, their tipped wage has been stuck at $2.13 since 1991.\n  The State of Maryland recently raised their minimum wage. They did \nnot raise the tipped wage which is stuck where it has been for a number \nof years. Americans do not know this--that typically there is a \nsubminimum wage that is a lot less. Most of the workers--the \noverwhelming majority of workers that get that tipped wage--are women.\n  We know that in restaurants the sexual harassment rate of workers is \none of the highest in the country because they depend on customers for \ntheir tips and they depend on their boss for the distribution of the \ntips to get their minimum wage--$2.13 an hour. Some restaurants pay $3, \n$4 or $5--I am not saying none of them do, but to get their minimum \nwage--their tipped wage--simply up to the minimum wage.\n  Surely, as some will say, in some restaurants the workers make way, \nway, way more than the minimum wage. They are more likely than not male \nworkers who work in the highest end restaurants. You are more likely \ngoing to see women in the diners and the lower-paid service jobs in \nrestaurants.\n\n\n                        Doolittle Tokyo Raiders\n\n  April 18 will mark the 72nd anniversary of the 1942 Doolittle Raid, \nthe first offensive action by the U.S. military following Pearl Harbor. \nEighty men, known today as the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders, volunteered for \nan ``extremely hazardous mission'' without knowing the target, location \nor assignment. The Raiders, led by LTC James Doolittle, launched their \nB-25 Mitchell Bombers 650 miles from their target. After hitting their \nmilitary and industrial targets in Tokyo and five other cities, they \nwere low on fuel, the weather was deteriorating. All 16 planes were \nforced to crash-land in China or Russia.\n  Of the 80 men on the mission, eight Raiders were captured. Of these \neight, three were executed; one died of disease; and four returned \nhome. Their mission traveled an average distance of 2,200 miles over 13 \nhours, making it the longest combat mission ever flown in a B-25 \nMitchell Bomber.\n  I would add that another aviation hero in Vietnam just walked into \nthe Chamber--Senator McCain--right at the time I was talking about the \nDoolittle Raiders. The Senator has signed our resolution and \ncommendation for a Medal of Honor for them. I thank Senator McCain both \nfor his heroism, especially, and for joining us in this effort.\n  In 2002, I led a resolution to recognize the 70th anniversary. It \npassed the Senate unanimously. Early last year, I renewed my efforts to \naward the Congressional Gold Medal to the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders. We \nhave got 78 cosponsors, nine more than the 67 necessary. This bill \npassed in the Senate in November by unanimous consent.\n  On November 9, 2013, the Raiders celebrated their final reunion. They \nhave met every year since the end of--I believe since the end of World \nWar II. They met at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in \nDayton. The meeting marked the last planned gathering of the living \nRaiders, which was celebrated by the opening of an 1896 bottle of \nHennessy cognac, originally given by their commander, Jimmy Doolittle, \non his 60th birthday.\n  Of the 80 men on the raid, only four remain alive today; only 3 were \nable to get to the reunion. Time is running out. I appreciate the \nefforts of Congressman Pete Olson from Texas who is leading the effort \nin the House.\n  I hope the Speaker, the leadership, and both parties will take the \nfinal action needed to pass the legislation to honor these heroes.\n\n\n               150th Anniversary of Gallaudet University\n\n  It is appropriate Senator McCain is in the Chamber too. In 2008, \nSenator McCain, who had served as the Senate designee on the Gallaudet \nUniversity board of trustees, left during his Presidential run. Senator \nHarkin and Senator McCain apparently had recommended that I be the \nSenate designee on the board at Gallaudet University.\n  This week Gallaudet celebrated its 150th anniversary. It is an \nincredible place, as Senator McCain knows. It is the only one of its \nkind in the world, a school for the deaf, created during the \nadministration of President Lincoln 150 years ago in 1864.\n  Senator McCain certainly will have reminiscences and stories about \nserving on this board, but my first dinner my first night at the \nGallaudet University board meeting, the students, all deaf, came out \nand performed a dance for the board. A number of the board hear--as I \ndo, obviously--but a number don't and they signed everything.\n  The students who were dancing to the music were able to dance because \nof the vibrations they felt on the floor. You could see this dance \ntroupe, but if you hadn't known better, you wouldn't have known they \nwere deaf because they were dancing an exact rhythm with the \npercussion, the beat, and the vibrations on the floor in the ballroom \nwhere the dinner was for the Gallaudet board.\n  I wish Gallaudet another 150 years. It is an incredible institution. \nIt has served this country so well. It is partially congressionally \nfunded.\n  Senator McCain, Senator Harkin, and now Senator Moran of Kansas are \nall particularly interested in it. It is an honor to be part of it. I \nwish Gallaudet a happy 150th birthday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Ohio for his service on one of \nthe very remarkable experiences that one could have at Gallaudet \nUniversity--the wonderful, loving, caring people who make us all proud \nof their success. I thank him for his involvement.\n  I also thank him for honoring our heroes today of long ago and far \naway\n\n[[Page S2319]]\n\nwhen the United States was in great jeopardy.\n\n\n                      Littoral Combat Ship Program\n\n  I rise to bring attention to the Navy's littoral combat ship--with \nnot a great deal of pleasure in doing so. It is a troubled major \ndefense acquisition program that, if not properly addressed, will join \na list of failed procurements at the Department of Defense.\n  From the 13 arduous years LCS has been in development, we have \nlearned yet again an important costly basic lesson: If we don't know \nwhat we really want when we procure a weapons system, we are likely not \nto like what we get, if we get anything. In this case, the Navy's poor \nplanning continues to frustrate its ability to state a clear role for \nLCS, the littoral combat ship, has led to dramatic cost increases, \nyears of wasted effort, and a ship that the U.S. Pacific Command \nCommander Admiral Locklear recently conceded only ``partially'' \nsatisfies his operational requirements.\n  The list of how the Littoral Combat Ship Program has failed is ironic \nand--given the amount of taxpayers' investment to date--shameful. In \nLCS we have, No. 1, a supposed warship that apparently can't survive a \nhostile combat environment; No. 2, a program chosen for affordability \nthat doubled in cost since inception and is subject to the risk of \nfurther cost growth as testing continues; No. 3, a ``revolutionary'' \ndesign that somehow has managed to be inferior to what came before it \non important performance measures; and, No. 4, a system designed for \nflexibility that cannot successfully demonstrate its most important \nwarfighting functions.\n  Like so many major programs that preceded it, LCS's failure followed \npredictably from a chronic lack of careful planning from its very \noutset in three areas: undefined requirements, unrealistic initial cost \nestimates, and unreliable assessments of technological and integration \nrisk.\n  In 2002, the Navy submitted its first request to Congress to \nauthorize funding for the LCS Program. Yet even then the program's lack \nof defined requirements drew criticism from the Armed Services \nCommittee conferees. The conferees noted that:\n\n       LCS has not been vetted through the [Pentagon's top \n     requirements-setting body, called the] Joint Requirements \n     Oversight Council [and that] the Navy's strategy for the LCS \n     does not clearly identify the plan and funding for \n     development and evaluation of the mission packages upon which \n     the operational capabilities of LCS will depend.\n\n  Despite the conferees' concerns, Congress approved funding for the \nLCS Program and authorized hundreds of millions of dollars for a \nprogram without well-defined frozen requirements. The Navy, therefore, \ncharged ahead with production without a stable design or realistic cost \nestimates. That resulted in frequent costly changes to the ships, even \nas they were being built.\n  Originally, the Navy wanted a small, fast, affordable ship to augment \nlarger ships in the fleet, with several interchangeable plug-and-play \nmission modules that would be used with aluminum and, separately, \nsteel-hull seaframes. LCS was to serve multiple roles operating in \ncoastal or open waters as part of a larger battle force.\n  The Navy could have easily procured a small warship similar to those \nalready serving in naval fleets around the world. The capabilities of \nsuch ships were well-known at the time and would have required much \nless development.\n  The Navy could also have upgraded older ships with a proven track \nrecord. Without any formal analysis of those reasonable alternatives, \nthe Navy opted instead to develop a high-risk ``revolutionary'' ship \nthat bore little resemblance to anything else in the fleet.\n  Despite the foreseeable costs of building LCS seaframes while \ndevelopment was still ongoing, LCS's original cost estimates were \noverly optimistic. Navy officials have since characterized those \nestimates as ``more of a hopeful forcing function than a realistic \nappraisal of likely costs.'' I can assure my colleagues that if we had \nknown that was the Navy's cost estimates at the time--hopeful forcing \nfunction, more than a realistic appraisal of likely costs--I can assure \nmy colleagues we would never have approved it.\n  While hope for low costs may spring eternal, reality is a far more \nhelpful basis in generating cost estimates. In this case, a realistic \nestimate would have allowed legislators and top defense acquisition \nmanagers alike to make much more informed decisions on procuring the \nLCS.\n  But because of poor planning early in the program, LCS suffered \nthrough years of waste while demonstrating little in the way of desired \ncombat capability. Hundreds of millions of dollars continued to pour \ninto LCS each year, even though the program continually failed to \ndeliver useful capability or conclusively flesh out the ship's unstable \ndesign.\n  Finally, in 2007--remember, 5 years later--Secretary of the Navy \nDonald Winter identified a need to slow down production so that a clear \nLCS design could be established and fixed-price agreements could be \npursued before more taxpayer dollars were wasted. I strongly supported \nSecretary Winter's actions, and I still believe that he effectively \nhighlighted the extent to which LCS was slipping out of control.\n  It was not until 2010, however, that the Navy ultimately began to \nimplement guidelines to bring skyrocketing LCS costs under control. \nWith congressional approval, the Navy overhauled and restructured the \nLCS Program and, since then, the cost of building LCS's seaframes has \nfinally stabilized. But even though the Navy has stabilized these \ncosts, the large investments sunk into the program to date have still \nnot yielded commensurate combat capability.\n  Since the early stages of LCS procurement, I have attempted to shine \na light on the lack of planning that has plagued the program. Last \nyear, I authored legislation to reduce LCS production and require \nvalidation by the Department of Defense and the Navy that the program's \nseaframes and mission packages were on schedule and would meet the \ncapability requirements of combatant commanders prior to additional \nfunding.\n  Congress spoke resolutely on the issue approving that legislation and \nsending a clear message the LCS would need to justify its existence \nwith meaningful progress toward becoming operational.\n  Despite that the cost to complete the construction of the seaframes \nhas stabilized over the past few years, LCS continues to face another \npotentially crippling consequence of poor planning, and that is a \nserious lack in capability.\n  Just last month, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel identified this \nproblem while announcing that the President's budget request for fiscal \nyear 2015 would reduce LCS production by 40 percent, from 52 ships to \n32 ships. Secretary Hagel said:\n\n       The LCS was designed to perform certain missions--such as \n     mine-sweeping anti-submarine warfare--in a relatively \n     permissive environment. But we need to closely examine \n     whether the LCS has the independent protection and firepower \n     to operate and survive against a more advanced military \n     adversary and emerging new technologies, especially in the \n     Asia Pacific.\n\n  Other Department of Defense leaders have expressed similar doubts \nabout LCS's abilities to survive combat situations. Acting Deputy \nSecretary of Defense Christine Fox in a speech on February 11, 2014, \nsaid:\n\n       Niche platforms that can conduct a certain mission in a \n     permissive environment have a valuable place in the Navy's \n     inventory, yet we need more ships with the protection and \n     firepower to survive against a more advanced military \n     adversary.\n\n  The prospect of sending LCS into combat with the lives of American \nsailors at risk is even more chilling in the aftermath of the \nGovernment Accountability Office's July 2013 report on LCS. Early in \nLCS's development, the Navy intended for the ship to be a self-\nsufficient combatant that could engage in major combat operations and \nsurvive in a battlespace actively contested by enemy forces.\n  According to the Government Accountability Office, however, more \nrecent Navy assessments suggest that LCS has little chance of survival \nin a combat scenario. Instead, LCS can only be safely employed in a \nrelatively benign, low-threat environment.\n  GAO also found deficiencies in the ability of LCS to operate \nindependently in combat, turning a supposedly capable warship into a \nvessel requiring significant support from larger ships of\n\n[[Page S2320]]\n\nthe fleet. Such fundamental uncertainty about LCS's capacity to \nfunction as a warship in a combat environment demonstrates a lack of \nclarity regarding LCS's actual capabilities.\n  Recent GAO assessments continue to highlight major problems regarding \nthe LCS Program. According to an article last Friday, a soon-to-be \nreleased GAO report will validate the need for LCS to be subject to \nrigorous testing and evaluation, not just anecdotal lessons learned \nfrom a single overseas deployment. And there is talk of another \nimpending GAO report critical of LCS that will also likely echo the \nissues I have long cited that continue to plague this program.\n  GAO is not alone in expressing concern about LCS's capabilities. In \nJanuary 2014 the Department of Defense Director of Operational Test and \nEvaluation published his annual report and noted that weapons systems \naboard each of the two LCS variants are struggling to demonstrate \nrequired capabilities. The report noted:\n\n       The Navy has not yet conducted comprehensive operational \n     testing of the LCS [and is] still developing the concept of \n     employment for these ships in each of the mission areas.\n\n  It is worth taking a moment to step back and consider the absurdity \nof this situation. Planning and development of LCS has been going on \nfor 12 years, roughly triple the time it took to fight and win the \nSecond World War. In that time, the Navy has spent billions of dollars \nand failed to even figure out how to use the ships it is procuring once \nthose ships demonstrate some semblance of capability.\n  And lest we forget, whether LCS will ultimately be operationally \neffective, suitable, and survivable remains at best unclear. Failure \nthis comprehensive is incredible, even for our broken defense \nprocurement system.\n  The individual mission packages that were supposed to give LCS its \nreal functionality in the fleet present another area of major \nconcern. The LCS's are meant to be outfitted with one of three \ninterchangeable mission packages tailored for particular roles in the \nfleet--antisubmarine warfare, surface warfare, and mine \ncountermeasures. So far, the mission packages have experienced \nsignificant performance issues.\n\n  The antisubmarine warfare mission package has suffered particularly \nsevere setbacks in recent years. When the antisubmarine package was \ntested by the Navy, it actually demonstrated less capability than \npredecessor systems. The Navy subsequently canceled the package and \nreportedly revised its entire strategy for procuring that aspect of \nLCS. The Navy has now stated a goal of fielding the antisubmarine \nmission package by 2018, but no independent assessment has been \nperformed to evaluate the likelihood the Navy will meet that 2018 goal. \nThe program's performance to date, of course, does not fill me with \nconfidence that the goal will be reached on schedule.\n  The other mission packages have also experienced major problems. The \nNavy has taken delivery of early versions of the surface warfare and \nmine warfare mission packages. But according to GAO, both packages have \nexperienced significant performance issues and neither has yet been \nfully integrated into the LCS seaframes.\n  The mine countermeasures mission package, considered by many experts \nto be the most important, is more than 4 years behind schedule. \nAccording to the DOD's Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, the \nmine countermeasures mission package has yet to demonstrate any of its \nrequired capabilities.\n  Given the utter failure of the mine countermeasures mission package \nto date, the Navy has altered its plan for acquiring this package. The \nfull package will be delivered over a series of four increments and, if \neverything goes according to plan, the Navy will successfully \ndemonstrate the capability of the fourth and final increment in 2019, \n18 years--18 years--after planning for the LCS Program commenced. Until \nthen, the Navy will be forced to retain the current generation of \nminesweeping ships.\n  Today, the Navy plans to purchase its final LCS seaframe in 2019, the \nsame year when the mine countermeasures package is supposed to be \nready. If the mine countermeasures package has suffered a delay by that \npoint--and with the history of this program to date, a mere 1-year \ndelay would qualify as an improvement--the Navy will have an entire \nfleet of LCS's with only two-thirds of their planned capability, even \nif all the other problems with the ships are fixed.\n  All of the mission packages need significant further testing and have \nto overcome major integration challenges. That work is likely to drive \nup program costs and leave combatant commanders without the tools or \ncapabilities they need for years to come.\n  The LCS Program faces a daunting combination of capability failures \nand strategic confusion. The Navy does not know what the LCS seaframes \nwill actually be capable of doing once all of them are purchased in \n2019, and it does not know what role they will play, even if \ndevelopment miraculously goes according to plan. Against that backdrop, \nthe need to slow this procurement is clear.\n  Recently, we learned that, at Secretary Hagel's direction, the Navy \nhas established a task force to determine how LCS can best serve the \nfleet going forward. The Navy should, above all else, not repeat the \nmistakes of the past, and Congress must hold the Navy to account at \neach step in the process. This means establishing requirements and \nsticking to them, setting a stable design and holding to it, and \nzealously guarding against further cost growth.\n  I support Secretary Hagel's decision to limit LCS procurement to 32 \nships. I have recommended further reducing the LCS procurement to 24 \nships. More important than the raw number of ships, however, is the \nmanner in which the procurement goes forward. As Congress considers the \nPresident's 2015 budget request and continues to conduct oversight of \nLCS and every major defense acquisition program, we would be wise to \nunderstand this particular program's failings or risk repeating them.\n  The program is still clearly riddled with uncertainty about what the \nships will be used for and what they will be capable of. Production \nshould not go forward until the Navy and DOD confirm that LCS provides \ngreater capabilities than the legacy ships it is intended to replace \nand that the mission packages plus the seaframes have demonstrated the \ncombined combat capability that our combatant commanders need.\n  I understand that in connection with Secretary Hagel's direction to \nlimit LCS's procurement and develop a more capable follow-on ship the \nNavy is underway brainstorming on possible alternatives to LCS that may \nprovide it reliably with the capabilities it needs at a comparable \ncost. Before making final decisions on any procurement, however, the \nNavy must first determine what problem it is trying to solve--exactly \nwhat operational requirements do combatant commanders actually have \nthat cannot be met with current capabilities? This is the step the LCS \nProgram originally skipped. Only after that basic question is answered \ndefinitively should the Navy start considering what material solution \ncould be brought to bear on that capability gap. On major defense \nacquisition programs, that should always be our approach--LCS or no \nLCS.\n  While history of the LCS procurement supports my recommendation that \nwe should not procure ships until we know what we want them to do, that \noutcome is also dictated by plain common sense. We live in an age of \ngreat fiscal uncertainty due to sequestration and other defense budget \ncuts. With that fiscal pressure, there is a much smaller margin for \nerror in the procurement world. Every dollar wasted buying ships with \nunclear capabilities for unspecified missions is a dollar that could \nhave supported a vital defense activity. The wastefulness of excessive \nconcurrency--of buying a system that has not been tested and figuring \nout requirements and fixes on the fly--is more unacceptable than ever \nwhen so many good programs have to make do with sharply reduced \nfunding. I will continue speaking out against wasteful concurrency, \nthat is, acquisition malpractice, as I have done for years.\n  In today's fiscal world, spending money as we have done in LCS is not \njust reckless, not just wasteful, it is dangerous. It actually weakens \nour national defense. It is my sincere hope and firm conviction that in \nthe future we can prove ourselves better stewards\n\n[[Page S2321]]\n\nof taxpayer money than we have in the past. And finally getting LCS \nright would be a big, long overdue step in that direction.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HILLENMEYER, JR.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to and \nlament the passing of a man of great faith from my home State, the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky. Mr. Ernest B. Hillenmeyer, Jr., devoted his \nlife to serving others. He passed away last Thursday at the age of 92.\n  Ernest, or ``Ernie'' as he was affectionately known by friends and \nfamily, was born on a farm in Lexington, KY, on February 26, 1922. \nErnie's formative years occurred when our country was trapped in the \ndepths of the Great Depression. It was during this time that he learned \nthe value of a good education, of family and community, and of faith in \nGod. Through good times and bad, Ernie carried these ideals with him \nfor the rest of his life.\n  Ernie's daughter, Katy Hillenmeyer, has said that ``we'd all have to \nlive to be 200 to accomplish what he did in his 92 years.'' This is \nhardly an understatement. After graduating from the U.S. Merchant \nMarine Academy, Ernie served his country for 10 years in the U.S. Naval \nReserve. In 1985, he was ordained as a deacon and served his parish at \nSt. Patrick Church in Maysville and St. James Church in Brooksville. \nErnie was heavily involved in establishing the Meadowview Regional \nHospital and the Hospice of Hope, both in Maysville, KY. He also \nchaired the Hayswood Foundation for 10 years, served as a director of \nthe Maysville-Mason County Area Chamber of Commerce, and was the first \nlay chair of the board of trustees at Thomas Moore College. Those are \nonly a few of Ernie's many accomplishments from a lifetime of service \nto others.\n  Ernie is survived by his wife, Mary Agnes Farrell Hillenmeyer, his \nsister, Mary Hillenmeyer Fiore, 6 children and 11 grandchildren. Said \nhis cousin, Robert F. Houlihan, Jr., ``He's loved and respected. And he \nwas totally unafraid to die. You can't live a bad life and be unafraid \nof death.'' Although he may have been unafraid, Ernie will undoubtedly \nbe missed by those who knew and loved him. I ask that my Senate \ncolleagues join me in remembrance of the life of Ernest B. Hillenmeyer, \nJr.\n  Mr. President, Ernie's obituary was recently published in the Ledger \nIndependent. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in full in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From The Ledger Independent, Apr. 3, 2014]\n\n               Hillenmeyer Remembered for Life of Service\n\n       Maysville.--During his 92 years, Ernest B. Hillenmeyer Jr. \n     lived by the motto his father instilled during his boyhood on \n     their Lexington farm: ``Be honest, and be of service to your \n     community.''\n       Hillenmeyer embodied that creed through the many decades \n     and facets of his life, each guided by love of God, family \n     and his community.\n       Hillenmeyer, former president of Parker Tobacco Company and \n     a leader in the Catholic Church and civic affairs, died April \n     3, 2014, at the age of 92, at Maysville Nursing and \n     Rehabilitation Center following a long illness.\n       He raised seven children in Maysville, where he lived for \n     the past 68 years, and is survived by his wife of more than \n     52 years, Mary Agnes Farrell Hillenmeyer.\n       The World War II veteran helped establish Meadowview \n     Regional Medical Center in Maysville and Hospice of Hope, \n     which provides end-of-life care and through which, as its \n     first chaplain, he ministered to patients. In 1985, he was \n     ordained a deacon in the Roman Catholic Church as part of the \n     Diocese of Covington's first class of men to enter the \n     permanent diaconate and served his parish at St. Patrick \n     Church, Maysville, along with St. James Church in \n     Brooksville, where he was pastoral associate from 1998 to \n     2002. Thomas More College in Crestview Hills, where \n     Hillenmeyer was the first layman to chair the board of \n     trustees, awarded him an honorary doctorate in May 2013 for \n     his lifetime of leadership and volunteerism.\n       ``Deacon Ernie Hillenmeyer was a gentleman and a man of \n     integrity,'' said Sister Justina Franxman, OSB, his friend \n     and spiritual director for a number of years. ``He loved God, \n     his family and the Church. He was committed to his ministry \n     and saw Jesus in the people to whom he ministered. Ernie \n     loved life to the full.''\n       ``Ernie'' Hillenmeyer was born Feb. 26, 1922, in Lexington, \n     to Earnest B. Hillenmeyer Sr. and Mathilde Scott Hillenmeyer \n     and grew up on his father's farm. His passion for gardening \n     and agriculture dates to his youth tending peach and potato \n     crops with his dad, himself the son and grandson of \n     nurserymen.\n       He attended St. Paul's School in Lexington and later \n     graduated from Campion Jesuit High School in Prairie du \n     Chien, Wis.\n       He graduated from the United States Merchant Marine Academy \n     in Kings Point, N.Y., holding a commission from 1942 to 1952 \n     as an officer in the U.S. Naval Reserve, from which he was \n     discharged as a lieutenant.\n       He spent three and a half years during World War II as a \n     deck officer aboard liberty ships in the Merchant Marine, \n     sailing with the North Atlantic and Pacific fleets.\n       During the war, he met fellow Kentuckian Ellen Cochrane \n     Parker, a Maysville native whom he married in April 1945.\n       His father-in-law, S. Alex Parker Sr. hired Hillenmeyer \n     into the family's tobacco business in 1946 and the couple \n     settled in Maysville, where their four children, Zoe, \n     Theresa, Ernie and Cece, were born.\n       Following his first wife's death in 1960, Hillenmeyer \n     married Mary Agnes Farrell of Ludlow, to whom he was \n     introduced by his childhood friend, the late Msgr. John F. \n     Murphy.\n       Married in October 1961, the couple had three more \n     children, Ellen, Katy and Paul.\n       He frequently traveled abroad for business and hosted \n     international guests in the creek-side house he built in \n     Huntington Park, one of two contiguous subdivisions he helped \n     to develop in Aberdeen, Ohio.\n       Whether sailing houseboats, pitching horseshoes, playing \n     bridge or crosswords, betting horses at Keeneland or cheering \n     on the University of Kentucky Wildcats, Hillenmeyer enjoyed \n     recreating with his family and friends, and delighted in \n     competition.\n       In 1987, Hillenmeyer was a representative attending various \n     Masses when Pope John Paul II visited and met with deacons \n     for a conference, in Detroit, Mich.\n       In all his years teaching card games to his kids and \n     grandkids, he never threw a hand. He took pride, too, in his \n     vegetable and flower gardens, producing homegrown tomatoes \n     and asparagus into his 90s.\n       Hillenmeyer began his long association with Thomas More \n     College when in the mid-1950s he was invited to become a \n     member of the Board of Lay Overseers, to which he was \n     selected chairman in 1960. This Board recommended the \n     college's move from downtown Covington to Crestview Hills and \n     the construction there of a new campus.\n       Along with education, Hillenmeyer worked to advance \n     ecumenism, health care and economic and human development.\n       As a member of the Limestone Ministerial Association, he \n     led ministers and others to locally observe an annual week of \n     prayer for Christian unity, now in its 42nd year.\n       He chaired a fund-raising drive to build a new hospital to \n     replace Maysville's outdated Hayswood Hospital. For 10 years, \n     he chaired the Hayswood Foundation, launching its grant \n     program which donated funds to support St. Patrick School, \n     the YMCA, The Boys and Girls Club and other projects in \n     surrounding communities.\n       A founding member of the Council for Burley Tobacco, \n     Hillenmeyer testified before Congress on behalf of tobacco \n     trade associations, and formerly presided over the Burley \n     Tobacco Dealers Association.\n       He served two terms as council member and vice mayor of \n     Aberdeen; was local district chairman for the Boy Scouts of \n     America; president of the Maysville Country Club; served as a \n     director of the local Chamber of Commerce; formerly presided \n     over Appalachian Industries in Vanceburg, promoting \n     employment and housing; and was a lifetime member of the UK \n     Alumni Association.\n       During retirement, he and his wife, Mary, routinely \n     attended daily Mass, and prayer and scriptural reflection, \n     and continued to nurture their deep bonds of affection and \n     eagerness to share their faith with others.\n       ``Ernie is a pillar--gentle and firm at the same time,'' \n     cousin Robert F. Houlihan Jr., of Lexington said. ``He's \n     loved and respected. And he was totally unafraid to die. You \n     can't live a bad life and be unafraid of death.''\n       He is survived by his wife, Mary Farrell Hillenmeyer; \n     youngest sister, Mary Hillenmeyer Fiore of Kansas City \n     Missouri; six children, 11 grandchildren, beloved in-laws and \n     many other relatives who were dear to him.\n       Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated at 11 a.m., \n     Monday, April 7, at St. Patrick Church, in Maysville.\n\n[[Page S2322]]\n\n       Visitation is 4 to 8 p.m., April 6, with Vigil Prayers at \n     7:30 p.m. at the church.\n       Burial will be in St. Patrick Cemetery.\n       Following the committal rite at St. Patrick Cemetery, \n     friends and family are invited to gather for food and \n     fellowship at the Limestone Center.\n       In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the \n     John J.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor the 10th \nanniversary of the Martin de Porres Center in Columbus, OH. Named after \nthe Dominican Saint Martin de Porres, and sponsored by the Dominican \nSisters of Peace, the center was founded in 2004 as a place for \nspirituality, education, arts, and ministry outreach to the people of \ncentral Ohio.\n  Over the last decade, the center has become a pillar of the central \nOhio community, bringing people together and helping them reach their \nfull potential. For example, through the Dominican Learning Center, \nmembers of the community are able to participate in the adult literacy \nprogram, which provides free one-on-one tutoring. The center also \nserves the Columbus region by connecting youth to its older population \nthrough discussions and study groups.\n  I have visited the Martin de Porres Center and have seen firsthand \nthe excellent work of the Dominican Sisters of Peace. The positive \ncontributions made by the center are countless. Its outreach and \ndedication to the region in spiritual, mental, and artistic growth have \nbeen commendable. I thank everyone involved in making the center's \nfirst 10 years a success and wish them the best of luck in the coming \ndecades.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/09/senate-section/article/S2322-3", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2322-S2323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMMENDING OHIO HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor 393 high school \nseniors in eight northeast Ohio counties for their commendable decision \nto enlist in the United States Armed Forces. Of these 393 seniors from \n129 high schools in 106 towns and cities, 91 will enter the Army, 104 \nwill enter the Marine Corps, 47 will enter the Navy, 32 will enter the \nAir Force, 5 will enter the Coast Guard, 100 will enter our Ohio Army \nNational Guard, and 14 will enter into the Ohio Air National Guard. In \nthe presence of their parents/guardians, and high school counselors, \nmilitary leaders, city and business leaders, all 393 will be recognized \non May 7, 2014 by ``Our Community Salutes of Northeast Ohio.''\n  In a few short weeks, these young men and women will join their \nclassmates in celebration of their high school graduation. At a time \nwhen many of their peers are looking forward to pursuing vocational \ntraining or college degrees, or are uncertain about their future, these \nyoung men and women instead have chosen to dedicate themselves to \nmilitary service in defense of our rights, our freedoms and our \ncountry. They should know that they have full support of this Senate \nChamber, and of the American people, who are with them in whatever \nchallenges may lie ahead.\n  These 393 young men and women are the cornerstone of our liberty. It \nis thanks to their dedication and the dedication of an untold number of \npatriots just like them that we are able to meet here today, in the \nU.S. Senate, and openly debate the best solutions to the many diverse \nproblems that confront our country. It is thanks to their sacrifices \nthat the United States of America remains a beacon of hope and freedom \nin a dangerous world. We are grateful to them, and we are grateful to \ntheir parents and their communities for instilling in them not only the \nmental and physical abilities our Armed Forces require, but more \nimportantly the character, the values and the discipline that leads \nsomeone to put service to our Nation over self.\n  I would like to personally thank these 393 graduating seniors for \ntheir selflessness and the courage that they have shown by volunteering \nto risk their lives in defense of our Nation.

Smith, of Durango, for his impeccable leadership and service. \nDavid retired on April 1, 2014, after a long and distinguished career.\n  David is a consummate public servant, having served the city of \nDurango for 37 years. In his capacity as city attorney, David has \nserved at the pleasure of 55 different city councilors. His tenure is \nthe longest of any city attorney in the city of Durango's 133 year \nhistory.\n  David's legal career, which began 45 years ago in general practice, \nis marked by his outstanding level of professionalism. David is \nrecognized as a leader among legal professionals in Southwest Colorado, \nfostering cooperative relationships among community stakeholders and \ngovernmental entities.\n  In service to his local community, David is committed to the \nadvancement of high-quality education. David has served as a board \nmember and president of the school board for the 9R School District, on \nthe Durango Foundation for Educational Excellence, and on the advisory \nboard for Animas High School.\n  After full engagement and an integral role in shaping the future of \nDurango and Southern Colorado for decades, David is transitioning from \nhis service as the city attorney to enter a well-deserved retirement. I \nam pleased to recognize David's extraordinary service to the city of \nDurango before the Senate today. I wish him all the best in his \nretirement; may the next phase of his life be equally as \nremarkable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/09/senate-section/article/S2323-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING PAUL PAWLAK, SR.\n\n Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and \nhonor the life and legacy of Paul Pawlak, Sr. I knew Paul from my work \nin Connecticut State government. He was a dedicated public servant and \nfamily man who worked on behalf of the town of Seymour and the State of \nConnecticut for his entire life.\n  Living in Seymour, the town where he graduated from high school, Paul \nworked as an electrician for more than 40 years. During that time, he \nalso tirelessly served his community in public office, serving as first \nselectman for 4 years, as second selectman for 8 years, Chairman of \nSeymour's Board of Education for 12 years, and a member of the \nConnecticut House of Representatives for 12 years. In the State \nlegislature, he placed particular importance on protecting our natural \nenvironment, serving as chair of the Water Resources Committee and \nhelping to fight pollution with the Clean Waters Act.\n  Paul also believed in the importance of public health and of strong \nand responsive public institutions to maintain it. He was the first \nchairman of the Lower Naugatuck Valley Public Health Department, as \nwell as a member of the board of directors of the Public Health Nursing \nand Homemaker's Services. And he understood that all these institutions \nneeded to work together and cooperate in order to accomplish their \nmissions. He helped to form the Valley Council of Governments and \nserved as its first chairman.\n  Paul's passing is mourned by all those who knew him and the many \npeople whose lives he affected for the better through his work. Of \ncourse, however, those who will miss him the most are those who were \nclosest to him: his wife Mildred, his brother Andrew, his children Paul \nJr., Joseph, David, and Richard, and the many other family members and \nfriends he leaves behind.\n  For his service to Connecticut, and for the legacy of good work and \nfamily loyalty that he created, I honor Paul Pawlak, and I know that he \nwill not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/09/senate-section/article/S2323-3", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2323-S2324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING BUDDY BROWN SPIVEY\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I wish to honor a larger than life \npersonality and a true American hero, Buddy Brown Spivey, who was \nrecently interred at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Buddy's story is truly inspirational. While serving in the U.S. \nMarine Corps, he was deployed to Vietnam. On December 7, 1966, he was \nseverely injured by an explosion that led most of his\n\n[[Page S2324]]\n\nunit to believe he died that day. The explosion took Buddy's eyesight, \nhis right leg, and caused brain damage. He refused to allow it to take \nhis spirit.\n  After years of rehabilitation, Buddy returned to Arkansas with the \nintention of helping his fellow veterans live happy, productive lives \nafter service. That was the thing about Buddy, he never stopped \nthinking of others despite the difficult circumstances he found himself \nin after his own military service.\n  After earning his master's degree at the University of Arkansas, \nBuddy went to work for the Blinded Veterans Association, where he \nserved as field representative for 10 years. He later worked as a \ncounseling psychologist and social worker at the VA hospital in Little \nRock.\n  It has been said that he rarely missed a day of work. Helping his \nfellow veterans was a job he was paid to do until he retired in 2007, \nbut continued to do long after that. That is how dedicated he was to \nhis fellow veterans.\n  Spivey family members will regale you with stories about Buddy's \ncaptivating personality. He was known as a sharp, at times flashy, \ndresser who wore a suit and tie to work long after business casual \nbecame the norm. He was a masterful storyteller, but he also listened \nto others' stories with the same intensity. After repeat meetings, \npeople were often amazed that Buddy remembered every detail of a \nperson's story from the last time they met.\n  Most importantly, Buddy inspired people. His sacrifices on the \nbattlefield earned him two Purple Hearts and two Bronze Stars. His \nsacrifices after service earned him accolades of another sort. The \nlives he touched, the people he helped, will always remember that \nsharply dressed man who put others first.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/09/senate-section/article/S2324-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING PAUL RINEBOLD\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I wish to honor Paul Rinebold, a \ndedicated Ohio dairy farmer, great-grandfather, and community member \nwho passed away last month. Ohio and our Nation are made strong by \npeople like Paul--men and women who have dedicated their lives to their \nfamily, community, and work.\n  A son of Fostoria, OH, Paul lived his entire life in his community. \nAfter graduating from Hopewell-Loudon High School in Bascom, OH, he \njoined the U.S. Army and served his country for 7 years. During that \ntime, in 1959, he married Ardith Bloom of Fremont, OH.\n  Mr. Rinebold was a self-employed dairy farmer who founded PAR 3 \nFarms, named after himself, Paul (P), his wife, Ardith (AR), and the \nfirst three (3) of what would be their four children. PAR 3 Farms has \nbeen recognized by both the Ohio State and the National Ayrshire \nBreeders Associations for its contributions to the dairy business in \nSeneca County. Mr. Rinebold's family farm is still in operation today.\n  In 2008, the Ohio Ayrshire Breeders Association presented Paul with \nthe Ohio Ayrshire Distinguished Service Award, a testament to the care \nwith which Mr. Rinebold raised, treated, and bred his cows. It was at \nthis awards ceremony that the association thanked Paul and Ardith for \ntheir dedication and expertise in the field of dairy farming. By 2008, \nthe couple had attended more national Ayrshire conventions than any \nother Ayrshire dairy farm in the country, adding up to a total of 40 \nyears' of conventions.\n  While he was not working on the farm, Paul dedicated his time to \nbenefitting the community he called home. Active in his community, he \nwas a member of St. John's United Church Christ in Fostoria; the Seneca \nCounty Farm Bureau; the State and National Ayrshire Associations; the \nNational Dairy Shrine; and both the State and National level of the \nLoudon Center Grange. Paul helped each of his four children earn their \n4-H club 10-year pins in Seneca County, and he enjoyed working with \nthem on their county fair projects and yearly showcases at the Ohio \nState Fair. Paul loved farming, dairying and bowling, but most of all, \nhis family.\n  This week--on what would have been Mr. Rinebold's 76th birthday--I \nwould like to honor him for his dedication, service to our country, and \ncontributions to the Ohio dairy community and his friends and neighbors \nin Fostoria community. I would also extend my thoughts and condolences \nto his family--his wife Ardith, sons Jeffrey and Michael, daughters \nCheryl Ann and Paula, eight grandchildren, Brian, A.J., Jackson, \nBrittany, Brayden, Blake, Taylor, and Cameron, and two great-\ngrandchildren, Anistyn and Chase, on their loss.\n  Emerson wrote ``To know one life has breathed easier because you have \nlived, that is to have succeeded.'' We have all breathed easier because \nof Paul.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/09/senate-section/article/S2324-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 USF HEALTH BYRD ALZHEIMER'S INSTITUTE\n\n Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, we need to find a cure for the \ndevastating disease of Alzheimer's. According to the Alzheimer's \nAssociation, there are 5 million people living with Alzheimer's in \nAmerica today. Last year alone, $213 billion was spent on Alzheimer's \ncare in the United States. And if measures are not taken to address the \nissue, it is estimated this will rise to $1 trillion a year by \nmidcentury.\n  As the senior Senator from Florida and the chairman of the Special \nCommittee on Aging, I am well aware of the toll this disease takes on \nindividuals and their families. In 2010, about 450,000 Floridians were \nliving with this disease, but this number is expected to rise to \n590,000 by the year 2025.\n  Florida is the home of groundbreaking research in the field of \ntreating, and hopefully curing, Alzheimer's. Today I will focus on just \none of Florida's many research institutes, the University of South \nFlorida, USF, Health Byrd Alzheimer's Institute. A leader in the field, \nthe Byrd Institute is already implementing and routinely practicing key \ntenets outlined in the milestones of the Federal Government's 2013 \nNational Alzheimer's Plan, including prevention, memory impairment \nscreening, state-of-the-art diagnosis and treatment, supportive \nservices, and education.\n  As a university-affiliated free-standing Alzheimer's center, the Byrd \nInstitute is one of very few places that can offer high-quality, \nintegrated Alzheimer's care. In fact, USF Magazine boasts that it is \n``the largest facility of its kind in the world.'' The Byrd Institute's \nstreamlined approach emphasizes integrated Alzheimer's care among \nphysicians, researchers, therapists, social workers, support groups, \ncaregivers, and other entities that play a crucial role in the \ncomprehensive well-being of Alzheimer's patients. As an active \nAlzheimer's research site, patients have access to many publicly and \nprivately funded clinical trials. Research productivity at the Byrd \nInstitute has been brisk with $2.7 million in Federal grant \nexpenditures for basic and translational research from 17 new and \ncontinuing Federal grants in 2012 and 2013. The Alzheimer's \nAssociation, along with several other non-Federal sponsors, provided \nnearly $1 million in funding to the center.\n  The institute's strong track record as a regional trailblazer in \nAlzheimer's care demonstrates the vast potential for the expansion of \nsimilar types of care centers on a national level. Moving forward, the \nByrd Institute offers hope for accelerated and improved Alzheimer's \ncare. It is a living and breathing testament to what can be \naccomplished by working together to tackle a problem that affects us \nall and a true model for the future of Alzheimer's care in this Nation.\n  I know that many Floridians--as well as advocates from all across the \nNation--are visiting with their congressional representatives to urge \ngreater funding for research funding at the National Institutes of \nHealth and caregiver support from the Administration for Community \nLiving. I want all Floridians visiting, as well as all of those who \ncouldn't be here today, to know that I share their commitment for \nfinding a cure for this dreaded disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/09/senate-section/article/S2324-3", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2324-S2325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FAIRFIELD EAGLES\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to honor the Montana Class B \nGirls Basketball State Champions: the Fairfield Eagles.\n  In rural Montana, high school basketball is a way of life. Rural \ntowns take pride in their teams' success, and fans often travel hours \nacross the State to see their children, their grandchildren, or their \nneighbors play. Fairfield, MT, is no exception.\n  This year, the Eagles won their fourth consecutive State championship\n\n[[Page S2325]]\n\nand their 104th consecutive game. And they did it in thrilling fashion, \nwinning a 60-to-55 double overtime game that included a 3-pointer to \ntie the game as the buzzer sounded at end of the first overtime.\n  The Eagles basketball team also puts forth the same kind of effort in \nthe classroom; Fairfield has done a great job of turning out some \nincredible student athletes.\n  Fairfield principal and girls' head coach Dustin Gordon makes sure of \nthat.\n  Congratulations on another great season.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nemployers a credit against income tax for employees who participate in \nqualified apprenticeship programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my \ncolleague, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the Leveraging and \nEnergizing America's Apprenticeship Programs or LEAP Act, which \nprovides a tax credit to employers to help increase the number of \nregistered apprenticeships in the U.S. and put more young Americans to \nwork.\n  Today, there are still more than 10 million unemployed Americans, and \nour young people continue to be especially hard hit. Nearly six years \nafter the start of the Great Recession, 16 percent of 16 to 24 year \nolds are without a job. The numbers are far worse among youth of color \nand for those without college degrees.\n  Yet 4 million jobs remain unfilled in the U.S., and part of the \nreason is that key gaps persist between the skills of young adults and \nworkforce needs. By 2020, the United States is expected to experience a \nshortage of 3 million workers with associate's degrees or higher and 5 \nmillion workers with technical certificates and credentials.\n  Apprenticeships are a proven way to help young people develop in-\ndemand skills and to meet the needs of employers, yet they comprise \njust 0.2 percent of the U.S. workforce.\n  While competitor nations around the world are investing in robust \napprenticeship programs, the U.S., by contrast, had just 358,000 \nactive, registered apprenticeships in 2012. That is 7 percent of what \nEngland offered when adjusted for population. In Germany, nearly half \nof all young people go through apprenticeship programs.\n  We can't let America continue to lag behind. That's why Senator Scott \nand I are introducing the LEAP Act, an initiative that provides a paid-\nfor Federal tax credit to businesses to develop apprenticeship programs \nthat are registered with the Department of Labor or a state \napprenticeship agency. The bill addresses the fact that the average age \nof apprentices is currently as high as 29 years, by offering a tax \ncredit of $1,500 for apprentices under the age of 25. The tax credit \nfor apprentices 25 or over is $1,000. The cost of the tax credits are \noffset by a provision that cuts printing waste by barring the Federal \nGovernment from producing publications that are available online, \nunless the printing is for seniors, Medicare recipients or communities \nwith limited Internet access.\n  A thriving apprenticeship system should be an essential element of an \neffective workforce development strategy; registered apprenticeship \nprograms help individuals attain a recognized post-secondary credential \nand provide workers with the education and on-the-job training needed \nto succeed.\n  Studies show that apprenticeships are a wise investment for both \nparticipants and the U.S. government: individuals who complete \nregistered apprenticeship programs earn over $240,000 more over their \ncareers than people who did not participate in such programs, and the \ntax return on every Federal Government dollar invested in registered \napprenticeship programs is $27.\n  Our future competitiveness--our economic strength as a nation--\ndepends on the innovation and skill of our workforce. I am proud to \njoin with Senator Scott in putting forward this bipartisan legislation \nthat will create opportunities for more Americans to learn the in-\ndemand skills that will help meet employers' needs and fuel our \neconomy. I look forward to working with my colleagues to build support \nfor and pass this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/09/senate-section/article/S2328-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 35--PROVIDING FOR A CONDITIONAL \nADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE SENATE AND AN ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE OF \n                            REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. REID submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.
