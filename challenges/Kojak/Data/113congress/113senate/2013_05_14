Madam President, the Republican leader and I follow very \nclosely the Washington Nationals, and we talk often about how they fare \non any given day. We just spent a minute commiserating about a young \nman from Las Vegas, Bryce Harper. We talk about him often because he is \na phenomenon in baseball. Yesterday, while playing in Los Angeles--a \nlate game--he got two walks, a hit, and, as he does all the time--well, \nnot like this--he was chasing a ball full speed and he ran into the \nwall full speed. I told the Republican leader I am going to talk to his \nfamily later. It is too early in the West, but I told him I will talk \nto his mom or dad and find out how he is doing. But he crashed into \nthat wall, and he has 11 stitches in his chin, he was knocked out, and \nhe hurt one of his shoulders. So we will see how he is.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will my friend the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As my friend indicated, we were talking about this \nbefore the session opened. This kid is one the most incredible \ncompetitors I have ever seen.\n  The game was on the west coast, and I don't know whether my friend \nstayed up that late, but I didn't stay up late enough to see the crash \ninto the wall. So when my friend speaks to his mother, remind her that \nthis is one thing on which leaders on both sides fully agree: We are \nhoping Harper has a speedy recovery and is back in the lineup.\n  Mr. REID. And the manager said, when asked afterwards about him, I \ndon't want him to change anything because he is such a competitor.\n  But I think he will maybe have to watch those walls in the future.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Plus, both Senators are wearing the same suit today. It \nis a good day for it.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, we are wearing the same suit.

Madam President, on Thursday Speaker Boehner said a \nremarkable thing. He said: We can't cut our way to prosperity. It was \ngood to hear him speaking candidly, for that is what Democrats have \nbeen saying for years--we cannot cut our way to prosperity. It is \nimportant that we have done some cutting. That is very important. And \nwe are proud of the work we have done. To this point, we have cut more \nthan $2\\1/2\\ trillion.\n  But it will take more than meat-ax budget cuts to keep our economy on \nthe path to full recovery. To protect our economic growth, it will take \na balanced approach, one that couples smart spending cuts with \ninvestments in our future and some new revenue from closing these \nwasteful loopholes I have spoken about to members of the Finance \nCommittee in my caucus on many occasions. Nothing could be further from \nthat balanced policy than the so-called sequester. As long as the \nsequester's harmful across-the-board cuts remain in effect, our economy \nis in jeopardy. And as long as Republicans refuse to go to conference \non the budget and work out our differences, the sequester will remain \nin effect.\n  It has now been 52 days since the Senate passed its budget. Why are \nRepublicans standing in the way? We have talked about that for weeks. \nWe need to move forward and pass a budget that encourages economic \nexpansion by investing in what makes America strong while cutting the \ndeficit.\n  After years--years--of calling for regular order, after years of \ndemanding the Senate pass a budget, I expected Republicans to embrace \nthis process, but I couldn't have been more wrong. Republicans have \nobjected to a conference half a dozen times and counting. It is obvious \nthey are delaying for one nakedly partisan reason: They hope to delay \ncompromise long enough to create another manufactured crisis, as the \nNation once again approaches the debt limit.\n  The debt ceiling is something we used to just move past. The elephant \nnever forgets, but Republicans obviously don't follow their mascot--the \nelephant--as they have a very short memory. Elephants don't, but the \nRepublican Party does. They should remember the political pain they \ninflicted upon themselves--the Republicans--and our country over the \nlast 2 years, in part by driving the country from one manufactured \ncrisis to the next.\n  It is astonishing that Republicans would once again--as they did in \nthe House last week--pass a bill to hold the full faith and credit of \nthe U.S. Government hostage, if only because it is so bad for their \npolitical brand. But it is also bad for our country. The last time \nRepublicans drove us to the brink of default, it cost the United States \nits pristine credit rating, and it cost the economy billions of \ndollars.\n  When I talk about Republicans, I am not speaking about Republicans \ngenerically--that is, Republicans around the country--because many \nRepublicans, if not most, agree these manufactured crises are a waste \nof time and not good for our country. I am talking about and directing \nmy attention to the Republicans in the Congress because they do not, \nobviously, agree with the Republicans around the country.\n  I hope my Republican colleagues will not take their partisan ploy as \nfar as they did in the past. It is time to embrace regular order. It is \ntime to get away from last-minute negotiations and short-term fixes. It \nis time to engage in a responsible budget process. The budget process \nis the only way to work through our differences without bringing the \ncountry to the verge of another artificial crisis.\n  Americans are tired of bitter battles over whether the Federal \nGovernment should pay the bills it has incurred. That is what we have \ndone. We have incurred these bills, and we have to pay them. We have \nmade purchases on credit. Americans know, as Democrats do, that \nCongress won't set sound fiscal policy during last-minute negotiations \nand Congress won't set sound fiscal policy through extortion or \nhostage-taking.\n  The Secretary of Defense is going to announce later today that \n800,000 civilian employees at the Defense Department are going to get \nfurloughs. The decision is how long it is going to be. He hopes he can \nmake it 11 days, but probably it will be 2 weeks. That may not sound \nlike much, but for somebody who is on a budget, a personal budget, \ndepending on their wages, to suddenly hear that during the time until \nSeptember 1 they are going to be furloughed, that they are not going to \nget paid for 14 days, that is a significant amount of money and can \nwreak havoc with their personal budget.\n  What this sequestration is doing is setting bad fiscal policy. It \ncan't happen. We have to compromise. We won't set sound fiscal policy \nwithout sitting down and finding common ground between the Republican \npriorities and the Democratic priorities in this Congress. Passing the \nbudget would clarify each side's values. We did that. We had a vote-\nathon here determining what Republicans wanted to do and what Democrats \nwanted to do. We finished at 5 o'clock in the morning. We thought that \nwas a good step toward compromise, but we were wrong.\n  Republicans will not move forward. We have waited 52 days. The next \nstep is to name conferees, and that will only be a first step. After \nconferees are named, we have to make sure they meet and work things \nout. Right now, Republicans are the only party standing in the way of \nprogress in getting rid of this sequestration. If my Republican \ncolleagues are serious about reducing the deficit and charting a course \nfor economic growth, they should stop waiting around for another crisis \nand start working with Democrats today.\n  Finally, again, it has been 52 days since the Senate passed this \nbill. We need Republicans to follow regular order and move to a \nconference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/14/senate-section/article/S3392-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, over the past few days we have heard \nmany in the media talk about how this has been a ``rough week'' for the \nadministration. That is because it has been a worse week for the First \nAmendment.\n  On Friday we learned that--just as we had been told by our \nconstituents--the IRS deliberately targeted conservative groups across \nthe country in the midst of a heated national election. Over the \nweekend we learned that the extent of it was even broader--even \nbroader--than we originally thought. Then this morning we all learned \nthe targeting wasn't limited to an IRS office out of Cincinnati, as the \nadministration suggested last week, but that it reached all the way to \nthe IRS headquarters right here in Washington.\n  What we don't know at this point is whether it jumped the fence from \nthe IRS to the White House. But we do know this: We can't count on the \nadministration to be forthcoming about the details of this scandal \nbecause so far they have been anything but. So this morning I am \ncalling on the President to make available completely and without \nrestriction everyone--everyone--who can answer the questions we have as \nto what has been going on at the IRS, who knew about it, and how high \nit went--no stonewalling, no more incomplete answers, no more \nmisleading responses, no holding back witnesses no matter how senior \ntheir current or former positions. We need full transparency and we \nneed full cooperation.\n  The American people deserve answers. The answers the IRS has now \nowned up to and that were uncovered by their own inspector general are \nan outrage--an absolute outrage. We now know the IRS targeted groups \nfor using such terminology as--get this--``we the people'' and for \neducating folks about the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\n  I mean, you can't make this stuff up.\n  What is also clear is that government officials repeatedly failed to \nown up to what they knew was going on--when it turns out they'd known \nabout it since at least the middle of 2011.\n  So the IRS knew what was happening--yet they continued to give us\n\n[[Page S3393]]\n\nassurances that they were applying the tax rules in a fair and \nimpartial way.\n  Despite repeated assurances from the Obama administration that it was \nnot targeting its political enemies through the IRS during the last \nelection cycle, we have now learned that the IRS was in fact singling \nout conservative groups--groups who dared to speak up and express their \nFirst Amendment rights.\n  Let's recap what happened.\n  Last March, after receiving multiple claims of unusual harassment by \nthe IRS from constituents who wanted to form tax-exempt political \norganizations, I and several of my colleagues sent a letter to then-IRS \nCommissioner Shulman questioning selective enforcement on tax exempt \norganizations.\n  Now, we learn, according to the IRS' own Inspector General, that the \nIRS was well aware that this selective treatment was happening at the \ntime our letter was sent, and in fact had already acted to correct what \nthey later called ``inappropriate'' behavior.\n  But there was no mention of that in the IRS initial response.\n  Nor was there any mention of this behavior, which was by that time \nwell-known within the agency, in a second letter sent back to us in \nSeptember 2012.\n  We had to wait several more months--to wait for a special \ninvestigator's report that Republicans demanded--in order to find out \nthe truth of what was actually happening at the IRS.\n  In the coming days we'll learn more, and we'll start getting answers \nto questions like: Was the IRS deliberately misleading Republican \nSenators, or was it betraying profound incompetence? But, as I said, \nthe fact is, none of this would have come out if we'd relied on the \nadministration's own word and Republicans had not demanded the truth.\n  Clearly, we've only started to scratch the surface of this scandal.\n  The American people are looking for answers, and I am determined to \nhelp them get to the bottom of this.\n  Last June, I gave a very public speech in which I called out the \nObama administration for serial abuses of government power in going \nafter its political enemies in the middle of a heated national \nelection. The left scoffed at the suggestion. The Washington Post said \nmy speech was full of ``red herrings.'' The New York Times called my \nargument ``bogus''. Robert Reich called it ``bonkers.''\n  Well, you know what we learned last week: these abuses were even more \nwidespread than we knew.\n  So it is good to see even some of my Democrat colleagues now \ncriticizing the IRS for such blatant and thuggish abuse of power. It is \npreferable to the silence--or, worse, encouragement--they have \ndemonstrated in the past.\n  The Chairman of the Finance Committee was correct in referring to the \nIRS' actions as an ``outrageous abuse of power and a breach of the \npublic's trust.'' He's vowed to ``get to the bottom'' of what happened, \nand he's promised that his committee will hold hearings on all this. \nThose hearings should be tough, and they should aim to bring the truth \nto light. But our Democrat friends should also acknowledge their role \nin inculcating this culture of intimidation, due to repeated calls for \nincreased IRS scrutiny of groups like the very ones that were targeted.\n  We owe it to all Americans to get to the bottom of this scandal, hold \nthose responsible accountable, and put the proper safeguards in place \nfor moving forward. Because, as the President was correct in noting \nyesterday, one day a Republican will inhabit the Oval Office. And when \nhe or she does, the left will want to know that they will not be \nharassed for having the audacity to disagree. That an agency like the \nIRS will return to its proper role as a completely non-partisan and \napolitical institution--not a tool for an administration of one stripe \nto bully and intimidate those who adhere to another.\n  But in order for Congress to effectively perform the oversight it \nneeds to do, the administration will have to make everyone who can \nanswer these questions available expeditiously.\n  We have even more questions today than we did last year, and we are \nnot going to accept more half-baked responses. We want the full truth \nthis time. And we intend to get it. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/14/senate-section/article/S3393-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, there is no room for politics at the \nIRS. Senator McConnell is right. Senator Reid is right. They have both \naddressed it. The issue is the IRS has to be completely neutral in \npolitics, but they do have to go after organizations and individuals \nwho are not abiding by the rules, whether they are right, left, center \nor no ideology at all.\n  I remember during the Bush years we saw the IRS targeting liberal \nchurches. It was awful. They were harassing them and forcing them to \nshow that they were nonprofits. Now we see the IRS has been targeting \ntea party groups. Whether they are targeting right or left, that is \nwrong, and anyone doing it, frankly, needs to get another job because \nthat is against the law. We cannot have politically motivated audits or \nharassing people, whatever their politics may be.\n  Here is what we do need. We do need a fair IRS that definitely looks \nat whether organizations, be they left or right, are truly deserving of \ntax-exempt status--that is important--but not targeting one group or \nanother. We also know the targeting of the tea party groups took place \nwhile a Bush appointee was the head of the IRS, probably--perhaps was \nquite unaware.\n  The bottom line is people at the top have to be held accountable. I \nagree with that. He should have known what was going on. But there is \nno room for this. I do believe there has to be serious action taken at \nthe personnel level; otherwise, people will just go ho-hum.\n  No, not ho-hum; you cannot use a position to harass people because of \ntheir politics, regardless of where their politics may lie.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/14/senate-section/article/S3393-5", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3393-S3394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                BENGHAZI\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I wish to be heard on the issue of \nBenghazi. I wrote an op-ed piece on this because I absolutely cannot \nbelieve what is happening with our Republican friends on this issue.\n  As a senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I can say I \nsat through the entire testimony of then-Secretary of State Hillary \nClinton. Not only did she sit for hours, not only was she straight from \nthe heart and straight from the shoulder, she took full responsibility \nfor what went on, and she ordered an independent investigation which \nwas launched by Admiral Mullen and Ambassador Pickering.\n\n[[Page S3394]]\n\nThey did an exhaustive study. What they found is that, unfortunately, \nwe did not have enough security at that outpost. It was not an embassy, \nbut it was definitely an outpost.\n  There is a lot of talk going on about how could this happen--e-mails \nand all the rest. Let me focus on something very important. It takes \nfunding to protect an embassy. It takes funding to protect a consulate. \nIt takes funding to protect an outpost. Yes, it takes funding. Who cut \nthe funds from embassy security? The Republicans in the House, that is \nwho--hundreds of millions of dollars. If it were not for the Democrats, \nit would have been cut more, because when it came here, we stood our \nground. We had to accommodate their cuts. That is how the process \nworks. So I think the Benghazi ``scandal'' starts with the Republicans \nlooking in the mirror. Mirror mirror, who is the fairest of them all? \nThey ought to ask: Mirror, mirror, who cut the funding for diplomatic \nsecurity across this world for America? The answer: Republicans.\n  They cannot stand the heat so they turn it on Secretary Clinton, and \nthat is completely wrong. I believe if we want to know what happened in \nBenghazi, it starts with the fact that there was not enough security. \nThere was not enough security because the budget was cut. Secretary \nClinton said that she, in hindsight, should have definitely fought \nagainst it even harder than she did. But let the record show she \npredicted problems. When she saw the cuts--I don't have the exact quote \nin front of me but to paraphrase--she said there are going to be \nproblems here. This budget is cut too much. And she was right.\n  What about these talking points? I do not know if the Presiding \nOfficer sits down with her staff to discuss how she is going to phrase \nsomething. I don't know whether the Presiding Officer does that or \nwhether she just does it by herself. What I do or what most people do \nis they have a collaborative process. When we are trying to put out a \npress release with a whole number of agencies having to sign off on it, \nit is a collaborative process. At the end of the day, one statement was \napproved. The statement that was made by Susan Rice, her paraphrasing \nof the statement was: It looks like this started because of this \nprotest, but we don't know for sure. We don't know and as soon as we \nknow we will say.\n  The day of or the day after what happened in Benghazi, the President \nof these United States, President Obama, stood and said this was a \nterror attack.\n  Why are the Republicans playing politics with this? It is pretty \nclear. Their attack coincides with the Karl Rove ad against Secretary \nof State Hillary Clinton. They are going after her. Why? Because they \nare looking to the 2016 Presidential election.\n  I have to say, keep politics out of the IRS, keep politics out of \nBenghazi. Don't take four beautiful Americans who died in a tragic \nfashion and play politics, 2016 politics, with it. It is an outrage.\n  So I say they should start off by looking in the mirror, stepping to \nthe plate, admitting that they cut too much from embassy security. If \nthey want to hold a hearing on it, fine. If they want a hearing, they \nneed to call the people to the table who can help us make sure this \nnever happens again.\n  I will continue to speak out on Benghazi, and I will continue to \nspeak out on whatever issues my Republican friends are pounding on. At \nthe end of the day, the bottom line is, Who cut the money for embassy \nsecurity?\n  If they want to divert attention from that, be my guest, but I will \nbring it home. Everyone knows if we had adequate security there, it \ncould have well been a different outcome.\n\n\n                                  WRDA\n\n  If there are any Senators who have amendments, please come down to \nthe Senate floor. Let's get this done. We hope to get this agreed to in \na timely manner. Let's get to the amendments. There is a whole list of \nbipartisan amendments we believe have been cleared. Let's get this bill \ndone.\n  The rating we have been given from the engineers is a D-plus for our \ninfrastructure. We need to deepen our ports and there needs to be more \nflex control. We need to invest in water infrastructure as well as \nrestore our wetlands. We have a lot of work to do.\n  We are entering into a period of time now where there is more and \nmore extreme weather--weather we have never seen before. We need to \nmake those investments to prevent the worst from happening. We saw what \nSuperstorm Sandy, that one event cost: $60 billion. How does it make \nsense to pay after the fact? We need to invest.\n  This bill has a lot of important reforms. People know we need to fix \nour infrastructure. We need to fix our roads, bridges, and water \ninfrastructure. It has to be done.

Madam President, I rise to speak out against the \nalarming reports that have recently surfaced by the IRS and the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  As the Federal agency tasked with administering the U.S. Tax Code, \nthe IRS has an extraordinary influence on the lives of all Americans, \nfrom all walks of life and all points of view. As citizens we have the \nabsolute right to expect the IRS to be free from political influence, \nwith taxpayers treated fairly and enforcement carried out in an \nunbiased manner. Unfortunately, in recent days we have learned our \nexpectations are far adrift from reality.\n  Last week the Internal Revenue Service acknowledged a history of \ntargeting conservative politically active groups during their process \nof seeking tax-exempt status. This practice first involved flagging \ngroups concerned about government spending and debt. Ironically, such \ntargeting comes at a time when poll after poll indicates the Federal \nGovernment's out-of-control spending and our $17 trillion debt are top \nconcerns for all Americans. I can tell my colleagues from my experience \nit is the top concern for Nebraskans.\n  Despite these legitimate concerns and the patriotic desire of \nAmericans to effect change in government, the IRS worked to impede \nthese organizations with one of the bluntest instruments of government: \nregulatory abuse. The IRS demanded inordinate amounts of documents from \nthese groups, including donor lists, which served to unfairly delay the \ntax-exempt certification of these well-intentioned groups.\n  This news is alarming on multiple fronts. First and foremost, it is \nunacceptable that the IRS would blatantly target any of our fellow \ncitizens, let alone groups of Americans whose views are at odds with \ntheir own. As the Washington Post noted in today's lead editorial: \n``Any unequal application of the law based on ideological viewpoint is \nunpardonable--toxic to the legitimacy of the government's vast law \nenforcement authority.'' I couldn't agree more.\n  These activist groups were simply trying to exercise their First \nAmendment rights of peaceable assembly and free speech--the cornerstone \nof our democracy. Yet their reward for expressing concern about the \ndirection our country is going was to be singled out in an attempt to \nprevent them from fully engaging in the democratic process.\n  It has been reported that the targeting of these Americans--and \nmuffling of their voices on the pressing issues facing our country--\nbegan in 2010. What has happened since then? The passage of very \nconsequential pieces of legislation, including ObamaCare and the Dodd-\nFrank Financial Reform Act, multiple debates on how to address our \nNation's dire fiscal situation, two national elections, including last \nfall's Presidential election.\n  As alarming as the actions of the IRS are, I am even more troubled by \nthe IRS trying to hide these actions. When an IRS official last week \nfinally acknowledged and apologized for the targeting of conservative \ngroups, it was more than 3 years after the practice is said to have \nbegun. It was more than 1 year after the current Acting IRS \nCommissioner, Steven Miller, is reported to\n\n[[Page S3395]]\n\nhave become aware of the targeting, but it doesn't stop with Mr. \nMiller.\n  As the Washington Post noted: ``Lois Lerner, the head of the IRS's \ntax-exempt organization office, knew about the targeting in 2011; she \nseemed to say Friday that she learned about it from news reports last \nyear.''\n  These were not the malicious actions of a rogue agent or simply \nanother example of government incompetence; instead, this was a clear, \nmethodical abuse of government power to discriminate against whole \ngroups of Americans simply because of their political beliefs.\n  Despite their awareness of abuse, officials from the IRS failed time \nafter time to disclose this targeting and little effort was made to end \nthe practice. Even as recently as their admissions on Friday, the IRS \ncontinued to engage in coverups and half-truths. In fact, IRS officials \nseem to go out of their way to deny wrongdoing.\n  In testimony last year before the House of Representatives, then-IRS \nCommissioner Douglas Shulman said there was ``absolutely no \ntargeting.''\n  After years of neglecting to inform Congress of this practice, the \nlong overdue admission was the result of diligent lawmakers exercising \noversight along with a soon-to-be released report from the Treasury \nInspector General for Tax Administration.\n  The time for muted outrage and limp apologies has passed. The \nAmerican people deserve nothing less than absolute assurance that this \npractice will not happen again. Those who are responsible must be held \naccountable and removed from their positions. The policies that enabled \nthis gross abuse of power must be changed immediately.\n  It is also worth noting the IRS is one of the lead Federal agencies \nin charge of implementing ObamaCare. It does not appear the IRS is in \nany condition to implement this highly controversial law, particularly \nas public trust in this agency continues to plummet.\n  Just yesterday we learned of another breach of public trust and \nanother potential violation of our First Amendment freedom--the freedom \nof the press. Press reports indicate the Department of Justice secretly \nobtained extensive telephone records of reporters and editors for the \nAssociated Press in what the head of the news organization called a \n``massive and unprecedented intrusion'' into how news organizations \ngather the news. According to the Associated Press's legal counsel, the \nrecords obtained included those from reporters working out of the House \nof Representatives press gallery.\n  While it is unclear at this point how many reporters were targeted \nand why, the effect of this data gathering is clear: intimidation of \nthe press and suppression of free speech.\n  This is unacceptable. A free and unfettered press is vital to any \ndemocracy. Moreover, the scope of this information gathering is simply \nbeyond the pale--and likely beyond precedent.\n  The Attorney General and the President owe the American people \nanswers, and they owe them now. These recent abuses of power by both \nthe IRS and the Department of Justice are just the latest episodes of \nthis executive branch's disturbing pattern of overstepping its lawful \npowers.\n  We have seen this in the President's unconstitutional recess \nappointments. We have seen this in the EPA's disclosure of classified \ninformation of cattlemen to activist environmental groups. We have seen \nthis in a lack of forthrightness with our government's response to the \nattacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.\n  The result of this methodical government overreach has a powerful \nchilling effect on citizens. There is no place for that in a democracy. \nThere is no place for that in the United States. The American people \ndeserve a government that jealously guards the liberties of its \ncitizens, not a government that tramples on our basic constitutional \nrights.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the interest of all Senators, and \nfrankly in the interest of the people of this country, we are moving \nforward on the Water Resources Development Act. The question is, will \nwe be able to clear a list of amendments, some by voice vote, and a \nfurther list of more controversial amendments by recorded vote. I am \nhoping that is the case. Senator Vitter and I hope that is the case, \nthat we can get clearance on these packages of amendments. If we do \nnot, we have to decide whether to invoke cloture, which will bring \ndebate to a close. If we have to go that way, we have to go that way. \nBut I am very optimistic that we can get these amendments cleared \nbecause, frankly, almost every Senator here has a stake in this very \nimportant legislation.\n  We have ports that are sometimes on the coast, sometimes they are \ninland. We have waterways. We have floods in our States. Not all of us \nbut most of us. We have environmental restorations in our States with \nwetland conservation. We have work to do on our water infrastructure. \nOur infrastructure in this country has been rated a D-plus. That is not \nvery heartening for the greatest country in the world. We have a weak \ninfrastructure. Frankly, that is not good enough.\n  I want to read a list of supporters for our legislation. I think what \npeople will notice is how broad-based the list is. They are either \nrepresenting workers or businesses, or they are businesses themselves. \nThey are businesses that need to ship products. So let me read this. \nThere are environmental organizations.\n  The AFL-CIO supports us; the American Association of Port \nAuthorities; the American Concrete Pressure Pipe Association; the \nAmerican Council of Engineering Companies; the American Farm Bureau \nFederation; the American Foundry Society; the American Public Works \nAssociation; the American Road and Transportation Builders; the \nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers; the American Soybean Association; \nAssociated Equipment Distributors; Associated General Contractors; \nAssociation of Equipment Manufacturers; the Clean Water Construction \nCoalition; the Concrete Reinforced Steel Institute.\n  I can't even go through it all, it is such a very long list. There is \nthe National Association of Flood and Storm Management Agencies, the \nNational Governors Association, the National Stone, Sand and Gravel \nAssociation, the National Waterways Conference, Inc, the American \nInstitute of Architects, the National Association of Manufacturers, The \nNature Conservancy, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the United \nBrotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. There are more. It is \nsuch a long list.\n  I ask unanimous consent to place this list into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                National Organizations Supporting S.601\n\n       AFL-CIO, American Association of Port Authorities, American \n     Concrete Pressure Pipe Association, American Council of \n     Engineering Companies, American Farm Bureau Federation, \n     American Foundry Society, American Public Works Association, \n     American Road and Transportation Builders Association, \n     American Society of Civil Engineers, American Soybean \n     Association, Associated Equipment Distributors, Associated \n     General Contractors of America, Association of Equipment \n     Manufacturers, Clean Water Construction Coalition, Concrete \n     Reinforcing Steel Institute.\n       Construction Management Association of America, \n     International Federation of Professional and Technical \n     Engineers, International Liquid Terminals Association, \n     International Propeller Club of the United States, \n     International Union of Operating Engineers, Laborers \n     International Union of North America, Management Association \n     for Private Photogrammetric Surveyors (MAPPS), NAIOP, The \n     Commercial Real Estate Development Association, National \n     Association of Flood and Storm Management Agencies, National \n     Governors Association, National Grain and Feed Association, \n     National Ready Mixed Concrete Association, National Retail \n     Federation, National Society of Professional Surveyors \n     (NSPS), National Stone, Sand and Gravel Association, National \n     Waterways Conference, Inc.\n       Plumbing Manufacturers International, Portland Cement \n     Association, The American Institute of Architects, The \n     Fertilizer Institute, The Nature Conservancy, Transportation \n     Construction Coalition, U.S. Chamber\n\n[[Page S3396]]\n\n     of Commerce, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of \n     America Waterways Council, Inc., National Association of \n     Manufacturers; AASHTO.\n       Letter signed by 160 organizations to Members of the United \n     States Senate (April 29, 2013)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. The point is this legislation represents jobs. This \nlegislation represents moving products. This legislation represents \nflood control. This legislation represents fixing our ports, making \nsure we have some reforms that work well. This makes sure that when the \nArmy Corps sets a project timeline, the resources agencies are in the \nroom. It is very important. I have to say, as this country sees, there \nis a lot of partisanship going on; this is a bipartisan bill.\n  The bill made it through the Environment Committee without a single \n``no'' vote. Since then, Senator Vitter and I have been working with \nall Senators, whether they are on the committee or off the committee, \nto meet the needs of their States to work with them. I think we have \ndone everything in our power to help every State.\n  We know the last WRDA bill was 2007. We used to have a WRDA bill \nevery couple years, but everything has gotten so controversial. What \nhappened between then and now is a ban on earmarks. This bill used to \nbe a bill that listed projects. We can't do that anymore. What we have \nto do is figure out a way to fund the needed projects while averting \nearmarks.\n  We did it by saying if there is a completed Corps report then, in \nfact, the project can go forward. We set up a way for future projects \nto be handled with the local communities coming forward.\n  I think we handled that issue well. We focused on flood control, \nports, and environmental restoration. We have a piece that deals with \nthe Everglades. If you have never been to the Everglades, it is a \nnational treasure, River of Grass. That is what it is called. It is a \nmagnificent, amazing, fabulous, environment, but it needs to be \npreserved and protected.\n  When my spouse and I went there with Senator Nelson, we went down \nthrough the Everglades. All of a sudden we see a deer jump up. The deer \nis actually living on the water on these little berms. It is the most \nremarkable thing I have ever seen.\n  We put WIFIA in here based on a program we call TIFIA, which will \nallow us to help local areas leverage their funds and build these \nprojects more quickly. It goes on and on. We have terrible threats from \nflooding in places such as Sacramento, for example. We are looking at \ntens of thousands of Californians at risk and $7 billion in property. \nWe say, OK, it is time to get that done.\n  We look at flood protection for the 200,000 residents of Fargo, ND, \nand Moorhead, MN. They have been fighting rising floodwaters in recent \nweeks. We will restore the reliability of levees that protect places \nsuch as Topeka, KS. It goes on to Texas. I could name literally every \nState in the Union that has something at stake.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator from California and the chair of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee for her work on this important \nproject. I do wish to mention we have in Vermont one small concern that \nI hope will be addressed in this bill. In Vermont we have suffered \nthrough Irene, and it was a devastating experience for many communities \nin the State and for businesses.\n  The problem we are having now is that we have State regulations which \ncorrectly require that culverts be built which can, in fact, deal with \nthe real problems of flooding. Unfortunately, what FEMA is prepared to \npay for is inadequate infrastructure--culverts, among other things, \nthat will not address the problem if we have to deal with another \nproblem such as Irene.\n  This is a very modest proposal. Senator Leahy and I feel strongly \nabout this issue. I know the chairperson is sympathetic. There appears \nto be some problems on the other side, and I very much hope we can \nresolve this.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. There is an amendment, I would say to my friend \nthrough the Chair, on our list that we have agreed to, Senator Vitter \nand I. There will probably be a vote on this proposal. I will ask my \nstaff is that correct, on the Leahy-Sanders amendment on the culverts \nif it is on the list.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I had heard there was some objection on the other side.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We are trying to work out the objections, but we will \nhave a vote on it if we cannot. We are working on it.\n  Mr. SANDERS. It is very important to Senator Leahy and me that be \naddressed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator. We are doing everything in our \npower. This shows the American people right on the floor of the Senate \nthe way Senators have been working with us. I wish to say to my friend \nI am so proud he is on the Environment and Public Works Committee and \nhow he has looked after his State. He has some very important things in \nthis bill.\n  As a matter of fact, his work on the extreme weather title is very \nimportant and would allow us to prevent these terrible floods before \nthey start. Yes, we are looking at things such as this in every State. \nWe are trying to do everything in our power to meet every Senator's \nneeds.\n  Sometimes what happens is it is kind of like that pop-up game. \nSomething pops up over here, and it is OK, but then something else pops \nup over here. It is the legislative fix we are trying to meet and get \nto here, the legislative fix so every State feels comfortable.\n  This is an important bill. There is no other bill that deals with the \nEverglades. There is no other bill that will deal with the Chesapeake \nBay. There is no other bill that is possible that would allow us to \nmove forward with these important flood control issues, because when we \nended earmarks, we had no way to authorize any programs.\n  This Boxer-Vitter bill is not just an important bill, it is an \nessential bill. We need to move forward.\n  The extreme weather title I talked about that Senator Sanders helped \nus write will require the corps and the National Academy of Science to \njointly evaluate options for reducing risks related to future extreme \nweather events. Let me say that again. Right now the corps is not \nauthorized to look ahead and say, given the extreme weather we are \nhaving, what is it we can do across this country to prepare. This study \nwill give us a roadmap to that.\n  Without this bill, we don't have it. Without this bill, we have no \nreforms in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. People are paying good \nmoney into the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for dredging our ports. \nYet the full amount of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund is not going \nfor those uses.\n  We make moves toward capturing more of those funds. The smaller ports \nhave a good title, the Great Lakes, the seaports that are large donors \nsuch as Los Angeles and Long Beach make progress. I think it is a win-\nwin. Our bill is certainly not perfect. Every one of us could write it \nin ways that benefit our States even more, I think there is no \nquestion, starting with the chairman of the committee. But we have to \ndeal with everybody's issues, everybody's concerns, everybody's \nproblems.\n\n  We support 500,000 jobs in this bill. There are very few bills that \ncome before us that could make that claim.\n  I think we can show the American people we can work together. We have \nthis one last stage, and we are working so hard.\n  I wish to say to my staff--who are still working. My staff and \nSenator Vitter's staff have worked nonstop. I am talking about \nSaturday, Sunday, last night. They were still in the office at 11 \no'clock. I just want to praise them. People don't see that. People \ndon't understand these bills don't magically appear.\n  Dealing with every Senator, I think everyone knows every one of us \nhas a very strong personality. They truly care about their States and \nfight for their States. It is tough to try to preserve everyone's \nrights and everybody's wishes. We have to work with Senator Mikulski in \na very good way and Senator Shelby. Senator Landrieu has worked hard on \nthis bill, and now she has an amendment we are trying to dispose of. I \nhope we will get the approval to do that.\n  Once we finish our work, Congressman Shuster, Chairman Shuster over \nin the House, needs to pass a bill or could take up our bill and pass \nit.\n  When I read this list to you, I didn't even get to all of the names. \nThis is\n\n[[Page S3397]]\n\none of the broadest coalitions I have ever seen behind any piece of \nlegislation. It is a huge and important coalition. It represents \nAmerica. It is people who work every day at building the \ninfrastructure, utilizing the infrastructure, and making sure our homes \nare safe from flooding. The list includes the National Governors \nAssociation. It is a rarity to have that kind of a list.\n  At this point, we are supposed to vote at noon, and we will be back \nto you with some further comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/14/senate-section/article/S3397-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Military Sexual Assault\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the sexual assault \ncrisis that is facing our military and the need to act immediately to \naddress this problem.\n  Last week, the Department of Defense released a report estimating \nthat over 26,000 servicemembers--and this includes men and women--were \nsexually assaulted in 2012, and this is up from approximately 19,000 in \n2010. This is astounding and totally unacceptable.\n  Even more alarming is the fact the number of cases actually reported \nremains just a fraction of the total. Only 13 percent of these cases \nare actually reported. Let me repeat that: Only 13 percent of assaults \nwere actually reported in 2012.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee and a Senator from North \nCarolina, home to the third largest military population in the country, \nI find these statistics appalling. The brave servicemembers who put \ntheir lives on the line should not have to worry about their personal \nsafety on bases in the United States and around the world. The men and \nwomen who are already tasked with so much, who have vowed to serve and \nprotect our country, should feel they are afforded the same protection \nin return, but they are not.\n  The stories I hear from our female servicemembers are astounding. One \nwoman marine was raped by an acquaintance, her fellow marine, in her \nbarracks one night. No one heard her cries for help. The next day she \ndid report the assault to her chain of command. An investigation was \nlaunched from there. While that investigation was underway, from June \nto January, she was heavily alienated by her peers. She was called \nderogatory names, and her sergeant major even told her the assault was \nher fault because she must have given her rapist a reason to think it \nwas OK. In the end the official investigation found her claim was \n``unfounded'' because there were no witnesses, and she did not know at \nthe time she should have gone to the hospital and had a rape kit \nanalysis done.\n  Other servicemembers--women who have served on forward operating \nbases in Afghanistan--have told me they limit their water intake \nthroughout the day so they do not have to use the latrines in the \nmiddle of the night and by doing so put themselves at further risk of \nbeing assaulted. No one should ever have to deal with those kinds of \nconcerns, especially when they are already putting their lives on the \nline to protect our Nation.\n  The Department of Defense has reported that half of all \nservicemembers who were victims of sexual assault say they are actually \nafraid to report out of fear of retaliation or that their \nconfidentiality will not be maintained. Others believe reporting the \ncrime will jeopardize their military career. They fear they would not \nreceive opportunities for advancement--opportunities they have earned \nthrough service to our country.\n  This is just totally unacceptable. The men and women of our Armed \nForces deserve far more. We have to deal with this problem once and for \nall, and I am encouraged the National Defense Authorization Act of 2013 \nincludes specific directives to reduce the alarming number of assaults \nthat take place and often go unreported.\n  Specifically, these provisions include independent review boards to \nexamine how sexual assault cases are handled, the creation of a special \nvictims unit, ensuring convicted offenders are permanently barred from \nthe military, improving how the military collects data on this topic, \nand several other needed provisions.\n  During his confirmation process, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel \nsaid he was committed to fully implementing these directives, and I \nurge Secretary Hagel to report to Congress on the progress made as \nswiftly as possible. I still believe Congress should and must do more. \nThe steps I believe we should consider are, first, the creation of a \nspecial victims counsel that would include advocates who can support \nvictims and help them report incidents of sexual assault.\n  As I mentioned, too many victims do not come forward because they are \neither afraid of retaliation, they do not believe their confidentiality \nwill be maintained, or they do not have faith in the military justice \nsystem. As in the case of the woman I described who had been raped, she \ndid not know she should have had an analysis of rape actually done. \nThese victims advocates would have given her that advice.\n  Second, we are fortunate in the Senate to have a number of former \nprosecutors engaged on this issue. Over the last 20 years, they and \ntheir colleagues have made great strides in handling sexual assault \ncases in the civilian world, and I believe we should take the lessons \nlearned from that process to improve the military's response--lessons \nincluding proper training for tackling evidentiary issues and \naddressing victims' needs.\n  Third, commanding officers can overturn verdicts of jury trials, as \nhappened in the Air Force earlier this year. These are commanding \nofficers, they are not appellate judges; they are not legally trained. \nThey should not have the authority to overturn a verdict. I believe we \nshould review that authority as it applies to sexual assault cases, \nsomething Defense Secretary Hagel has indicated should be a priority.\n  Finally, we need to explore whether the present Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice is up to the task of addressing the problem of sexual \nassault. I believe both the Armed Forces and the cause of justice would \nbe well served by a vigorous debate in Congress on whether sexual \nassault cases can be effectively handled within the chain of command or \nwhether this process needs to occur independently. Significant \noverhauls of the Uniform Code of Military Justice should not be \napproached lightly, but we owe it to our servicemembers to think \noutside the box and consider all possibilities.\n  These men and women of our military cannot wait another day, and they \nshould not have to wait another day for this problem to be addressed. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in taking concrete steps to address this \nissue and to\n\n[[Page S3398]]\n\nprotect the men and women who sacrifice so much for us each and every \nday.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senators Boxer and Vitter have worked hard \nfor days now to come up with a finite list of amendments to complete \nwork on this very important bill, the Water Resources Development Act. \nIn just a minute I am going to ask consent that we postpone the vote \nscheduled for 12 today until 2:30. We will come back in session, I \nhope, at 2:15 today. When we come back in session I want Chairman Boxer \nto report to the Senate if they have been able to work out an agreement \nbetween the two of them. If they have, I want her to ask the consent \nand when she asks that consent, if there is an agreement, we will work \nthrough a number of amendments they have come up with to complete work \non this bill.\n  If there is no agreement at 2:15 when she comes in, then we will vote \nat 2:30 on cloture. I hope that is not necessary. But I am not going to \nhave any ``I'm objecting on behalf of somebody else.'' If it is not \ndone, I don't care who objects, we are going to move to cloture. That \nis what I believe should be done.\n  It is a lot of work to get this agreement. I think tentatively it has \nbeen done. We know how things work; one Senator can block all this. I \nhope that is not the case. I know the block will not come from our \nside. Senator Boxer has the complete confidence of all members of our \nconference. They recognize that she has worked hard on this and has \ndone the right thing--as she always does.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the motion to invoke cloture \non S. 601 be moved to 2:30 p.m.\n  I will ask, while she is on the floor, the Senator from California, \nthe chairman of the committee, is there anything I have missed in my \nstatement?\n  Mrs. BOXER. If my friend will yield, through the Chair, I think he \nhas covered it. Basically what I want to make sure people know as they \ngo to their various conference meetings this afternoon is that we have \na very fair list. I think it probably has more Republican amendments \nthan Democratic amendments. We have done everything to reach an \nagreement.\n  But I also want to support my leader. If there is objection to this \nimportant list of amendments, we will go straight to cloture. I want \neveryone to understand, without this bill there will be no more water \ninfrastructure projects because there is no path forward. Since we \nended earmarks, this is the one bill that will make sure there is a \npath forward. Without water infrastructure earmarks you cannot keep \ncommerce moving at the ports, you can't do flood control, you can't \nrestore the Everglades or the Chesapeake. I strongly support what my \nleader is doing but I also hope colleagues will please allow us to move \nforward, make the cloture vote unnecessary. But we are going to have \nthat cloture vote, if necessary, at 2:30.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the vote on the motion to invoke \ncloture on S. 601 be moved to 2:30 p.m. this afternoon; that if cloture \nis invoked, it will be considered as having been invoked at 12 noon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the continuing \nefforts by a minority of this body to block a Federal budget by \nblocking a conference with the House to find compromise. I spoke about \nthis one week ago, but the stalemate continues.\n  Today there was an announcement that in my Commonwealth, 90,000 \ncivilian Department of Defense employees and hundreds of thousands of \nDOD civilians nationally will be furloughed for 11 days between now and \nthe end of the year. This furlough announcement--along with ample other \nevidence we have discussed in this body in the last few weeks--\ndemonstrates that budgetary gridlock, budgetary indecision, and \nbudgetary stalling has real-life consequences.\n  I rise to implore my Senate colleagues to do what is right and to do \nthe job the American public has sent us here to do. This is not only \nabout budgets, it is also about something even bigger than budgets. It \nis about something fundamental to the entire system of government we \nhave; that is, the willingness to work together to find common ground \nand find solutions.\n  I truly view this budgetary stalemate as an attack on compromise. We \ncannot survive as a Senate or as a Congress or as a nation without \nfinding common ground.\n  I know the Presiding Officer, like me, was out on the campaign trail \na lot in 2012. I heard a repeated critique of this body during the \ncampaign. I heard that this body was unable to produce a budget since \n2009. There were some arguments back and forth about whether that was \ntechnically accurate. As I looked at it as a candidate, it was at least \nclear that a normal budgetary order in accordance with the Budget Act \nof 1974 had not been followed for a number of years.\n  As a candidate and citizen of the Commonwealth and country, I said: \nIf I have the opportunity to serve in this body, I am going to work \nwith my colleagues to make sure we do the public's business in the way \nthat was contemplated in that statute.\n  Although I didn't ask, I was assigned to be on the Senate Budget \nCommittee as soon as I got to this body. I immediately made clear--\nalong with many other Members, both newcomers and Members who had been \non the committee for a while, including the new committee chair, \nSenator Murray--that this body needed to return to normal budgetary \nprocedures.\n  It seemed as though over the past few years, Congress tried a lot of \nother things--supercommittees, sequesters, and continuing resolutions--\nnone of which were working to do the Nation's fiscal business. Along \nwith many Senators of both parties, I said the right strategy for us is \nto return to normal budgetary procedure. We can make it work just as \nCongresses in the past have made it work.\n  I entered the body on January 3--more than 4 months ago--with the \nprofound belief that we needed to embrace the normal procedures about \ndoing a budget. Those normal procedures are known to all. People read \nin textbooks about how bills become laws. Essentially, in the spring \nthe Senate and House, under normal procedure, would each pass a budget. \nThose budget bills would likely be significantly different.\n  Even when the parties controlling the two Houses are the same, the \ntwo House budgets are different. There is then some effort to find a \ncompromise between the two differing versions often through use of a \nconference committee. Once that compromise is found, then that \ncompromise is sent back to each House for a vote, and it then becomes \nthe guidance that is used by the Appropriations Committee to write the \nbill's appropriating dollars for the next fiscal year. That is the \nnormal process, and it is the way Congress has operated under both \nparties, under split Houses for many years.\n  Here is the good news: The Senate Budget Committee embraced this \nchallenge. Chairman Murray worked with staff and members of the \ncommittee to create a draft budget, and then early in mid-March we had \nrobust committee hearings, a full debate, and a full amendment process \nabout a Senate budget.\n  In March the committee ultimately considered the chairman's mark for \n13 hours, and we had a full amendment process. We voted on over 30 \namendments, the majority of which were made by Republican members of \nthe committee. We debated and voted on those amendments. I sat there \nand voted for a number of the Republican amendments to the budget that \nthen became part of the ultimate committee product.\n  Republican members offered numerous amendments. In response to an \namendment offered by a Republican member, I remember my colleague from \nMaine, Senator King, asking: If I vote for your amendment, are you \ngoing to vote for this committee budget? The answer was given in \npublic.\n  The answer was: No. I want you to vote for my amendment, but I am \nstill\n\n[[Page S3399]]\n\ngoing to vote against the budget. I am going to vote against it because \nthe House will produce a Republican budget, the Senate will produce a \nDemocratic budget, and then we can get those two budgets together and \nfind compromise going forward.\n  That was what was said when we met as a Budget Committee. At the end \nof the day, the Senate Budget Committee passed that budget in mid-\nMarch, and passed it without a single Republican vote. The budget was \npassed and forwarded to the Senate floor.\n  I know the Presiding Officer remembers this, as it is emblazoned upon \nall of our memories. We took the budget to the Senate floor in late \nMarch. The budget was the subject of floor activity in this body for \n39\\1/2\\ hours. We don't do a lot around here for 39\\1/2\\ hours, but the \nbudget was subject to floor activity and numerous speeches by Senators, \njust like me, over the course of that week.\n  The entire body then considered, debated, and voted on nearly 110 \namendments to the budget. We passed 77 of the amendments. The \namendments that were passed were offered by both Democrats and \nRepublicans. I remember voting for many of the Republican amendments \nthat then became part of the ultimate budget bill. This amendment \nactivity--110 amendments, 77 passing--is significantly greater than has \nbeen the norm in earlier Senate deliberations.\n  At 5 a.m. on the morning of Saturday, March 23, the Senate passed its \nfirst budget in 4 years. Not a single Republican voted to support that \nbudget even though many of their amendments had been included either in \nthe committee or in the floor amendment process we had during those \nhours in late March.\n  I have done a lot of budgets as a mayor and as a Governor. Along with \nmy colleagues on the Budget Committee, I worked hard in the committee \nand on the floor. My staff--as well as the Senate Budget Committee \nstaff and the staffers of all the members on that committee--also \nworked hard on this bill. I am proud we passed a budget on March 23, \nand I believe firmly if that budget were implemented today, without \nchanging one apostrophe, comma, or punctuation mark, it would do a \nnumber of things: It would help create jobs, it would help the economy, \nand it would deal with our debt and deficit in a fiscally responsible \nway.\n\n  I also understood this: that the Senate budget we passed was not the \nfinal product. It was the Senate's best effort to find a budget that \nwould move our economy and our country forward. We knew that budget \nwould be placed in a conference with the House budget. The House passed \ntheir budget the same week. We knew there would have to be discussion \nand compromise in an effort to find common ground, but we did our best \nversion and the House, I assume, feels as though they did their very \nbest version.\n  The two budgets are very different. I deeply believe the Senate \nbudget is superior and the American people, watching the discussions \nbetween the two Houses and comparing them, would reach the same \nconclusion. But at the very least I know this: The American public are \nentitled to see that debate and discussion. They are entitled to look \nat the House budget and look at the Senate budget and compare them, \njust as the conferees would be comparing. They are entitled to watch \nthat process of dialog and debate and, hopefully, compromise. That is, \nin fact, what they have sent us here to do, and that is what Congresses \nhave done for many years and decades.\n  The process of a budget conference would not be an easy one because \nthe two budgets are quite different, but there is no substitute for \ndialog and compromise. In fact, I think all of us in this body know \ndialog and compromise at its core are what we are about here.\n  When the Framers of our Constitution, in article I, set up a \nlegislative branch with two Houses--a bicameral branch--and required \nthat most items to pass through Congress would have to go through both \nbranches, they understood very well what they were doing. They were \ncreating a system of checks and balances that required dialog and \nlistening and compromise in order to do good for the benefit of the \nNation. At our very root, a bicameral legislature, existing in a system \nof checks and balances, with a judiciary and an executive branch, \ndepends upon public servants who are willing to find common ground.\n  Well, since March 23--nearly 7 weeks--a small minority of Senators, \noften one at a time, has done all it can to block a budget conference \nfrom even beginning and, therefore, to block compromise. As we have \ntaken steps to begin a budget conference with the House leadership to \nput these two budgets together and find compromise, again and again \nindividual Senators have stood on the floor of this body and, in my \nview, abused the UC rules to block a conference from even beginning. \nEven as budgetary indecision and sequester are leading to furloughs, \nthey have blocked a conference from even beginning. Even as we are \nseeing reductions in the number of people who are able to receive Meals \nOn Wheels or children in Head Start, they have abused Senate rules to \nblock a budget conference from even beginning.\n  I serve on the Armed Services Committee. We are working on the \nDefense authorization bill now, and we have the service chiefs come in \nand talk to us every day about the challenges they are facing, about \nthe degraded readiness. One-third of our air combat command units are \nstanding down because of these budgetary challenges. We hear the steady \ndrumbeat, day in and day out, about degradation in readiness and \nchallenges to our modernization programs. We had a hearing about the \nMarine Corps this morning. Yet even as we are hearing this testimony in \nhearings in the morning and in the afternoon, Members come to this \nfloor and stand and try to block a budget conference from even \nbeginning.\n  This is very serious. When we are talking about the readiness of our \nmilitary who are facing challenges--just pick up today's paper and read \nheadlines about Syria or North Korea or Iran--as we are facing \ncontinuing challenges in Afghanistan, to have Members in this body \nblock efforts to find compromise is very chilling.\n  Let's be clear about what this is. This is not just an attack on the \nbudget itself, because those who want to attack the budget voted \nagainst it in committee. Those who didn't like the budget had a chance \nand voted against it on the floor. Even in the event a conference \ncommittee would produce a budget compromise, that compromise would come \nback and those who didn't like that budget would have a chance to vote \nagainst it again. That is how we attack a budget. That is how we \nexpress disagreement with a budget. A Member stands on the floor of \nthis body and votes against it. The Members have had a chance to do \nthat in committee and on the floor and they will have a chance to do it \nagain at the end of the conference process.\n  The effort that has been underway in this body since March 23 is not \nfundamentally an attack on budgets, it is an attack on the whole notion \nof compromise. To block a conference committee from beginning so House \nand Senate conferees can sit down and listen to each other and try to \niron out their differences is fundamentally an attack on compromise. We \nhave seen that too much in this body. Anyone in this room knows that, \nif a person is not a hermit, if a person is a member of a family or a \nmember of a parish council or a member of the PTA or part of an \norganizing group of a Little League, if a person has a business or if a \nperson is elected to a school board or to the Senate--everybody knows \nif we participate in life, it has to be about compromise. Our Founders \nknew it and they created a system that relies upon compromise.\n  What we have seen in this body since March 23, after people had a \nfull opportunity to amend and vote on a budget, is not about a budget, \nit is an attack on compromise.\n  I conclude by saying that just as no family can succeed without \ncompromise, just as no community, just as no business, just as no \nschool board, just as no group of people can succeed without \ncompromise, Congress, the Senate, and our Nation cannot succeed without \na spirit of compromise.\n  So I implore and I ask my colleagues to rethink the path they are on, \nto stand down in this attack upon compromise, to allow the budget to go \nto conference so we can do the tough work of listening to each other \nand finding common ground for the good of the American people.\n\n[[Page S3400]]\n\n  Thank you, Madam President.

While we have some down time on the floor to wait for \nthe 2:30 hour--I believe we are going to have some action on the WRDA \nbill, which is very important--I thought I would take this time to talk \nabout an amendment I have pending on the WRDA bill. It is an amendment \nthat I offered for myself, Senator Vitter, Senator Schumer, and Senator \nMenendez. Several other Senators have expressed their strong support \nover the weekend on both sides, Republicans and Democrats.\n  There are many States in the Union, and Louisiana is only one--the \nState of Florida, the State of California, the State of Mississippi, \nthe State of Alabama, other coastal States and, yes, some inland \nStates--that are going to be terribly disadvantaged if the Landrieu-\nVitter amendment does not pass on the WRDA bill. What is going to \nhappen because of a reform bill--parts of it were necessary, but there \nwere some parts that, in my view and in the view of many Senators, \nshould never have passed as part of the flood insurance reform bill.\n  The reason some of us are fairly exercised about this is the bill \nitself, the reform bill to reform the Flood Insurance Program of the \nUnited States, never came to this floor for debate. It came out of the \nBanking Committee, and then it was basically tucked into a larger \nomnibus bill, which happens sometimes. This is not the only or the \nfirst time it has happened. It is very unfortunate that it happened \nwith this bill.\n  In our haste and in our good intentions to try to put national flood \ninsurance on a more even financial keel, we have put the ability, \nunfortunately, in this bill for flood insurance rates to go up 20 \npercent a year on hundreds of thousands of first homes in this \ncountry--not second homes, not vacation homes, but first homes. The \nLandrieu-Vitter amendment doesn't try to solve this whole problem on \nthe WRDA bill. It is going to take a little bit of work, which we can \ndo, working together in good faith on behalf of our constituents.\n  This is big government at its worst--passing a reform bill and making \nthe cure worse than the disease. In this case, for my constituents and \nfor constituents in Florida, Mississippi, California, and New Jersey, \nwe would have taken the disease as opposed to the cure. The cure is \ngoing to kill us. We weren't sure about the disease, but the cure is \ngoing to kill us.\n  Our papers have been editorializing for days since this issue has \ncome to the surface on the WRDA bill. Our largest newspaper or second \nlargest newspaper editorialized this morning and spoke about a quite \nsenior woman--in her eighties--who lives with her daughter, who is in \nher sixties, in Plaquemines Parish. It is very typical to have families \nof different generations living together. They were in Plaquemines \nParish before the flood insurance measure was ever passed.\n  We were living in Louisiana before this Nation was a nation. Our \npeople have been down there a long time living on this water. They \nbuilt their houses centuries--not this couple, but we had houses built \ncenturies before this bill was ever passed. Now, what the law--the cure \nthat is going to kill us--says is that this is their choice: They can \nelevate their home 18 feet, which probably would cost $50,000, which \nthey don't have, or their flood insurance will go up to something on \nthe order of $15,000 or $20,000 a year, which they can't pay.\n  One may say: That is too bad. Let them sell the house.\n  Their house has no value.\n  This is a dilemma not just for the people of Louisiana but for people \nfrom Mississippi, Alabama, California, and New York. We have a \nsolution. The solution I have offered is temporary until we can be \nsmart and think about how to fix this, and it doesn't cost anything.\n  I am begging Members to allow us this short period of time to get \nthis cure corrected. We can find a way to make this program balance. We \ndon't have to do that today, at this moment. Give us a little breathing \nroom to figure this out. I believe this program could be self-\nsustaining. I am not an expert on insurance, but I am very fortunate to \nserve with colleagues who are. I am sure we can put our heads together \nand come up with something better than what is coming down like a \nfirehose out there on lots of people in communities in Florida, \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.\n  My understanding is--the managers are not on the floor--that there \nare about eight or nine amendments that have been worked out, \nhopefully, on both sides of the aisle. One of them is the Landrieu-\nVitter fix, the flood insurance amendment that has zero cost to the \ntaxpayer--zero. It is a temporary reprieve of rates going up for \ngrandfathered homes, which affects many people in Florida, Louisiana, \nand in other States as well. It has a zero score. The CBO has \ntestified. We have letters from CBO.\n  Please give our people this breathing room. I promise that I will \nwork in good faith.\n  There are probably a few other things that need to be fixed in this \nflood insurance bill as we find a better way to lower costs to the \ntaxpayer and to provide opportunities for people to live on a \nmountaintop if they choose, in a valley or on the coast, but to be \nsafely sustainable. We all need to work together as a country. We can \nfind an affordable way for our people--and not just millionaires--to be \nable to live on the coast. We have to make room for our fishermen, our \nagriculture, our farmers, and our aquaculture folks who have invested a \ngood amount of money in helping to build more sustainable fisheries for \nour Nation. We have people who have to live near the water for commerce \nand trade. Not everybody lives by the water to vacation. Some people \nlive by the water to work, which is an essential part of the work to \nkeep this country moving forward. We have to figure out a way to allow \nthem to do that in an affordable manner without completely undermining \nthe coastal counties of our country.\n  Senator Schumer is on the floor now with some others who also have \nbeen working. I thank them for working over the weekend. Let's help \nthem get this list of amendments cleared. One of those amendments will \nbe the Landrieu-Vitter amendment on fixing temporarily--giving some \nreprieve to thousands of homeowners who are desperate for a signal from \nus that we get it, we understand. We didn't correct this appropriately. \nWe are going to respond, as a democracy should, and give them a little \nsignal today that as the WRDA bill moves forward, we can fine-tune and \nmodify this flood insurance reform.\n  I understand we are ready for action on WRDA.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3401]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n  Amendments Nos. 847, 899 as Modified, 895, 894, 867, 872, 912, 880, \n 904, 884, 870 as Modified, 911 as Modified, 882, 903 as Modified, 906 \n      as Modified, 893, 898, 861 as Modified, 907, and 896 En Bloc\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. For the interest of Senators, we are going to very \nshortly propound a consent agreement that has been cleared by Senator \nVitter and myself and we will see where that takes us. If it needs to \nbe modified, we may well do that, but I want Senators to know it is our \nhope we can avert a cloture vote at this time.\n  I ask unanimous consent the following amendments be considered and \nagreed to en bloc: Baucus No. 847, Boxer-Vitter No. 899 as modified, \nInhofe No. 895, Wicker No. 894, Inhofe No. 867, Boozman No. 872, Thune \nNo. 912, Cornyn No. 880, Murkowski No. 904, Klobuchar No. 884, Wyden \nNo. 870 as modified, Cochran No. 911 as modified, Carper No. 882, \nMurkowski No. 903 as modified, Durbin No. 906 as modified, Levin No. \n893, Collins No. 898, Cardin No. 861 as modified, Brown-Graham No. 907, \nand Wyden No. 896; further, that the only remaining amendments in order \nto the bill be the following: Inhofe No. 797, Barrasso No. 868, Sanders \nNo. 889, Johnson and Landrieu--Johnson No. 891, Landrieu No. 888, \nCoburn No. 815, Coburn No. 816, Boozman No. 822, Merkley No. 866, Udall \nof New Mexico No. 853, and Hoeven No. 909; further, that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order to any of the amendments prior to votes \nin relation to the amendment; that the time until 5 p.m. be equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees for debate on all of \nthe amendments; that at 5 p.m. the Senate proceed to vote in relation \nto the amendments in the order I have listed; that all after the first \nvote be 10-minute votes; that there be 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto each vote; that the following amendments be subjected to a 60-\naffirmative-vote threshold: Sanders No. 899, Johnson No. 891, Landrieu \nNo. 888, and Barrasso No. 868; finally, that upon disposition of the \nHoeven amendment No. 909, the cloture motion be withdrawn, the Senate \nproceed to vote on the passage of S. 601, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I want to \npoint out there is one amendment in this package that is very troubling \nto me. Under the current flood insurance law we passed just 10 months \nago, we put in place a mechanism to diminish the subsidization that \noccurs now where homeowners in low-risk areas are made to subsidize \nhomeowners in high-risk areas by the nature of the way premiums are \nset. The existing law is designed to diminish significantly that unfair \nsubsidy that occurs, and I think that is why the chairman and the \nranking member of the Banking Committee and many others of our \ncolleagues oppose this amendment.\n  If this amendment goes through, the Landrieu amendment No. 888, then \nfor 5 years this reform cannot take place and that means not only do \npeople in low-risk areas continue subsidizing people in high-risk \nareas, but because people in high-risk areas are paying lower premiums \nthan what they ought to pay to reflect the risk they are taking, it \ncreates the moral hazard of a risk to continue building in high-risk \nareas with the expectation this will continue and therefore jeopardizes \ntaxpayer funds.\n  This is already a program that is $24 billion in debt and that is the \nreason I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, it is my understanding, listening to my \nfriend from Pennsylvania, that he objects to the Landrieu amendment. It \nis also my understanding that Senator Landrieu would like to be heard \non this matter. Then I will propound a new consent request. I ask she \nget the floor and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I wish to clarify through the Chair \nthat the Senator from Pennsylvania is not objecting to the long list of \namendments as described by the chairman of the committee, he is only \nobjecting to amendment No. 888 and objecting to a vote on amendment No. \n888 by myself, Senator Vitter, Senator Schumer, Senator Menendez, \nSenator Lautenberg, and others; is that correct? Is the Senator \nobjecting to a vote or to the amendment?\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, my understanding is there is a unanimous \nconsent request for a series of amendments on this bill, and I am \nobjecting to that consent request because it contains the Landrieu \namendment No. 888.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. So it is my understanding, Madam President, through the \nChair, that the Senator is objecting to a vote on the amendment. He is \ncertainly entitled, in my view, to vote against the amendment. That is \nwhat debate on the floor is all about. But he is not expressing his \nobjection to that. He is objecting to having a vote on the amendment; \nis that correct?\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, as I said earlier, this is a matter that \nhas been litigated and adjudicated in this body. We have had a vote on \nthis. This has not come back through committee. This would cause \nconsiderable risk to taxpayers. If the Senator from Louisiana believes \nthis is something that needs to be addressed yet again, despite the \nfact that 10 months ago we had a vote on this--and we did vote, then I \nwould be happy to work with the Senator on how we might address that. \nBut my objection still remains.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I am just trying to get clarification \nthrough the Chair from the Senator from Pennsylvania. I understand he \nobjects to my amendment. That is not what I am asking him. I would just \nlike a yes or no answer; is he objecting to a vote on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I think I answered the question.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. He did not answer the question clearly, but since he \nwill not answer the question, which is unfortunate, I wish to make it \nclear for the record that the Senator from Pennsylvania is objecting to \na vote on the Landrieu-Vitter amendment. He most certainly is entitled \nto vote no on our amendment. Other Senators may vote no. But I want the \nrecord to show he is saying, no, we cannot even have a vote.\n  If I could have 5 more minutes. I will take 3 more minutes. I want to \nsay how disappointing it is to me because the Senator is unfortunately \nwrong on several counts.\n  No. 1, this floor never voted on the Biggert-Waters bill. As I said a \ndozen times, the bill came out of the Banking Committee with broad \nbipartisan support. A different bill was passed by the House. Then \nthese two bills that were very different and tried to ``reform the \nflood insurance program'' were tucked into a conference committee \nreport. I want the record to show this floor never voted on the reform, \nand the cure that came out of the conference committee is worse than \nthe disease.\n  Second, I want to tell the Senator from Pennsylvania I think this is \ngoing to come back to haunt him because the people of his own State are \ngoing to be negatively affected by his actions today.\n  There are 74,000 people in Pennsylvania--4,000 in Philadelphia alone \nbut 74,000 people in Pennsylvania who pay flood insurance rates. Under \nthe proposal that never came to this Senate floor, those rates in some \ncases can go up 20 or 30 percent in 1 year.\n  For the record, I want to put in: In Florida, 2 million people are \naffected; Texas, 645,000; Louisiana, 486,000; California, 256,000; New \nJersey, 240,000; South Carolina, 205,000; New York, 178,000; North \nCarolina, 138,000--I am not going to read all of this--Virginia, \n116,000; and in Pennsylvania, 74,000. I could go on. I ask unanimous \nconsent this list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         NFIP POLICIES

Second, I have a letter from the National Association \nof Home Builders--not a liberal-leaning organization and most certainly \nnot a group that just works in Louisiana. People build homes all over \nAmerica including in Pennsylvania. They sent a strong letter urging us \nto adopt the Landrieu-Vitter amendment which will just temporarily put \na hold on raising rates 20 to 40 to 60 to 80 percent on grandfathered \nhomes that were around before the flood insurance program was ever \ninvented by Members of this body, well before I was even a Senator.\n  What this says is the program should be widely available, it should \nbe affordable, so people can live in many different places of America. \nThis is one big great country with lots of different kinds of \nneighborhoods. That is what the National Association of Home Builders \nsaid, and I am going to submit their letter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                                Home Builders,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2013.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: On \n     behalf of the more than 140,000 members of the National \n     Association of Home Builders (NAHB), I am writing to express \n     strong support for amendment #888 (sponsored by Senators Mary \n     Landrieu and David Vitter) to S. 601, the Water Resources and \n     Development Act of 2013. This amendment would delay flood \n     insurance premium increases on certain properties for 5 \n     years. NAHB believes a financially-stable National Flood \n     Insurance Program is in all of our interests, yet we must \n     ensure that overall affordability is not adversely affected.\n       The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 \n     (BW12) reauthorized the NFIP for five years and included a \n     phase-in to actuarial rates to help return the program to \n     sound financial footing. Also included in the law was the \n     requirement for a study and a report on the affordability of \n     NFIP premiums and the effects of increased premiums on low-\n     income homeowners.\n       The BW12 phase-in to actuarial rates is separated into two \n     different segments of policy-holders. Some homeowners will \n     start to see premium increases in October, while the others \n     will start in 2014, once the new scientific rate maps have \n     been drawn and approved. Over the next year and a half, many \n     hard working homeowners in flood-prone areas (and newly-drawn \n     flood prone areas) could see large flood insurance premium \n     increases. The Landrieu-Vitter amendment ensures that the \n     later changes are delayed to help Congress re-examine \n     consumer affordability and answer other questions about \n     implementing BW12. NAHB believes this amendment is a first \n     step in balancing consumer affordability and re-establishing \n     the solvency of the program.\n       The homebuilding industry depends on the NFIP to be \n     annually predictable, universally available, affordable and \n     fiscally viable. This program enables the home building \n     industry to deliver safe, decent, affordable housing to \n     consumers in all areas of the country. We urge you to support \n     this important amendment that balances the fiscal solvency of \n     the NFIP and consumer affordability.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           James W. Tobin III,\n\n                                           Senior Vice President &\n                                                   Chief Lobbyist.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Evidently, the Senator from Pennsylvania doesn't \nunderstand this. That is fine. We have disagreements and I respect him. \nHe should vote no. But to stop a vote?\n  The third and final argument I am going to make in my 30 seconds \nleft, we worked so hard on this amendment that it doesn't even cost \nanything.\n  We have a zero score--zero. It does not cost one dime, not one \ndollar, and still the Senator from Pennsylvania, with 74,000 people in \nhis State who could be affected, is objecting to even voting on giving \npeople a chance. We are going to be on this issue again; it is going to \ncome back.\n  I praise Senators Boxer and Vitter for their work on WRDA. It is a \nshame that we cannot even get a vote to postpone this issue to try to \nsee if we could make it more affordable. It doesn't cost anything.\n  I say to the Senator from California that I am sorry for holding this \nup. I thought this was important. We worked on it all week. Everybody \nis cleared except for one Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to very briefly agree with two \nkey points made by my colleague from Louisiana. First of all, as far as \nthe substance of this amendment goes, I wholeheartedly agree with her, \nand that is why I am a sponsor of this amendment as well.\n  We will visit this issue again because it is vitally important that \nwe get it right--not just for the tens of thousands of folks from \nLouisiana but for millions of Americans across the country. We need to \nget this right, and we don't yet have it right.\n  Secondly and also very importantly, I absolutely agree that we should \nhave debate and votes on the Senate floor. I don't think any Member \nshould object to just having a vote on a matter.\n  My colleague, the Senator from Pennsylvania, has been a leading \nadvocate to have an open amendment process on the Senate floor, to \nallow votes, and I agreed with that. I fought with the chair of the \ncommittee to have an open amendment process in the context of this \nbill, and we got it. Now, at the end of the day, he objects to even \nhaving a vote on a particular amendment he doesn't like. The Senator \ncannot have it both ways. If the Senator wants an open amendment \nprocess on the floor, as I do, then he will have to accept that he may \nhave to take votes on amendments he doesn't agree with. I accept that; \nI wish he would accept that. I hope it will continue and grow from \nhere.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think everybody who is listening to this \nunderstands that there has been a disagreement here--a pretty tough \none.\n  I have to praise Senator Landrieu for saying: Look, I am going to \nbring this fight back another day. She has told me she would be willing \nto support a new, modified request--the same one I made about 10 \nminutes ago--and take out Johnson amendment No. 891 and Landrieu \namendment No. 888. I believe the new request will be acceptable to all \nin the Senate.\n  I renew my request with that change--the deletion of Johnson \namendment No. 891 and Landrieu amendment No. 888. I ask unanimous \nconsent that we move forward with this agreement at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we realized \nover the last 72 hours that we were all scandalized when we learned \nthat the Internal Revenue Service of the United States and employees \nwithin the Internal Revenue Service were targeting fellow Americans and \npolitical organizations because of their political views. The feelings \nwe have are bipartisan--I hope they are. I don't think any of us want \nto see an agency of government being used to target our fellow \nAmericans because of their points of view on a political issue. This is \na very serious issue.\n\n[[Page S3403]]\n\n  Yesterday I called for the President to ask for the resignation of \nthe acting chief of the IRS. I asked that there be a criminal \ninvestigation launched in this matter, which Attorney General Holder \nhas announced today.\n  I have prepared an amendment that I think is timely and that I hope \nwe will consider in this body that makes it a crime for an employee of \nthe IRS to target individual taxpayers or organizations because of \ntheir political views. I stand today to ask if the chairwoman would \nconsider consenting to allow my Rubio amendment No. 892 to be included \nin the unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I might respond to my friend's request, the American \npeople need to know that we are dealing on this Senate floor with a \nbill that is the Water Resources Development Act. This bill is about \nimprovements in flood control so we don't have anymore Hurricane \nSandys. This is also about port-deepening and about 500,000 jobs. This \nis about restoring the Chesapeake Bay and the Everglades in my friend's \nhome State. What a beautiful spot that is, I say to my friend. It is \nnot about the IRS scandal, although I could not agree more with my \nfriend. Anyone who would play politics at the IRS is doing a disservice \nto this Nation. I am happy to look at this law. They ought to be \ncanned.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an inquiry which took \nplace by the IRS into a church in my State--the All Saints Church--in \nthe district of Adam Schiff be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Dec. 9, 2005]\n\n         Inquiry Into IRS Investigations of Churches Is Sought\n\n                      (By Patricia Ward Biederman)\n\n       Expressing concern about the 1st Amendment rights of \n     clergy, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) and two Republican \n     colleagues called Thursday for an investigation by the U.S. \n     Government Accountability Office into the IRS' recent probes \n     of alleged ``campaign intervention'' by churches, including \n     Pasadena's liberal All Saints Church.\n       Schiff, whose district includes Pasadena, said he asked for \n     information from the IRS on its church inquiries soon after \n     learning in November that the local Episcopal church could \n     lose its tax-exempt status because of an antiwar sermon \n     preached by former Rector George Regas just before the 2004 \n     presidential election.\n       Because the IRS has yet to respond to his request, Schiff \n     said, ``I've gone to the next level.''\n       On Thursday, Reps. Walter B. Jones (R-N.C.) and Joe Pitts \n     (R-Pa.) joined with Schiff in sending a letter to GAO \n     Comptroller General David M. Walker. They asked the office to \n     look into reports that the IRS is investigating places of \n     worship ``based on the content of sermons or other discourse \n     delivered as part of a religious service or gathering.''\n       Although the tax code prohibits tax-exempt organizations \n     from ``intervening in political campaigns and elections,'' \n     the congressmen said, ``We believe that the faith community \n     has every right to express itself in the political process.''\n       Spokesman Eric Smith said IRS policy precludes commenting \n     on requests such as the congressmen's. But Smith cited a \n     report released by the Treasury Department in February that \n     found the IRS had ``not . . .\n       All Saints Rector Edwin Bacon announced Nov. 6 that the \n     church's tax-exempt status was threatened.\n       The congregation has received wide support, from \n     evangelicals as well as liberal groups. All Saints expects an \n     IRS decision soon, a church spokesman said.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Republicans and Democrats at that time asked for \ninvestigations into this, and this is from 2005.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article that talks about the \ninvestigation of the NAACP that involved the IRS in 2006 be printed in \nthe Record.\n  This is a continuing scandal. It is outrageous, and I think anyone \nwho goes after a liberal group should be canned. Anyone who goes after \na conservative group should be canned unless there is reason to do so. \nBut it appears they are not following the rules of nonprofits, which is \nthey cannot be political.\n  I ask that those items be placed in the Record only to remind people \nthat this is a bad and terrible thing that has happened, and it has \nbeen a while.\n  I object to the request that we place such an urgently important \nmatter on this long-term bill. It is going to take a while for us to \nget it through the House. We don't know when the conference will come \nback.\n  I object to the unanimous consent request to turn a bill like this \ninto a bill about the IRS scandal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. First of all, on the second request of the \nSenator from California, is there any objection?\n  The Chair hears none.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Washington Post, September 1, 2006]\n\nIRS Ends 2-Year Probe of NAACP's Tax Status; Leader's Criticism of Bush \n              in 2004 Did Not Violate Law, Agency Decides\n\n                           (By Darryl Fears)\n\n       Nearly two years after a controversial decision to \n     investigate the NAACP for criticizing President Bush during \n     the 2004 presidential campaign, the Internal Revenue Service \n     has ruled that the remarks did not violate the group's tax-\n     exempt status.\n       In a letter released yesterday by the NAACP, the IRS said \n     the group, the nation's oldest and largest civil rights \n     organization, ``continued to qualify'' as tax-exempt.\n       If the NAACP were stripped of the status, donors would not \n     be allowed to claim contributions to the group on income tax \n     returns.\n       Federal law requires tax-exempt nonprofit organizations to \n     be politically nonpartisan.\n       ``It was an enormous threat,'' NAACP Chairman Julian Bond \n     said of the investigation. The opposite outcome, he said, \n     ``would have reduced our income remarkably.''\n       Bond reiterated his belief that the investigation was \n     politically motivated. He said the decision, received by the \n     NAACP on Aug. 9, ``meant that they thought they had harassed \n     us enough and they could stop.''\n       In a response to lawmakers who expressed outrage over the \n     investigation in 2004, IRS Commissioner Mark W. Everson said \n     the agency's examinations are based on tax law, not \n     partisanship.\n       The commissioner said the investigation of the NAACP was \n     undertaken because two congressional leaders, whom he \n     declined to name, requested it. They were unhappy because \n     Bond criticized Bush in a speech in July 2004, saying his \n     administration preached racial neutrality and practiced \n     racial division.\n       ``They write a new constitution of Iraq and they ignore the \n     Constitution at home,'' Bond said.\n       After filing four freedom-of-information requests, NAACP \n     lawyers discovered that far more than two members of Congress \n     called for an investigation and that all were Republicans.\n       Republican Sens. Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) and Susan Collins \n     (Maine) called for the investigation.\n       Others included Rep. Jo Ann S. Davis (R-Va.) and then-Rep. \n     Larry Combest (R-Tex.). Former GOP representatives Joe \n     Scarborough of Florida, who now hosts a talk show, and Robert \n     L. Ehrlich Jr., currently governor of Maryland, also \n     requested a probe.\n       The investigation started Oct. 8, 2004, a month before the \n     election. As the investigation dragged on into the following \n     February, the NAACP announced that it would not continue to \n     cooperate.\n       Angela Ciccolo, an NAACP lawyer, noted that although Bond's \n     remarks were made in July 2004, the investigation did not \n     begin until October, just when the NAACP was attempting to \n     register voters. ``The timing of the investigation is \n     critical,'' she said.\n       When the investigation started, Bush and the NAACP were \n     locked in a long-running feud that started shortly before the \n     president's first election victory in 2000.\n       During that campaign, the NAACP ran television spots \n     featuring the daughter of James Byrd Jr., a black man who was \n     dragged to death behind a pickup truck in Texas in 1998. She \n     criticized Bush, then governor of Texas, for not signing \n     hate-crime legislation.\n       The rift grew when the NAACP charged that Republicans in \n     Florida stole the 2000 election by turning black voters away \n     from the polls.\n       Recently, however, the relationship between the group and \n     Bush has begun to warm. Bush addressed the NAACP convention \n     in July for the first time in his six years in office, \n     avoiding becoming the first president since Warren G. Harding \n     to snub the group for an entire presidency.\n       ``It's disappointing that the IRS took nearly two years to \n     conclude what we knew from the beginning: The NAACP did not \n     violate tax laws and continues to be politically \n     nonpartisan,'' said its president, Bruce S. Gordon.\n       CORRECTION-DATE: September 12, 2006; September 21, 2006\n       CORRECTION:\n       A Sept. 1 article incorrectly said that the Internal \n     Revenue Service had named the NAACP as a group whose tax-\n     exempt status was being investigated in response to questions \n     from congressmen. Though the NAACP's status was investigated, \n     the IRS did not name the group.\n       A Sept. 1 article incorrectly listed several Republicans as \n     having called for an Internal Revenue Service investigation \n     into the tax-exempt status of the NAACP. Named were Sens. \n     Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) and Susan Collins (Maine); Rep. Jo \n     Ann S. Davis (Va.);\n\n[[Page S3404]]\n\n     and former representatives Larry Combest (Tex.), Joe \n     Scarborough (Fla.) and Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (Md.). The \n     lawmakers forwarded complaints and requests for an \n     investigation from constituents to the IRS.\n       LOAD-DATE: September 1, 2006.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object to the unanimous consent request because of the importance \nof this issue to many States in the country, let me close by saying \nthat we need to understand what happened here over the last 72 hours \nand what we found out. Employees of the Internal Revenue Service made a \ndecision that they were going to specifically target groups who had \nthings like ``tea party'' and the word ``patriot'' in their \norganization, groups who looked to do things like protect the \nConstitution of the United States. This is outrageous.\n  There is growing evidence that higher-ups--significant people in the \nIRS--knew about this and were not disclosing that to Members of \nCongress. Members of this body were asking the IRS directly: Are you \ninvolved in this? Is this happening? They were not giving us \ninformation we now know they had.\n  I will not object to the unanimous consent request because of the \nimportance of this issue, but this issue will not and cannot go away \nbecause of the importance of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 847\n\n(Purpose: To modify a provision relating to Northern Rockies headwaters \n                      extreme weather mitigation)\n\n       On page 236, strike line 13 and insert the following:\n       (f) Effect of Section.--\n       (1) In general.--Nothing in this section replaces or \n     provides a substitute for the authority to carry out projects \n     under section 3110 of the Water Resources Development Act of \n     2007 (121 Stat. 1135).\n       (2) Funding.--The amounts made available to carry out this \n     section shall be used to carry out projects that are not \n     otherwise carried out under section 3110 of the Water \n     Resources Development Act of 2007 (121 Stat. 1135).\n       (g) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 899, as modified\n\n                     (Purpose: To improve the bill)\n\n       On page 214, strike lines 15 through 20 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(d) Interim Adoption of Comprehensive Master Plan.--Prior \n     to completion of the comprehensive plan described under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary shall adopt the plan of the \n     State of Louisiana entitled `Louisiana's Comprehensive Master \n     Plan for a Sustainable Coast' in effect on the\n\n       On page 216, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n       (c) Effect.--\n       (1) In general.--Nothing in this section or an amendment \n     made by this section authorizes the construction of a project \n     or program associated with a storm surge barrier across the \n     Lake Pontchartrain land bridge (including Chef Menteur Pass \n     and the Rigolets) that would result in unmitigated induced \n     flooding in coastal communities within the State of \n     Mississippi.\n       (2) Required consultation.--Any study to advance a project \n     described in paragraph (1) that is conducted using funds from \n     the General Investigations Account of the Corps of Engineers \n     shall include consultation and approval of the Governors of \n     the States of Louisiana and Mississippi.\n       On page 222, line 14, strike ``2018'' and insert ``2023''.\n       On page 239, strike lines 14 through 19 and insert the \n     following:\n     for the period beginning with fiscal year 2001 $450,000,000, \n     which shall--\n       ``(1) be made available to the States and locales described \n     in subsection (b) consistent with program priorities \n     determined by the Secretary in accordance with criteria \n     developed by the Secretary to establish the program \n     priorities; and\n       ``(2) remain available until expended.''.\n       On page 293, line 2, strike ``amount'' and insert ``amounts \n     remaining after the date of enactment of this Act''.\n       On page 347, line 12, strike ``or ecosystem restoration'' \n     and insert ``ecosystem restoration, or navigation''.\n       Beginning on page 47, strike line 3 and all that follows \n     through page 53, line 13, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2014.

Mr. President, it is my understanding--and I ask the \nfloor staff to correct me--is it so that we just now passed the first \nnumber of amendments that don't require votes? Was that just done in \nthe unanimous consent? Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am very pleased with that. We had about 15 of these \namendments--quite bipartisan. Half of the amendments were Democratic \nand half Republican, so that is good.\n  Now what we are going to do is take up the amendments that require \nvotes. It is my understanding that Senator Vitter wants to speak on the \nBarrasso amendment, which is fine.\n  I say to my colleagues through the Chair that they now have \napproximately 2 hours to come down and make the case on their votes. \nSenators Inhofe, Barrasso, Sanders, Coburn, Boozman, Merkley, Udall, \nand Hoeven is where we are. If they wish to be heard, then it is time \nto come over and be heard.\n  At this time, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank my colleague \nfrom California, the chair, and all of my colleagues for allowing us to \nmove forward with a very open amendment process. It is not quite as \nopen a process as I would have wanted--namely on the Landrieu amendment \nbecause of the objection from my colleague from Pennsylvania. By any \nSenate standard, this has been a very open amendment process, and that \nis very healthy.\n  I join the chair in urging all of our colleagues who would like to \ndebate upcoming votes to come to the floor now. The time is between now \nand 5 p.m. Please come to the floor. I am doing that right now. I want \nto talk about one of those amendments on which we will vote, the \nBarrasso amendment, which is about waters of the United States. This is \nan important issue.\n  John Barrasso and I and many others believe the EPA should not be \nable to define and expand its regulatory jurisdiction--in this case, we \nare talking about the Clean Water Act--without undertaking a formal \nrulemaking process that provides individuals, businesses, and other \nstakeholders the opportunity to give meaningful input.\n  The Clean Water Act authorizes the EPA to regulate the discharge of \npollutants into ``navigable waters.'' Again, that is a very clear \nterm--``navigable waters.'' The act defines ``navigable waters'' as \n``the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.'' \nThe trouble is clearly understanding what constitutes the waters of the \nUnited States. For decades, courts have considered the meaning of ``the \nwaters of the United States,'' and yet uncertainty still remains.\n  Recently, in 2006--about 7 years ago--in the Rapanos decision, the \nSupreme Court considered whether the Army Corps of Engineers properly \ndetermined the wetlands in Michigan as being waters of the United \nStates. Although the Court determined that the corps viewed its \nregulatory authority under the Clean Water Act too broadly, a majority \nof the Justices still could not come to a precise agreement into \nexactly what ``waters of the United States'' means. So they agreed \nabout what it didn't mean in the context of that case--that the corps \nhad gone too far afield--but they didn't clearly agree on exactly what \nit meant.\n  More recently, Justice Alito, in the Sackett case, observed that the \nreach of the Clean Water Act remains ``notoriously unclear.'' Justice \nAlito and others have called on Congress to examine the Clean Water Act \nstatutory language to make it precise and clear up the confusion. He \nalso noted that EPA ``has not seen fit to promulgate a rule providing a \nclear and sufficiently limited definition of the phrase''--that phrase \nbeing ``the waters of the United States.''\n  Instead, the EPA has done something different. Unfortunately, this is \na trend at the EPA. The EPA issued what it calls guidance on this \nissue. Now, according to the EPA, the guidance ``clarifies how the EPA \nand Corps understand existing requirements of the Clean Water Act and \nthe agencies' implementing regulations'' in light of relevant \ndecisions.\n  The problem is this: Guidance is short of what the EPA should do, \nwhich is to promulgate rules and regs. It is short of that for a very \nparticular reason--because there is no clear-cut, nailed-down process \nfor guidance. The EPA can just make up what it wants without having to \ntake input from affected parties. Under the law, there are clear-cut \nguidelines and rules for promulgating rules and regulations, and that \nis what the EPA should do.\n  In this instance, there are two problems. First of all, the guidance \nis simply mistaken. It is way too expansive, in the view of many folks, \nincluding myself and the author of this amendment, Senator Barrasso. \nAlso, very importantly, guidance doesn't have to go through a process. \nGuidance doesn't illicit input from citizens, impacted parties, and \nstakeholders. That is another crucial issue involved.\n\n  This Barrasso amendment would clear up that point on two fronts. It \nwould go to the substance of the guidance--and we think EPA is getting \nit wrong with regard to that substance--but it would also help \nunderscore that there is a process for the EPA to issue rules and \nregulations, and that is what the EPA should be doing on important \nmatters such as this--not shortcutting, circumventing that process by \nsimply issuing guidance.\n  So if the EPA wishes to examine the meaning of ``waters of the United \nStates'' in the Clean Water Act, it needs to do so in a fair and \ntransparent manner, and in a way that provides all Americans the chance \nto offer meaningful regulatory input. Guidance doesn't do that. This \nguidance gets it wrong. But, just as importantly, guidance doesn't \nfulfill the need for transparency and openness and the ability to \naccept input. This Barrasso amendment would provide EPA with precisely \nthat opportunity: Make them accept\n\n[[Page S3409]]\n\ninput and make them get it right. That is why I strongly support the \nBarrasso amendment.\n  Again, I invite all of our colleagues to come down to the floor to \ndebate any part of this bill, any aspect of pending amendments. We are \nopen for business now until 5 p.m. I think that is going to be a lot of \ntime. We will have a series of votes starting today and going into \ntomorrow, and I very much appreciate the chair of the committee and \nothers who have allowed this very open amendment process on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 868\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I wish to call up amendment No. 868.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Barrasso], for himself, Mr. \n     Sessions, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Crapo, Mrs. Fischer, and Mr. \n     Wicker, proposes an amendment numbered 868.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To preserve existing rights and responsibilities with respect \n                    to waters of the United States)\n\n       On page 452, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2055. IDENTIFICATION OF WATERS PROTECTED BY THE CLEAN \n                   WATER ACT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Neither the Secretary of the Army nor the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall--\n       (1) finalize the proposed guidance described in the notice \n     of availability and request for comments entitled ``EPA and \n     Army Corps of Engineers Guidance Regarding Identification of \n     Waters Protected by the Clean Water Act'' (EPA-HQ-OW-2011-\n     0409) (76 Fed. Reg. 24479 (May 2, 2011)); or\n       (2) use the guidance described in paragraph (1), or any \n     substantially similar guidance, as the basis for any decision \n     regarding the scope of the Federal Water Pollution Control \n     Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) or any rulemaking.\n       (b) Rules.--The use of the guidance described in subsection \n     (a)(1), or any substantially similar guidance, as the basis \n     for any rule shall be grounds for vacation of the rule.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, this amendment restricts expansion of \nFederal authority, and it is a Federal authority attempting to \nencompass all the wet areas of farms, ranches, and suburban homes all \nacross America, so this amendment is designed to restrict that \nexpansion of Federal authority.\n  Specifically, the amendment eliminates this administration's guidance \nto implement this expansion of Federal authority. Through proposed \nguidance--that is the key phrase here, ``guidance''--Federal agencies \nare preparing to expand the definition of ``waters of the United \nStates.'' I think it would make sense that people would inherently \nunderstand what waters of the United States would be. But the Federal \nGovernment is preparing to expand the definition to include ditches, \nincluding dry areas--other dry areas where water happens to flow and \nwhen it only flows even for a short duration after a rainfall. The \nAmerican people know that should not be considered waters of the United \nStates. Federal regulations have never defined ditches and other upland \ndrainage features as ``waters of the United States.'' But this draft \nguidance coming out of Washington does do that, and it will have a huge \nimpact on farmers, ranchers, and small businesses that need to put a \nshovel in the ground to make a living. The EPA and the Army Corps of \nEngineers' guidance amounts to a Federal user fee for farmers and \nranchers to farm the land they own.\n  Just as troubling as ignoring congressional intent, the guidance \nabsolutely disregards the fundamental tenet embodied in two decisions \nof the U.S. Supreme Court. One is the SWANCC decision and the other is \nthe Rapanos decision. Those are decisions that say there are actual \nlimits to Federal jurisdiction. It is particularly troubling to me and \nto others around the country--and certainly at home in Wyoming it is \nparticularly troubling--that the guidance allows the Army Corps of \nEngineers and the EPA to regulate waters now considered entirely under \nState jurisdiction. As somebody who has served in the State \nlegislature, talking to the Presiding Officer as someone who has served \nas a Governor of his State, we know the key importance of State \njurisdiction in making local decisions.\n  This guidance would grant the Environmental Protection Agency and the \nU.S. Corps of Engineers virtually unlimited--virtually unlimited--\nregulatory control over all wet areas within a State.\n  In addition, if this guidance is allowed to go forward--the guidance \nI am attempting to prevent to protect Americans from today--enormous \nresources are going to be needed to expand the Clean Water Act Federal \nregulatory program, which could lead to longer delays, and the delays \ntoday are significant. Increased delays in securing permits are going \nto impede a host of economic activities in Wyoming as well as in all of \nour other States. Commercial and residential real estate development, \nagriculture, electric transmission, transportation, and mining will all \nbe affected. These are not sectors of our economy we ever want to \ndeliberately hurt, but we certainly would not want to vote for guidance \nthat would harm these sectors while we are in economic times such as \nthese.\n  That is why I come to the floor with this amendment. I will be urging \na ``yes'' vote on this amendment No. 868 at the appropriate time, to \ncontinue with the rights and responsibilities of the States and the \nprivate landowners impacting this significant water which is the \nlifeblood of our States.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise now to speak in opposition to the \nBarrasso amendment No. 868 and to explain why.\n  Before I talk about why I hope the Senate will defeat this amendment, \nI wish to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for working so \nclosely with me and with Senator Vitter.\n  The underlying bill is a very good bill and it protects every State. \nWe look at every State's needs. Whether it is flooding, whether it is \npreserving fishing, whether it is about ports, whether the ports are \ninland or coastal, medium, small, or large, we have gone out of our way \non both sides of the aisle to accommodate Senators.\n  I wish to speak about Barrasso amendment No. 868, which will be the \nfirst amendment to come before us.\n  It is an anti-environmental rider. Now, here we go again, again and \nagain and again. There is no reason to bring these anti-environmental \nriders onto every single piece of legislation that goes through here, \nbut yet that is what we face. So I agreed that we would have a vote on \nthis in the spirit of good faith because it certainly is not germane to \nthis bill. It is not.\n  It has to do with the Clean Water Act. It does not have to do with \nthe Water Resources Development Act. This Barrasso amendment says the \nguidance that has been developed by the Army Corps of Engineers and by \nthe Environmental Protection Agency as they get ready for a rulemaking \nafter a Court decision is null and void--without a hearing, without \ngiving the corps a chance to explain their guidance, without giving the \nEPA a chance to explain their guidance. Without looking at the Court's \ndecision his amendment would say the guidance is blocked because he \ndoes not like the guidance.\n  Well, trust me. I am sure I do not like everything in the guidance \neither. But let the process go forward. The guidance is necessary so \nthere can be a rulemaking, which is essential. Right now there is \nnothing but chaos after the Court's ruling. People do not know what the \nClean Water Act covers.\n  So the Army Corps, working with the EPA, has issued some guidance. It \nis\n\n[[Page S3410]]\n\nnot the final rule, it is guidance. The Barrasso amendment throws the \nguidance out, throws it into the garbage can, says it cannot be used. \nIf anything like it is ever used, there can be no rulemaking. The \nBarrasso amendment stops, therefore, the rulemaking. He may not say it \nexplicitly, but if you cannot use any of the guidance, any of the work \nthat has been done, then you cannot have a rule.\n  Let me tell you who opposes not having a rule: the business \ncommunity. The business community opposes it. Everyone opposes it. \nEverybody wants a rule. The vague restriction will make it impossible \nto initiate a rulemaking, to define what waters are protected under the \nClean Water Act. The Barrasso amendment locks into place the current \nconfusion created in the wake of two Supreme Court decisions. He does \nit by prohibiting any future update of the Clean Water Act regulations \nor related guidance.\n  Industry associations and 30 Republican Senators who are opposed to \nthe guidance developed by the Obama administration have called for a \nrulemaking. They have called for a rulemaking. The letters were just \nsent to the EPA last month. What we believe to be absolutely accurate \nis if you throw out the guidance, if you vote for this Barrasso \namendment and you say no guidance that looks anything like this will \never be used, there can be no rulemaking.\n  For decades the Clean Water Act has provided broad protections for \nthe Nation's waters. The Barrasso amendment stops the corps from \nrestoring these longstanding protections, leaving many waters at risk. \nLet me tell you what that means. Streams that provide drinking water \nfor up to 117 million Americans may not be covered by the Clean Water \nAct. That is dangerous for the people because there is all kinds of \npollution that gets dumped into these streams. There are 20 million \nacres of wetlands that provide flood protection and serve as wildlife \nhabitat. There will be no rules governing them because of the way the \nBarrasso amendment is written.\n  Any effort to clear up uncertainty that has resulted in delays and \nconfusion and slowed efforts to hold polluters accountable will be null \nand void, can have no effect. You cannot use the guidance. You have to \nthrow it away. If anything comes forward that remotely resembles it, \nyou have to throw it away. Then you cannot make a rule. This is \nharmful.\n  In closing, I want to talk about from what harm we want to protect \nthe people. We know some of the dangerous pollution that gets dumped \ninto our Nation's waters sometimes on purpose, sometimes on accident. \nBut we have chemical pollution and all kinds of industrial pollution. \nIt includes such chemicals as arsenic--very dangerous for people. I \nwill have more to say on the specifics, but we know there is waterborne \ndisease. People get very ill if the drinking water is not good, if the \nswimming water is not good. The warmer our waters are getting, the more \ndangerous it is. Certain organisms that live in these warmer waters \nnever existed before.\n  We had a case in Ohio where a child got deathly ill because the water \nwas so warm it attracted these different kinds of bacteria and \norganisms. So when I stand here, I speak from the heart. All of us do. \nBut I know we should not vote on something that precludes us from \nprotecting the health and safety and the lives of our people who are \nthe most vulnerable, the children--the children, the pregnant women, \nthe elderly. My goodness, if we are here for any reason, it would \ncertainly be to do no harm to them.\n  The Barrasso amendment does a lot of harm. It does not belong on the \nWater Resources Development Act, which is about building projects to \nprotect people using flood control. It is about dredging our waters. It \nis making sure commerce can move. This is an anti-environmental rider. \nIt does not belong on this bill. It is dangerous for the people.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no when the vote comes before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                  Internal Revenue Service Activities\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Vermont here. I \nwill not be long. I did have a few comments to offer about the unusual \ndevelopments of the last few days in Washington, DC. Back in 2011 and \n2012 my office was contacted by some constituents who were active \npolitically with organizers such as the King Street Patriots, True the \nVote, the tea party, particularly in Waco and San Antonio. They were \nconcerned that they were being targeted by the Federal Government, \nspecifically the Internal Revenue Service, for their political \nactivity. They were concerned that the activities of the Internal \nRevenue Service seemed excessive, unreasonable, and improper. They \nfeared the government officials were targeting them for doing nothing \nmore than exercising their constitutional rights under the First \nAmendment of the Constitution.\n  So I did what I think any Senator would do, any Member of Congress: I \nwrote a letter to the Internal Revenue Service and asked them, first of \nall, about any indication they had that this was the case. Douglas \nShulman, the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, testified \nlater before Congress and categorically denied any type of targeting \nwas, in fact, taking place.\n  Well, last Friday we learned that my constituents were correct and \nthe Internal Revenue Service was wrong. It turns out the Internal \nRevenue Service really was targeting American citizens for exercising \ntheir most fundamental rights. Even though the Internal Revenue Service \ndid not acknowledge this until last Friday, the Associated Press has \nreported that senior agency officials learned about the abuses as early \nas June 2011, nearly 2 years ago.\n  Let me be clear. These abuses are not simply inappropriate, they are \na breach of faith with the American people. They are potentially \nviolations of our criminal law.\n  Now, as my friend from Vermont knows, if the IRS, if the government \ncan target conservative groups such as the King Street Patriots and the \ntea party, they can target anybody anywhere across the political \nspectrum. That is why you are seeing such bipartisan outrage over this \nnews. But not only was the IRS targeting tea party groups, they \ntargeted other people based on their advocacy of restoring the Federal \nGovernment to its basic constitutional framework, people concerned \nabout government spending. Meanwhile, there is evidence that the IRS \nalso in some cases targeted Jewish organizations as well. I would hope \nwe would all on a bipartisan basis rise and say this is unacceptable \nand it is immoral. It is the kind of behavior we associate not with the \ngreatest democracy in the world but with corrupt tin-pot dictators.\n  President Obama has said, to his credit, that all guilty parties will \nbe held fully accountable. Well, I wish I could take some comfort from \nthe President's comments. Unfortunately, the administration has \nrepeatedly stonewalled and misled U.S. officials investigating programs \nlike the Fast and Furious gunwalking scandal and the 2012 attacks in \nBenghazi, Libya.\n  The President of the United States got four Pinocchios today from the \nFact Checker in the Washington Post. That has to be a first. So why \nshould we expect the Internal Revenue Service investigation to be any \ndifferent? Unfortunately, this administration has shown a tendency to \nput politics ahead of the rule of law too many times.\n  For example, during the government-run Chrysler bankruptcy process, \nthe company-secured bondholders received much less for their loans than \ndid the United Auto Workers Pension Fund, a favorite of the Obama \nadministration. As Solyndra was going bankrupt, the administration \nviolated the law by making taxpayers subordinate to private lenders. So \nthe taxpayers got gored first before private lenders were at risk.\n  Last year the administration made unconstitutional recess \nappointments to the National Labor Relations Board and to the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau. Last year the administration illegally \nwaived key requirements of the 1996 welfare reform law.\n  Finally, to help implement ObamaCare, the IRS has announced that it \nwill violate the text of the law and issue health insurance subsidies \nthrough Federal exchanges, something Congress did not authorize. The \nlaw clearly states that these subsidies are not available to the \nFederal exchange but to the State-based exchanges. Indeed, it is the \ncase that the President's\n\n[[Page S3411]]\n\nhealth care law will dramatically expand the power of the Internal \nRevenue Service because the agency is responsible for implementing so \nmuch of ObamaCare's most important provisions.\n  Well, given what we have learned about IRS malfeasance, does it \nreally sound like a good idea to give them more responsibility, to hire \nmore agents? Before we get to the bottom of the present scandal, do we \nreally want the IRS to administer a law that will affect one-sixth of \nour economy, as ObamaCare will?\n  Do we really want the Internal Revenue Service agents collecting so \nmuch personal information about millions of American citizens? \nRemember, even before ObamaCare became the law, the IRS had more than \nenough power to destroy the lives of individual Americans. Chief \nJustice John Marshall, at the very beginning of our country, the Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court of the United States said the power to tax \ninvolves the power to destroy, and those words are still true today. \nWith trust in the Federal Government already at an all-time low, the \nIRS scandal will further diminish public confidence in public \ninstitutions and in Washington, DC.\n  As a result, this scandal will make it much harder for us to work \ntogether to adopt a fiscal policy and economic reforms that our country \nso desperately needs. When the IRS starts behaving as a rogue agent \nthat considers itself above the law, we have entered truly dangerous \nterritory. Today I am going to join others of my colleagues to call on \nthe Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller to resign. If it is true what \ncurrently appears to be true, that Mr. Miller willfully misled Congress \nwhen inquiries were made earlier about this political activity, he \nshould resign today.\n  Furthermore, I am encouraged actually by Chairman Max Baucus of the \nSenate Finance Committee and Senator Orrin Hatch who said they believe \nit is important for the Finance Committee as the appropriate standing \ncommittee of the Senate with jurisdiction over the Internal Revenue \nService to conduct an investigation.\n  I hope the first witness they will call is Treasury Secretary Jack \nLew, who is the boss of the IRS, or overseer of the IRS, Mr. Miller's \ndirect reporting boss. I look forward to a thorough bipartisan \ninvestigation that will deliver justice to these government officials \nwho betrayed the American people in such a shameful and egregious \nmanner.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 889\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 889.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], for himself and Mr. \n     Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 889.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To address restoration of certain properties impacted by \n               natural disasters, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. RESTORATION OF CERTAIN PROPERTIES IMPACTED BY \n                   NATURAL DISASTERS.\n\n       For all major disasters declared under the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act on or \n     after August 27, 2011, the Corps of Engineers and the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency shall consider eligible the costs \n     necessary to comply with any State stream or river alteration \n     permit required for the repair or replacement of otherwise \n     eligible damaged infrastructure, such as culverts and \n     bridges, including any design standards required to be met as \n     a condition of permit issuance.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by my \ncolleague from Vermont, Mr. Leahy. What it does is it addresses a very \nserious problem facing the State of Vermont and I think potentially \nStates all over the country.\n  Mr. President, as you well know, Tropical Storm Irene impacted some \n225 Vermont communities with 90 bridges and 963 culverts damaged or \ndestroyed statewide. In a small State, that is a lot of damage.\n  Long before Irene, the Vermont State legislature enacted stream \nalteration standards that prevented flood hazards, damage to fish and \nwildlife, and damage to adjacent property owners. These standards \nresult in resilient infrastructure and are looked to as a model by \nother States. In other words, what the State legislature did \nappropriately is pass standards that would do the job, that would \nprotect communities in times of floods and natural disasters.\n  As we all know, FEMA compensates communities for the rebuilding of \nbridges and culverts damaged during large storms such as Irene, but \nFEMA--and here is the main point--in many cases is insisting on \noverriding Vermont's stronger standards, requiring communities to build \ninferior projects that are unlikely to withstand the next major storm \nto hit the State. In other words, communities are standing there \nwanting to do the right thing. The State has promulgated regulations as \nto what these culverts and bridges should look like. What FEMA is \nsaying is we are not going to compensate you for doing the right thing. \nIn other words, FEMA is insisting that local communities, in order to \nget reimbursed for these expenses of replacing damaged infrastructure, \nmust build culverts and bridges to standards that have already failed \nand are likely to fail again. This is Vermont's problem today. It could \nbe your State's problem tomorrow. The point here is we should not be \nrebuilding culverts and bridges in a way that will result in them \nfailing once again when another flood or extreme weather disturbance \ntakes place. That makes no sense at all.\n  In Vermont, at least 39 bridge and culvert projects would benefit \nfrom this amendment, and half of these projects have not yet gone \nforward because of this dispute with FEMA. In other words, we have many \ncommunities in the State of Vermont that are not going forward \nrebuilding the damaged culverts and bridges but waiting because of this \nongoing dispute with FEMA.\n  Again, today this is Vermont's problem. Tomorrow it could be West \nVirginia's or California's. It makes no sense to rebuild bridges and \nculverts in a way that has failed. We want to rebuild them in a way \nthat will enable them to remain strong during the next flood or extreme \nweather disturbance. If another Hurricane Irene were to hit, those \ntowns would be vulnerable to severe damage yet again. In other words, \nthey are sitting in limbo. They don't have the money to do the job they \nwant to see done, and they are not getting help from FEMA. In fact, \ncommunities in States across the country that adopt more resilient \nstandards for infrastructure replacement would benefit from this \namendment.\n  Today it impacts Vermont. Tomorrow it could impact any State in this \ncountry. Local communities and States have a better sense of the kinds \nof standards that are required for bridges and culverts than FEMA, and \nthey should be allowed to go forward with those standards and be \ncompensated by FEMA.\n  FEMA's current practice throws good money at bad by preventing States \nand local communities from rebuilding with more resilient, better-\ndefined infrastructure after devastating storms. The amendment Senator \nLeahy and I are offering will save taxpayers money, will save lives, \nand better protect communities from future natural disasters and \nextreme weather disturbances.\n  In short, the Sanders-Leahy flood resilience amendment requires FEMA \nto recognize State standards when providing Federal reimbursements for \nbridge and culvert replacements after natural disasters, supports \ncommunities that want to rebuild more resilient infrastructure after \nnatural disasters, harmonizes the approaches of the Army Corps of \nEngineers and FEMA, and stops throwing good money after bad, saves \ntaxpayers at the local, State, and Federal level by making smarter \ninvestments in more durable infrastructure.\n  With that, I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time during all quorum calls be \ncharged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3412]]\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 868\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first let me thank Senator Boxer and \nSenator Vitter for the incredible work they have done in bringing \nforward the Water Resources Development Act, the WRDA legislation. This \ntruly has been a bipartisan effort to bring forward an extremely \nimportant bill for our economy, for jobs, for infrastructure, and for \ncompetitiveness. I can speak for the citizens of Maryland as to how \nimportant this legislation is to the economic life of our State in \nmaintaining the shipping channels that are critical to the ports in our \nState, the Port of Baltimore. This legislation will provide the \nwherewithal for Maryland and our Nation to remain competitive.\n  In this environment, it is not easy to get a major bill to the finish \nline. It looks as though as a result of the work done by the chairman \nand the ranking Republican member, we are on the verge of being able to \nmove this bill forward.\n  I know we are going to have a few votes in a few moments, and I \nwanted to take this time to urge my colleagues to reject the Barrasso \namendment that would deny the regulation of a lot of the waterways in \nour country. For 40 years the Clean Water Act dramatically improved the \nhealth of a generation of Americans. Without this law, which for \ndecades had protected rivers, streams, wetlands, lakes, and coastal \nwaterways from toxic pollution, all of our Nation's waters would be \nless safe to swim in, to fish in, and, especially, to drink.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about the health of the people of this \ncountry--the Clean Water Act. We are talking about the health of our \nstreams which people live next to. We are talking about families \ndepending upon clean safe water when they turn their taps on so they \ncan have water to give their families. We are talking about our \nenvironment.\n  I am pretty aggressive on this because I have the honor of \nrepresenting one of the States that is part of the Chesapeake Bay \nwatershed. The Presiding Officer also represents a State--West \nVirginia--that is part of the Chesapeake Bay, as is Pennsylvania and \nDelaware and Virginia and the District of Columbia. My point is there \nare over 100,000 streams and rivers that feed into the Chesapeake Bay. \nThe Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in North America and has \nthousands of species. The life of the Chesapeake Bay depends upon the \nwaters that flow into it, and the Barrasso amendment would deny the \neffectiveness of regulating the health of the waters leading into the \nbay. It would inject into the Clean Water Act a way in which we would \nbe denying the protection of the Clean Water Act to the public.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. It is anti-\nenvironment. There is no question about that. But let me cite another \nreason. I hear my colleagues on both sides of the aisle talk about \npredictability and we need to know what the rules are. We thought we \nknew what the rules were on the Clean Water Act, but then the Supreme \nCourt came through with some cases that are, quite frankly, baffling to \nus because they change the long-standing tradition of the regulations \non the Clean Water Act. We thought we understood what it was all about. \nSo there is a great deal of uncertainty today, and the Barrasso \namendment takes us back to that uncertainty.\n  The Obama administration, through its regulatory process, has given \nus the predictability we need so everyone can plan their activities, \nknowing full well what the responsibilities are for clean water. I \ndon't think we want to return to that time of uncertainty, and the \nBarrasso amendment would lead us back down that path.\n  There are many other reasons why this is wrong to do. When we take a \nlook at how many wetlands and how many streams and brooks we have lost \nacross this country, do we want to turn back the clock on the \nregulation of clean water on the streams, the brooks, and the wetlands \nthat are involved in our water supply? It is literally because of the \nprotections of the Clean Water Act that we know we are going to have a \nsafe supply of drinking water. It is because of the Clean Water Act we \nknow we can go to our beaches this summer and enjoy the recreational \nactivities along the water. The Barrasso amendment would take us to a \npoint where we could lose the effectiveness of the Clean Water Act in \nprotecting the public health of the people of this Nation.\n  We have a good bill before us. It is well balanced. I do again \napplaud the chairman and ranking member. There are provisions in this \nbill, quite frankly, I would like to see written in a different way, \nbut it was done with full bipartisan cooperation, and so the Barrasso \namendment should be rejected by this body, and I urge my colleagues to \nreject the amendment.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on legislation in regard \nto surplus water fees. I call it the States Water Rights Act, the \nStates water rights legislation, and I introduced this legislation as \nan amendment to the Water Resources Development Act. Essentially what \nit does is it would prevent the Corps of Engineers from unlawfully and \nunfairly imposing water usage fees on the Missouri River States. \nJoining me in this bipartisan legislation is Senator John Thune of \nSouth Dakota, Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Senator Max \nBaucus of Montana, and also Senator Tim Johnson of South Dakota. It is \nbipartisan legislation. In fact, I expect Senator Thune will be joining \nme here on the floor very shortly, and also Senator Heitkamp, so we can \nengage in a colloquy in regard to the legislation.\n  The Missouri River, of course, flows through the State of North \nDakota and the other Missouri River States. We have seven States the \nMissouri River flows through. In 1944, through the Pick-Sloan Act, \nwaters in those States were dammed to create large-scale reservoirs. \nThere are six mainstream reservoirs. Of course the primary purpose for \nthe dams and reservoirs was to provide flood protection downstream, \nwhich we have been doing now for more than 50 years--actually, over 60 \nyears.\n  At the same time, just as we are providing that flood protection with \nthese reservoirs, at the same time the upper basin States, States \nthroughout the basin, have withdrawn water from those reservoirs for a \nwhole variety of uses--municipalities, tribes, business and \nindustrial--the whole gamut of uses. In all that time, more than 60 \nyears, the Corps of Engineers has never charged the respective States--\nMontana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska--any of them--has not \ncharged them for using the water. That makes sense because if they draw \nthe water out of the river--I mean every one of the States has water \nrights. Tribes have water rights. If they draw the water out of the \nriver, of course, there is no charge.\n  Likewise, because the States gave up the land for flood protection in \norder to create those reservoirs, the corps has never charged for \ndrawing water out of the reservoirs either.\n  That has changed now. Now the corps is saying we are undertaking a \nstudy and in our study we are going to look and decide whether we are \ngoing to charge a fee if you take water out of the reservoir; even \nthough we never have, now we think maybe we are going to charge a fee.\n  This amendment blocks that. It says you can't do that. The States \nhave water rights. Just as if you take it out of the river you can't \ncharge us for that water, you certainly can't flood our land and then \ncharge us for it. It doesn't make any sense.\n  Furthermore, because States have water rights, they would never be \nable to do it. If in fact the corps were to proceed and impose those \nfees, we would sue them and we would win under the law because the \nrespective States are entitled to those water rights. That makes this \nkind of an unusual situation.\n  We have put this legislation forward, frankly, to avoid the cost of \nlitigation,\n\n[[Page S3413]]\n\nthe cost to the respective States and the cost to the Federal \nGovernment. So the reality is without this legislation we are offering, \nit would actually cost the Federal Government money because they would \nhave to undertake litigation against the States to impose fees on the \nStates in violation of their water rights which are well established at \nlaw. This amendment, in fact, in actuality saves the Federal Government \nmoney.\n  But the CBO, under their scoring regime, says no, wait a minute. \nSomehow we are going to look beyond that. I guess they would pretend \nthat wouldn't really happen. So we are going to assign a cost to this \nlegislation because the corps might get some fees down the road \nsomewhere; in spite of all these things, they might get a fee. So they \nhave assigned a $5 million cost to the legislation over the 10-year \nscoring window; $5 million over the 10-year scoring window.\n  We have managed to address that by saying no, we have also added--in \naddition to the fact that under this legislation the corps can't impose \nthe fees, we have also said you have to find $5 million in savings over \nthe next 10 years out of your operating budget. Since just their \noperations alone are $2 billion a year, obviously that would be a very \nsimple matter. The fact is it is, frankly, a technicality anyway \nbecause they are offsetting money they are never going to get so there \nis no cost to it. But from an accounting standpoint we do that so the \nCBO does not assign any score to this legislation.\n  That is kind of some of the nuts and bolts of the legislation. But \nthe key is this: This is about States that have given up fertile \nfarmland, hundreds of thousands of acres, in order to provide flood \nprotection for other States farther downstream. They were able to not \nonly use the land but they were able to draw water from the river as \nthey wanted to without being charged. So here comes the corps and says \nnow that we have flooded your land, now that you have provided that \nflood protection, oh, golly, we are going to charge you for flooding \nyour land. We are going to charge small towns, we are going to charge \ntribes, we are going to charge business and industries, farmers--\nwhomever.\n  It absolutely makes no sense. That is what this act does. It \naddresses that and makes sure they do not impose those fees in clear \nviolation of States' water rights. In fact, the legislation, even \nthough scored by CBO as having no cost, will save not only the Federal \nGovernment money but the respective States money as well.\n  I am very pleased to note that my distinguished colleague from South \nDakota, Senator John Thune, is here. I wish to ask if he, as cosponsor \nof this legislation, would express some of his thoughts as well.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask the Senator from North Dakota if he will yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Yes.\n  Mr. THUNE. This is an issue that is important to both his State and \nmy State for many reasons, not the least of which is we have basically \nflooded 1.6 million acres of prime bottom land, some of the richest \nagricultural land in our States, in order to prevent flooding \ndownstream. Then of course there were also stated other various uses of \nthe water that would be allowed for the States that were impacted when \nthis occurred.\n  But I wonder if my colleague from North Dakota--he has already \ntouched upon many of the reasons why this should not happen, but he is \na former Governor of his State. I know our Governor and our attorney \ngeneral have made it abundantly clear that if the corps moves forward, \nthey intend to file a lawsuit and they will litigate this. As a former \nGovernor, if the now-Senator from North Dakota could respond to how his \nState of North Dakota might act in the event this actually were \nimplemented by the corps?\n  It strikes me at least that this is without precedent. This is \nsomething that--the Flood Control Act was passed in 1944 and the dams \nwere built subsequent to that. For the past 50 years our States have \nhad access to this water and it is something that is a State right. \nThere is no legal or statutory--there is no historical precedent for \ndoing this. I am wondering how the former Governor of North Dakota \nmight view this as a Governor, as to what his action might be in the \nevent the Corps of Engineers were to move forward with this. Because it \ncertainly would impact a lot of the industrial users, water users in \nthe State, businesses, tribes--a lot of folks are going to be impacted \nif the corps moves forward with this proposal. If the Senator from \nNorth Dakota might tell me as former Governor how he might view this \nand what he would intend to do and what our Governor and attorney \ngeneral would intend to do in the event the corps moves forward.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the distinguished Senator from South Dakota for \njoining me, and for his question. Of course, he is anticipating exactly \nwhat would happen. The States will initiate litigation against the \ncorps if in fact the corps decides to impose a fee. They are \nundertaking a year-long study and at the end they are going to come \nback and say: Oh, they are not going to charge a fee. Or they are not \ngoing to impose a fee. If they do impose a fee, here is what it would \nbe. At that point they would be sued by the States. In fact, in the \ncase of North Dakota, the legislature has already set aside moneys to \nfund the lawsuit.\n  As when I was the Governor, the current Governor and the attorney \ngeneral have already said very clearly they will commence litigation. \nIt would be multistate litigation. As I said, they have already set \naside funds.\n  That is the point I am making. We can talk about the CBO score--which \nwe have now squared away so it doesn't score--the reality is we are \nsaving both the Federal Government and the States money with this \nlegislation because there will absolutely be litigation.\n  Mr. THUNE. Will the Senator yield for another question, if I might?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I will.\n  Mr. THUNE. Our attorney general wrote a letter and said:\n\n       This proposal, whether disguised as a reallocation or \n     surplus water, exceeds the Corps' regulatory authority and \n     violates basic principles of federalism.\n\n  It went on to lay out the reasons why they, our State, would \nobviously enter into litigation if it comes to that, if it is necessary \nin order to protect the rights of South Dakotans to the water that is \nrightfully theirs.\n  I would be interested in knowing as well from the Senator from North \nDakota if in fact, during the course of the last many years, his \namendment would change anything, if his amendment would change anything \nthat is happening today? In other words, today what happens if the \nState wants to use water in one of the mainstream dams--and there are \nsix mainstream dams, one in Montana, a big one in North Dakota, and \nthen we have four in South Dakota, all of which were created by the \nFlood Control Act or authorized. These were dams built to protect from \nflooding downstream and then also authorized various uses of that \nwater.\n  I might point out what some of those uses are. They were to be for \nenhanced navigation, cheap hydro power, irrigation, programs to \nincrease public recreation facilities, municipal-industrial water \nsupplies, and fish and wildlife populations. Those are some of the \nthings that are stated that the water is to be used for.\n\n  The Senator's amendment, which would prevent the corps from charging \nfor this water, as I understand it, doesn't change anything, the \npractice as it exists today, because a water user would request an \neasement from the corps, and then essentially the State would have to \nissue the water. That is my understanding of how it works today.\n  Does any of that change--if it is passed--as far as the amendment of \nthe Senator from North Dakota?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, in response to the Senator's question, \nabsolutely not. It doesn't change any of the authorized purposes for \nthe reservoirs and for the system. This does not impact in any way any \nof the authorized uses for the mainstem dams, the mainstem breviaries \nor the Missouri River system.\n  I want to emphasize that because we have the seven Missouri River \nStates, and sometimes we get the upstream and downstream interests. \nThis does not change any of those authorized purposes or how they are \nutilized or how the respective States interact with them--or even the \namount of water usage.\n  So to try to bring in any of the other issues which have typically \nbeen concerns for the Missouri River does not\n\n[[Page S3414]]\n\napply here. This is about whether the respective States--this is one \nwhere we can come together. This is upstream or downstream and whether \nany States will be charged for water that is rightfully theirs. That \nmakes this very much a States rights issue about which all of the \nStates should be concerned.\n  How can we allow Federal agencies to come in and simply impose a fee \nbecause they want to and then impose whatever fee they want? We will do \na study and we will impose a fee of whatever size we determine we \nbelieve is appropriate.\n  It is a clear violation of States rights, and on a very important \nissue, water rights.\n  If I could, I want to also invite the good Senator from North Dakota, \nMs. Heitkamp, to join us as well in this colloquy. She also brings \nexpertise as the former attorney general in North Dakota and can \ncertainly comment on the legal issues as well.\n  Before I do that, I will turn it over, Mr. President, to the Senator \nfrom South Dakota, who I think had another question and/or comment.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I want to welcome our other colleague from \nNorth Dakota who also has experience as a litigator in protecting the \ninterests of her State. Perhaps she could also comment on what actions \nthe States might take if the corps moves forward.\n  I want to point out to my colleagues, and perhaps the Senator is \nalready aware of this, but I am looking at some things that are \nproposed charges that the corps would make under this proposal, \nalthough I don't think they have stated explicitly what that might be. \nBut it ends up being a significant amount.\n  In fact, over the Lewis and Clark leg, which is Gavins Point--or I \nshould say, Lewis and Clark Dam--they are talking about $174 per acre \nfoot of yield from Lewis and Clark Lake. We are talking about \nbusinesses, individuals, tribes, and industrial users having access to \nwater they believe--and I think we all believe--is something that was \npromised to them when this legislation was passed way back in the \n1940s.\n  We have essentially 70 years of precedent where it has been the case \nthat the States have access and can rightfully use that water for those \nvarious purposes as authorized under the legislation. This would move \naway from that and start to impose these fees, which I think over time \nget to be quite excessive.\n  I appreciate the work that has been done by the Senator from North \nDakota Mr. Hoeven in terms of trying to get the CBO to evaluate this in \nthe proper context. For a while they were talking about the scoring \nimpact that was much larger than many of us believed it would be. \nAgain, it is a hypothetical situation. It is not happening today.\n  All the Senator is simply doing is saying we want to keep in place \nthe rules of the game as they have applied to the mainstem dams for the \npast 50 years--70 years since the authorization in the legislation that \ncreated it, but also since the dams were built.\n  I guess I would say to my colleagues from North Dakota, I appreciate \ntheir good work, and I would simply reiterate--as a South Dakotan, \ndownstream from North Dakota--that our States, and all the States in \nthe upper basin, would be dramatically impacted by this because it \nwould be a precedent that would be entirely new.\n  Literally, this is something we have not dealt with since we had the \ndams and the lakes in our States. Again, this would be at a tremendous \nsacrifice in terms of the amount of prime bottom land that was given up \nwhen the dams were built and the land was taken.\n  I now defer to the former attorney general of North Dakota, Senator \nHeitkamp, for some observations she might have with respect to that \nissue.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the Senator from South Dakota for joining, and he \nis absolutely right. The cost to the States is significant. In \nactuality, the scoring number is reduced because the probability of \nthem getting it is so remote. As I mentioned earlier, they are flying \nin the face of well-established water rights the States have. So once \nthey assign the probability they would lend to it, obviously that \nreduces the amount that gets scored.\n  Once again, it shows they are trying to impose a fee where they have \nno right to do it, so it did create some scoring issue that it really \nnever should. The fact is the litigation would far outweigh the score \nthat CBO has put on it, both to the Federal Government and to the \nrespective States. In the end there would be no fees because there is \nno right to assess those fees.\n  I think we have someone who as a former attorney general dealt, in \nfact, with this very type of issue during her tenure as attorney \ngeneral. I turn to my colleague from North Dakota and ask that she \ncomment on the legality of the issue as well as her thoughts in terms \nof the fairness and the States rights aspect, which truly makes this an \nissue our colleagues should join and support. This is exactly what \ncould happen to them, and it could happen to their States.\n  I turn to Senator Heitkamp for her thoughts in that regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. I say thank you to my colleagues from North Dakota and \nSouth Dakota. Mr. President, this is not a new issue. This is an \nissue--even back in the 1990s--I dealt with as the State's attorney \ngeneral. Why do I mention that? I mention it because we were able to \npersuade the corps at the time that the intake pipe they were \nattempting to charge for surplus water was actually in the original \nriver bed. I--just tongue-in-cheek--suggested I would charge them for \nputting their water on top of our water, and maybe they should pay a \nfee to us for the storage we were going to allow them.\n  In all seriousness, this is not an issue that is going to go away. If \nany of our colleagues think this is an issue where we can just let it \ngo and ride it out, this is an issue that has percolated for a lot of \nyears. It has culminated right now to this effort to be proactive in \nthis body to prevent litigation, prevent excess expense, and prevent a \ndeterioration of a relationship that is essential to making sure we \nhave flood protection and all of the other good that came out of the \nFlood Control Act.\n  So the time is now to take an immediate step to prevent this issue \nfrom going any further and to address the concerns that upstream States \nhave.\n  I want to spend just a few moments talking about this from a legal \nperspective and what could happen if, in fact, the Federal Government \nengaged in litigation with the States.\n  We have heard today from both South Dakota and North Dakota Senators. \nI am reasonably sure Montana would not allow this precedent to stand \nwithout some pushback and an absolute commitment from a bipartisan \nstandpoint from all the upstream States for a pushback.\n  Let's talk about why there are legal problems with the corps \napproach. Charging fees for surplus waters, I believe, would violate a \nState's right to the water that naturally flows through the boundaries \nas historically recognized by the Federal Government and as recognized \nby the 10th Amendment.\n  Charging fees would violate statutory law. Section 1 of the 1944 \nFlood Control Act provides protection for water resources in Western \nStates. We have a common law water rights argument, a historic \nargument, and we have a statutory argument.\n  I think charging fees would reverse decades of corps policy on \nsurplus water and create a precedent which should not be established, \nnot only in the upper Missouri basin but should not be established \nanyplace in this country. That is why this is an issue that is not just \nabout the Dakotas, it is not just about Montana and the upstream \nStates, it is an issue that every one of our colleagues has an interest \nin reviewing. If they can do it in this case, why can't they do it in \nany other reservoir.\n  Charging fees would penalize Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota \nby charging for water that is freely available in the absence of the \ncorps reservoir. If there were no reservoir, there would be no issue. \nIn fact, if they tried to charge, most of our colleagues would find \nthat absolutely atrocious. This is in the face of what we know we have \nsacrificed for flood control in that basin.\n  I want to mention the unique interest that the Mandan, Hidatsa, \nArikara Nation, along with the Standing Rock Nation have and what they \nhave sacrificed for flood control, what they have sacrificed in terms \nof loss of their\n\n[[Page S3415]]\n\nland, division of their reservation boundaries, and division of their \nproperty. Now, the corps is saying: Yes, we took your land. Yes, we \ndisrupted your natural boundaries and your natural way of life, and now \nwe are going to charge you for the water that sits on your historic \nhomeland.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for another 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We have a vote locked in at 5 p.m., so the Senator can \nspeak up until 5 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that at 5 p.m., the Senate vote \nin relation to the Inhofe, Barrasso, and Sanders amendments as provided \nunder the previous order; that following the vote in relation to the \nSanders amendment, the Senate proceed to a period of morning business \nwith Senators permitted to speak up to 10 minutes; further, that when \nthe Senate resumes consideration on S. 601 on Wednesday, May 15, it \nresume the voting sequence in the previous order with all after the \nfirst vote being 10 minutes and all other provisions of the previous \norder remaining in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. For the information of all Senators, it is our \nexpectation that the Inhofe amendment will be the subject of a voice \nvote. If that occurs there will be two rollcall votes this evening, and \nthe remainder of the votes will occur tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. HEITKEMP. So when we look at water surplus fees and we think \nabout the fact that we have given our land, we have given our \nopportunity to have free access to our water, we have done all of this \nwith the idea that it is for the better good of this country, to now \ncharge our citizens and people who have always had historic access to \nthat water--this fee looks a whole lot like a tax--it is adding insult \nto injury.\n  I can guarantee that this issue will not go away. If we don't \nprevail, what we are buying is a lawsuit because the Corps of Engineers \nis not going to give up. The Corps of Engineers will continue to \nadvance and promote this idea until they implement this idea, and then \nwe are going to be in litigation.\n  This issue will not go away. The easiest way to resolve this issue in \nan amiable way and in a way that is going to maintain the kind of \nhistoric relationship we have with our tribes is to deal with it today. \nWe need to deal with it within the Water Resources Development Act we \nare enacting. We need to support amendment No. 909, the amendment of my \ngood friend and colleague John Hoeven, the Senator from North Dakota, \nand put this idea to bed once and for all that the corps cannot charge \nus for water that historically and legally belongs to the States where \nthat water is located.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I wish to thank again my colleague for her comments in \nregard to the legal aspect; again, she brings a lot of direct \nexperience working with this issue. So I thank her for her comments \nwith regard to the legal aspect, but she makes another very important \npoint. This isn't just about States rights; this would be a taking of \ntribal rights too.\n  I am going to turn to my colleague from South Dakota and ask him a \nquestion on this very same subject. But, in fact, in North Dakota, it \nis going to be one of our tribes that is most disenfranchised by this \naction of the corps. Because, again, we have made the point we can take \nwater out of the river. We can continue to do that. They can't charge \nus for water coming from the river.\n  The other place they are trying to charge for water is out of the \nreservoir. But most of the reservoir in North Dakota is inside the \ntribe reservation, so the people who would be most dramatically \nimpacted, in fact, would be Native Americans in our State.\n  I am going to turn to our colleague from South Dakota. I am guessing \nthat is true in South Dakota as well.\n  Mr. THUNE. I would just say to both of my colleagues from North \nDakota, that is an absolutely accurate observation.\n  If we look at who is impacted--and we have the Standing Rock Tribe \nthat is partly in North Dakota and partly in South Dakota so it crosses \nthe State border. We have the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, the Coal \nCreek Sioux Tribe, the Yankton Tribe. We have a whole bunch of \nreservations as we go right down that corridor of the Missouri River \nthat would be profoundly impacted. As we mentioned earlier, when this \nland was given up, when the dams were built, this was a lot of not only \nprivate land but tribal-held land which they gave up. This would \ndirectly impact the access they would have to water that is rightfully \ntheirs.\n  So in addition to the concerns our States have and our attorneys \ngeneral have, we also have a lot of tribes that have a very vested \ninterest in making sure this doesn't happen. That is why it is so \nimportant that our colleagues support the amendment of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, because as was pointed out by Senator Heitkamp, this is \nprecedent setting. If they can do this here, they may try and do it \nsomeplace else.\n  I also think--and the point was made by both of my colleagues--this \nis a very practical consideration. It will cost the Federal Government \nand our States a lot more than what they are saying this is going to \nachieve in terms of revenues when this goes to court. Both the States \nand the Federal Government will be locked up, I would suspect, in \nlitigation for some time. The amount of revenues that would be raised \nby the fees that would be imposed under the various proposals that are \nbeing advanced by the corps simply would pale in comparison to the \nlitigation costs that would be involved.\n  So that is a very practical consideration. I concur. I am not a \nlawyer, and I certainly am not a former attorney general or former \nGovernor. I know both of my colleagues have experience with these \nissues. But I can tell my colleagues from talking with our Governor and \nour attorney general they are highly confident that legally this is a \nvery open-and-shut situation and a case in which our State would \nprevail. So it seems sort of crazy in a way that we would even have to \ngo down that trail, and I hope we can prevent it from happening by \nhaving our colleagues join us in support of this amendment.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from South \nDakota and turn to my colleague from North Dakota for any final \nthoughts before we yield the floor.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, my colleagues from North and South \nDakota and I come from practical States. We come from States where we \ntry to anticipate problems and we solve problems before they turn into \nbig, expensive pieces of litigation, and that is what that amendment \ndoes. This amendment addresses, in a proactive way, a policy we know \nwill not be put to bed until this body speaks. Let's do it now. Let's \ndo it kind of in the way we do it in our States. Let's be proactive. \nLet's make sure we aren't wasting money and wasting relationships on \nlitigation and that we are moving forward to manage the Upper Basin as \nbest we can and that we do what is right by the people of our State and \nthe people in our tribal governments and our Native American neighbors.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 909\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, with that, I wish to set aside the pending \namendment and call up the Hoeven amendment No. 909.\n  I wish to close with a couple other thoughts. Senator Baucus from \nMontana wanted to join with us in the colloquy, but the timeline didn't \nwork out. So I wished to express my appreciation for his support and \nsponsorship of this legislation as well.\n  I wish to again make the point that this isn't about using the water. \nOur respective States will still use the water. The issue is about \nbeing charged for it. That is a very important point, so that nobody \ntries to confuse this issue in order to try to get opposition to the \nissue. We will still use the water; it is just that we will be charged \nfor it unfairly, except for the fact--as we said, this would be tied up \nin litigation creating a bunch of costs for the State and the Federal \nGovernment, so that wouldn't really happen. So what we are doing is \nsolving a very important problem. It is one that all of the States need \nto be cognizant of, because\n\n[[Page S3416]]\n\nif a Federal agency can come in and try to do it to one State, it can \ndo it to any one of the States. This is a fundamental issue regarding \nStates rights.\n  If any of our colleagues have questions or concerns about the \namendment, I encourage them to come to us. We want to talk to them \nabout it. We truly believe, if they understand the facts, they will be \nstrongly supportive.\n  Again, I wish to turn to my colleague from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. One final point of clarification and perhaps the Senator \nfrom North Dakota can react and comment on this as well.\n  My understanding is, of course, that this doesn't have any impact on \nthe master manual, the way in which the corps manages the reservoir. So \nthe degree to which there might be concern about whether this is our \nwater versus their water, which historically has plagued a lot of the \ndiscussions about the Missouri River--upstream-downstream interests. As \nthe Senator from North Dakota pointed out, the water is going to get \nused. It is water that is either stored or used. I think it is a \nquestion of whether we are going to be charged, the users of that water \nare going to be charged, and that does, of course, create precedent. If \nthat is something they can do here, the question is, What is the next \nState? Because this violates a principle of federalism, as pointed out \nby the attorney general of South Dakota in his letter to the Corps of \nEngineers.\n  But I wanted to say for the record, perhaps to those who are viewing \nthis as an upstream-downstream battle, that is not the case. This does \nnot affect the master manual, to my knowledge, and I ask the Senator \nfrom South Dakota to react to that as well.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, the Senator is absolutely right. I wish to \nthank him for emphasizing that point. It is very important. Again, that \nis why I encourage any of our colleagues to discuss this issue with us \nif they have any concerns whatsoever. It is just a fundamental fairness \nissue, and we ask for an affirmative vote from our colleagues.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Without objection, the clerk will report the Hoeven amendment.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Hoeven] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 909.\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 909\n\n        (Purpose: To restrict charges for certain surplus water)\n\n       On page 190, after line 23, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2060. RESTRICTION ON CHARGES FOR CERTAIN SURPLUS WATER.\n\n       (a) In General.--No fee for surplus water shall be charged \n     under a contract for surplus water if the contract is for \n     surplus water stored on the Missouri River.\n       (b) Offset.--Of the amounts made available under Public Law \n     113-6 (127 Stat. 198) for operations and maintenance under \n     the heading ``Corps of Engineers--Civil'', $5,000,000 is \n     rescinded.\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 868\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, shortly we are going to vote; I believe it \nwill be a voice vote on the Inhofe amendment. It is not a controversial \namendment; everybody agrees to it. Then we will proceed to the Barrasso \namendment which I have spoken about before.\n  I wish to urge my colleagues to be very careful on this one because \nit has unintended consequences. The way the Barrasso amendment is \ndrafted, it tries to say, in advance of a rulemaking, that if the \nrulemaking includes any infrastructure from the guidance that has been \nput forward by the corps and the EPA--if it even contains anything like \nit--``the rule will be considered as having been vacated.'' That is a \nquote.\n  So the bottom line is, the Barrasso amendment is such an overreach \nthat we will keep the whole issue of waters of the United States in \nchaos--and it is in chaos. We received letters from business people \nbegging us to allow the rulemaking to go forward, but because of the \nway the Barrasso amendment is drafted, essentially we are not going to \never have a rule.\n  So why is it important to have a rule that is very clear and explains \nwhat waters are covered under the Clean Water Act? Let me tell my \ncolleagues why. Without protections of a rule, dangerous pollutants \ncould be put into our waterways. This isn't just hyperbole. We are \ntalking about toxic heavy metals such as arsenic and lead. We are \ntalking about toxins that cause cancer and harm the health of infants \nand children in particular. Who are the vulnerables? The infants, the \nchildren and the elderly and those who are disabled. They are the ones \nwho are the victims of filthy, dirty water.\n  I am not saying my friend Senator Barrasso wants to get people sick. \nI am not saying that. But I am saying there is an unintended \nconsequence of the overreach in this amendment which is pretty clear to \nall who read it. It says if the draft guidance that has already been \nlooked at is included in any way, shape or form into a final rule, then \nthe whole rule is thrown out on its face and that leaves the situation \nin chaos.\n  Say I come to the Presiding Officer and say: I am going to write a \nbook about mathematics. The Presiding Officer says: That is very \nexciting, but there is only one thing. I am your publisher and you \ncan't put one single number in the book--not a 1 to a 2 to a 3. You can \nwrite a book on mathematics, but it can't contain any numbers. That is \nthe most ridiculous situation. But this is the essence of the Barrasso \namendment. It is telling people who are going to write a rule that they \ncan't take anything that was put in the draft guidance and put it into \nthat rule. It makes absolutely no sense.\n  I want to protect people from toxics such as lead and arsenic. \nWithout these safeguards of the rule, our drinking water supplies would \nbe more at risk and the laws of these protections would increase the \nrisks of dangerous floods in downstream communities because it would \neliminate wetlands protections.\n  One of the things I learned when I was a county supervisor a very \nlong time ago is that wetlands kept in their natural state and enhanced \nare the best way to have flood protection. When I went to Louisiana \nafter Katrina, I was struck by the fact that the whole community \nunderstood the importance of the wetlands, because they absorb the \nfloodwaters.\n  So now, because we are not going to be able to define what is a body \nof water that falls under the Clean Water Act, we are going to have a \nmajor problem with our wetlands. We are going to have a major problem \nwith our rivers. We are going to have a major problem with our streams. \nWe are talking about enormous bodies of water that are unprotected now \nbecause there is no rule. Under the Barrasso amendment, my opinion is--\nand it isn't just my opinion--there will not be any rule because if the \nrule picks up anything in the guidance at all--anything substantially \nsimilar to the guidance at all--it will be automatically overturned.\n  I wish to say to my friend, if he doesn't like a rule, he has the \nCRA, the Congressional Review Act. He can wait until he gets the rule. \nDon't prejudge it. Don't say the rule is vacated. That is pretty \ndictatorial to people who are in charge of protecting our water supply.\n  Nobody wants our kids to get more cancer. Nobody wants this to \nhappen. We have to protect streams that provide drinking water for up \nto 117 million Americans. We have 20 million acres of wetlands that \nprovide flood protection, improve water quality, and serve as wildlife \nhabitat.\n  So the hour of 5 o'clock is upon us. We are going to vote on the \nInhofe amendment first. Then we will turn to Senator Barrasso for a \nmoment to make his case, and then I will have 1 minute after that. So \nat this time we return to regular order. I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3417]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 797\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I call up Inhofe amendment No. 797.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for Mr. Inhofe, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 797.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent to yield back all time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 797) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: To authorize a land exchange)\n\n       At the end of title XII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 12__. TULSA PORT OF CATOOSA, ROGERS COUNTY, OKLAHOMA \n                   LAND EXCHANGE.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Federal land.--The term ``Federal land'' means the \n     approximately 87 acres of land situated in Rogers County, \n     Oklahoma, contained within United States Tracts 413 and 427, \n     and acquired for the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas Navigation \n     System.\n       (2) Non-federal land.--The term ``non-Federal land'' means \n     the approximately 34 acres of land situated in Rogers County, \n     Oklahoma and owned by the Tulsa Port of Catoosa that lie \n     immediately south and east of the Federal land.\n       (b) Land Exchange.--Subject to subsection (c), on \n     conveyance by the Tulsa Port of Catoosa to the United States \n     of all right, title, and interest in and to the non-Federal \n     land, the Secretary shall convey to the Tulsa Port of \n     Catoosa, all right, title, and interest of the United States \n     in and to the Federal land.\n       (c) Conditions.--\n       (1) Deeds.--\n       (A) Deed to non-federal land.--The Secretary may only \n     accept conveyance of the non-Federal land by warranty deed, \n     as determined acceptable by the Secretary.\n       (B) Deed to federal land.--The Secretary shall convey the \n     Federal land to the Tulsa Port of Catoosa by quitclaim deed \n     and subject to any reservations, terms, and conditions that \n     the Secretary determines necessary to--\n       (i) allow the United States to operate and maintain the \n     McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System; and\n       (ii) protect the interests of the United States.\n       (2) Legal descriptions.--The exact acreage and legal \n     descriptions of the Federal land and the non-Federal land \n     shall be determined by surveys acceptable to the Secretary.\n       (3) Payment of costs.--The Tulsa Port of Catoosa shall be \n     responsible for all costs associated with the land exchange \n     authorized by this section, including any costs that the \n     Secretary determines necessary and reasonable in the interest \n     of the United States, including surveys, appraisals, real \n     estate transaction fees, administrative costs, and \n     environmental documentation.\n       (4) Cash payment.--If the appraised fair market value of \n     the Federal land, as determined by the Secretary, exceeds the \n     appraised fair market value of the non-Federal land, as \n     determined by the Secretary, the Tulsa Port of Catoosa shall \n     make a cash payment to the United States reflecting the \n     difference in the appraised fair market values.\n       (5) Liability.--The Tulsa Port of Catoosa shall hold and \n     save the United States free from damages arising from \n     activities carried out under this section, except for damages \n     due to the fault or negligence of the United States or a \n     contractor of the United States.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to reconsider the vote and move to lay that motion \non the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, what is the order at this time?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 868\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote on \namendment No. 868 offered by the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Barrasso.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, this amendment restricts the expansion \nof Federal authority to encompass all wet areas of farms, ranches, and \nsuburban homes across the United States. They want to do it through \nguidance, this proposed guidance that is used by Federal agencies. It \nseems that they are preparing to expand the definition of waters of the \nUnited States to include ditches and other dry areas where water flows \nonly for a short duration after a rainfall.\n  This guidance is going to have a huge impact on farmers, ranchers, \nand small businesses that need to put a shovel in the ground to make a \nliving. This guidance will, in fact, trump States rights by preempting \nState and local governments from making local land and water use \ndecisions.\n  I have always believed the State and local governments, not \nWashington, know best how to protect their communities from \nenvironmental harm. The guidance does exactly the opposite and puts the \npower of these decisions in the hands of bureaucrats in Washington.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, the way my colleague and friend has \ndrafted his amendment is very dangerous to the process because he wants \nto say if, in the rulemaking where we will define the waters of the \nUnited States, if they even so much as refer to the guidance that has \nbeen put forward, the draft guidance, there will be no rule.\n  The problem of not having a rule is we leave in place chaos. States \ncannot go ahead and handle this themselves. Local governments cannot. \nUnder the law, according to all the rules of the Court and everybody \nelse, we have to have a definition. No one I know wants to classify a \nditch or a puddle as a water of the United States. That is always \nbrought up, but that is just a red herring.\n  We need to make sure we have a Clean Water Act that protects the \npeople, protects their drinking water, and makes sure they are safe \nwhen they swim in a lake. If we do not move forward with a rule, at the \nend of the day this amendment will not allow that to happen, and we are \nin chaos. It does not protect our people from arsenic, from lead, from \nwhatever objects there may be in a body of water. So I hope we will \nreject this. I thank my friend for offering it, but I think it is \nmisguided.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in \nrelation to amendment No. 889, offered by the Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nSanders.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. This amendment impacts Vermont today, but it can impact \nany and every State in this country if it experiences a major flood or \na natural disaster.\n  We all know FEMA compensates communities for rebuilding bridges and \nculverts damaged during storms such as Irene, but what is not widely \nknown is that FEMA insists that local communities, in order to get \nreimbursed, must build culverts and bridges to the same standards that \nalready failed and are likely to fail again. It is not terribly \nsensible. That is what this amendment deals with.\n  I yield to my colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nLeahy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, all we are saying is that if you are \ngoing to be getting relief from the Federal Government but you have a \nbetter way to rebuild your culverts, you can do it that way rather than \nto have the ones that failed before.\n  I am sure there are a whole lot of States here that will be affected \nby this amendment, and I hope it will be approved.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, as ranking member on the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, I know there are a lot of \nproblems with FEMA and the Stafford grant, but this is essentially an \nearmark for an improvement before FEMA has even determined whether it \nis going to give mitigation grant money to the State of Vermont.\n  We need to do a lot in the way of changes with FEMA and grants and \nthe Stafford grant monies. We know that, and we are working on that in \nHomeland Security. But this starts a process that sets a precedent that \nwill be terrible. This is nothing right now but an earmark for one \narea, to benefit one State, when we need to make improvements in the \nwhole process.\n  I hope my colleagues will look at the big picture rather than the \nsmall picture, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order requiring \n60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise today to speak on S. 601, the \nWater Resources Development Act, WRDA. I would like to focus on Senate \nAmendment No. 801, a bipartisan provision to provide regulatory relief \nto our country's farmers and ranchers. Senate Amendment No. 801 is \nbased on S. 496, the Farmers Undertake Environmental Stewardship Act, \nFUELS Act.\n  The FUELS Act was introduced by Senator Mark Pryor and has 10 \ncosponsors from both sides of the aisle including Senators John \nBoozman, Saxby Chambliss, Thad Cochran, John Cornyn, Heidi Heitkamp, \nJames Inhofe, Johnny Isakson, Mike Johanns, Mary Landrieu, and myself. \nIt was referred to the Senate Environment & Public Works Committee, of \nwhich I am a member.\n  I filed the FUELS Act as an amendment to WRDA when it was considered \nearlier this year by the Senate Environment & Public Works Committee. \nThe amendment was not considered at that time.\n  The House version of the FUELS Act, H.R. 311, was introduced by \nCongressman Rick Crawford and has 69 cosponsors. In the 112th Congress, \nthe FUELS Act, H.R. 3158, was reported by the House Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee and passed the House by voice vote. The House \nCommittee Report for H.R. 3158 (Report 112-643) provides background and \ndiscusses the need for legislation:\n\n       The EPA mandated Oil Spill Prevention, Control and \n     Countermeasures program, or SPCC, requires that oil storage \n     facilities with a capacity of over 1,320 gallons must make \n     infrastructure improvements to reduce the possibility of oil \n     spills. The regulations require farmers to construct a \n     containment facility, like a dike or a basin, which must \n     retain 110 percent of the fuel in the container. These \n     mandated infrastructure improvements--along with the \n     necessary inspection and certification by a specially \n     licensed Professional Engineer will cost many farmers tens of \n     thousands of dollars. Sometimes compliance costs reach higher \n     than $60,000.\n       The SPCC program dates back to 1973, shortly after the \n     Clean Water Act was signed into law. In the last decade, it \n     has been rigorously applied to agriculture lands, and has \n     been amended, delayed, and extended dozens of times. The \n     Obama administration updated the rule in 2009 to expand \n     regulation under the SPCC program--applying it to nearly all \n     farms, and lifting a 2006 rule that suspended compliance \n     requirements for small farms with oil storage of 10,000 \n     gallons or less. It applied to crop oil, vegetable oil, \n     animal fat, and even milk. Further revisions came during \n     April of 2011 when the EPA decided to exempt milk.\n       The 2009 rule--minus regulating milk spills was scheduled \n     to go into effect in November 2011. A few weeks before the \n     November deadline, EPA issued a statement saying they would \n     not begin enforcement until May of 2013. While enforcement \n     has been delayed until 2013, the underlying regulation has \n     not been fixed.\n       The FUELS Act requires that EPA revise the SPCC regulations \n     to be reflective of a producer's spill risk and financial \n     resources. The exemption level would be adjusted upward from \n     1,320 gallons of oil storage to an amount that would protect \n     small farms: 10,000 gallons. The proposal would also place a \n     greater degree of responsibility on farmers and ranchers to \n     self-certify compliance if their oil storage facilities \n     exceed the exemption level. If the amount exceeds 42,000 \n     gallons, a professional engineer must certify the SPCC plans \n     for a farm. The bill provides another layer of protection by \n     requiring the producer to be able to demonstrate that he or \n     she has no history of oil spills, or to fully comply with the \n     SPCC regulations.\n       The University of Arkansas, Division of Agriculture did a \n     study that concluded that, for the entire country, H.R. 3158 \n     would save farmers and ranchers up to $3.36 billion.\n\n\n[[Page S3419]]\n\n\n  Agricultural production is an energy-intensive endeavor. Farmers need \nfuel to power machinery, equipment, and irrigation pumps. Because these \noperations are in rural areas where regular access to fuel supplies is \nlimited, producers rely upon on-farm fuel storage capacity to provide \nthe supply we need at the times we need it.\n  My family operates a cattle ranch in the Nebraska Sandhills, so I can \ntell you firsthand that farmers and ranchers take great pride in the \nwork we do. Our success is the direct result of careful stewardship of \nour natural resources, which we depend upon for our livelihoods. In \nagriculture, we know the value of clean water, and we work hard to \nprotect the quality of our streams and aquifers. When it comes to \npreventing spills from our on-farm fuel storage, farmers already have \nevery incentive to do so--not the least of which is the high cost of \ndiesel and gasoline.\n  I receive calls and letters every day from Nebraska farmers concerned \nabout the compliance challenges associated with the SPCC rule for on-\nfarm fuel storage, a regulation originally designed for oil refineries. \nAllow me to share a portion of one such constituent email I recently \nreceived on this issue:\n\n       We just became aware of this regulation yesterday through \n     an email from Farm Bureau. Since we have a large quantity of \n     on-farm storage capacity, we are not able to self-certify and \n     must hire a professional engineer to create a plan. In order \n     to find a qualified engineer, I first called the EPA, who \n     then told me to call the Region 7 office out of Kansas City, \n     who then told me to call the Nebraska Board of Engineers, who \n     then told me to call the Nebraska Society of Professional \n     Engineers, but the number on their website is no longer in \n     service. When I asked the gentleman from the Nebraska Board \n     of Engineers how much it would cost, he said anywhere from \n     $1500-$4800, depending on the complexity and the engineer's \n     ability to charge more due to high demand due to the \n     approaching deadline. When I asked the gentleman from the EPA \n     Region 7 office why we hadn't heard about it before now, he \n     said the ruling was in place for a long time but they haven't \n     done a good job of getting the word out.\n\n  When I shared these frustrations with Gina McCarthy, the nominee for \nEPA Administrator, she acknowledged at her nomination hearing on April \n11, 2013, that ``the agency has bridges to build with the agriculture \ncommunity.'' The fact is that good stewardship on farms and ranches and \nenvironmental improvements are achieved because of producers' \napplication of new technology, best practices, and conservation \nmeasures.\n  Centralized management and mandates are all too often arbitrary, \nineffectual, or even counterproductive, lacking the insight of local \nstakeholders. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter from the stakeholder groups on this issue that illustrates this \npoint, July 25, 2012 letter to the House Committee on Transportation \nand Infrastructure. This letter from national agriculture groups--\nincluding the American Farm Bureau Federation, American Soybean \nAssociation, National Association of Wheat Growers, National \nCattlemen's Beef Association, National Chicken Council, National Corn \nGrowers Association, National Cotton Council, National Council of \nFarmer Cooperatives, National Milk Producers Federation, National \nTurkey Federation, and USA Rice Federation explains the arbitrary \nnature of the current regulation: ``EPA's unusual threshold number of \n1,320 gallons has no basis in science or in normal tank sizes for \nagriculture.''\n  WRDA will require EPA, in consultation with the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, USDA, to conduct a study to determine the appropriate \nexemption level ``to not more than 6,000 gallons and not less than \n2,500 gallons, based on a significant risk of discharge to water.'' The \nintent of this provision is to ensure that EPA is not unnecessarily \nregulating on-farm fuel storage at capacities that do not pose a \nsignificant risk to harming water quality. If there is not a \nsignificant risk, then regulation is not justified. Compliance costs \nshould not be imposed where there is not a significant risk.\n  A March 2005 USDA report, Fuel/Oil Storage for Farmers and \nCooperatives, states, ``The SPCC rule will have a substantial cost of \ncompliance for the nation's farmers. A total compliance cost of almost \n$4.5 billion is projected. There is very little evidence of fuel/oil \nspill by farms.'' The report goes on to state that ``the 1,320 gallons \naggregated storage trigger is not supported by the survey data. \nCompliance at this level not only ignores the physical layouts of farm \nfuel storage but it also imposes a broad and extreme impact on the \nmajority of farms. Nearly 70 percent of all farms would have to comply, \nat an average aggregated tank cost of $9,215 and a total compliance \ncost of $4.5 billion.''\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record other \nletters of support for the FUELS Act from agricultural stakeholders, \nincluding letters from the American Farm Bureau Federation, USA Rice, \nNational Corn Growers Association, American Soybean Association, \nNational Cotton Council, National Association of Wheat Growers, \nNational Cattlemen's Beef Association, and National Council of Farmer \nCooperatives, NCFC.\n  This quote from the NCFC letter illustrates the points I have made, \nfurther explains the need for the legislation, and emphasizes the \nimportance of the EPA-USDA study in ensuring that we are not \nunnecessarily regulating capacity levels at which no significant risk \nof oil spills has been demonstrated.\n\n       Without question the members of the agricultural sector who \n     grow the nation's food and rely on surface and well water to \n     meet their families' and agricultural operations' needs are \n     highly motivated to ensure that their environmental practices \n     are sound. These producers work daily to ensure a safe \n     environment for their children and the communities in which \n     they live. As such, they can and do take very seriously their \n     responsibility, consistent with the intent and spirit of the \n     SPCC provisions, to properly manage the oil resources used on \n     their operations.\n       Row crop farms, ranches, livestock operations, farmer \n     cooperatives and other agribusinesses pose low risks for \n     spills and are often seasonal in nature. In fact, data on oil \n     spill on farms, cooperatives, and other agribusinesses is \n     almost nonexistent. The Agency has failed to provide data or \n     even anecdotal evidence of agricultural spills to justify \n     such a resource-intensive rulemaking for America's farmers \n     and ranchers. The risk of such spills from agriculture is \n     extremely low and there is little to no evidence that \n     providing greater flexibility through S. 496 will harm the \n     environment.\n\n  The Senate's approval of WRDA will be a huge victory for farmers \nthroughout Nebraska and across America, who should not face unnecessary \nregulations. The bipartisan provision regarding on-farm fuel storage \nraises the exemption levels for fuel storage capacity to better reflect \nthe spill risk and financial resources of farms. I appreciate my \ncolleagues' support and cooperation on this issue.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    July 25, 2012.\n     Hon. John Mica,\n     Chairman, House Committee on Transportation and \n         Infrastructure, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nick Rahall,\n     Ranking Member, House Committee on Transportation and \n         Infrastructure,, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Mica and Ranking Member Rahall: The \n     undersigned organizations would like to express our strong \n     support for H.R. 3158, the Farmers Undertake Environmental \n     Land Stewardship (FUELS) Act, H.R. 3158 would bring some much \n     needed clarity to agriculture on the confusing requirements \n     of the EPA's Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure \n     (SPCC) rule.\n       As you are aware, farming is an energy-intensive \n     profession. Producers need fuels stored on-farm for \n     everything from fueling mobile equipment to running \n     irrigation pumps. Many of these tanks are seasonal use and \n     stay empty much of the year due to the high cost of fuel and \n     the possibility of theft. Furthermore, EPA's unusual \n     threshold number of 1,320 gallons has no basis in science or \n     in normal tank sizes for agriculture.\n       In addition, EPA's bifurcation of the rule date (before and \n     after August 16, 2002) has brought immense, unneeded \n     confusion to the farming community as they try to determine \n     whether their current business model is the same that was in \n     operation prior to the 2002 date. The requirement to have \n     Professional Engineers (PEs) sign off on many SPCC plans adds \n     significant costs to the producer as well as the time spent \n     trying to find the limited number of PE's willing to work on \n     this rule in agricultural areas. It has already led to PEs \n     telling producers many things that aren't in the rule as they \n     try to oversell their product.\n       While the undersigned organizations welcome EPA's extension \n     of the deadline to May 10, 2013, that extension only applies \n     to farms in operation after August 16, 2002, further \n     confusing the industry. Furthermore, farms are still under \n     the costly requirements of providing secondary containment to \n     many seasonal-use tanks and developing complicated `spill \n     plans'. Despite pleas to the agency for compliance \n     assistance, they have been slow to respond, and despite \n     invitations\n\n[[Page S3420]]\n\n     to grower meetings, they have little funding for travel.\n       Thankfully, this Congress has the opportunity to ease this \n     burden on rural America. H.R. 3158 would provide realistic \n     threshold sizes for tank regulation at the farm level and \n     allow more farms to self-certify thus saving time and money \n     that would otherwise be spent in hiring PE's to sign the SPCC \n     plans.\n       H.R. 3158 is common sense legislation that the undersigned \n     strongly support. We urge the Committee and Congress to pass \n     the bill to help relieve undue regulation on farmers and \n     rural America.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Farm Bureau Federation, American Soybean \n           Association, Arkansas Farm Bureau Federation, Montana \n           Grain Growers Association, National Association of \n           Wheat Growers, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, \n           National Chicken Council, National Corn Growers \n           Association, National Cotton Council, National Council \n           of Farmer Cooperatives, National Milk Producers \n           Federation, National Turkey Federation, Pennsylvania \n           Farm Bureau Federation, USA Rice Federation.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   National Cotton\n\n\n                                           Council of America,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 2013.\n     Hon.

The National Cotton Council \n     (NCC) supports your efforts to advance S. 496, the FUELS Act.\n       Your bill will alleviate the costly regulatory burden on \n     farmers resulting from EPA's Spill Prevention, Control, and \n     Countermeasure (SPCC) Rule. EPA's unusual threshold number of \n     1,320 gallons has no basis in science or in normal tank sizes \n     for agriculture. S. 496 will raise that threshold to a more \n     realistic and practical level. Your bill will also allow more \n     farms to self-certify rather than hiring a qualified \n     professional engineer.\n       NCC is the central organization of the U.S. cotton industry \n     representing producers, ginners, merchants, cooperatives, \n     textile manufacturers, and cottonseed processors and \n     merchandisers in 17 states stretching from California to the \n     Carolinas. NCC represents producers who historically \n     cultivate between 10 and 14 million acres of cotton. Annual \n     cotton production, averaging approximately 20 million 480-lb \n     bales, is valued at more than $5 billion at the farm gate. \n     While a majority of the industry is concentrated in the 17 \n     cotton-producing states, the down-stream manufacturers of \n     cotton apparel and home-furnishings are located in virtually \n     every state. The industry and its suppliers, together with \n     the cotton product manufacturers, account for more than \n     230,000 jobs in the U.S. In addition to the cotton fiber, \n     cottonseed products are used for livestock feed and \n     cottonseed oil is used for food products ranging from \n     margarine to salad dressing. Taken collectively, the annual \n     economic activity generated by cotton and its products in the \n     U.S. economy is estimated to be in excess of $120 billion.\n       Again, the Council supports and appreciates your efforts on \n     this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 E.

Mark Pryor,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. James Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Pryor and Inhofe, On behalf of the National \n     Association of Wheat Growers (NAWG), we appreciate your \n     efforts to advance S. 496, the Farmers Undertake \n     Environmental Land Stewardship (FUELS) Act, and would urge \n     its inclusion in the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) \n     in the Senate. NAWG and its 22 affiliated state associations \n     work together to help protect and advance wheat growers' \n     interests.\n       As you are aware, farming is an energy-intensive \n     profession. Producers need fuels stored on-farm for \n     everything from fueling tractors to running irrigation pumps. \n     EPA's unusual 1,320 gallon regulatory threshold under the \n     Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) rule has \n     no basis in science or in normal tank sizes for agriculture. \n     S. 496 would raise the exemption threshold to 10,000 gallons, \n     which is a more reasonable level. It would also allow more \n     farms with aggregate storage capacity between 10,000--42,000 \n     gallons to self-certify rather than hiring a professional \n     engineer.\n       This common sense amendment to WRDA would ease the burden \n     on smaller producers, and we strongly encourage its adoption. \n     Thank you for your support on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Bing Von Bergen,\n\n                                                        President,\n     National Association of Wheat Growers.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 American Soybean Association,\n\n                                       St. Louis, MO, May 2, 2013.\n     Hon. James Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: I am writing on behalf of the American \n     Soybean Association in support of your efforts to include S. \n     496, the FUELS Act, during Senate consideration of the Water \n     Resources Development Act (WRDA). ASA represents all U.S. \n     soybean farmers on domestic and international issues of \n     importance to the soybean industry. ASA's advocacy efforts \n     are made possible through the voluntary membership in ASA by \n     over 21,000 farmers in 31 states where soybeans are grown.\n       New rules will take effect at the end of this fiscal year \n     that will require that oil storage facilities with a capacity \n     of over 1,320 gallons make structural improvements to reduce \n     the possibility of oil spills. The plan requires farmers to \n     construct a containment facility, like a dike or a basin, \n     which must retain 110 percent of the fuel in the container.\n       Most soybean farmers find these threshold levels to be \n     unacceptably low. Your amendment would raise the exemption \n     level to a more reasonable 10,000 gallons for a single \n     container, with farmers able to self-certify compliance if \n     aggregate storage capacity is between 10,000 to 42,000 \n     gallons.\n       ASA supports this amendment, and urges the Senate to adopt \n     it.\n       Thank you for your leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Danny Murphy,\n     ASA President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      May 2, 2013.\n     U.S. Senator Mark Pryor,\n     Dirksen Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     U.S. Senator James Inhofe,\n     Russell Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     U.S. Senator Deb Fischer,\n     Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators, The National Cattlemen's Beef Association \n     (NCBA) thanks you for your support of the Farmers Undertake \n     Environmental Land Stewardship (FUELS) Act (S. 496). The \n     FUELS Act eases the burden on farmers and ranchers in \n     implementing the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure \n     (SPCC) rule for farms. NCBA represents over 100,000 cattle \n     producers across the country as the nation's oldest and \n     largest trade association representing cattle ranchers. Our \n     members believe the FUELS Act is a common-sense measure that \n     balances environmental concerns with the burden and cost of \n     the regulation.\n       U.S. cattle ranchers are proud of their tradition as \n     stewards of our country's natural resources. Our members take \n     very seriously their commitment to protecting water quality \n     from events like fuel spills. They also believe however that \n     the economic burdens of developing spill plans certified by a \n     profession engineer outweigh the marginal benefit that would \n     come with requiring these plans on all farms. Compliance with \n     the rule will cost producers thousands of dollars at a time \n     when their budgets are very limited due to historic drought \n     and other economic factors. In addition, in the rural areas \n     there is an inadequate number of Professional Engineers \n     (P.E.S) to do the engineering work required. The FUELS Act \n     takes into account these considerations. It raises the \n     threshold for fuel storage capacity from a mere 1,320 gallons \n     to 10,000 gallons, which eases the burden on many smaller \n     operations. It also allows more operations to self-certify \n     their plans, eliminating the need for more P.E.s and the \n     increased cost.\n       The SPCC rule for farms will take effect October 1, 2013 \n     and therefore it is imperative that Congress act to prevent \n     this regulation from creating unnecessary financial burdens \n     on many farmers and ranchers. Thank you for your leadership \n     on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Scott George,\n                                                        President,\n     National Cattlemen's Beef Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              American Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Senator,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the American Farm Bureau \n     Federation, I would like to commend you for introducing \n     S.496, the Farmers Undertake Environmental Land Stewardship \n     Act. This legislation will help clarify the uncertainty \n     created by existing regulations and the Environmental \n     Protection Agency's (EPA) confusing and potentially costly \n     compliance assistance efforts. AFBF supports the legislation \n     and hopes it will receive strong bipartisan support.\n       Modern agricultural equipment requires a lot of energy. \n     EPA's current regulatory requirements for farms appear to \n     have little basis in science nor alignment with tank sizes \n     currently in use in agriculture. Equally confusing is EPA's \n     inability to provide clarity with regard to language that \n     asks farmers and ranchers to comply with Spill Prevention, \n     Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) regulations if the \n     operation could reasonably be expected to discharge oil to \n     waters of the U.S. As it stands, this ambiguous term might\n\n[[Page S3421]]\n\n     apply to features that farmers and ranchers would more likely \n     associate with dry land than water. It is therefore not \n     reasonable for EPA to include such an expectation if it has \n     done nothing to clarify a reasonable understanding of \n     jurisdiction waters that is consistent with congressional \n     intent and judicial case law\n       S. 496 is common-sense legislation that the Farm Bureau \n     strongly supports. We urge the Senate to pass this amendment \n     to help relieve undue regulation on farmers and rural \n     America.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Dale Moore.\n                                  ____\n\n     Senator Mark Pryor,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Jim Inhofe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Pryor and Inhofe: The USA Rice Federation \n     would like to express our strong support for S. 496, the \n     Farmers Undertake Environmental Land Stewardship Act (FUELS \n     Act), as an amendment to WRDA, the Water Resources \n     Development Act. This bill would bring some much needed \n     clarity to agriculture on the confusing requirements of the \n     EPA's Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) \n     rule.\n       As you are aware, farming is an energy-intensive \n     profession. Producers need fuels stored on-farm for \n     everything from fueling mobile equipment to running \n     irrigation pumps. Many of these tanks are in use seasonally \n     and stay empty much of the year due to the high cost of fuel \n     and the possibility of theft. Furthermore, EPA's threshold \n     number of 1,320 gallons has no basis in science or in normal \n     tank sizes for agriculture.\n       In addition, EPA's bifurcation of the rule date (before and \n     after August 16, 2002) has brought immense, unneeded \n     confusion to the farming community as they try to determine \n     whether their current business model is the same that was in \n     operation prior to the 2002 date. The requirement to have \n     Professional Engineers (PEs) sign off on many SPCC plans adds \n     significant costs to the producer as well as the time spent \n     trying to find the limited number of PE's willing to work on \n     this rule in agricultural areas.\n       The USA Rice Federation has joined other groups in our \n     support of EPA's extension of the deadline to May 10, 2013, \n     but that quickly approaching extension only applies to farms \n     in operation after August 16, 2002, further confusing the \n     industry. Furthermore, farms are still under the costly \n     requirements of providing secondary containment to many \n     seasonal-use tanks and developing complicated and expensive \n     `spill plans'. Despite pleas to the agency for compliance \n     assistance, they have been slow to respond, and despite \n     invitations to grower meetings, they have little funding for \n     travel.\n       Thankfully, the Senate has the opportunity to ease this \n     burden on rural America. S. 496 would provide realistic \n     threshold sizes for tank regulation at the farm level and \n     allow more farms to self-certify thus saving time and money \n     that would otherwise be spent in hiring PE's to sign the SPCC \n     plans. S. 496 is a piece of common sense legislation that we \n     strongly support. We urge the Senate to pass the bill to help \n     relieve undue regulation on farmers and rural America as a \n     part of the Water Resources Development Act.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Linda C.

Founded \n     in 1957, NCGA represents approximately 38,000 dues-paying \n     corn growers and the interests of more than 300,000 farmers \n     who contribute through corn checkoff programs in their \n     states. NCGA and its 48 affiliated state associations and \n     checkoff organizations work together to help protect and \n     advance corn growers' interests.\n       As you are aware, farming is an energy-intensive \n     profession.

Mark Pryor,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. James Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Pryor and Inhofe: On behalf of the more than \n     two million farmers and ranchers who belong to farmer \n     cooperatives, the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives \n     (NCFC) applauds your outstanding work to create sound \n     policies that maintain the economic and environmental health \n     of farms, ranches, and the rural communities where they \n     operate. This commitment is evident in S. 496, the Farmers \n     Undertake Environmental Land Stewardship Act (FUELS Act).\n       The SPCC rule was originally promulgated on December 11, \n     1973. In 1991, a proposed rule was initiated but floundered \n     for more than 11 years. In a move that caught many off guard, \n     the Agency published a final rule on July 17, 2002, amending \n     the SPCC regulations. This new rule became effective on \n     August 16, 2002, and applied to any facility--including \n     farms--with an aggregate of 1,320 gallons of oil on their \n     property in aboveground tanks of 55 gallons or greater, where \n     the spill might eventually reach navigable waters. That \n     rulemaking showed a lack of understanding of production \n     agriculture and as a result, required multiple revisions and \n     compliance deadline extensions that spanned over decade.\n       While we welcomed the extension of the compliance deadline \n     to May 10, 2013, that extension only applied to those \n     agricultural operations that currently have an SPCC plan or \n     new facilities that came into operation after the rule was \n     effective. Specifically, if a farm was in existence prior to \n     August 16, 2002, the compliance extension was not applicable \n     as these farms were supposed to be in compliance with the \n     SPCC rule and have a plan in place. EPA's bifurcation of the \n     rule date (before and after August 16, 2002) has brought \n     immense, unneeded confusion to the farming community as they \n     try to determine whether their current business structure was \n     in place prior to the 2002 date.\n       At the same time, the Agency has unfortunately struggled \n     with efforts to prepare guidance and mobilize specific \n     outreach activities in a timely manner in order to provide \n     the farming community with the understanding and necessary \n     tools to comply with the final rule.\n       Throughout the history and evolution of the SPCC rule, NCFC \n     has strived to maintain a constructive dialogue with EPA to \n     ensure that any agency action regulating oil spill prevention \n     and response take into account the uniqueness of the \n     agricultural industry; be based on sound science, need, and \n     identified risk; and that final regulations be clear and \n     allow time for education and implementation. While the Agency \n     has shown good faith in working to improve the SPCC rule for \n     agriculture, these efforts have proceeded in fits and starts.\n       Without question the members of the agricultural sector who \n     grow the nation's food and rely on surface and well water to \n     meet their families' and agricultural operations' needs are \n     highly motivated to ensure that their environmental practices \n     are sound. These producers work daily to ensure a safe \n     environment for their children and the communities in which \n     they live. As such, they can and do take very seriously their \n     responsibility, consistent with the intent and spirit of the \n     SPCC provisions, to properly manage the oil resources used on \n     their operations.\n       Row crop farms, ranches, livestock operations, farmer \n     cooperatives and other agribusinesses pose low risks for \n     spills and are often seasonal in nature. In fact, data on oil \n     spill on farms, cooperatives, and other agribusinesses is \n     almost nonexistent. The Agency has failed to provide data or \n     even anecdotal evidence of agricultural spills to justify \n     such a resource-intensive rulemaking for America's farmers \n     and ranchers. The risk of such spills from agriculture is \n     extremely low and there is little to no evidence that \n     providing greater flexibility through S. 496 will harm the \n     environment.\n       We strongly believe S. 496 will bring much needed clarity \n     to agriculture on the confusing requirements of the SPCC \n     rule. Specifically, it would provide realistic threshold \n     sizes for tank regulation at the farm level and allow more \n     farms to self-certify thus saving time and money that would \n     otherwise be spent in hiring Professional Engineers to \n     develop and sign the SPCC plans.\n       The FUELS Act is common-sense legislation and we strongly \n     encourage the Senate to support its passage as part of the \n     Water Resources Development Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Charles F.

CON. RES. 25\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise to make a few brief remarks. I \nwill leave most of those remarks until after I make another request for \nunanimous consent. I think I know where this unanimous consent request \nis headed. I am disappointed. I think we are on, I believe, day 51 at \nthis point as to the request that many of us have made in this Chamber \nto go back to regular order. Part of that regular order is after a \nbudget has passed for budget conferees to be appointed so we can \nresolve what I believe is the most important issue facing our Nation, \nthe question of our debt and deficit, so we can try to take the actions \nneeded to get this economy jump-started again. I will reserve most of \nmy time for the remarks afterward.\n  In the meantime, let me make this request:\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to \nconsideration of Calendar No. 33, H. Con. Res. 25; that the amendment \nwhich is at the desk, the text of S. Con. Res. 8, the budget resolution \npassed by the Senate, be inserted in lieu thereof; that H. Con. Res. \n25, as amended, be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table, the Senate insist on its amendment, \nrequest a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two \nHouses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of \nthe Senate, all with no intervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nconsent the Senator modify his request so that it not be in order for \nthe Senate to consider a conference report that includes tax increases \nor reconciliation instructions to increase taxes or raise the debt \nlimit.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator so modify?\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, simply as someone who has \nspent an awful lot of time on this issue, both sides need to be willing \nto comprise. We need to deal with both the revenue side of this \nchallenge as well as the entitlement reforms that are needed to make \nsure we can get our close-to-$17-trillion debt back under control. \nRecognizing the Senator's request would take part of the opportunity to \nreach that common ground off the table, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I simply want to again take a moment \nhere, 52 days after we spent until 5 o'clock in the morning debating a \nbudget--the budget that had over 100 amendments offered, a budget that \nhad amendments from both sides offered and rejected but also accepted. \nAmendments from both sides were accepted into this budget. It passed \nwith a majority.\n  I know there are some of my colleagues on the other side who say we \nshould go into the next step of this debate with certain things taken \noff the table. I do not understand how we are ever going to get to the \npoint which every economist from left to right has all agreed upon, \nthat we have to put this issue of lurching from one budget crisis to \nanother behind us.\n  The fact is there is an awful lot of consensus about what we need to \ndo. Starting back with the Simpson-Bowles report, then followed up by \nthe Gang of Six and the Domenici-Rivlin report, everyone agrees we need \nto do at least $4 trillion over the next 10 years. We don't have to \nsolve the whole problem, we just have to take a good step forward.\n  The remarkable thing is even lurching from crisis to crisis we are \nover half the way there. Depending on how you want to count, we have \ndone between $2.2 and $2.5 trillion of deficit reduction. That means we \nneed about $2 trillion more to be done for us to again not only provide \nthe boost to the American economy, not only to no longer make Congress \nthe object of more than late-night jokes about our inability to get \nthings done, not only to be able to ensure we have driven our debt-to-\nGDP ratio back down, headed in the right direction, but, perhaps most \nimportant, demonstrate to the American people that when we have an \nissue of this importance we can actually find that common ground.\n  To do that is going to require, candidly, everyone in this body and \nour friends down the hall in the House to be willing to give a little \nbit. That means we are going to have to find ways to generate \nadditional revenues. I believe, for one--I know sometimes many on my \nside disagree with me--we are going to have to find ways to reform our \nentitlement programs so the promise of Medicare and Social Security and \nMedicaid, some of the best initiatives ever put forward, are going to \nbe here 30 years from now.\n  But if we are going to reach that kind of compromise, it means the \nregular order has to proceed. It means we have to have these two very \ndifferent budgets, one passed by the House, one passed by the Senate, \nresolved through the regular order of a conference committee. If we do \nnot do this--if we do not do this--my fear is we are going to continue \nto do the kind of actions we have been on over the last number of \nmonths where we continue to cut back on that relatively small piece of \nFederal spending which is discretionary spending.\n\n  We are already seeing, in States such as Massachusetts and Minnesota \nand Virginia, the effects of sequestration where we have put forward a \npolicy that was viewed by everyone when it was originally thought up as \nso stupid, so beyond the pale, that no rational group of folks would \never allow it to come to pass. We are now 3 or 4 months into allowing \nthat to come to pass. While we have taken action on certain items such \nas relieving the challenge of our air traffic controllers, we have not \ntaken action on making sure the funds have been replaced for the 70,000 \nto 80,000-plus kids who have lost their Head Start funding. We have not \ntaken action to ensure the NIH cancer grants that are being cut, where \nwe have done multigrant years--where the preceding years of research \nare now going to be flushed because we cannot do the final year of the \ngrant, we cannot take action on that.\n  We have not taken action on the fact that now, as announced by the \nSecretary of Defense, while we have made some progress, where no longer \nare there 22 days of furloughs, we are now seeing 11 days of furloughs \nto our defense civilian employees. This is at a time that makes \nenormous challenges to their budgets but beyond that to the readiness \nof the men and women who defend our Nation.\n  We can continue this path on sequestration, frankly, retarding our \nability to keep our military ready, holding back our ability to have \nthe kind of economic recovery we would all like to see or we can allow \nthe regular order, a regular order that my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle called for, for the last couple of years, for us in this \nSenate to pass the budget.\n  We passed that budget. Now we need to take the next step in the \nprocess and appoint conferees and let us try to find that common ground \nbetween the House and Senate budget so we can address this issue of \ndebt and deficit, so we can demonstrate to the American people that we \ncan do our most basic responsibility, which is to make sure we pay our \nbills and operate the basic functions of government, and that we can do \nour job to restore the faith that this institution can work in a way \nthe Founders set up.\n  Unfortunately, we are not going to take that step today because now, \nfor the fifty-second day in a row, our Republican colleagues have \nobjected to the next step in regular order. I am greatly disappointed, \nbut I know I and other colleagues will come down on a regular basis and \ncontinue to make this request. My hope is that at some point in the not \ntoo distant future we can let the process continue, and we can get to \nthe hard work of resolving the differences of the House and Senate so \nwe can put this issue of lurching from budget crisis to budget crisis \nin the rearview mirror.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n[[Page S3423]]\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I thank the former Governor of \nVirginia. He knows how to balance a budget and how to have a strong \nbudget for the good people of this country. I share his frustration \nthat we are not able to bring this long-awaited budget that we finally \npassed in the Senate to conference with the House. I hope minds will \nchange and we will be able to get this done.\n  Again, I thank the Senator for his leadership and for a balanced \napproach on reducing the debt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/14/senate-section/article/S3423-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3423-S3424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I come to the floor today to speak on the importance \nof passing the Water Resources Development Act or, as we know it around \nWashington, the WRDA bill.\n  In my State they know it as a bill that is good for our harbors, \nrivers, and the flood protection we need in the Fargo-Moorhead area or, \nas I like to call it in Minnesota, the Moorhead-Fargo area.\n  The bill advances a critical front to protect the Red River of the \nnorth to Moorhead, MN, and Fargo, ND. I visited this region twice over \nthe last year, and I have been back literally every year I have been in \nthe Senate because of flood threats--these years more than ever.\n  This is literally an every-year occurrence now to the point where \npeople have major sandbag operations filled with volunteers, seniors, \nand people from the prisons. Everyone is working together, but there \nmust be a better way to do this. Just because we do it so well in North \nDakota and Minnesota and have such an incredible spirit of voluntarism \ndoesn't mean there is going to be one year where the flood is too great \nor that we should continue on this path when, in fact, we have the \nopportunity to have long-term flood protection.\n  The river has been above major flood stage 6 out of the last 8 years. \nIn 2009, the year of the record flood, the river rose to more than 40 \nfeet.\n  I will remind the Presiding Officer of the Grand Forks flood and what \nhappened there. It was literally just about an hour away from Fargo. So \nwe were that close to that happening in Fargo and Moorhead.\n  In Minnesota and North Dakota, the Red River doesn't divide us, it \nunites us. It is in that spirit of solidarity that we drive our efforts \nto help the Red River Basin. This year we were fortunate that the \nflooding was not nearly as severe as it had been projected. A week \nbefore the crest went down, it was projected to be the second biggest \nflood in history with the late snow.\n  In 2009 and 2010 homes and farms with ring dikes around them looked \nlike small islands floating in the floodwaters. If anyone thinks this \nlasts for a day or week, it literally lasts for months. Entire towns \ncreate ring dikes, and they can only get out of them with boats. That \nis what is happening near the Canadian border in Minnesota and North \nDakota. The town of Georgetown, MN, is threatened every time the Red \nRiver rises and the Buffalo River overflows.\n  The volunteer who was working at the emergency center--I went up to \nhim and said: It is so nice that you are making lunches for people. He \nsaid he lost his entire home.\n  I said: And you are here?\n  He said: Yes, this is the only thing I could think of to do to help \nother people who had the same bad experience as me. That is the spirit \nof voluntarism in our States.\n  I think we can do better. The annual threat of flooding in the Fargo-\nMoorhead area underscores the need for permanent flood protection. We \nknow about the devastating impact of floods. The flood diversion \nproject, which is authorized in the WRDA bill, is critical to safety \nand economic development.\n  I have enjoyed working with Congressman Peterson on flood diversion \nefforts, including retention, which he cares a lot about, and we did \nget some funding for that. I was able to get funding in the farm bill \ntoday to help with that. I have also worked with Senator Hoeven, \nSenator Heitkamp, and Senator Franken on this long-term project to have \nactual permanent solutions to our flooding project in Fargo and \nMoorhead.\n  We have a problem, and the WRDA bill is the beginning of a solution. \nAlso included in this bill is a Roseau River project, which is at a \ncritical point. The WRDA bill helps address flood protection for \nRoseau, MN. Roseau has recovered from a flood in 2002 that caused \nwidespread damage, but the area needs flood protection to reduce the \nflood stages in the city. The next phase of the plan will include a \ndiversion channel, a restriction structure, and two storage areas \ndesigned to remove the city from the regular 100-year regulatory \nfloodplain and reduce future flood damages by nearly 86 percent.\n  The WRDA bill also advances our Nation's water infrastructure, which \nis something the Presiding Officer knows a little bit about in \nMassachusetts. It is clear that our 21st-century economy demands 21st-\ncentury infrastructure, and we cannot afford to sit back any longer and \nallow it to crumble. No place knows this better than Minnesota.\n  I lived six blocks from that 35W bridge, which is an eight-lane \nhighway. One day, in the middle of a summer day, the bridge fell down \nin the middle of the Mississippi River. As I said that day, a bridge \njust shouldn't fall down in the middle of America, but it did.\n  We are seeing the same crumbling infrastructure and problems with \nmany of our ports across the country. Failure to take action will have \nconsequences no one likes. According to the American Society of Civil \nEngineers, inefficiencies in infrastructure are estimated to drive up \nthe cost of doing business by an estimated $430 billion, and that is \njust in this decade.\n  The civil engineers' 2013 report card gives our Nation's \ninfrastructure an overall D-plus grade. As someone who has taught \nstudents before, I think the Presiding Officer knows that is not a good \ngrade. Our inland waterways infrastructure, which includes our locks \nand dams on the Mississippi River, gets a D-minus, and our ports \nreceived a C grade. We cannot be satisfied with those grades.\n  When people hear ``ports'' they think of places such as \nMassachusetts, South Carolina, Florida, and California. But, in fact, \nthe Great Lakes--including Lake Superior, which we are so proud of in \nMinnesota--have very significant ports.\n  In fact, when I first came to the Senate, I was assigned to the \nCommerce Committee and somehow found myself on the oceans subcommittee. \nI remember sitting at my first meeting thinking: What am I doing here? \nI am on the oceans subcommittee. I wrote a note to the Senator from New \nJersey, Frank Lautenberg, that said: I am the only Senator on the \nsubcommittee who doesn't have an ocean. I kept the note he wrote back \nto me. The note said: It is easy, next year just come back and ask for \none.\n\n  Well, in fact, I found out since then that the oceans subcommittee \nincluded the Great Lakes so it gave me a platform to advocate for our \nGreat Lakes. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, which is so important \nto our ocean-bordering States, also includes the Great Lakes. The \nHarbor Maintenance Trust Fund collects $700 million each year more than \nit spends on dredging. In other words, it collects $700 million more \neach year than it spends on dredging and maintenance.\n  Meanwhile, our ports and navigation channels wait for basic \nmaintenance. We need to correct this disparity and ensure the funds are \nspent to address the needs of the shippers and ensure that the Great \nLakes system does not fall into further disrepair.\n  I was just up at the Port of Duluth-Superior to highlight the need \nfor dredging and maintenance on the Great Lakes. The Port of Duluth-\nSuperior is ranked among the top 20 ports in the U.S. by cargo tonnage. \nIt sees 40 million short tons of cargo and nearly 1,000 vessel visits \nevery year. I think people would be surprised by that since Minnesota \nhas lakes. In fact, we have 1 of the top 20 ports in the country.\n  We have 11,500 jobs that are dependent on cargo shipments in and out \nof the port. The port is critical to the economy of northeastern \nMinnesota where my dad was born and my grandpa worked as an iron ore \nminer. Guess what. That is how they got the iron ore out of Minnesota \nand out to the world.\n  It is critical that high-use ports like Duluth and Two Harbors get \ndredged so they can support the ships. It is vital\n\n[[Page S3424]]\n\nthat their trading partners throughout the Great Lakes system receive \nmaintenance as well. Both Duluth and Two Harbors, MN, ports are \nconsidered deep-water ports, so they come into a classification which \nhas tended to get the funding, but, in fact, the entire Great Lakes \nnavigation system is in trouble.\n  The backlog of sediment due to insufficient dredging is more than 18 \nmillion cubic yards and estimated at $200 million. When ships on the \nGreat Lakes have to ``light load''--having to reduce the amount of \ncargo they carry because channels are not deep enough--our economy \nsuffers.\n  At first some people might think: What does light loading mean? At \nthe end of 2012, the light loading to navigate the Soo Locks on the St. \nMary's River between Lake Superior and Lake Huron meant 10,000 tons of \ncargo could not be transported on the final voyage. Think of it. These \nare American goods that our workers produced, and we want them to make \nmore of it. Yet we literally cannot put them on the ships because we \nhave not maintained our ports the way we are supposed to.\n  The ships that are coming in cannot take the goods. They have to wait \nuntil the winter is done. That is what happened this year and has been \nhappening many years.\n  We are an export economy. America's way forward is to make goods \nagain, invent, and export to the world. Well, that is not going to \nhappen if we cannot get our goods to market. That is why I have been \nworking so closely with Senators from across the Great Lakes to address \nthis backlog. We have been able to make some progress.\n  I cosponsored an amendment with Senator Levin to direct the Secretary \nof the Army Corps to manage the Great Lakes navigation system as an \ninterconnected system. This would ensure that maintenance and dredging \nis done throughout the system. There is much more to do. I will \ncontinue to work with Senator Levin, Senator Stabenow, and other Great \nLakes Senators on this bill.\n  The WRDA bill will go a long way toward increasing the efficiency of \nthe shipping across the Great Lakes system, thereby strengthening the \neconomic standing of our agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and other \nindustries.\n  The bill also makes critical reforms to our Nation's rivers and \nwaterways. The inland waterway system in this country spans 38 States \nand handles approximately one-half of the inland waterway freight. \nFarmers and businesses in my State transport soybeans, corn, and other \ncommodities from Minnesota to other terminals in the South. From there, \nships are loaded and the commodities are eventually delivered to \ntrading partners.\n  Again, if we want to produce and export to the world, we have to have \nthe transportation system that supports it. With many maintenance and \nconstruction projects years overdue, the inland waterways are in dire \nneed of major rehabilitation. The Inland Waterways Trust Fund, which \nfunds these projects, is in steady decline. If we don't make the Inland \nWaterways Trust Fund sustainable, the industries that are so heavily \ndependent on the inland waterways will suffer, and this means jobs \nsuffer.\n  I cosponsored the RIVER Act with Senator Casey and Senator Landrieu \nto help move forward major construction projects on the inland waterway \nsystem. That bill is also supported by Senator Lamar Alexander. It is a \nbipartisan bill, and it includes much needed rehabilitation of the \nlocks and dams along the Mississippi River.\n  This bill includes a number of reforms to the project management \nprocess that will ensure that waterway projects are completed on time \nand minimize cost overruns.\n  I also, by the way, support the amendment to increase the inland \nwaterways user fee. I am a cosponsor of that amendment. Let me \nemphasize that the users who pay this fee have asked for it. We have a \nsituation where the industries are willing to pay more so we can \nimprove the locks and dams so they can get their goods to market. That \nis what is going on here. They understand we are having budget issues, \nand they are willing to pay a higher fee to pay for the changes.\n  Industry partners from farmers to shippers to companies, such as \ncargo companies in my State, strongly support this user fee \nincrease. The increase was, in fact, their idea. They realized that the \ngovernment wasn't going to fund these and that they were having trouble \ndoing business, and they have agreed to pay for this increased fee. To \nme, it is the perennial no-brainer that we get this done. They know \nthis modest change would go a long way to making our Nation's rivers \nand waterways viable for years to come.\n\n  While the fee increase will not advance, sadly, in the WRDA bill \nbecause it is considered a tax provision, it sends an important message \nthat industry and shippers are at the table and volunteering more to \nhelp build the infrastructure our economic future requires. We plan on \nadvancing this part of the river act in another bill--in tax reform or \nstanding on its own--because we think it is so important to be able to \nfund these improvements to the locks.\n  Finally, in Minnesota, the fishing and boating industries contribute \naround $4 billion to our State's economy each year. Sometimes I like to \ntease people and ask them how much money do they think we spend on \nworms in Minnesota every year. Well, it is literally tens of millions \nof dollars. People come to our State and buy worms and bait and other \nforms of fishing tackle because of their importance to our economy. In \nfact, for last weekend's Minnesota fishing opener, sadly, cold and ice \ncovered many lakes, but people were still out there looking for that \nempty hole where there wasn't ice so they could put their line into the \nwater.\n  In Minnesota, we also know how important it is to address invasive \nspecies problems, especially when they threaten our lakes and rivers. \nIn our State the problem of Asian carp is literally swimming and \njumping into our lives. Anyone who hasn't seen the YouTube video should \nlook at it. You can see Asian carp literally jumping out of the water \nand hitting fishermen in the head. We are very concerned because we \nhave seen problems with them downriver in southern Minnesota. They are \ncoming our way, and we do not want them to ruin our way of life in \nMinnesota, nor do we want them to hurt our jobs and our $4 billion \nfishing and gaming industry.\n  I believe we need an ``all-of-the-above'' solution to this challenge \nthat includes research, carp barriers, as well as authority to close \nthe Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock. I am very glad the provision was \nincluded to allow for greater coordination between Federal agencies \nwhen it comes to Asian carp, and this also includes rivers and not just \nthe Great Lakes.\n  So we are continuing to work on this bill when it comes to Asian carp \nand other invasive species, but I think there are some other good \nprovisions in this bill as well.\n  I wish to commend Senators Boxer and Vitter for their great work to \nput together this bipartisan legislation. I support its passage, from \nfighting to protect towns from flooding to critical waterway \ninfrastructure. This legislation is vital to our economy, to our \nenvironment, to our cities, and to our towns. I am excited to be a part \nof it. I hope my colleagues support it and we can get this done.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/14/senate-section/article/S3424-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3424-S3425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             25TH ANNIVERSARY OF KENTUCKY BUS CRASH TRAGEDY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to commemorate a sad and \ntragic event in Kentucky history that happened 25 years ago today: on \nMay 14, 1988, a horrific bus crash occurred on I-71 near Carrollton, \nKY. Twenty-seven people were killed, 24 of them children, and 34 were \ninjured when a drunk driver traveling in the wrong direction hit the \nbus. It remains the worst drunk-driving crash in American history.\n  On this day 25 years ago, the Radcliff First Assembly of God Church \nin Radcliff, KY, organized a youth trip to a nearby amusement park, and \ndrove 170 miles to Cincinnati in the church bus. The bus was full with \n67 passengers. After a fun day of roller coasters and ice cream, at \n10:55 that night, on the return trip, a drunk driver in a pickup truck \ntraveling north in the southbound lane of I-71 struck the church bus \ndirectly head-on.\n\n[[Page S3425]]\n\n  The impact ruptured the bus's 60-gallon gasoline tank, starting a \nfire which reached 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit and filled the bus with \nsmoke. With the front door blocked by collision damage, and no \nemergency exits in the windows or roof, most of the survivors exited \nthrough a single emergency exit at the rear of the bus. Of the 40 \nsurvivors, only 6 escaped uninjured. Many others suffered severe burns \nand other injuries. And 27 lives were lost in that crash.\n  I want to extend my gratitude to the Kentucky State Police, who not \nonly provided rescue efforts at the scene and crash reconstruction \nanalysis afterwards, but were also the lead investigative agency for \nthis tragedy, following the case through to the prosecution phase. \nCurrent Kentucky State Police Commissioner Rodney Brewer was one of the \ninvestigators who worked on the challenging case.\n  Remembrances and observances in honor of the victims are happening in \nKentucky today, where dozens of families remain grief stricken by the \nsenseless loss of their beloved child. Those who survived the crash are \nstill haunted by what happened. I wish to express my deepest sympathies \nfor the victims' families, the survivors, first responders, and all \nthose who were touched by this tragedy. The people of Kentucky stand \nwith you today and share your sorrow.\n  If any good can be said to have come from this awful event, it is \nthat it directed national attention on driving safety, the dangers of \ndrunk driving, and safety requirements in buses. Kentucky took the lead \nin responding to this tragedy by requiring school buses to have more \nemergency exits than the Federal standard and instituting stricter \ndrunken driving laws.\n  Madam President, I know my colleagues in the Senate join me today in \npaying tribute to the 27 people who were killed in this bus crash, to \ntheir families who grieve today, to the surviving passengers who must \nstill live with the nightmare of what happened, to their families, to \nthe law enforcement officers and first responders who assisted in \nrescuing the passengers, and to every Kentuckian whose life was altered \nby the events of that fateful day.\n  Even today, 27 people are killed every day in America as a result of \ndrunken driving. In 2011, drunk driving killed 9,878 on America's roads \nand injured over 300,000. I believe one way we can honor the memories \nof the victims of this terrible accident is to continue to speak out \nagainst the dangers of drunk driving and work towards its elimination. \nNo family should have to endure the suffering that so many Kentucky \nfamilies did on this day 25 years ago.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the names of the 27 \ncrash victims be included in the Record following my remarks. I yield \nthe floor.\n  There being no objection, the names of the 27 victims of the tragedy \nof May 14, 1988, were entered into the Record as follows:\n\n       Jennifer Ann Arnett, Cynthia Anne Atherton, Sandy Brewer, \n     Joshua Conyers, Mary Catheryn Daniels, Julie Ann Earnest, \n     Kashawn Etheredge, Shannon Rae Fair, Dwailla Fischel, Richard \n     Keith Gohn, Lori Kathleen Holzer, Charles ``Chuck'' Kytta, \n     Anthony Marks.\n       April Mills, Phillip Lee Morgan, Tina Michelle Mustain, \n     William J.

Madam President I wish to call attention to the \nplight of the Baha'i community and the atrocious human rights situation \nin the Islamic Republic of Iran. Today marks the fifth year Fariba \nKamalabadi, Jamaloddin Khanjani, Afif Naemi, Saeid Rezaie, Behrouz \nTavakkoli, and Vahid Tizfahm have been behind bars in Iran due to their \nfaith. These six individuals, along with Mahvash Sabet, imprisoned 2 \nmonths earlier, make up the ``Yaran-I-Iran,'' or Friends of Iran, which \nis the former leadership group of the Baha'i community of Iran. We must \nnot let up on our efforts to defend the Baha'i community until the \nIranian Government's intensifying persecution comes to an end.\n  Iran outlawed Baha'i institutions in 1983, leading to the \nestablishment of an ad hoc leadership group to meet the basic spiritual \nand social needs of the Baha'i community of Iran. In August 2010, the \nGovernment of Iran sentenced the Yaran to 20-year prison terms on the \nabsurd charges of ``spying for Israel, insulting religious sanctities, \npropaganda against the regime and spreading corruption on earth.''\n  The Baha'i faith is an independent world religion that began in 19th-\ncentury Persia. Its central tenets include unity, peace, and \nunderstanding. The Baha'is are currently the largest non-Muslim \nminority in Iran, numbering some 300,000 members, and the Baha'i faith \nis one of the world's fastest growing religions with more than 5 \nmillion followers worldwide. Since the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the \nBaha'is have been a target of systematic government-sponsored \npersecution. Roughly 200 Baha'is in Iran have been killed by government \nauthorities since 1978 and more than 650 Baha'is have been arrested \nsince 2005 alone.\n  In May 2011, the government conducted raids on the Baha'i Institute \nof Higher Education, an informal learning system created by the Baha'i \ncommunity in response to the exclusion of Baha'is from universities. \nSeveral educators were arrested and detained. Seven of them--Mahmoud \nBadavam, Noushin Khadem, Vahid Mahmoudi, Kamran Mortezaie, Farhad \nSedghi, Riaz Sobhani, and Ramin Zibaie--were sentenced to 4 and 5-year \nprison terms, although Vahid Mahmoudi has since been released. Since \nOctober 2011, four more BIHE instructors were imprisoned.\n  The 2013 U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom Report \nstated that ``during the past year, the already poor religious freedom \nconditions continued to deteriorate, especially for religious \nminorities, in particular for Baha'is.'' On February 28, 2013, the U.N. \nSpecial Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran reported that there were 110 Baha'is currently \nimprisoned in Iran solely for practicing their faith. Baha'is in Iran \nare restricted from filling public and private jobs, denied business \nlicenses, and excluded from university. In recent years, the state-\nsponsored media in Iran embarked on a systematic campaign to demonize \nand incite hatred against Baha'is through the use of false and \noffensive propaganda pieces. An increasing amount of personal property \nhas been confiscated, an increasing number of Baha'i-owned businesses \nhave been vandalized and attacked, and an increasing number of Baha'i \ncemeteries have been desecrated over the past year across the country.\n  Despite being bound to numerous international treaties, the Iranian \nGovernment continues to persecute those who seek to exercise their \nfreedom of expression, thought, conscience, and religion. As Americans, \nwe honor our fundamental rights and freedoms by speaking out for the \nrights and freedoms of the Baha'is and all others who are oppressed in \nIran. And it is incumbent on the Senate to reveal the truth about the \nsituation of the Baha'i community in Iran and take steps to eradicate \nthe violence and injustice.\n  Illinois is home to the world-renowned Baha'i Temple, so the plight \nof Baha'is in Iran holds special significance for our citizens. I am \nproud to have joined with my Illinois colleague, Senator Durbin, in \nintroducing S. Res. 75, a resolution that condemns the Government of \nIran for its state-sponsored persecution of its Baha'i minority and its \ncontinued violation of the International Covenants on Human Rights. \nToday, we reaffirm our solidarity with the faithful Baha'is in Iran who \nare subject to discrimination, detention, or worse solely for their \nbeliefs and views. It is my hope that S. Res. 75 will bring the \npersecution of Baha'is and the issue of human rights in Iran to the \nforefront of the international agenda.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, it has been 5 years since the Iranian \nregime arrested and imprisoned seven members of the Baha'i community's \nad hoc leadership group. Today I rise to mark this sad anniversary and \nto remind folks of the persecution that religious minorities continue \nto face in Iran.\n  The Baha'i faith was founded in Iran during the 19th century. It is \nan independent religion not a sect of Islam\n\n[[Page S3426]]\n\nand it rejects violence. The Baha'i faith is practiced today by more \nthan 5 million people around the world, roughly 300,000 of whom still \nlive in Iran.\n  But rather than celebrate its own religious history, the Iranian \nregime considers the Baha'i faith to be a heresy and brutally represses \nits practitioners. The regime routinely seizes personal property from \nmembers of the Baha'i community, denies them access to education and \nemployment opportunities, and detains them based solely on their \nreligious beliefs. According to some reports, more than 600 Baha'is \nhave been arrested since 2004. The American Baha'i community counts 115 \nBaha'is currently in Iranian prisons and another 437 awaiting trial, \nappeal, sentencing, or for their sentence to begin.\n  Five years ago, the Iranian regime arrested seven leaders of the \nBaha'i community--Fariba Kamalabadi, Jamaloddin Khanjani, Afif Naeimi, \nSaeid Rezaie, Mahvash Sabet, Behrouz Tavakkoli, and Vahid Tizfahm--and \ndetained them in Iran's notorious Evin prison. Iranian leaders accused \nthe seven of espionage for Israel, insulting religious sanctities, and \npropaganda against the Islamic Republic.\n  These seven have since faced sham trials in kangaroo courts. One of \ntheir lawyers, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, reported \ndifficultly establishing basic, meaningful access to counsel. She also \nstated that the regime had no evidence against the accused and that \ntheir trial was riddled with irregularities. Despite these concerns the \nregime sentenced all seven to 20 years in prison in 2010.\n  I and many others found these sentences unconscionable and said so at \nthe time. Imagine being sentenced to prison because your faith \nrecognized the divine origin of the world's great religions, the \noneness of the human race, and the equality of men and women. Imagine \nlosing 20 years of your life because somebody objected to your personal \nbeliefs.\n  For the Iranian regime, I am sorry to say, this is more business as \nusual. This religious persecution is hardly limited to the Baha'is \neither. In fact, since 1999 the State Department has designated Iran as \na ``country of particular concern'' for its human rights record. The \nU.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom's 2012 annual report \ncited the regime for engaging in ``systematic, ongoing, and egregious \nviolations of religious freedom, including prolonged detention, \ntorture, and executions based primarily or entirely upon the religion \nof the accused.'' The report goes on to state that ``even the \nrecognized non-Muslim religious minorities protected under Iran's \nconstitution--Jews, Armenian and Assyrian Christians, and \nZoroastrians--faced increasing discrimination, arrests, and \nimprisonment.''\n  The Iranian regime must stop its assault on religious expression and \nfreedom of conscience, and there is no better day to do so than this \nsad and dubious anniversary. I call upon Iran's rulers to immediately \nrelease the seven Baha'i leaders and all other prisoners held on \naccount of their beliefs. I also want to urge my colleagues to join me \nin cosponsoring S. Res. 75, introduced by Senators Kirk and Durbin. \nThis resolution condemns the Iranian regime for its state-sponsored \npersecution of its Baha'i minority and for its continued violation of \nthe International Covenants on Human Rights, to which Iran is a party.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/14/senate-section/article/S3426-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  RECOGNIZING THE MAINE TROOP GREETERS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, on May 18, Americans will join \ntogether in observance of Armed Forces Day to thank the men and women \nof our military for their courageous and dedicated service to our \nNation. This occasion has a special significance in my home State, as \nit marks the 10th anniversary of a remarkable group of patriots called \nthe Maine Troop Greeters.\n  The story of the Maine Troop Greeters is that of hundreds of \npatriotic citizens who, since May of 2003, have gathered at Bangor \nInternational Airport to greet every single flight carrying our \nmilitary personnel across the Atlantic to Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, or \nother overseas assignments or bringing them home. Whether these flights \nland at Bangor in the light of day or the dark of night, in fair \nweather or foul, the Troop Greeters are there with cookies and coffee, \ncheers and songs, and handshakes and hugs.\n  It is the story of more than 1.3 million servicemembers and nearly \n350 military dogs who have landed in Bangor on some 6,700 flights. \nWithout exception, our troops have been astonished, overwhelmed, \nencouraged, and most of all, welcomed and thanked by this spontaneous \noutpouring of gratitude and respect.\n  Bangor's tradition of greeting troop flights began long before 2003. \nOn a frigid March morning in 1991, a large group of grateful Mainers \ncame to the airport to welcome home returning troops from Operation \nDesert Storm. One of those soldiers, MSG Kevin Tillman of Kentucky, \nborrowed a saxophone from a high school musician and performed a spine-\ntingling rendition of our national anthem. It was a moment that \nelectrified America.\n  To underscore the powerful and lasting impact of the Maine Troop \nGreeters, Master Sergeant Tillman returned to Bangor in 2011, 20 years \nafter that unforgettable moment, to perform in concert with our high \nschool band.\n  I am often asked by my Senate colleagues why this Troop Greeter \nphenomenon is so powerful in Bangor. It is not just that the city I am \nproud to call home is the location of the easternmost airport in the \nUnited States, a former Air Force base that can accommodate \ntransatlantic flights. For many of our troops, Bangor is either the \nlast American soil they touch upon deployment or the first they touch \nupon their return.\n  That simple answer only scratches the surface. The phenomenon of the \nMaine Troop Greeters is not merely a matter of geography and facilities \nbut the manifestation of a caring community and of the American spirit. \nThroughout our Nation's history, young Americans have left the comfort \nand security of home to defend our freedom and to extend the blessing \nof freedom to others. And behind patriots in uniform have stood \npatriots at home to honor their service.\n  The Maine Troop Greeters are individuals acting out of personal \nconviction, but their efforts are magnified by the support of local \nbusinesses, civic organizations, and the Bangor International Airport. \nTheir generosity strengthens the spirit of volunteerism that is a core \nAmerican value.\n  One of the principles of true service is that it is not something \nthat is done only when convenient but a commitment sincerely made and \nfaithfully kept. That is the principle that guides our men and women in \nuniform and that guides those who honor and support them.\n  It has been said that it is easy to take for granted that which has \nnever been taken away. Thanks to the veterans who served in the past, \nAmerica has never lost its freedom. Thanks to those who serve today, we \nnever will. Armed Forces Day reminds us of the high price some pay for \nwhat we all cherish, and the Maine Troop Greeters exemplify the \ngratitude all Americans share.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/14/senate-section/article/S3426-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3426-S3427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RECOGNIZING THE MAINE SCHOOL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am delighted to commend the \nMaine School of Science and Mathematics, MSSM, of Limestone, ME, on \nbeing recognized among the best high schools in our country. MSSM was \nrecently awarded an outstanding 13th-place ranking among more than \n21,000 public high schools included in the 2013 U.S. News and World \nReport national rankings on school achievement. I would like to engage \nmy fellow Senator from Maine in saluting this accomplishment, which \nmakes us both proud.\n  This award recognizes that MSSM students achieve at the highest level \nacademically. MSSM is a top-performing school on State-required \nassessments, and staff at the school use assessments throughout the \nacademic year as a tool for improving and customizing instruction. The \nschool's faculty works closely with students to forge a strong school \ncommunity where students are encouraged to pursue their interests.\n\n[[Page S3427]]\n\n  I applaud the students who are working hard to excel and in doing so, \nmaking their families, communities, and State proud. I also want to \ncommend the administrators, teachers, and staff of MSSM who are \nsucceeding in their mission to generate confidence and momentum for \nlearning. They are making a difference in the lives of their students \nand are helping them reach their full potential as independent, \nresponsible learners and engaged citizens.\n  I am pleased that the U.S. News and World Report has recognized the \nachievements of the Maine School of Science and Mathematics, and I \ncongratulate the entire community for this outstanding achievement. \nHaving grown up in Northern Maine, I could not be more proud of what \nthese students and this faculty have achieved.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the comments \nof the senior senator from Maine. I too am proud to congratulate the \nMaine School of Science and Mathematics, MSSM, for its 13th-place \nshowing in this year's U.S. News and World Report on high school \nrankings. In addition, U.S. News ranked MSSM first in New England and \nthird in the United States among magnet schools. This impressive \nachievement is a testament to the exceptional caliber of the school's \nstudents, faculty, and staff.\n  Founded by the Maine State Legislature in 1995, MSSM is a residential \nmagnet school that specializes in science and mathematics education. It \nis the only school of its kind in New England. MSSM serves a diverse \nstudent body made up of young people from across the State of Maine and \naround the world. Graduates of MSSM are prepared for rigorous \npostsecondary programs and have gone on to notable success in fields as \ndiverse as academia, engineering, public service, and the military.\n  It bears mentioning that when the school was proposed during my first \nyear as governor, I was opposed to funding it for budgetary reasons. \nDuring a time of fiscal restraint, I was uncertain of the wisdom in \ndevoting funds to a new school. Boy, was I wrong--MSSM has become a \nreal gem, and I have never been so glad to have been wrong.\n  The U.S. News ranking reflects the school's ongoing commitment to \nexcellence. Just last year, MSSM entered into a learning partnership \nwith the University of Maine at Presque Isle that affords MSSM students \nthe opportunity to earn college credit for select coursework. This \ncollaborative approach is precisely the kind of innovative thinking \nthat forges connections between high schools and postsecondary \ninstitutions and ensures that students are able to envision clear \neducational pathways for themselves.\n  The world-class education offered in Limestone would not be possible \nwithout the talented teachers, administrators, and staff who have \nfostered a genuine community of learning and exploration and who have \ndedicated themselves to educating the next generation of innovative and \nwell-rounded scholars. The foundation of any successful school lies in \nthe dedication of its staff, and I commend the many individuals who \nlead and support this outstanding institution.\n  In its 18 years of existence, MSSM has become a point of pride for \nthe residents of Limestone and for the whole State of Maine. I am \ndelighted to offer my hearty congratulations to all members of the MSSM \ncommunity, and I look forward to hearing of the school's continued \nsuccess in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/14/senate-section/article/S3427-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMENDING UTAH'S ACADEMY NOMINEES\n\n Mr. LEE.

Madam President, I wish to honor the remarkable \nservice of a great Pennsylvanian to our Nation's defense and its \nveterans. Maj. Nathan Kline, U.S. Air Force, Retired, served for nearly \nhalf a century in our country's Armed Forces. After enlisting in the \nU.S. Army Air Forces in 1942, he served in highly hazardous positions \nas a bombardier and navigator on a B-26 Marauder. His 65 air combat \nmissions included the D-day invasion and the Battle of the Bulge. \nIncredibly, he survived after his aircraft was shot down twice during \nthe campaign in Europe. For his actions, he earned the Distinguished \nFlying Cross and 10 Air Medals.

He continued \nhis military service in the Reserves while working in support of the \nveterans' community. His advocacy on behalf of veterans and their \nfamilies became a lifelong endeavor. Major Kline was a founding member \nof the Lehigh Valley Military Affairs Council. In this capacity, he \nraised funds to provide scholarships to deployed servicemembers' \nchildren, managed assembly and shipment of care packages and helped \nveterans to find employment.\n  In honoring Major Kline, we recognize his commitment to service \nduring times of war and peace.\n\n[[Page S3428]]\n\n  As Congress confronts the dual challenges of ensuring our national \nsecurity and putting our fiscal house in order, it must remember its \nprofound responsibility to keep our Nation safe and care for its \nveterans.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to require \ncourses of education provided by public institutions of higher \neducation that are approved for purposes of the All-Volunteer Force \nEducational Assistance Program and Post-9/11 Educational Assistance to \ncharge veterans tuition and fees at the in-State tuition rate, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, today, as Chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am proud to introduce the Veterans' \nEducational Transition Act of 2013.\n  My colleague and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, Senator Burr, joins me in introducing this important \nlegislation.\n  The Department of Defense estimates that approximately 250,000 to \n300,000 servicemembers will separate annually for the next 4 years. \nThat is more than one million brave men and women who will face the \nharsh reality of transitioning back to civilian life. Many of them will \nelect to further their education by using the most lucrative benefit \nafforded to them since WWII--the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Since 2009, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, VA, has paid nearly 1 million Post-9/11 \nGI Bill beneficiaries more than $28 billion.\n  The Post-9/11 GI Bill stands as a testament of our willingness to \ninvest in our newest generation of veterans. Unfortunately, this \ninvestment often falls short of what they need to complete a post-\nsecondary education and successfully transition back to civilian life. \nThey deserve better.\n  Given the nature of our Armed Forces, servicemembers have little to \nno say as to where they serve and where they reside during their \nmilitary service. Thus, when transitioning servicemembers consider what \neducational institution they want to attend, many of them choose a \nschool in their home State or a State where they previously served.\n  I have heard from too many veterans that many of these public \neducational institutions consider them out-of-State students. Given \nthat the Post-9/11 GI Bill only covers in-State tuition and fees for \npublic educational institutions, these veterans are left to cover the \ndifference in cost between the in-State tuition rate and the out-of-\nState tuition rate. In some States, this difference can be more than \n$20,000 per year. As a result, many of our Nation's veterans must use \nloans to cover this difference and in the process become indebted with \nlarge school loans that will take years to pay off.\n  I applaud the States that have taken initiative to assist our \nveterans by recognizing them as in-State students for purposes of \nattending a public educational institution. Yet, there are too many \nStates that still require transitioning veterans to meet stringent \nresidency requirements before they can be considered in-State students. \nRecently separated veterans may not be able to meet such requirements \nbecause of their military service, and once enrolled, they cannot \nlegally establish residency because of their status as full-time \nstudents.\n  The Veterans Educational Transition Act of 2013 would require States, \nas a condition for course approval under the Post-9/11 GI Bill or \nMontgomery GI Bill, to recognize certain veterans and their dependents \nusing these education benefits as in-State students for purposes of \nattending a public institution. The veteran must be within 2 years from \nthe date of discharge, and the individual using the benefit must live \nin the State while attending the school.\n  This legislation would help our brave men and women who have \nsacrificed so much in defense of our country transition to the civilian \nworkforce by giving them a fair shot at attaining their educational \ngoals without incurring an additional financial burden simply because \nthey chose to serve their country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 944\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe treatment of church pension plans, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today my colleague Senator Portman and I \nare introducing this legislation, which refines the language included \nin a previous bill, S. 3532, introduced in the 112th Congress by \nSenator Hutchison and myself.\n  Our goal is to ensure the retirement security of our Nation's clergy, \nchurch lay workers, and their families by resolving an unfortunate \napplication of our current pension rules on church pension \nbeneficiaries.\n  Churches and synagogues established some of the first pension plans \nin the country, some dating back to the 18th century, and they are \ndesigned to ensure that our pastors and lay staff have adequate \nresources during their retirement years.\n  Church pensions are critically important compensation plans that help \nsupport over one million clergy members across the country in their \nretirement--particularly those who dedicated their careers to serving \nin economically disadvantaged congregations.\n  Church plans developed structures and mechanisms that reflect the \ndiffering church polities they serve and their unique status has been \nrecognized in law. However, recent IRS regulations governing 403(b) \npension programs and legislative changes have resulted in uncertainty \nand compliance issues for church pension plans.\n  The Church Plan Clarification Act is straightforward, non-\ncontroversial, and has bipartisan support. I hope we can work quickly \nto provide clarity for these distinctive plans by enacting this \nlegislation and thereby ensuring that those who dedicate their lives to \nreligious service are not inappropriately and unfairly disadvantaged.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 952\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
