Res. 8, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 8) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for \n     fiscal year 2014, revising the appropriate budgetary levels \n     for fiscal year 2013, and setting forth the appropriate \n     budgetary levels for fiscal years 2015 through 2023.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Mikulski) amendment No. 431, to establish a \n     deficit-neutral reserve fund to require equal pay policies \n     and practices.\n       Reid (for Ayotte/Thune) amendment No. 158, to prohibit the \n     consideration of a budget resolution that includes revenue \n     increases while the civilian unemployment rate is above 5.5 \n     percent, the administration's prediction for the unemployment \n     rate without the stimulus.\n       Reid (for Cruz) amendment No. 202, to establish a deficit-\n     neutral reserve fund to provide for the repeal of the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and \n     Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and to encourage \n     patient-centered reforms to improve health outcomes and \n     reduce health care costs, promoting economic growth.\n       Reid (for Murray) amendment No. 439, to amend the deficit-\n     neutral reserve fund for tax relief to provide tax relief for \n     low and middle-income families.\n       Reid (for Crapo) amendment No. 222, to establish a deficit-\n     neutral reserve fund to repeal the tax increases enacted \n     under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that \n     were imposed on low-and middle-income Americans.\n       Reid (for Shaheen/Stabenow) amendment No. 438, to establish \n     a deficit-neutral reserve fund to protect women's access to \n     health care, including primary and preventative health care, \n     family planning and birth control, and employer-provided \n     contraceptive coverage, such as was provided under the \n     Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148).\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, from now until 11 a.m., there will be \nconversation on the floor. At 11 a.m., we will have six rollcall votes. \nThe first vote will be 15 minutes and after that the votes will be 10 \nminutes each, as we said yesterday, and I enforced it. When the time is \nup, we are closing the vote. If the Republicans are not here, too bad; \nif the Democrats are not here, too\n\n[[Page S2236]]\n\nbad. We are going to have a lot of votes today, so everyone should make \nsure they are here. Understand if you are not here in time, the clerk \nhas been asked to turn the vote in.\n  After we complete the six rollcall votes starting at 11 a.m., there \nwill be 2 hours of debate remaining on the resolution. Therefore, \nunless something untoward happens, the vote-arama is expected to begin \nat 3 p.m. this afternoon. I hope everyone will understand we have had \nabout 400 amendments that have been filed. We are not going to vote on \n400 amendments. The average is usually between 25 and 35 votes. So \neveryone should understand that is about where we should wind up.\n  Everyone is going to be tired. The two managers have worked very hard \non this for a long time, so be considerate of their time, their \nthoughts, and their efforts also.\n\n\n                     Measure Placed on the Calendar\n\n  Mr. President, S. 649 is at the desk and due for a second reading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 649) to ensure that all individuals who should \n     be prohibited from buying a firearm are listed in the \n     national instant criminal background check system and require \n     a background check for every firearm sale, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object to any further proceedings with \nrespect to the bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection having been heard, the \nmeasure will be placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  Under the previous order, the leadership time is reserved.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 11 a.m. will be equally \ndivided and controlled between the two managers or their designees.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to thank Ranking Member Sessions \nonce again for another good day of vigorous debate. There are clearly \nsome differences between us in the Senate, but all our constituents \nbenefit from having those views laid out and expressed clearly. I \nappreciate all he is doing to help us move along as well as have the \ngood debate we are having.\n  Yesterday, the Senate did vote to reject the idea that balancing the \nbudget by an arbitrary date should come before middle-class families \nand broad-based economic growth. Last night, the Senate voted to \ncontinue down the path toward a truly balanced approach to tackling our \neconomic and fiscal challenges. It is the kind of approach that cuts \nspending responsibly and calls on the wealthiest Americans and biggest \ncorporations to pay their fair share.\n  We voted on an approach that puts our economy first and foremost and \nmakes sure we are protecting, not threatening, our fragile economic \nrecovery. That is the kind of approach that is supported by the vast \nmajority of the American people, and the Senate stood strongly behind \nthat.\n  The Senate strongly rejected the budget that passed the House of \nRepresentatives yesterday. Their budget would meet the goal by \nbalancing the budget with an arbitrary date but would do it in a way \nthat would be devastating for our families and the economy. It would \ndismantle Medicare and end up cutting taxes for the rich while raising \nthem on the middle class; not only that, but it did rely on gimmicks \nand tricks to hit that arbitrary date. There is nothing balanced about \nthat kind of approach. I am very glad every Member of the Senate had an \nopportunity to be clear about where we stand on that.\n  The Senate also voted yesterday to specifically reject the idea that \nMedicare should be dismantled or voucherized. I am glad we had strong \nbipartisan support on that amendment. We also voted clearly for the \nidea that while both sides favor closing tax loopholes and ending \nwasteful deductions that favor the wealthiest Americans and biggest \ncorporations, the Senate thinks some of that revenue should be used to \ntackle the deficit and invest in the middle class, not to be used to \nsimply cut tax rates for the rich the way the House budget did.\n  We have a few more hours of debate this morning between now and 11 \na.m., followed by some votes, and then we will close out the debate and \nmove on to all the rest of the votes we will take before final passage \nlate tonight or early tomorrow morning.\n  As the majority leader said, we have hundreds of amendments. If we \nwere to vote on all of them, we would be here every single hour voting \nbetween Monday and Tuesday. I think every Member knows that is probably \nnot going to happen. I encourage every Member of the Senate to work \nwith the manager on their side so we can get the amendments up sooner \nrather than later and vote on the ones each side wants us to.\n  I urge all my colleagues to work with us and our staff to make sure \nwe know where the priorities are, how to proceed, and we will work with \neveryone to combine similar amendments. Obviously, among those 400 \namendments, there are a number that are similar. We will clear as many \nnoncontroversial amendments by voice vote as we can, and we will get \nthrough as many votes as possible in a fair and reasonable manner. We \nlook forward to working with Senator Sessions to make sure we can do \nthat.\n  I encourage our colleagues--there is a bit more time for them to have \ntheir say before we vote. If anyone would like to have their say, make \nsure our staffs know before making any statements.\n  With that, I yield to my colleague, Senator Sessions.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have enjoyed working with Senator \nMurray. She is a strong leader. She makes clear decisions and sticks by \nthem and executes them. I respect that. She has stayed within the rules \nas the chair of the committee. We disagreed on a number of things. Our \nvision for the financial future of America is quite different.\n  I understand how difficult it is to produce a budget. That is not an \neasy thing to accomplish. When there is a divergent caucus, it is \nparticularly difficult.\n  Politico said the budget was written by the left of the Democratic \ncaucus to the left of President Obama. I think that is probably \ncorrect. It is a very big spending, big tax budget. It is the wrong \nthing for America. It is the wrong thing for economic stability. It is \nthe wrong kind of plan if made into law to help us grow our economy, \ncreate jobs, create wealth, get people overtime and bonuses and pay \nraises, the kind of thing we have when the economy is growing.\n  This budget is the wrong medicine. I have to say I strongly believe \nit takes us in the wrong direction. What does it do at the bottom? It \nraises taxes. It raises taxes, according to the chairman, by $1 \ntrillion--$985 billion. That is almost $1 trillion. We think it raises \nit $1.5 trillion. There is a reserve fund to make it easy to raise more \ntaxes. I asked the chair to close that so it could not be used to raise \ntaxes easily, but she declined, which continued to cause me to believe \nthat is an additional part. Regardless, $1 trillion in new taxes is a \nhuge tax increase.\n  In January of this year, the President got a $600 billion tax \nincrease on the rich. Plus there is $1 trillion in tax increase in the \nPresident's health care bill. So we are already at $1.6 trillion in new \ntaxes, and there is a proposal in this budget for at least another $1 \ntrillion. That is not healthy for the economy.\n  We all know when we extract more wealth out of the economy, it does \nhave effects. One of them is it weakens the economy and strengthens the \ncentral government. The central government is not managing the people's \nmoney well. We have no interest, it appears from this budget, in \nlistening to the American people and running their government better, \nleaner, more productive, get more bang for the buck. What do we do? We \nask for more money. We haven't done anything wrong; send us more money.\n  I have to urge my colleagues to honestly examine what the budget \ndoes. In addition to raising taxes, we would think that would help us. \nThey say they have a balanced approach. We started counting how many \ntimes my Democratic colleagues used the word ``balance.'' I think it \nsuggests a guilty conscience myself because the budget in no way comes \nclose to balancing a\n\n[[Page S2237]]\n\nbudget. It doesn't pretend to. It explicitly rejects it. There is not \nan arbitrary date. There is not a date proposed to balance the budget. \nIn fact, because it makes no changes in the drivers of our debt, the \nbig entitlement programs, the big welfare programs, the interest on the \ndebt, none of those are constrained by this budget. We know the next 10 \nyears that are outside the budget window will be even worse. They will \nbe on an unsustainable course, accelerating even off the course we are \non today, which is unsustainable. So I am very disappointed.\n  Everybody who has been involved or who has participated--whether it \nis the Gang of 6 or the committee of 12, as our chairman did, the super \ncommittee--knows that nearly 60 percent of the money the government is \nnow spending, such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on \nthe debt, food stamps, those programs are out of control. They are \nentitlements, which means we set up legal standards that if those \nstandards are met, anyone can walk into a government office and demand \nthe money. They have to give it to them. If they don't, they can sue \nthe government. I am 68 years old, I want my Social Security check. We \ncan't say we don't have any money.\n\n  So this is the kind of thing that needs to be fixed now. It needs to \nbe discussed now. Every expert who is an independent adviser to the \ngovernment has said: You guys need to get together and fix this.\n  So what the budget before us today says is, no, we are not going to \nfix any of that. We have no plans to construct any of that. And any of \nour Republican colleagues who suggest that these programs have to be \nchanged, we say they don't like old people. We say they don't like poor \npeople. We say they don't want people to have food.\n  That is what we say--attack, attack, attack, when everybody knows \nchange must occur. We know that. It is not in this budget--nothing in \nthe budget. So they don't change the programs within the budget. I \nsuggest that is not responsible. I suggest that is not a budget worthy \nof a party that says they want to lead America. The great Democratic \nParty is absolutely refusing to confront the great financial issues of \nour time. No, we won't talk about it, and if our Republican colleagues \ndo, we are going to attack Paul Ryan because he has a creative, \ninsightful way to preserve Medicare and make it more healthy in the \nfuture and put it on a sound path. We are going to say he is trying to \ndestroy Medicare.\n  Paul Ryan has a plan to save Medicare, bring it into the 21st \ncentury, and make things better. It ought to be discussed openly and \nfairly, not demonized. That is the level of debate we are in here.\n  In private when we talk to our colleagues, they say: Yes, we need to \nmake changes. We really do.\n  Well, when? And when the paper is printed, when the budget is \nprinted, it is not there. It is not there. So there is no reform of the \nfundamental drivers of our debt.\n  We also know that last year we spent $750 billion on 83 government \nwelfare programs, means-tested programs; that is, if a person's income \nis below a certain level, the government deems that person worthy of \nsome subsidy of some kind. Many of these 83 programs are duplicative. \nThere is not a coherent focus on them that endeavors to help the \npeople, really, other than giving them money, giving them aid. There is \nnot a sufficient focus in all of these programs in actually helping \nthat struggling mother with children who is out of work, who lost her \njob, who can no longer get overtime or bonus pay, and young people who \nare struggling to get up on the ladder of work and prosperity. This is \nnot helping them. And these programs are just temporary. We have \nbillions going out for unemployment insurance, food stamps, temporary \nassistance to needy families, earned-income tax credit, all of these \nprograms.\n  It is time for us to begin a massive overhaul, review all of these \nprograms, and several things can happen. One thing that can happen is \nwe can make them better, and we can actually create programs that allow \neach person in their time of need to get temporary assistance, to be \nable to refocus their life, to move into the workforce, help them find \nthe training they need to get into areas that need jobs right now, and \nhelp them move forward. But do my colleagues know what we have in our \nSenate and among a lot of the Members of the House? We have a goal to \nsee how many more workers we can bring in without effectively helping \nAmerican workers who are unemployed.\n  We have an immigration policy that says we have jobs but we don't \nhave enough workers. That is what the businesses are telling us. We \ndon't have enough workers. They all ought to add--when they send us \nthat message, they ought to say: And by the way, you need to give more \nwelfare and more aid to people who don't have jobs. Now, what is the \ndisconnect there?\n  We need to be protecting American citizens who are here, out of work, \nand hurting today--minorities, Blacks and Whites and all colors and \nraces that are hurting today with high unemployment, but we seem to be \nmore focused on how we can ram through this Senate a bill that would \nlegalize millions and create an even more robust guest worker program. \nThere are not enough jobs now. Give me a break.\n  So we are talking about $750 billion going out now for these 83 \nprograms, projected to go up 80 percent in the next decade--the total \nof those programs--go up 80 percent in the next decade. We have \ncalculated those numbers, and if it went up 60 percent, it would save \n$1 trillion. I think we can make those programs more effective, more \nhelpful, and organized in a way that really advances the needs of poor \npeople and save $1 trillion. That ought to be our goal. We will let it \ngrow as much as we have to allow it grow to take care of people in \nneed. We are going to make sure people have their needs met in America \nwho are struggling out there, but at the same time, it can be done \nbetter, and every American knows it. They will talk to us when we ask \nthem about it. They are uneasy about the easy money and the feeling \nthat this system isn't working when it comes to government assistance, \nand I think they are right. I would ask my colleagues if they think \nthey are right. I really think so. So what does that mean? That means \nwe should be having hearings and doing work to fix it, which we are not \ndoing.\n  The challenge of our time is the unsustainable debt course this \ncountry is on. The challenge of our time is for us to demonstrate that \nwe made the changes necessary to place this economy on a sound footing.\n  I believe the great minds of our time are not as smart as they think \nthey are. In 2001 Chairman Greenspan of the Fed came before the Budget \nCommittee and talked about what we were going to do when the entire \ndebt of the United States was paid down, and he worried we wouldn't \nknow what to do with the money. Of course, we were in a recession \nwithin a few months, and now we see demographically that we are on an \nunsustainable debt course. The new Fed Chairman, Mr. Bernanke, as the \nWall Street Journal documented, at the time was promoting Mr. Greenspan \nto spend more money and keep losing money before the housing crisis--\njust exactly the wrong advice. He didn't see it coming. So we are not \nso smart around here.\n  I am worried about the future. What do I think responsible government \npolicymakers should do? They should provide a good, solid framework for \nthe vibrant, free market economy in this country to flourish. We can't \nbe the kind of off and on again faucet for money and taxes and spending \nand not spending and bouncing around here trying to pass laws every few \nmonths to meet what is perceived as the financial goal of somebody on \nWall Street at that moment. We are not able to do that.\n  What we should do is lay out a strong, clear policy, adhere to it, \nand let the businesspeople risk their money with some ability to \nascertain what those risks are, not expecting the government to come in \nand alter the situation and the rules of the game a few months down the \nroad. That is what we should do--create a sound framework. We are not \ndoing that. I am concerned about it.\n  Finally, this budget increases spending. It increases spending very \ndramatically at a time when we don't need to be increasing spending at \nthis rate. We are increasing spending above the rate we are currently \nset to operate by--the Budget Control Act line--\n\n[[Page S2238]]\n\nwhich allows for increasing spending every year. But this budget spends \nmore than that, and it raises $1 trillion in taxes, at least, and it \nexpends all of those new taxes, eats that up with new spending. If it \ncalled for us to stay on the current baseline of spending, growth that \nis going up, and we raised $1 trillion in taxes, we would have $1 \ntrillion in reduced deficit over the next 10 years. But it spends more \nmoney, and it eats up the new taxes with new spending. It really does.\n  This is a failed plan that has been produced by the majority party in \nthe Senate. When people heard this--this is what is being said to the \nAmerican people, and we all know it: The Democratic leadership is \nsaying, we have a budget that is balanced. What does that mean? It \nmeans we are going to pay down the debt, but it is not all going to be \ncutting spending. We are going to pay down the debt by raising taxes \nand cutting spending--raise taxes $1 trillion, cut spending $1 \ntrillion, so we have a $2 trillion reduction in the deficit. Doesn't \nthat sound good? That is the kind of thing the American people would \nlike to hear. It is not enough. We could do more, and we don't have to \ndo a lot more, and we will have a balanced budget.\n  But it doesn't do that, I say to my colleagues. It doesn't. It raises \ntaxes $1 trillion, but it raises spending $1 trillion. It doesn't cut \nspending by $1 trillion, it raises spending. Therefore, we have no \ndeficit reduction at all, but we have a new $1 trillion tax.\n  The government is saying to the American people: We need more money. \nWe don't have any way to cut any spending, and if anybody proposes \nthere are abuses in the food stamp program or there are abuses in other \nprograms out there or that we are wasting money on energy loans by the \nbillions--Solyndra and A123s and those kinds of companies--they are \nsaying all of that, but we can't save any money. There is no money to \nbe saved. You just send us more money, and then we will pass it around, \nand this will stimulate the economy.\n  I will conclude. I see we have some colleagues who are here. I would \njust say this: The debt we have today I have become absolutely \nconvinced is too high. The gross debt of the United States is 104 \npercent of our economy. It is above our GDP, which is almost $17 \ntrillion--that debt is almost $17 trillion now.\n  What we have seen from the Rogoff and Reinhart study and from recent \nreports by the International Monetary Fund and a report by the European \nCentral Bank and a report by the Bank for International Settlements--\nthey all say that when debt is as high as it is today in the United \nStates, that begins to pull down growth.\n  So my colleagues claim they have a budget that will help create jobs. \nI would say with all respect that we have a disagreement. Democrats \nbelieve they can tax more and spend more and borrow more and that will \nsomehow create growth and prosperity. I believe we have had 4 years of \nthat experiment, which I fundamentally doubted and opposed from the \nbeginning, and it hasn't worked. We can't take a bucket of water from \none end of the pool and pour it in the other and gain from it, \nespecially when the bucket is going to leak--a good bit of it--in the \nprocess.\n  So what I would say is that the debt now is so high--according to all \nof those reports, the debt of the United States is in the zone that \nthey craft, that they have analyzed--when debt gets into that zone, we \nlose growth. All of those reports--Rogoff and Reinhart, IMF, European \nCentral Bank, the Bank of International Settlements--say we are in that \nzone.\n  So if we want to have growth, we are going to have to make our \ngovernment leaner. We are going to have to begin to get our budget \nunder control and balanced. And if we balance it by allowing growth to \noccur at 3.4 percent, without having to cut over 10 years--but if we \nallow our growth to increase at 3.4 percent instead of 5.4 percent, the \nbudget balances. So we don't have to slash and burn, but we do have to \nget off the course we are on. It isn't easy, but that is what we are \npaid to do--to be responsible.\n  So if we get off that course and begin to see our debt-to-GDP go \ndown, which a balanced budget--even over a 10-year, responsible \nperiod--would do, then we will be able to actually honestly say we have \nstrengthened America, we have put us on a sound path, and we have \nallowed the economy to grow again.\n  There is no doubt in my mind, I say to my colleagues--and I doubt in \ntheirs--that if the world were to see that the United States was on a \npath to a balanced budget, wow, they would say: Really? This debt \nspiral the United States and all of these big, fat Western nations have \nbeen on--maybe others can do this too. Maybe this is the place to \ninvest our money.\n  I believe it would help growth, help investment, help put the country \non a sound path. I am disappointed that this budget doesn't do it.\n  I respect my colleagues. We had a great time in the committee. We \nhave had a good time on the floor. Senator Murray is a good chair. But \nI guess the left of the Democratic caucus has produced a budget that \nwon't work. It does not meet the challenge of our time. It is deeply \ndisappointing. I guess there is still some chance something might \nhappen in conference. But from the looks of this budget, the chances \nare not very great, I have to say.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for this opportunity and yield the \nfloor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes off the resolution to my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Mikulski, the chair of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coons.\n  I probably will not take 10 minutes, but what I will speak about is \nreally compelling.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 431\n\n  Later on during the vote-arama we will be considering my amendment \nthat will create a reserve fund that should we pass the Paycheck \nFairness Act, it will in no way negate the spending within our budget. \nIt is essentially the functional equivalent of a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that the Senate should pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  We talk a lot about growing the economy. The economy will grow when \npeople work. The people who are entering the workforce who have been \none of the driving forces for the last 30 years are women. Although we \nare in the workforce full force, we are still not being paid equal pay \nfor equal work. It is outrageous. If you want to grow the economy, pass \npaycheck fairness so we are not harassed for simply trying to find out \nwhat our pay is and how we can get equal pay for the same job.\n  Women across America are worried about staying in the middle class if \nthey are already there or getting to the middle class if they are not \nthere. Nearly 50 years after passage of the Equal Pay Act, women still \nget paid less than men.\n  This budget is a reflection of our values and priorities, and \neliminating the wage gap should be one. For years I and other \ncolleagues have fought for paycheck fairness. Under that act, no longer \nwould employers be able to retaliate against workers for sharing \ninformation about wages. Right now, if you ask someone what they get \npaid, you can get fired. This bill follows on from the famous Lilly \nLedbetter Act. Lilly herself was humiliated and harassed because she \ntried to find out what she was making.\n  No longer will women be able to seek only backpay when they are \ndiscriminated against. Under this bill they could also seek punitive \ndamages. No longer would employers be able to use almost any reason for \npaying a woman less: Oh, the men do harder jobs. Oh, they have a better \neducation than you. In fact, the reverse is happening. Women entering \nthe workforce are often better educated, with more academic and trade \ncertifications than men who are doing it. Women are also doing hard and \ndangerous jobs. We can look at what they do in the military. We can \nlook at them as firefighters, police officers, and prison guards.\n  Under the legislation I am proposing, no longer will women be on \ntheir own in fighting for equal pay for equal work. In this country we \nsay: If you work hard and play by the rules, you will get ahead. We \nwork hard every day, but we find that the rules are different for women \nthan for men. Actually, the rules in many workplaces are rigged against \nus.\n  So I would hope that we would adopt my amendment today that would \nallow\n\n[[Page S2239]]\n\nus to be able to go forward later on in the year and pass paycheck \nfairness. It is important to the women in the workplace, and it is \nimportant to our economy.\n  Much is being said about being progrowth. Who is not progrowth? Of \ncourse we want to grow our economy. If we look at the tax structure, I \nbelieve we should reward--right now, the tax structure is tilted and \nthe tax breaks that we give are to reward people who make money off of \nmoney, not people who make money off of products or the sweat of their \nown brow. So I think we need to take a look at the Tax Code.\n  My State is an entrepreneurial-driven State. We are an innovation \neconomy in biotech, cyber tech, space tech. At the same time, we have \npeople who work hard every single day in agriculture, in poultry, in \nmining, in trying to earn a living by very hard work. I believe we \nshould have a Tax Code that rewards it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, how many minutes are remaining on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 48\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COONS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  We have heard a great deal about balance in the debates on the Senate \nfloor. As we move toward voting on a budget resolution, I just want to \nremind all of us in this Chamber today to keep in mind that a balanced \npath forward has broad support across all of America. Folks are looking \nfor us to take a path toward steady and responsible deficit reduction, \ninvesting in growing our economy, investing in helping our private \nsector grow good jobs, while still honoring the pledges we have made to \nAmerica's veterans, to our seniors, to those who rely on some of our \nmost important and most treasured Federal programs--Medicare, Medicaid, \nand Social Security.\n  There is a sharp contrast--and that contrast will be clear and \nclearer as this day goes on--between the values embedded in the Ryan \nbudget, passed by the House, and the budget led ably by Chairman Murray \nand the Senate Democrats in the Budget Committee that will be taken up \nlater today. We will be considering dozens, perhaps hundreds, of \namendments that will touch on a very wide range of issues--from \npaycheck fairness and gender equity, as referenced by Senator Mikulski \njust a few moments ago, to issues very widely ranging--ones that I have \nhelped champion on the Budget Committee that would increase investment \nin manufacturing, making sure that our manufacturing sector is more \ncompetitive; ones that allow us to strengthen our R sector, \nstrengthen our education sector; ones that ensure we preserve and \nprotect these valued Medicare and Medicaid programs that I referenced.\n  More than anything, at the end of the day I think the challenge to \nall of us is to help the American people understand the fundamental \ndifference in values reflected in these two different budgets.\n  I know I will be joined in just a few minutes by colleagues who are \ncoming to speak to that point, to help lay out for the American people \nthe fundamental difference between these two budgets. But if I might, \nsort of at the highest level for a moment, I want to remind folks who \nmight be watching, folks in the Chamber, that a budget resolution is \nquite different from the budgets that, Mr. President, you might have \nbeen used to as a Governor, that others of us were used to from the \nprivate sector or from State or county or city governments.\n  A budget resolution does not have every single item to be spent by \nthis government in great detail. As State budgets are submitted to \ngeneral assemblies or legislatures, they typically have exactly how the \nState will spend its funds in the year ahead in enormous detail. This \nbudget resolution sets a framework. It sets sort of top-level spending \ntargets and then directs the committees of jurisdiction to achieve \neither changes to the Tax Code in the Finance Committee or changes to \nvital programs in other committees, whether Defense or HELP or others.\n\n  So when we talk often about the values embedded in a budget \nresolution, that is, in part, because a budget resolution is just the \nbeginning of a regular order, healthy budget process. It then has to be \ncomplemented with authorization bills and with appropriations bills.\n  But if you compare the budget resolution that has already been \nadopted in the House, and that was rejected by a vote on the floor last \nnight, with the budget resolution that has come out of the Senate \nBudget Committee, I think you see a few simple, stark differences. Both \nbudget resolutions raise a significant amount of revenue through tax \nreform by closing so-called tax loopholes or cutting spending through \nthe Tax Code. This is spending that is not reviewed every year. This is \nspending that often has been stuck into the Tax Code through the \nefforts of the wealthy and well-connected powerful interests in our \ncountry, that does not get reviewed every year. It is time for us to \nlook seriously at our Tax Code to make it leaner, easier to understand, \neasier to enforce, more efficient, and to make our country more \ncompetitive.\n  But a core question we have to address is, To what end do we put the \nrevenue raised through changes to our Tax Code? In the House budget \nresolution, they raise, if I remember, roughly $5.7 trillion over the \n10-year budget period--all of which is dedicated to reducing the tax \nrates on the wealthiest Americans and on the most profitable \ncorporations, reducing rates on corporations and individuals.\n  The much smaller amount raised in our budget plan--$975 billion over \n10 years, through cutting spending through the Tax Code--is dedicated \nto deficit reduction.\n  The balanced path we have talked about--that balances reduction in \nthe deficit through new revenue raised by reforms to the Tax Code with \ncomparable spending reductions across all areas of our budget--is the \nsort of balanced plan that was on the ballot, that was a critical part \nof the 2012 election process, and that I frankly think the American \npeople have broadly embraced.\n  We have put forward a budget that meets the values agenda that our \nDemocratic Budget Committee stands behind: to invest in critical areas \nof our economy, whether infrastructure, education, or R to help lift \nthe private sector and help grow jobs again; to keep our most vital \ncommitments to seniors and to veterans and to those most at risk in our \nsociety, while still making responsible, steady progress toward \nreducing our crippling deficit and debt. We get the deficit down to \nless than 3 percent of GDP. At the end of the 10-year period, we \nstabilize our publicly held debt at 70 percent of GDP. These are the \ntargets broadly agreed on by every major bipartisan group that has \nlooked at the challenges facing the United States, our economy, and our \nbudget.\n  I will remind you that the Bowles-Simpson Commission--a bipartisan \ncommission--came up with a rough target of $4 trillion in savings over \na decade. This plan, this budget resolution, would achieve--in fact, \nwould exceed--that target in a way that has balance and, I believe, is \nresponsible.\n  I would be happy to talk further then, if I might, Mr. President, \nabout some of the other issues contained both within our budget \nresolution and, in contrast, within the budget resolution coming over \nfrom the House.\n  As a number of my colleagues have spoken about movingly on the Senate \nfloor in recent days, one of the most important differences is in the \nfuture of the fundamental entitlement programs that are a part of the \nprogressive legacy of FDR and LBJ and that were put in place with both \nRepublicans and Democrats over many years, strengthening and sustaining \nthem. We see a fundamental difference in direction between what has \nhappened in the House and what we have proposed in the Senate.\n  To put it simply, in the House they would change Medicare from a \nFederal guarantee, from a program that provides health care to millions \nof Americans, to a voucher program, one where what the Federal \nGovernment provides is not a guarantee but premium support, a voucher, \nsomething that would shift costs onto seniors, onto States, and onto \ncommunities. In Medicaid, in my view, even worse--because it supports \nthe most vulnerable in our country--they would turn it into a block \ngrant. This would shift more than $800 billion onto the balance sheets \nof States.\n\n[[Page S2240]]\n\n  To talk further about these important differences and the values \nbetween the House and the Senate budgets, and to talk about its impact \non the future of the United States, I yield 7 minutes to my colleague \nfrom the State of Rhode Island, Senator Whitehouse.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coons.\n  The Senate budget resolution that we have worked so hard on would, \nfirst, replace the harmful budget sequester, the effects of which are \nonly beginning to be felt in our communities--with balanced deficit \nreduction. Second, it would invest in our crumbling roads, bridges, and \nwater infrastructure. Our engineers give our infrastructure a D-plus. \nClearly, we need to make that investment, and it would support \ncontinued job creation and economic growth.\n  Despite this sensible, balanced approach, not a single Republican \nsupported this budget in committee. Republicans prefer to raid the \nprograms that the middle class depends on, while protecting the rich \nand the well-connected.\n  A CBS News poll conducted last September shows that 78 percent of \nAmericans favor continuing the current guarantee of Medicare coverage \nfor seniors--78 percent. But the Republican budget would gut Medicare, \nturning it into a voucher program for those 55 and under--basically \nputting Medicare into a death spiral. And it would end the Medicare \nguarantee that has been the pillar of American retirement for half a \ncentury.\n  More than 3 million seniors right now save an average of $700 a year \non prescriptions because we closed the dread doughnut hole. Well, the \nRepublican budget throws them right back in the doughnut hole, forcing \ntoday's seniors to pay an additional $700 a year, on average, out of \npocket.\n  Sixty million Americans got to college and were able to seize their \ndreams because of Pell grants. The Republican plan cuts Pell grants, \ndropping an estimated million students in this vital program. This Ryan \nRepublican plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program is so extreme \nand so radical that even Republicans are speaking out against it.\n  Congressman David McKinley voted against the Ryan budget. He said, \n``My home State of West Virginia has the highest percentage of Medicare \nbeneficiaries in the country, and I cannot support a plan that the \nCongressional Budget Office has determined would nearly double out-of-\npocket healthcare costs for future retirees.''\n  Of course, former Speaker Newt Gingrich described this plan as \n``right-wing social engineering.'' This Republican budget makes \nenormous mystery cuts in the budget. Chairman Ryan claims he can cut \n$900 billion of appropriated domestic spending over the next 10 years. \nThat means border security, that means the FBI, that means medical \nresearch, that means student financial aid, that means the grants that \nsupport our efforts to combat violence against women.\n  Under the extreme radical Republican budget, domestic discretionary \nspending will fall to its lowest level as a share of GDP since we \nstarted keeping track in 1962. There were not even Pell grants in 1962. \nThere was not even Medicare in 1962. Their future is our distant past.\n  Chairman Ryan would push $810 billion onto our States to shift costs \nto the States for Medicaid, and find another mystery $962 billion in \nunspecified entitlement grants. He boasts that the Republican budget \nrepeals ObamaCare but he puts all of the savings from ObamaCare in the \nbudget.\n  He cannot have it both ways. It is not even an honest budget. It is \npolitically, mathematically, and logically unrealistic. It is not a \nbalanced budget so much as magical thinking. Even if the unrealistic \nprogram cuts in the Republican budget could be made, the plan ignores \nthe economic damage that would result.\n  We have had the austerity experience. We have had the austerity \nexperience in Europe. The evidence is in. Deep austerity cuts in Spain, \nGreece and Portugal caused persistent double-digit unemployment and \nnegative growth rates. We may be impatient with our unemployment rate, \nwe may be impatient with our low positive growth rate, but the \ncountries that tried what the Republicans want to do have double-digit, \n26-percent unemployment rates. Their economic growth is negative. Their \neconomies are shrinking.\n  The Wall Street Journal just reported that industrial production in \nthe UK after its austerity plans has fallen to its lowest level in 22 \nyears and the country is looking at a third recession. The Republicans \nwho want to emulate European austerity should consider what Jeremy \nWarner said in the conservative Daily Telegraph.\n\n       This is a truly desperate state of affairs. . . . We seem \n     to have the worst of all possible worlds, with nil growth, \n     some very obvious cuts in the quantity and quality of public \n     services, but pretty much zero progress in getting on top of \n     the country's debts.\n\n  That should be a warning. Not only is the Ryan Republican budget's \nmagical thinking unrealistic, it is unfair. It achieves 100 percent of \nits deficit reduction by cutting government programs that benefit lower \nand middle-income Americans, while getting nothing--not one dime--from \nwealthy Americans or corporations. In fact, it would cut the high-end \ntax rate for corporations and wealthy individuals. It adds more tax \nbreaks for the rich and well-connected, and goes after the lower and \nmiddle-class families.\n  The Republican budget cuts total education and workforce training, \nfor instance, by an estimated 47 percent. It cuts $135 billion out of \nthe food stamp program, which helps feed the poorest Americans. At the \nsame time, if you are making over $1 million, it offers you an average \ntax cut of $330,000.\n  For the kind of money the Ryan Republican budget wants to give to the \nrich and the well-connected, they have to come after the middle class. \nChairman Ryan's tax cut would require $5.5 trillion in new revenue. To \ncover that pricetag, President Clinton revealed the hard truth. I will \nquote President Bill Clinton:\n\n       . . . they'll have to eliminate so many deductions, like \n     the ones for home mortgages and charitable giving, that \n     middle-class families will see their tax bills go up.\n\n  That is the promise of the Ryan Republican budget--middle-class \nfamilies will see their tax bills go up. We do not. We take 7 percent \nout of that, which means we can focus on the corporate tax spending, we \ncan focus on the high-end deductions, on the carried interest \nexception, so we do not have to go after the middle-class tax cuts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Let me close by reading one thing. We have just \nwelcomed a new Pope. The Conference of Catholic Bishops had this to say \nabout the Ryan budget last year:\n\n       Congress faces a difficult task to balance needs and \n     resources and allocate burdens and sacrifices. Just \n     solutions, however, must require shared sacrifice by all, \n     including raising adequate revenues, eliminating unnecessary \n     military and other spending, and fairly addressing the long-\n     term costs of health insurance and retirement programs. The \n     House-passed budget resolution fails to meet these moral \n     criteria.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am pleased to yield up to 10 minutes \nto Senator Cruz of Texas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend from Rhode Island \nfor his stirring remarks and, indeed, his powerful arguments against \nthis Nation going down the road of Greece and Spain and much of Europe. \nThose were indeed compelling statistics of 27-percent unemployment in \nGreece, and negative nearly 7-percent growth in Greece. I found myself \nmoved looking at those statistics that all of us should act, and act \nwith leadership, to prevent going down that road, to stop the out-of-\ncontrol spending, the out-of-control debt that put Greece and Spain in \nthose circumstances.\n  We are right now in a situation where our Nation faces debt larger \nthan our entire economy, greater than 100 percent of our entire \neconomy. That is where the United States is right now. I would suggest \nthe irresponsible policies of this Congress and this administration are \nwhy we are seeing stagnant growth. Last quarter, our\n\n[[Page S2241]]\n\neconomy grew 0.1 percent. I found the speech of my friend from Rhode \nIsland quite powerful for arguing why every Member of this body should \nvote against the Democratic budget that will be coming up for a vote, \nbecause it is clear that raising taxes $1.5 trillion on top of the $1.7 \ntrillion tax increase that has already been put in place will only \naccelerate our path to where Greece and Spain and much of Europe are.\n\n  Adopting a budget that never balances in perpetuity, as sadly the \nDemocratic budget does, will only accelerate our path to where Greece \nand Europe are. So I thank my friend for that stirring recitation.\n  I would note also that tomorrow is an important milestone. Tomorrow \nis the 3-year anniversary of the adoption of ObamaCare. As we vote \nlater today, I will be introducing an amendment to establish a deficit-\nneutral reserve fund to provide for the repeal of ObamaCare.\n  ObamaCare was passed with many promises. Yet the reality is it has \nnot delivered. When ObamaCare was being proposed, the President told \nAmericans, the average American family would see our premiums drop by \n$2,500. Instead, today, the average American family has seen our \npremiums rise by $3,000. That is a $5,500 difference between what was \npromised and what has been delivered.\n  Young people in particular have been hit incredibly hard by \nObamaCare. The actuaries predict that young people trying to climb the \neconomic ladder could see their premiums rise anywhere between 145 \npercent and 189 percent.\n  Seniors also have been hit severely by ObamaCare. As a result of \nObamaCare, some 14 million, nearly 15 million seniors are on Medicare \nAdvantage. Half of them will lose their Medicare Advantage coverage as \na result of ObamaCare. Seven million seniors will lose Medicare \nAdvantage. I would note, a very large percentage of those are low-\nincome seniors, are Hispanic seniors, are African-American seniors.\n  Every one of us should ask, when confronted with Hispanic seniors in \nour State, why is it that we are content to see 7 million seniors lose \ntheir Medicare Advantage program. I would suggest we should not be.\n  Last Wednesday, all 45 Republicans stood united voting in support of \nan amendment I offered to delay funding ObamaCare at least until our \neconomy gets growing. Our economy is stagnant right now. It is not \ngrowing. Last quarter it was 0.8 percent. Sadly, every Democrat who \nvoted voted to continue implementing ObamaCare even as the economy is \ngasping for breath and to risk very potentially knocking this Nation \ninto a recession.\n  I would urge this body to reconsider this decision, when so many \npeople are hurting, not to put the kind of impact that could send this \ncountry backwards into a recession. ObamaCare itself includes some 20 \ntax increases, over $1 trillion. Many in this body talk about the \nmiddle class. Many of those tax increases fall directly on the middle \nclass.\n  Yesterday, over 70 members of this body voted against the medical \ndevices tax. I celebrate that. That is a terrific recognition of the \ntax burdens of ObamaCare. I hope that amendment is not simply voted on \nin an aspirational sense, but that it becomes law and we repeal that \namendment. But I would suggest the medical devices industry, a critical \nindustry, employs a virtual army of lobbyists. The lesson yesterday \nillustrated is if you are wealthy, if you are connected, if you are an \nimportant industry with lobbyists that can get Senators to come to \ncocktail parties, you too can see some of the burdens of ObamaCare \nperhaps lifted from you.\n  But as we voted for that--I happily voted to lift that tax--it struck \nme, what about the millions of small businesses that do not have \nlobbyists in Washington, that do not have the ability to corral \nSenators and say: It is so important that this burden not fall on me. \nWe respond, quite rightly, to the pleas from one power industry and yet \nwe ignore the pleas from the mom-and-pop shops, from the millions who \nare struggling.\n  I will note, if you look at the Hispanic community, there are 2.3 \nmillion Hispanic small business owners in this country. Roughly one in \neight Hispanic households is a small business owner. But you know what. \nThey do not have lobbyists here who capture the attention of some 70 \nSenators. Instead, they face the costs and the burdens from ObamaCare.\n  I want to read to this body a couple of recent press stories \nillustrating that this is not a Republican talking point or a \nDemocratic talking point. These are the facts. This is what is \nhappening under ObamaCare. The Associated Press on March 13, 2013, so \njust earlier this month, reported--this is the opening line of the \nstory:\n\n       Some Americans could see their insurance bills double next \n     year as the health care overhaul laws expand coverage to \n     millions of people.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The biggest price hikes are expected to hit a group that \n     represents a relatively small slice of the insurance \n     population. That includes some roughly 14 million people who \n     buy their own insurance as opposed to being covered under \n     employer-sponsored plans, and to a lesser extent some \n     employees of smaller companies. Yet again, the impact of \n     ObamaCare hitting small businesses, hitting the struggling \n     entrepreneurs.\n\n  I would note, two-thirds of all new jobs in our economy come from \nsmall businesses. If this body continues to make it harder for small \nbusinesses to survive, we will continue to see 23 million Americans out \nof work, because the new jobs are going to come from small businesses, \nand we cannot continue to put more and more costs and burdens on them.\n  The Associated Press continued:\n\n       Young people who currently have low-cost coverage may see \n     some of the biggest hikes.\n\n  To all of the college kids right now who stood for ``hope and \nchange,'' to all of the young people who are coming out of school \nstruggling to find jobs and are not able to find jobs right now, I \nwould point out that what the Associated Press reported is that alone, \nthe ObamaCare impact could cause the premium for a 24-year-old who pays \n$2,400 annually to jump $1,800. As their resumes go up, as they see \nadditional dollars taken out of their pockets, as they are struggling \nto climb the economic ladder, I hope the young people realize the cause \nfor those impacts.\n  Just this week, the Washington Post, hardly a bastion for \nconservative thought, had a major story headlined ``Health-care law \nuncertainty grips Old Town Alexandria cafe--and other small \nbusinesses.'' It explained there is a cafe in Old Town Alexandria which \nemploys 45 people. The owner says:\n\n       There is tremendous confusion and fear among many of my \n     competitors and other business owners in my network, \n     particularly about what you have to cover and how you have to \n     report.\n\n  This comment was by Hugh Joyce, owner of James River Air Conditioning \nin Richmond. Continuing:\n\n       In speaking to them, I am convinced that the primary reason \n     we aren't seeing a robust economic recovery is the \n     uncertainty and costs associated with this health-care law.\n\n  This is from a small business owner saying why don't we see growth, \nwhy don't we see the economy blooming? Because ObamaCare stays in force \nand it is crippling jobs.\n  The Washington Post continues:\n\n       One in eight small-business owners who responded to a \n     survey by the National Federation of Independent Business \n     said their insurance providers had notified them that their \n     plans would be terminated. A study released last week by \n     Adecco, a human resources consulting firm, showed that nearly \n     a third of employers said they stopped hiring of cut their \n     workforce because of the law.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used his 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I urge ObamaCare be repealed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise to offer support for an amendment \nI will be offering, No. 198, which establishes a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund to protect the benefits of disabled veterans and their \nsurvivors, which may or may not include CPI.\n  This amendment is supported by the American Legion, which is the \nlargest veterans organization in our country, AARP, the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, AFL-CIO, Disabled American Veterans, National Committee \nto Preserve Social Security & Medicare, Gold Star Wives, and Alliance \nfor Retired Americans. This amendment is supported by every veterans \norganization, every major\n\n[[Page S2242]]\n\nsenior organization, 12 million workers in the AFL-CIO, every \ndisability organization, and the National Organization for Women.\n  Why are they all supporting this amendment? They understand at a time \nwhen millions and millions of veterans are struggling to keep their \nheads above water economically, when we have millions of seniors today \nwho are having a difficult time purchasing the prescription drug they \nneed, food they need, and the ability to heat their homes, it is cruel \nand immoral to turn our backs on veterans and seniors to make \ndisastrous cuts for the benefits of disabled veterans and for seniors.\n  Under the chained CPI, a disabled veteran who started receiving \ndisability benefits at age 30 would have their benefits cut by more \nthan $1,400 at age 25, $2,300 at age 55, and $3,200 at age 65.\n  Memorial Day is coming. I know many of my colleagues around the \ncountry will give speeches to veterans and tell veterans how much they \nsupport and respect the sacrifices they have made. It is time to go \nbeyond fine rhetoric and fine speeches if we are serious about \nprotecting the needs of veterans. Now is the time to stand tall. They \nhave protected us. Now our job is to protect them. It is wrong to \nbalance the budget on the backs of disabled veterans, pure and simple.\n  What the chained CPI would do to seniors on Social Security is \nequally bad. In my State we have many seniors--and I daresay in Maine \nas well--who this winter wonder how they will find the money they need \nto heat their homes and to purchase the prescription drugs they need. \nMany of them are living on $13,000, $14,000 or $15,000 a year on Social \nSecurity benefits. The chained CPI would say to them, if you are 65 \ntoday, by the time you are 75, your benefits would be cut by some $650 \na year. By the time you are 85, your benefits would be cut by $1,000 a \nyear.\n  I will offer another amendment above and beyond the chained CPI, \nwhich makes the point every single year we are losing tens and tens of \nbillions of dollars. The largest corporations in this country are \nputting their money in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and paying zero--\nzero--in Federal income tax. One out of four profitable major \ncorporations pays nothing in Federal income tax, including some of the \nWall Street firms we bailed out a few years ago.\n  What this whole debate is about is how do we go forward with deficit \nreduction in a way which is fair, a way which is moral, and a way which \ncalls for good economic policy. I would argue when some of the largest \ncorporations in America pay zero in Federal income taxes, before we cut \nSocial Security and benefits for disabled veterans, ask those people to \nstart paying their fair share of taxes.\n  We are in a horrendous recession. Real unemployment is over 14 \npercent, counting those who have given up looking for work and are \nworking part-time. Median family income since 1999 has gone down by \n$5,000.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let us not balance the budget on the backs of the most \nvulnerable people in our country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Whitehouse to my amendment No. \n198.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. If I might, I simply wanted to reassure those who might be \nwatching in the Chamber the Democratic budget and resolution which is \npending on the floor reflects some of our most fundamental values and \nmakes responsible progress toward reducing our deficit. We have already \ndone more than $2.4 trillion toward deficit reduction since the time \nthe Bowles-Simpson Commission suggested an overall target in reduction \nof $4 trillion in Federal spending. With this additional $1.85 \ntrillion, we will get to about $4.25 trillion. We are making \nresponsible progress.\n  As my colleague from Vermont and many others have come to the floor \nand spoken about, we need to do this in a way which still keeps our \ncommitments to America's seniors, America's veterans, and the most low-\nincome and vulnerable in our communities. We need to do it in a way \nwhich both stabilizes our deficit and debt, makes critical investments \nin growing our economy, and preserves the core of the programs on which \nAmericans rely.\n  This is not just about numbers, it is also about values. It is also \nabout priorities.\n  If I might, before I yield to the full committee chair, I wish to say \nI am grateful to Chairman Murray for everything she has done to bring \nus to this point. In the 3 years in which I have served in the Senate \nas a member of the Budget Committee, we have not had a budget \nresolution on this floor.\n  The very difficult and very long process we are about to go through \nmay be a reminder of how challenging legislative compromise can be. It \nis my hope we may engage in a thorough and vigorous debate and yet by \nthe end of this legislative day we will have a budget out of the \nSenate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. As we consider the budget which is before us today, I \nwould call my colleagues' attention to the fact that the Democratic \nbudget, the Murray budget, was voted down in the House of \nRepresentatives 2 days ago by 107 votes. One-fifth of the Democrats, \none out of five, 20 percent, voted against this budget. No Republicans \nvoted for it.\n  This may be because, as Politico said, ``to win over her caucus, \nMurray begins from the left of Obama himself.'' With regard to \nindependent evaluations of the budget, the United States USA Today \neditorial on March 15 said this:\n\n       The plan produced by the Senate Budget Committee Chair, \n     Patty Murray, D-Wash, is a disappointing document. It is a \n     namby-pamby plan that underwhelms at every turn.\n       The Murray budget neither balances the budget nor reigns in \n     entitlements.\n\n  It would help the Nation's Democrats if they were to embrace the goal \nof a Ryan budget.\n  This is the view of USA Today, the largest print in the country.\n  The Washington Post said on March 15: ``This document, gives voters \nno reason to believe that Democrats have a viable plan for--or even a \nresponsible public assessment of--the country's long-term fiscal \npredicament.''\n  The Wall Street Journal, Investment Business Daily, The Hill, all of \nthese have comments in somewhat the same vein.\n  What is our problem? Our problem is spending.\n  People say: Sessions, this is just what Republicans say, and we say \nit is not taxing the rich enough.\n  There is a fundamental issue about spending. I dealt with and asked \nquestions of Mr. Elmendorf, our CBO Director, on this very subject. It \nwent to this point: Colleagues, we need to understand it. The American \npeople need to understand it. Taxes, whatever rate they are, tend to \ngrow with the economy. If the economy is going up 2 percent, more \npeople make a little more money and taxes tend to go up 2 percent.\n  If the economy is growing at 2 percent and your spending is going up \n5.4 percent, then you have a problem. You could raise taxes.\n  I asked Mr. Elmendorf about this. Even though we had a trillion-\ndollar deficit last year, a 1,000-plus billion-dollar deficit last \nyear--unbelievable debt--almost 35 percent of the money we spent last \nyear was borrowed. We will pay interest on that for decades to come. \nThere is no plan to pay it down in any significant way.\n  I asked Mr. Elmendorf, if we raise taxes, instead of $650 billion as \nwe did in January, if we raised them enough to balance the budget, \nwould we stay in balance.\n  He acknowledged, if the economy continues to grow at 2 percent and \ngrowth of spending is at 5 percent, we will immediately be back into a \nproblem area.\n  In one sense, this is the very definition of unsustainability. This \nis the very definition of the problem we have that spending is growing \nfaster than the economy. It cannot maintain itself at that rate.\n  We can spend, and we can say we have a balanced plan, a balanced \nprogram, a balanced approach, as my colleagues have done. They know \nthis budget never balances, not in 1 year, not in 10 years, not in 50 \nyears. It will become worse in the second 10 years. It absolutely will \nbe worse.\n\n[[Page S2243]]\n\n  This is the path which, as Senator Cruz just indicated, Greece, \nSpain, and Italy have followed. This is why they are in trouble.\n  My colleagues say the economy isn't growing well, and it is not. We \nhad virtually zero growth last quarter, zero. We are supposed to be \nmoving out of the recession. As I pointed out last night, the CBO, for \nthe last several years, has been predicting 4 percent growth but not \nthis year. After missing about 2 percentage points for the last several \nyears, they are predicting low growth this year.\n  What do our colleagues say? They say they have a balanced approach. \nThey keep stating this.\n  I grew up in the country, where I went to a great little school. \nThere were 30 in my senior class. I am proud of my classmates. My \nclassmate is now president of the University of Alabama--out of our \nlittle class.\n  I know what a balanced approach means. It means nothing. A balanced \napproach is an unaccountable statement. It provides no ability for the \nAmerican people to ascertain whether we are doing anything they promise \nbecause they don't promise anything. We promised a balanced approach. \nWhat does that mean?\n  Does it mean we raise taxes and cut spending by the same amount, $1 \ntrillion each or does it mean we raise taxes by $1 trillion and raise \nspending by $1 trillion? They want us to believe they raise taxes by $1 \ntrillion, they cut spending $1 trillion, and reduce the deficit $2 \ntrillion. That is what they are suggesting to the American people. They \nare using the word ``balance'' and they hope people will hear it and \nthink this means we have a balanced budget. They know they do not have \na balanced budget. They won't tell the American people they do not have \none, they just use the word. But it is not in their document.\n\n  Where and when do we hold people accountable in this Senate for an \naccurate statement of legislation? It is wrong. We have counted so \nfar--this is pretty incredible--I think they have used the word \n``balance'' 191 times. Does that reflect a guilty conscience or \nsomething, that they want people to think we have a balanced budget? We \nthink we have a plan to get to a balanced budget. Oh, we have a \nbalanced approach. But what does that mean? It means zero. The American \npeople need to know this plan has no vision for America and it \nmisrepresents what it does.\n  I know it is hard to write a budget with the Democratic Conference, \nwhich Politico says is being written from the left--by President Obama \nhimself. I think that is probably accurate. The President's plan is \nirresponsible also. He has no real plan to do any of this, and he has \npublicly stated he does not think a balanced budget is important.\n  May I ask the Chair--we are moving along here, and I know there are \nother speakers coming, probably on both sides--to clarify our time \nsituation and what the status is?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama has 17 \nminutes remaining and the Senator from Washington has 25 minutes 50 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. All right, fair enough.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am very proud of the balance we have \nput forward in our budget that makes sure all Americans in this country \nparticipate in solving the great crisis in front of us in terms of \nmanaging our debt and deficit. We are doing exactly what the American \npeople have asked us to do--making sure that everyone participates.\n  To me, as someone who has been involved for a long time in taking \ncare of my own family and my community, balance is an important word, \nand I am very proud of the balance we put into this in terms of the \nAmerican public.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to speak to amendment No. 202 by \nSenator Cruz, which we will be voting on shortly.\n  The Senator from Texas informed us that the amendment would repeal \nthe Affordable Care Act. Well, that approach has already been rejected \nby the electorate, I would just reference, in the last election. Also, \nwe have had more than 35 separate votes in the Congress about that and \nwe have always upheld the Affordable Care Act. But I want to focus \nSenators' attention on something that is in the Cruz amendment that \nthey may not know.\n  When we passed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of \n2010, not only did it contain the health care portion of it, but it \nalso had a portion in there on education. What we did was to stop that \nold system of subsidizing banks for student loans and changed it into a \ndirect loan program.\n  That was about a $61 billion transfer from the banks getting these \nrisk-free government subsidies to basically putting it in so that \nstudents could get more of the money. So under that provision, for \nexample, $36 billion of those savings went to increasing the Pell \ngrants. So now we have a higher Pell grant award and it is indexed to \nthe rising cost of living.\n  The Cruz amendment--maybe the Senator didn't understand it when he \ndrafted it--in the drafting of it, does away with that. So if my \ncolleagues vote for the Cruz amendment, they are, in fact, voting to \ncut Pell grants. Go back and tell your colleges and universities that. \nYou may not know that, but that is what is in that Cruz amendment.\n  Also, $2.55 billion went to investments in historically Black \ncolleges and universities serving minority students. That would be cut \nout with the Cruz amendment. Another $2 billion went to community \ncolleges, and that would be cut out by the Cruz amendment.\n  So it is not just the Affordable Care Act, folks, that is being cut \nor done away with by the Cruz amendment but all of the things we did to \nbolster education for minority students and for disadvantaged students, \nand in raising the Pell grants. I would ask my colleagues to talk to \ntheir private colleges, talk to their universities in their States and \nsee what they think about this. See what they think about cutting down \non the Pell grants. That would be the exact result of passing the Cruz \namendment.\n  There is one other thing we did in that portion of the reconciliation \nbill. We also put in place a more generous income-based repayment \nsystem so that students who graduate from college can base their \nrepayment on a smaller portion of their discretionary income. We capped \nit. We capped the student loan repayment to 10 percent of discretionary \nincome so that when students get out and get a job, they only have to \npay a maximum of 10 percent of their discretionary income to repay \ntheir student loans. That would be done away with in the Cruz \namendment. I wanted to point that out. Maybe the Senator didn't realize \nit when he drafted the amendment, but that is the way it is drafted and \nthat is the way the vote will occur. So if my colleagues think they are \njust voting to do away with the Affordable Care Act, look again at the \namendment. It is not just that, it is education funding also. So I \nwanted to point that out.\n  We are going to hear a lot about a lot of bad amendments coming up \ntoday, but this is truly a very bad amendment. Maybe it should have \nbeen drafted differently to accomplish what the Senator from Texas \nwanted. If that was a clean vote on doing away with the Affordable Care \nAct, fine, if he wants to do that, but the way it is drafted it cuts \nPell grants, assistance for community colleges, and all the things we \ndid to help students get a higher education in this country. I wanted \nto let Senators know that.\n  If I have at least 30 seconds or 60 seconds left, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am happy to yield 3 additional minutes \nto the Senator from Iowa.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I invite all Senators, before we start \nvoting today, to read the Washington Post this morning, the front-page \nstory: ``On Montana Reservation, Cuts Hit Hard.'' It talks about the \nFort Peck reservation and what is going to happen there to these \nstudents and these families on this reservation. Please read it. \nPlease.\n  How can we be so cruel? How can we be so heartless? How can we be so \nimmune from understanding the impact\n\n[[Page S2244]]\n\nof the sequester and what is happening to poor kids? This is one \nclassic example.\n  As one teacher there said: You know, if you have a lot and you cut 5 \npercent, that is not much. But when you don't have anything, cutting 5 \npercent really hurts.\n  The article talks about how much they are going to lose in their Head \nStart Program, how many students are going to lose because they do not \nhave support systems on the reservation. It tears your heart out to \nread this.\n  I think about the kind of votes we are going to be having today and \nthe impact of those votes on these kids and these families on this \nreservation. They have no place else to turn. They have no place else \nto turn. It is not as though they have property taxes on the \nreservation. They do not have that. They do not have businesses there. \nThey do not have anything. But you know what I would like most of all \nfor colleagues to know? One person was quoted as saying: This is not \nsomething we are giving our Native Americans, this is something we owe \nthem. This is something we owe them. Read your history--all the land we \ntook from them. Helping them on reservations is not a gift. We owe them \nthis. And now we are pulling the rug out from underneath them.\n  Read about this young girl whose mother committed suicide and her \nfather is in a drug treatment program in Minnesota. She is 15 years old \nand she is trying to make it, yet we are telling her--basically, with \nour votes here and with this sequester--we don't care. I ask people to \nread that before we start voting today and let your conscience be your \nguide.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Iowa for \nhis long-time passion for young people in this country. As chair of the \nEducation and Health Committee, he has committed his time to making \nsure those who are least among us have opportunity in this country. \nThat is so important. He has spoken eloquently against the Cruz \namendment, reminding all of us that amendment isn't just about \nrepealing health care but actually taking away the ability for students \nto be able to go to college on Pell grants and student loans.\n  I would not be standing in front of us today if our country hadn't \ninvested in me way back to give me the ability to go to college on \nstudent loans and Pell grants. So I want to thank him, on behalf of a \nvery grateful country, for his long-time work on this. And as we all \nknow, the Senator will be retiring. We will miss his voice, but his \npassion will always remain here.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I do have some remarks, and we will be having some \nspeakers, who I think are on the way.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I withhold my request.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, the Ryan budget is not going to get rid of Pell \ngrants. Is that the level of debate we have degenerated to here? The \nRyan budget says we are not going to try to balance the budget too \nquickly. We are going to do it over 10 years. We will reach a balance.\n  We have calculated--and it is not disputed--that you can increase \nspending every year 3.4 percent and the budget will balance. You don't \nhave to cut spending. When they talk about cuts, they are talking about \nreducing the projected rate of growth, and that is why we are going \nbroke. That is why this country is losing its moorings. We have defined \ncutting spending as reducing the rate of growth.\n  You cannot sustain 5-percent growth--5.4-percent growth--when your \neconomy is growing at 2 percent. And the experts tell us we are at a \nnew normal and we are not going to see 5-percent growth in the future--\nnot likely. We might have a year or two of it. Bill Gross and his group \nat PIMCO, the great bond company, coined the phrase ``the new normal,'' \nand the new normal is that a mature economy such as ours, with an aging \npopulation, is not going to sustain some of the 9- and 10-percent \ngrowth rates that new and developing nations that are down here can \nachieve. I think that is probably something we have to accommodate, but \nwe need to have policies that create as much growth as possible. That \nis absolutely true.\n  We had no growth last quarter--zero. The Congressional Budget Office \nhas been predicting 3- and 4-percent growth the last 3 years. It is not \nthere. It is not happening. The reason it is not happening is we have \ntoo much debt. The studies of the European Central Bank, the \nInternational Monetary Fund, the Bank of International Settlements, and \nthe magnificent ``This Time It's Different'' by Rogoff and Reinhart \ndemonstrate that statistically, empirically, when nations have this \nhigh a debt--we are at 104 percent of GDP, and Rogoff and Reinhart used \nthe gross debt of America, which is almost $17 trillion now, comparing \nthe gross debt to the size of our economy--that the debt we are \ncarrying is larger than our economy and we have to pay interest on \nthat.\n  There are a lot of other ramifications and instabilities and concerns \nthat ripple through businesses and foreign investors who are going to \ncreate jobs in America, but all sorts of people lose confidence in the \ncountry when the debt reaches that high. They say, from their studies \nof over 200 years of every country that has gone into fiscal crisis, \nthat the debt began to pull them down. They conclude--these Harvard \nprofessors--that we could lose 1 to 2 percent of growth.\n  We are not growing. This is the slowest recovery from a recession \nsince World War II, and I don't think this debt has been recognized in \nand of itself as a detriment to the economy. But what do our colleagues \nsay the answer is? Tax more on the economy and borrow more. Don't \nreduce our debt. Get the sugar high now, as Mr. Gross at PIMCO said. \nAll this borrowing and spending creates a sugar high and you have a \nhangover later.\n  This is so simple. You can't create something from nothing. You know, \nJulie Andrews had that great, great song in the ``Sound of Music,'' \n``Nothing comes from nothing, nothing ever could.''\n  I met a man in Evergreen, AL, in a townhall meeting, who said: My \ndaddy always said that you cannot borrow your way out of debt.\n  We need to listen to that kind of logic. I don't know who these \npeople are who say that Paul Krugman said we can borrow, borrow, \nborrow. The other day, he said he didn't care--even if the Defense \nDepartment had a wasteful program. He said that we should not cut those \nprograms. How ridiculous is that? I think that kind of thinking is the \ndrive behind this budget, that we have to keep spending even if we keep \nrunning up the debt and somehow that is going to make America better \nand create economic growth.\n  I am worried about our working people. They are not doing well. Wages \nhave not gone up in a decade. They are slipping below inflation. It is \nan absolute fact that has happened. The smart people in high-tech \ncompanies are doing well. A lot of them are making money. There are \ncertain sectors of the economy that are doing well, but the economy \nitself is not moving, and I believe the net reason is revealed in the \nRogoff-Reinhart analysis, which says that higher debt pulls down \ngrowth. So we have to do what families do and States have done and \ncities have done, and that is to tighten our belts a little bit.\n  We are proud of the food stamp program, also known as the SNAP \nprogram, but we find that it has all kinds of fraud and abuse in it, \nand it needs to be tightened up. I reject the idea that it is bad for \nthe economy or will hurt people who are legitimately in need of food. \nWe have not done anything like that since the 1996 welfare reform. We \nneed to be doing that throughout the government.\n  One of the ways to create economic growth is to make American \nGovernment more productive and lean. Wouldn't that help? Let's ask this \nquestion: Is Mr. Krugman right? Should the government just spend \nregardless of whether the program is any good? Shouldn't we say to \nourselves: Isn't it clear without any real dispute that if our \ngovernment spent its money on things that are productive for America, \nthis would make America stronger? We have to eliminate every single \nwasteful program. We don't have a single dollar to waste.\n\n[[Page S2245]]\n\n  Our colleagues here are saying to the American people that there is \nnothing wrong. Our government is fine. We cannot cut any program. If we \ndo, we will deny kids the right to go to college.\n  There is no reason Pell grants have to be salvaged, but maybe they \nneed to be constricted a little bit. Maybe there are some abuses in \nthose programs.\n  The growth of spending can increase every year at 3.4 percent. We are \nnot required to damage, savage, or devastate the American economy to \nget the budget balanced. I appreciate the opportunity to share these \nremarks. I really believe the budget process is a bit messy and \nfrustrating, but it is a good one. It has allowed us all to talk \nhonestly about the great choices we face.\n  I am pleased to see Senator Thune, a supporter of the leadership on \nthe Republican side, an outstanding Senator and longtime member of the \nBudget Committee who has been engaged in the financial issues of our \ntime for quite a number of years.\n  I yield to Senator Thune at this time.\n  Mr. THUNE. If I might, I thank the distinguished ranking member of \nthe Budget Committee for yielding, and I will pose a question to the \nSenator, if I might.\n  I heard Senator Sessions say earlier and put up a chart which \nsuggested that the term ``balanced'' had been used 191 times by the \nother side in the course of this debate. Is that correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct. We probably missed a few.\n  Mr. THUNE. That may be an incomplete count, but nevertheless the \nSenator and his staff counted 191 times where the word ``balanced'' has \nbeen used. As the Senator from Alabama very fittingly pointed out, \nthere is nothing balanced about this budget. In fact, this budget \ndoesn't balance in 10 years; it doesn't ever balance.\n  The other thing I would suggest to my colleague from Alabama is that \nin the course of the debate, it has become clear to me--and I think \nclear to anybody who has been observing this--that the so-called \nbalanced approach they advocate is anything but balanced.\n  We have a $1.5 trillion tax increase. We have a spending increase \nthat is at 62 percent over the course of the next decade--a net \nspending increase notwithstanding their assertions that somehow this is \na reduction in spending. The whole idea that this is ``a balanced \napproach'' strikes me as a big charade. I think that is what this \nentire budget is. That is why all the editorial pages across the \ncountry, including those from newspapers that are not considered the \nleast bit conservative--many of us in the Chamber who are on this side \nof the aisle expect most of the newspapers around the country and their \neditorial pages to attack Republicans and Republican budgets--have \nabsolutely eviscerated in their editorial comments the budget that has \nbeen put forth by the Senate Democrats. I think it is simply because it \nis anything but balanced.\n  When they used the word ``balanced'' 191 times on the floor of the \nSenate with regard to this debate, if we think about the ``balanced \napproach'' they talk about--even when we were dealing with the fiscal \ncliff, they talked about a balanced approach, but there was no balance \nthere. It was all tax increases. There was a $620 billion tax increase. \nOver the course of the President's first term, we got a $1 trillion tax \nincrease with ObamaCare. If we add those together with some other tax \nincreases that have been added on, we are at $1.7 trillion in new \ntaxes--or new revenues, as they say.\n  We want balance. Well, we have $1.7 trillion in new revenue already, \nand then they are talking about another $1.5 trillion in taxes. Really? \nWhere is the balance in that? This is all about raising taxes and \ngrowing government at the expense of the economy.\n  I say to my colleague from Alabama, we are going to vote on an \namendment pretty soon by the Senator from New Hampshire, Ms. Ayotte, \nthat raises a point of order against any tax increase that would occur \nuntil the unemployment rates gets back down to 5.5 percent, which is \nwhat the President and White House said in 2009 would be the \nunemployment rate by now without the stimulus. It is hard to imagine \nthat after spending $1 trillion that was borrowed from our children and \ngrandchildren to ``stimulate the economy'' and still having an \nunemployment rate that hovers around 8 percent, they would be talking \nabout yet more taxes when we know that raising taxes does nothing but \nhurt the economy and hurt job growth.\n\n  If the real goal is to get deficits and debt under control--my \ncolleague from Alabama shares my view--the best way to do that is to \nexpand the economy. We need to have people working again, investing, \nand paying taxes. We don't need less revenue, we need more revenue in \norder to have a growing economy. That is what we should have before us. \nThis budget does the opposite. It adds $7.3 trillion to the Federal \ndebt and raises $1.5 trillion in new taxes on top of the $1.7 trillion \ntax increases we have already seen in the last 4 years under this \nadministration. This is a completely wrongheaded approach, which is why \nit is not just the Republicans in this Chamber who are saying that, it \nis the so-called independent folks out there in the media who say it on \ntheir editorial pages. They are calling it what it is. It is a charade.\n  There is nothing about this exercise we are going through here on the \nSenate floor this week that will solve the Nation's fiscal problems or \nget people back to work or get this economy growing again. I say that \nin terms of a budget. The budget is supposed to confront harsh \nrealities, and it is supposed to set a vision and blueprint and pathway \nfor the future.\n  If this is their pathway--ignoring the problems and sweeping them \nunder the carpet--as far as the long-term structural challenges we face \nwith regard to Social Security and Medicare, this does nothing to \nprotect those programs. It does nothing. There is no reform in here. \nThere is not anything in here that prolongs the programs that people \nrely on today that are headed toward bankruptcy. At the end of this \ndecade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, that is going to \nrepresent 91 percent of all Federal spending. Think about that--91 \npercent of all Federal spending will be composed of mandatory programs. \nOnly 9 percent of the entire budget will be left over to pay interest \non the debt, national security, and all the other discretionary things \nthe government funds.\n  This budget does nothing to address the long-term structural fiscal \nimbalances that face this country. Yet it relies on the same old tried-\nand-failed policy: Well, let's just raise taxes a little more. It will \nbe a tax increase on the rich because Lord knows we are the defenders \nof the middle class.\n  Let me tell the middle class in this country, they cannot raise taxes \nenough on the rich to do all the things they want to do in the form of \ngrowing government and increasing spending. This is going to hit and \npenetrate middle-income Americans. Middle-class families are going to \nget hit with higher taxes because the appetite to spend on the other \nside is endless. It just goes on and on and on, and we are not doing \nanything to address that.\n  We have a spending problem in this country, not a revenue problem or \na tax problem. It isn't that we spend too little or that we tax too \nlittle, it is that we spend too much, and that is what we need to \naddress in this budget. That is where this budget falls terribly short.\n  It is an incredible disappointment to finally--after 4 years--have a \nbudget on the floor of the Senate that is inadequate to the future of \nAmerica and relies on the same old failed policy that raises taxes and \nhurts economic growth and hurts job creation.\n  We are still hovering at 8 percent unemployment. In the last 4 years, \nwe have added $6 trillion to the Federal debt. We have a sluggish \neconomy that is growing at 1.5 to 2 percent, and for the 4-year average \nit has been less than 4 percent. The 60-year historical average is 3.3 \npercent economic growth. If we got back to the normal economic growth \npattern average over the last 60 years, these fiscal challenges we face \nwould be so much smaller by comparison simply because a growing economy \nhelps address all of these problems we are talking about today. \nUnfortunately, the budget we have before us doesn't focus on growing \nthe economy; rather, it focuses on growing the government, and that is \nwhere it falls so miserably short.\n  It is really unfortunate that is the vote we are going to have today. \nMany of the amendments we are going to vote on are an attempt to \nimprove it. I\n\n[[Page S2246]]\n\nhope that the Ayotte amendment will pass and that the tax increases \nincluded in this budget--that the point of order will be approved and \nwill deny any tax increase until we get the unemployment rate back down \nto 5.5 percent. That is where it should be. If we have a growing \neconomy, it would be closer to that number.\n  I support the good efforts of my colleague from Alabama. He has been \nhere on the floor for many, many hours over the last couple of days \ndoing yeoman's work by pointing out the shortcomings in this budget \nthat we are considering before the Senate. The Senator from Alabama has \nlaid out a very different vision for how we can solve these problems.\n  It is really ironic. I am sure this is-- The ACTING PRESIDENT pro \ntempore. The minority time has expired.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I yield back our time so our colleagues \nhave an opportunity to use the term ``balanced'' a few more times \nbefore this debate concludes.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Children's Budget\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized to engage in a \ncolloquy with my good friend from Washington, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Senator Murray.\n  I want to commend the chairman's tireless efforts on this budget \nresolution. She has done the yeomen's work in crafting a document that \nreflects the values of our caucus in a balanced and pragmatic way. This \nstands in sharp contrast to the polarizing and ideologically driven \nbudget our friends in the House passed earlier this week. As you know I \nhave introduced legislation in the last three Congresses to create what \nI call the ``children's budget.'' This bill would require that the \nexecutive branch agencies include in their annual budget request to \nCongress a detailed analysis on children's programs. This analysis \nwould include a breakdown of the appropriations, spending levels, and \nobligational authority and outlays for each program specifically \ntargeted towards children or that serve children as a major component \nof their mission. Importantly, this would include an analysis not only \nof the fiscal year for which the budget request is being made, but also \nthe previous and current fiscal years, to provide the Budget Committees \nand the Appropriations Committees with a comprehensive look at how \nfunding is affecting the youngest Americans.\n  I have filed an amendment to this concurrent resolution that seeks to \naddress this very issue by encouraging the Appropriations Committees to \nrequest the analysis of children's programs contingent on the agencies' \nfunding. However, I understand through conversations with the Senate \nParliamentarian and others that indicate such an amendment might not \ncomport with the strict requirements and procedures of a budget \nresolution. Is this the chairman's understanding as well?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I want to thank my friend from New Jersey on his \nprevious work to highlight how our budget impacts children and on his \nefforts to do so again today. I agree with him that it is important \nthat we have a full accounting of how the Federal Government serves \nchildren throughout our Nation. However, my friend is correct, and due \nto the strict procedural guidelines of the budget resolution an \namendment that is primarily focused on executive branch agencies falls \noutside the scope of a concurrent resolution such as the one we are \ndebating today. However, I want to assure my friend that I will work \nclosely with him to find a path forward on the children's budget and \nachieve our shared goal of ensuring that the government is doing its \nbest to efficiently and effectively serve our Nation's children.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to seek support for an \namendment to the budget resolution that would discourage aerial \nsurveillance of farms by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  Last year, we learned that EPA had been conducting aerial flyovers of \nlivestock operations in Nebraska, Iowa, and other states. Needless to \nsay, farmers and ranchers were not excited about EPA flying over their \noperations and taking pictures of their farms and homes, which are \noften the same thing. I tried to get straight answers from EPA about \nwhat they were doing, but they were never willing to be forthcoming \nabout this program.\n  In an age when satellite imagery allows us to see the cars parked in \nour driveways, one might be tempted to ask, what's the big deal? Well, \nthe problem is EPA's recent track record on agriculture and what they \nmay do with this information. In spite of several high profile outreach \nevents to farmers, I continually hear about EPA's dismissive attitude \ntowards the people who work hard every day to put food on the plates of \nmillions of people.\n  Some members of this Administration and the media have mocked us farm \nstate Senators for ``crying over spilled milk'' and fretting about \n``phantom dust rules.'' But we were not using these fears to whip up \nfarmers into an anti-EPA frenzy. Yes these rules were far-fetched, but \nwhat had farmers justifiably worried was that EPA was actually \nconsidering them.\n  It took months and several votes before EPA backed off on its attempt \nto regulate milk spills like oil spills. It's the same story on farm \ndust. Harvesting crops and driving down country roads is dusty work, \nespecially when we have persistent drought like much of the country is \nin now.\n  But EPA still took months to decide that it would not regulate dust. \nInternal policy documents at EPA recommended that particulate matter \nstandards be revised to include coarse particulate matter, also known \nas dust. We should have had a final answer from EPA right away that \nthey would not regulate dust, but it took the threat of legislation to \nforce their hand.\n  And that's just the low-hanging fruit. I've heard many stories of \noverly aggressive enforcement by EPA where they don't even need new \nregulations. Regulated entities can find themselves slapped with \nmultiple fines with a time-consuming appeal process, in spite of their \nbest efforts to comply with the numerous regulations we place on them.\n  The last EPA Administrator, Lisa Jackson, said that her biggest \nregret was her poor relationship with rural America. Well, that was \ncertainly frustrating to me as well. But she found an odd way of \nexpressing that regret. In the waning days of her tenure, she released \nprivate information on thousands of farms to several environmentalist \ngroups.\n  It's no secret that environmental groups based in New York, \nPhiladelphia, and San Francisco don't always get along with farmers and \nranchers in states like Nebraska. These groups do not regulate \npollution. Congress has not told EPA to release information to them.\n  Their only interest in agriculture is in radically reinventing crop \nand livestock production based on idealistic notions and not on the \nreality of what it takes to feed the world. Why EPA decided it was \nprudent to release farmers' and ranchers' personal information to these \ngroups is beyond me.\n  Is it really any wonder why farmers and ranchers don't believe EPA \nsupports agriculture? They don't trust EPA . . . and they sure don't \nwant them doing low-altitude surveillance flights over their private \nproperty.\n  These concerns are bipartisan--last year we voted on an amendment to \nstop this surveillance and it received fifty-six votes from members of \nboth parties. Yet, EPA has not been forthcoming about this program and \nhas never been willing to answer basic questions about the number of \nflights they conduct.\n  In fact, we never received any information from EPA headquarters--\nonly from a regional office--despite multiple requests. The public \ndeserves open and honest information about the agency's use of aerial \nsurveillance across the country.\n  So, until EPA takes a more common-sense, transparent approach, we \nneed to stop the EPA's aerial surveillance of our agricultural \noperations that has raised significant privacy concerns. This amendment \ndoes that, yet it does not hinder the use of traditional on-site \ninspections to ensure our waterways are clean.\n  I ask my Colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire, Ms. \nAyotte, has filed Senate amendment No. 161, which reinforces the \ncurrent requirement for the Department of Defense to be fully \nfinancially auditable by the year 2017. I fully support the\n\n[[Page S2247]]\n\namendment and have joined as a co-sponsor, as auditability is an \nimportant step to managing a budget, especially one in the hundreds of \nbillions of dollars.\n  I wish to clarify, however, that the amendment should not be seen as \nsuperseding existing requirements for agencies within the Intelligence \nCommunity, including those in the Department of Defense, to be fully \nauditable by 2016. The Select Committee on Intelligence, which I chair, \nhas been pushing the intelligence community for years to improve its \nauditability, and I am pleased to say that recently there has been \nsignificant progress in this area. We will continue to conduct \noversight and ensure that agencies have the tools and resources they \nneed to be fully auditable by 2016, notwithstanding the 2017 date for \nauditability by the rest of the Defense Department.\n  The Intelligence Committee staff has confirmed with Senator Ayotte's \noffice that this is the Senator's understanding and intent with the \namendment as well.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No. 136, \nwhich creates a prohibition on funding for the Medium Extended Air \nDefense System, MEADS.\n  This amendment is consistent with the House Appropriations, House \nArmed Services, and Senate Armed Services Committee positions to stop \nwasting taxpayer dollars on this bloated, inefficient program the \nDepartment of Defense doesn't even intend to buy.\n  In February 2010, the Department of Defense stated in a memo, which \nis available online, that the program has ``encountered significant \nschedule and cost overruns since its inception in the 1990s.''\n  I want to stress that we have been investing in this system since the \n1990s and it hasn't delivered. Billions and billions of dollars have \nbeen wasted.\n  As far as I can tell, more than two decades later, all we have bought \nwith those billions is full page ads in newspapers that Senators and \nstaff read asking us to give more money to the program.\n  It's time we stopped wasting valuable dollars on programs which do \nnothing for Americans, nothing for the warfighter and nothing to \npromote our national security.\n  This is simple really. The amendment places a prohibition on further \nfunds for the program.\n  So I ask my colleagues, do you want to eliminate wasteful spending or \nnot?\n  Do you want to support warfighter needs or Pentagon pork?\n  Do you really want to keep paying China for our debt because the \nPentagon won't stop sinking money in a program that has no value to our \ntroops when they are facing real threats overseas?\n  Working with my colleague, Senator Kelly Ayotte, we made a law in the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 prohibiting \nfunds from being spent on the program.\n  It's imperative we send a message to the Pentagon we won't tolerate \nmore requests for fancy pictures in Capitol Hill newspapers. Our \nmilitary needs equipment to help them defeat the enemy and equipment to \nprotect them. Not pictures and power point slides two decades later.\n  I want to commend Senator Ayotte's efforts on the floor the last \ncouple of weeks to stop wasteful spending on this ``missile to \nnowhere''--as she calls it.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the \namendment.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I want to commend the majority for \nfinally allowing us to have this debate. This is the first time since I \nwas elected to the Senate that we will have the opportunity to vote on \na Senate budget resolution. The budget they produced is far from what \nour country needs, but the fact that we are having this debate today is \na very positive step in the right direction.\n  Passing a budget is the basic principle of a government. For too long \nnow, Washington has been operating without one. The American people \ndon't have this luxury. Arkansans ask me, almost daily, how we can \nspend money we don't have because they can't. They are forced to live \nwithin their means while Washington isn't. So I am pleased to see we \nare putting an end to this unacceptable trend.\n  Unfortunately, this budget plan falls far short of what we need to \nget our fiscal house in order and get our economy back on track.\n  At a time when we need to put Americans back to work, the majority \nhas offered a budget that makes jobs disappear. At a time when we need \nto cut spending, the majority's proposal increases spending by 62 \npercent over the next decade. At a time when we need comprehensive \nreform to ease the tax burden hard-working Americans face, the majority \nraises taxes another $1.5 trillion. And at a time when we need to be \npaying down the national debt, the majority's budget adds another 7.3 \ntrillion to it.\n  I can tell you what the people of Arkansas think about this budget. \nOur State is required to balance its budget. Every year, the \nlegislators who serve in Little Rock have to make the difficult \ndecisions that come with that obligation. They make it work. Washington \ncan too.\n  We need to stop looking to the Federal Government to solve all our \nproblems. The majority's budget proposal not only perpetuates the myth \nthat big government is the answer, but it doubles down on it. It is \ntime to empower the American people by passing a budget that is a \nblueprint for economic growth and prosperity, rather than bureaucratic \ngrowth and massive debt.\n  Focusing on a progrowth budget is the only way we will speed up the \nslowest economic recovery since World War II. We aren't going to get \nthere by continuing to do the status quo. It hasn't worked.\n  I don't say all of this to cast doubt on anyone's intentions. I \nbelieve everyone in this Chamber is working for what they believe is in \nthe best interest of the American people. We all want to save future \ngenerations from the burden of debt; create an environment where the \neconomy can grow; protect our entitlement programs for future \ngenerations; and create a fair tax system that allows every American to \nkeep more of his or her hard-earned money.\n  These are all admirable goals. I believe they are goals every one of \nmy colleagues would like to accomplish. And the good news is that they \nare achievable.\n  If we balance the budget now, we save future generations from the \nburden of debt.\n  If we pursue policies that focus on growing the private sector \neconomy, we can create rising wages and better jobs.\n  If we address the looming crisis with our entitlement programs, we \ncan protect Social Security and Medicare for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  If we enact comprehensive tax reform, we can ensure that every \nAmerican keeps more of his or her hard-earned money and help small \nbusinesses grow.\n  It all starts with a responsible budget. While I am pleased we are \ngoing to have a vote on a Senate-created budget, it fails on too many \nlevels to warrant passage. I urge my colleagues to reject the \nmajority's budget and focus our efforts on one that will help us \naccomplish our mutual goals.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, a federal budget outlines our priorities \nas a Nation. On both sides of the aisle, we should be able to agree: We \nneed to be wise about our Federal investments. We should be investing \nin what works--in what gives us the biggest bang for our buck.\n  For decades, study after study has shown what parents already know--\nthat quality early education is foundational for success in school and \nlife. Quality early education can help kids enter kindergarten ready to \nlearn and avoid falling behind. Later in life, kids with quality early \nlearning are more likely to avoid crime or teen pregnancy. They \ngraduate high school and college, avoid poverty, earn more income, and \npay more taxes. That is more revenue for our long-term fiscal picture.\n  We want to cut unnecessary public spending? Kids with preschool are \nless likely to need public services--from assistance for needy families \n. . . to prisons.\n  For a generation, long-term studies have found that investing $1 in \nquality early learning brings a return on investment of between $2 and \n$17 after a generation. In Hawaii, a study for Good Beginnings Alliance \nfound we would get $4.20 for every dollar invested. Nobel prize winning \neconomist Jim Heckman did the math over a full lifetime. He estimates \nan average 7 to 10\n\n[[Page S2248]]\n\npercent return on investment per year. In the private sector, business \nleaders would do anything for a return like that.\n  On Wall Street, you can't get a long-term return like that in the \nstock market. So it makes sense that business and financial leaders \nsupport quality early learning, from the Hawaii Business Roundtable to \nFederal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, to leading CEOs, who know that \nto train tomorrow's workers we must start early.\n  Law enforcement officials know that quality early learning helps \nprevent kids from falling behind, dropping out of high school, or \ngetting involved in crime. Military generals and admirals have stressed \nthe importance of quality early education as a national security issue. \nToday 75 percent of Americans age 17 to 24 are ineligible for military \nservice due to poor education, physical unfitness or involvement with \ncrime. Quality early learning helps kids get on the right path--before \nthey fall behind. Parents know the high cost of childcare is difficult \nto afford. But parents want more than just safety and supervision for \ntheir children. Parents want their children to be prepared \nacademically, socially, and emotionally for success in school and in \nlife.\n  Teachers and school administrators know firsthand that their students \nwho come to kindergarten with quality preschool are more likely to \nsucceed. We have special education professionals and advocates for \nstudents with disabilities. They know quality early learning can \nidentify disabilities early and bring intervention to get kids on track \nwith their peers. That can save billions of dollars in more expensive \nspecial education services down the line.\n  In our States, Governors from both red States and blue States know \nthis is important. In Hawaii we have Governor Abercrombie. In \nMassachussetts we have Deval Patrick. But also in Louisiana, Governor \nBobby Jindal is pushing for quality early education. In Georgia, \nGovemor Nathan Deal is pushing for quality early education. In Alabama, \nGovernor Bob Bentley is pushing for quality early education. Oklahoma \nis a bright red State and they have been doing quality early education \nfor years.\n  In February, President Obama called for new support for quality early \nlearning. This is the first time we have ever seen this in a State of \nthe Union Address. States are asking their leaders in Congress to act. \nToday's Senate budget has a deficit-neutral reserve fund for early \nchildhood education.\n  Here is what that means. It means let's find a way to pass \nlegislation in this Congress. One of the best investments we can make \nlong-term that does NOT hurt our deficit in the next 10 years. Let's \ninvest in what works: high-quality pre-K for low-income children; high-\nquality childcare for working families; and high-quality home visiting \nprograms serving low-income mothers-to-be and low-income families.\n  This helps get poor children the health and social services they need \nbefore it is too late.\n  Patty Murray has been working to strengthen quality early education \nfor a long time. She was a mom in tennis shoes. She was a preschool \nteacher. In the 1980s, she organized 13,000 parents to save a \nWashington State preschool program. I thank Patty for her work on this \nissue in the budget. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nwork with us on early childhood education in this budget and in this \nCongress. It is one of the best things we can do for our long-term \neconomic health and for our children.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 430\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for years many of the largest U.S. \nmultinational corporations have been exploiting offshore tax haven \nloopholes in the U.S. Tax Code to avoid paying billions in U.S. \ncorporate income tax.\n  According to a recent Bloomberg report analyzing publicly available \nU.S. corporate financial data, ``Eighty-three U.S. companies have \nstockpiled $1.43 trillion in untaxed profits in foreign countries.'' \nAccording to the same report, ``THE six biggest U.S. drug-makers \navoided paying $7.05 billion in U.S. taxes last year by shifting their \nprofits overseas,'' nearly doubling ``the amount they saved using the \nsame strategy 10 years earlier.''\n  It is time for Congress to close the special interest loopholes that \nallow sophisticated multinational corporations to defer U.S. income tax \nthrough various foreign tax sheltering techniques and offshore tax \nhavens. Senator Levin's amendment No. 430 supports legislation to end \nthe abuse of offshore tax shelters. I am cosponsoring this amendment to \nbegin the process of closing the egregious loopholes.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I support budgets that make tough but \nnecessary spending reductions, save our safety net programs, and \npreserve our commitment to protecting Americans and our interests at \nhome and abroad.\n  Facing our current debt disaster, there should be no sacred cows in \nthe Federal budget. If there is waste, it should be eliminated. If \ngovernment dependency is depressing individual initiative, we must \nreform those programs. Where important and valid programs are destined \nfor bankruptcy, we must save them.\n  Senator Paul deserves lots of praise for taking our debt problem \nseriously and coming up with a plan to solve it. While there are many \nobjectives I support in his budget--including the repeal of ObamaCare \nand Dodd-Frank, allowing the Keystone Pipeline to move forward, and \nbringing our regulations under control through the REINS Act--I could \nnot support it tonight.\n  One of the most solemn promises I made to Floridians was to work to \nsave Social Security without implementing personal accounts, which \nwould actually make it harder to get the programs finances in order. \nThis budget plan calls for Social Security personal accounts, something \nI do not support.\n  On national security issues, we also can't walk away from our \ncommitments abroad, which this budget would do by drastically reducing \nthe size and scope of the U.S. military by ending agreements with \nforeign partners, closing many overseas installations, and bringing \ntroops home from Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Military reductions \nwould also result from a policy of attrition, a concerning factor \nbecause it means we would not be not be replacing the officer corps \nthat leads our brave men and women.\n  Whereas the current fiscal year 13 budget for the Defense Department \nis $614 billion, this budget would be $546 billion, with $554 billion \nin fiscal year 14--figures that would further strain readiness and \nimpair force projection.\n  Especially during this dangerous time when our enemies would be \nemboldened to see us abandon our allies around the world, I cannot \nsupport a budget that would make the world less safe place because the \nU.S. defense capabilities and our ability to influence events around \nthe world are diminished.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the Senate will vote this evening on an \namendment offered by Senator Durbin to establish a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund supporting legislation that would allow States to enforce \nState and local use sales tax laws. I will vote in support of this \namendment because I believe it is important to levy sales taxes fairly \nand consistently and because States, especially those currently facing \nbudgetary challenges, need to have the tools necessary to collect \nrevenues that are lawfully due. With that said, my support for this \namendment should not be mistaken as support for any specific \nlegislative proposal, including the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013, \nS. 336. I look forward to working with Senators Durbin and Enzi, the \nleaders of this effort, in the months ahead to craft a legislative \nproposal that meets these goals without unduly burdening small \nbusinesses or States, such as New York, that already have a system for \ncollecting sales taxes from online retailers.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as we consider the budget resolution, \nlaying out a blueprint for how we invest in our Nation's priorities, I \nurge my colleagues to support my amendment creating a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund to allow for the growth of the National Institutes of \nHealth, NIH.\n  We all have benefited from medical innovations and cures supported by \nthe NIH. If you have ever faced the diagnosis of an illness in your \nfamily and turned to the doctor to ask: ``Is there a cure? Is there a \ntreatment?'' then you understand the importance of NIH research for \nyour family. Great medical care is only as good as the science behind \nit. Drugs and devices work only as well as our understanding of the \nmedical condition we are treating. NIH\n\n[[Page S2249]]\n\nsupport has established the U.S. as a global leader in medical \ninnovations that save lives, and we are on the verge of so many life-\nchanging discoveries.\n  We all remember the 1980s as the AIDS epidemic gripped our country \nand the world with a disease that was at that time a death sentence. \nBut now thanks to drugs created with NIH support, people with HIV can \nlive a long, productive life into old age. Ironically, the same week \nthat sequestration took effect, a groundbreaking medical discovery \nsupported by NIH was made in AIDS research. A 2-year old baby in \nMississippi born with HIV may be the first child to be functionally \ncured of the disease after receiving a cocktail of drugs. This study \nwas supported by the NIH, and NIH played a key role in the development \nof the drugs used to treat the toddler.\n  Our country is rich with promising research just like this and rich \nwith bright minds, curious scientists, and innovative labs engaged in \nwork that will lead to a cure for AIDS and treatments for diseases like \ncancer and Alzheimer's. But cuts to NIH could curb the promise of these \nmedical discoveries.\n  The medical advancements for which we owe our thanks to NIH are many. \nThanks to NIH-supported research, the likelihood that a child with \nleukemia will survive for 5 years is now 90 percent. And 152 new FDA-\napproved drugs and vaccines have been discovered with NIH support over \nthe last 40 years. Just 2 weeks ago, I talked with a researcher at the \nUniversity of Illinois Chicago who credited NIH-supported research that \ncreated a blockbuster new drug to treat HIV.\n  NIH-led research developed beta blockers, a commonly used drug to \ntreat high blood pressure. And thanks to these drugs, fewer people are \nhospitalized for cardiovascular disease, saving lives and also saving \ncosts to Medicare and the Federal Government of $6,000 per patient. \nInvestments from NIH in the Human Genome Project opened the door to \ncountless medical discoveries and cures and generated $796 billion in \neconomic output--a return on investment of $141 for every $1. A \npromising NIH-supported project at the University of Pittsburg School \nof Medicine is working to allow people with paralysis to move a \nmechanical arm with their minds. Imagine how this innovation could \nimprove the lives of people paralyzed from a stroke and servicemembers \nwith spinal injuries.\n  I would like to share the experience of Stevie Conti, a 25-year-old \nwoman from Deerfield, IL, who has cystic fibrosis, a rare disease that \nimpacts about 30,000 people in the U.S. Stevie loves cooking and \nhanging out with friends. Her twin sister says she is the last to \ncomplain about anything, including her health. Thanks to investments \nfrom the NIH, tremendous scientific breakthroughs in genetic mapping \nand drugs are improving the lives of people with cystic fibrosis. A \nlittle over a year ago, FDA approved a groundbreaking new drug, called \nKalydeco, which is the first drug to treat the genetic cause of cystic \nfibrosis in some people.\n  Since Stevie started taking Kalydeco her health has improved by leaps \nand bounds, and she is able to do simple things that many of us take \nfor granted. She has gained 10 pounds and can run a mile without \ncoughing or feeling short of breath. Stevie has landed her dream job \nand is able to work 40 hours a week without feeling tired and still has \nenough energy to hang out with friends after work. Stevie says this \ndrug has changed her life. NIH-supported research and scientists are \nhelping people, like Stevie, live healthier, more productive lives. \nRight now, when so much good research is showing us the way forward, we \nshould be doubling down on biomedical research and infrastructure.\n  Due to several years of flat funding and cuts, the current NIH budget \nis insufficient to fund all of the critical research that needs to be \ndone. Due to cuts to NIH funding and the failure to keep up with rising \nresearch costs, the number of research grants funded by NIH has \ndeclined every year since 2004. In 2012, NIH funded 3,100 fewer grants \nthan in 2004. Cutting back on biomedical research is a shortsighted act \nthat undermines everything we are trying to do for this country. \nMedical research saves lives, keeps America's place as a leader in \nscience and medicine, and generates economic growth. Every State and \nthe District of Columbia receive NIH funding. These awards go to \nuniversities, businesses, and research centers--engines of growth for \nlocal economies.\n  Not only is NIH dealing with years of insufficient funding, on March \n1 sequestration went into effect imposing mindless, across-the-board \ncuts for critical, federally supported programs like defense, \neducation, aviation safety, and scientific research. This is a \nmanufactured crisis that never should have happened. We need to reduce \nour deficit in a thoughtful and sensitive way, but sequestration is a \nhatchet approach that cuts from vital programs that protect our Nation \nand economic growth. A $1.6 billion cut to the NIH, due to \nsequestration, will cause 20,000 jobs to be lost. A cut of this \nmagnitude will have a ripple effect that will hurt every State in our \nUnion.\n  Last year, Illinois received $746 million in NIH funding. \nSequestration would cause Illinois to lose $38 million. That translates \nto 700 fewer jobs, less innovation, and a slowdown of economic growth \nin my State. Our country is just starting to recover from a recession. \nWe cannot afford a mindless cut that will lay off hard-working people \nand stall economic growth.\n  Every $1 in NIH funding stimulates $2.21 in business activity that \ndevelops around research, such as biotech companies that provide \nsupplies, food services and restaurants, building construction, and \nhiring support staff. As research projects slow and then stop, the \ncompanies that provide equipment and supplies and the construction \nprojects to expand research facilities also slow and then stop. Some \nU.S.-based companies that provide lab supplies to researchers expect \nthat a cut to NIH will cause a drop in sales and slow down production \nlines forcing companies to close sites and lay off workers.\n  Dr. Francis Collins, the Director of the NIH, says there is no \nquestion that sequestration will slow the development of an influenza \nvaccine and our progress with cancer research.\n  Eli Zerhouni, the head of NIH under President George W. Bush, says:\n\n       We are going to maim our innovation capabilities if you do \n     these abrupt deep cuts at NIH. It will impact science for \n     generations to come.\n\n  Insufficient funding and cuts to NIH will force the agency to not \naward some grants. And it may need to reduce awards that have already \nbeen announced. Research and clinical trials that have already started \nare less likely to be given funding to continue, so promising projects \nwill be terminated, suspended or forced to lay off workers.\n  I would like to share the story of Dr. Teresa Woodruff, a researcher \nand professor at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine. \nDr. Woodruff is leading one of the first major studies on the impact of \nsuperfund environmental toxins on reproductive health. Her work could \nhelp us understand the health risks of certain chemicals and how \npollutants enter the human body. The Monday after sequestration took \neffect, Dr. Woodruff was delighted to learn that the NIH had awarded \nfunding for her research, but disappointed to learn that--due to \nsequestration--the grant was cut by more than half.\n  Dr. Woodruff is thankful for the NIH funding, but this cut means she \nwill have to drop key parts of her research, like studying the impact \nof toxins on men and children and how pollutants end up in the food we \neat. Because of the drastic cut in funding, Dr. Woodruff will not hire \nnew people and will have fewer training slots to teach the next \ngeneration of scientists. Dr. Woodruff's experience is being played out \nacross the country as promising researchers are forced to stall \nclinical trials and lay off support staff.\n  The percent of NIH grants being awarded since the 1960s has dropped \nsignificantly. Currently, less than one in every five grants to the NIH \nis awarded funding. The primary reason for this decline is insufficient \nfunding. Less funding will result in fewer grants being awarded, and \nthe group of researchers most impacted by this cut is young \nresearchers. Once we add the $1.6 billion cut due to sequestration, we \nrisk losing a new generation of scientists in our Nation.\n  Less funding means fewer academic grants to educate young scientists.\n\n[[Page S2250]]\n\nAnd more competition for grants makes it difficult for young scientists \nto win funding and dissuades new scientists from pursuing careers in \nresearch. When and if NIH funding eventually increases, projects will \nstruggle to find and train talented scientists who will make tomorrow's \ndiscoveries.\n  For over a century, NIH-supported scientists have led the way for \nimportant breakthroughs to improve health and save lives through \ndiscoveries--discoveries such as development of the MRI, extending the \nlife expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis, revolutionizing our \nthinking about cancer, and creating vaccines.\n  Two weeks ago, I received a letter from a man named Andrew Young from \nVernon Hills, IL. His 16-year-old sister Emily has a rare disease \ncalled Friedreich's Ataxia, a rare disease that makes it hard to \nperform basic motor functions like walk, write, and speak. Most young \npeople with FA need to use a cane or wheelchair by their teens. Emily's \nworld was turned upside down in 2008 when she was diagnosed with FA, \nbut she refuses to let it define her. She wants to go to college and \npractice medicine and hopes for a cure one day.\n  Now is not the time to disinvest in NIH and close the door to finding \ncures for people like Emily. Disinvestment in NIH would be a \nshortsighted act that risks forfeiting the U.S.'s position as a leader \nin biomedical research and reaping the economic and biomedical rewards \nof scientific research. These cuts don't make sense for--patients, \nlocal economies, or our Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and to ensure our \ncountry creates and benefits from the life-changing medical discoveries \nsupported by the National Institutes of Health.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of \norganizations that support my amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Organization That Support the Durbin-Moran NIH Amendment\n\n       Research!America\n       American Lung Association\n       American Heart Association\n       United for Medical Research\n       FASEB (Federation of American Societies for Experimental \n     Biology)\n       American Society of Transplantation (AST)\n       The Endocrine Society\n       American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, Inc.\n       Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)\n       American Association for Cancer Research\n       Association of Minority Health Professions Schools\n       Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America\n       Digestive Disease National Coalition\n       Dystonia Medical Research Foundation\n       GBS/CIDP Foundation International\n       International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal \n     Disorders\n       Interstitial Cystitis Association\n       Joint Advocacy Coalition\n       National Alopecia Areata Foundation\n       National Kidney Foundation\n       National Marfan Foundation\n       NephCure Foundation\n       Pulmonary Hypertension Association\n       Scleroderma Foundation\n       Sleep Research Society\n       US Hereditary Angioedema Association.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority has 17 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nHampshire and 7 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, the chairman of the Budget Committee has \ndone an excellent job. While I appreciate the comments of my colleague \nfrom South Dakota, I actually think that in order to deal with the \nbudget challenges facing the country, we have to look at both revenues \nand spending.\n  One of the areas of spending that have been the most problematic has \nbeen health care costs. It has been one of the fastest growing costs \nfor the Federal Government, and what we have to do is look at how we \ncan lower the health care costs.\n  The amendment I proposed that we are going to vote on this morning, \namendment No. 438, is one that actually reduces health care costs.\n  In the 3 years since the Affordable Care Act was passed, women's \naccess to affordable health care has improved. Women now have access to \na wide range of preventive services, such as well-women appointments, \nscreenings for cancer, diabetes, HIV, and counseling for domestic \nviolence. All women now have access to contraceptive coverage for free \nthrough their insurance plans. Ninety-nine percent of women report that \nthey have used birth control at some point in their lives, and access \nto birth control is directly linked to the decline in maternal and \ninfant mortality. I think that is a really important message we need to \nget across to people. There is a direct connection between access to \nbirth control and maternal and infant mortality. Access to birth \ncontrol can also reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. It is linked to \noverall good health outcomes.\n\n  Sadly, the United States has one of the highest rates of unintended \npregnancies in the industrialized world, and preventing unintended \npregnancies just makes fiscal sense. Studies have found that medical \nservices to women who experience unintended pregnancies and to infants \nwho are born as a result of such pregnancies can cost taxpayers up to \n$12 billion a year.\n  My State of New Hampshire has one of the lowest teen birth rates in \nthe country. As Governor, I was proud to sign a law that required \nhealth care plans to cover contraception. It was a law that passed with \noverwhelming bipartisan support in our legislature. The fact is that \naccessible family planning matters, and it can make a difference.\n  Despite the research which shows that investments in women's health \nmake sense, we continue to see efforts to deprive women from receiving \nthe most basic of care.\n  The amendment I am going to be offering this morning will protect \nwomen's access to primary and preventive health care, to family \nplanning, and to birth control. At the most basic level, this amendment \nensures that a woman's family planning decisions are ones she makes \nwith her doctor and her family, and that they are not dictated by \ngovernment or by her employer.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Thank you. So I hope my colleagues will support the \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota has requested \n10 minutes, and I yield to him 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the budget we are \nproposing. It has three basic guiding principles: First, we must \nprotect our fragile economic recovery by creating jobs and investing in \neconomic growth.\n  I remember when we did this during the Clinton administration. \nPresident Clinton proposed as a deficit reduction package raising \nincome taxes on those who earned above $250,000 at 39.6 percent. Every \nRepublican voted against it, and many of them went on record saying it \nwas going to cause a recession. Some Members of this body voted against \nit saying it was going to cause a recession and it would be Clinton's \nrecession. So 22.7 million jobs later there was no deficit. We had a \nsurplus.\n  This idea we hear from the other side that every time we raise taxes \nwe hurt the economy just defies history. All we have to do is look at \nrecent history, and especially now, at a time when there is a growing \ndisparity in income in our country.\n  What we are trying to do is to promote growth. We promote growth by \ninvesting in that which creates growth. We know what they are. One is \neducation. We are going to cut Pell grants? When my wife was 18 months \nold her father died in a car accident. He was a decorated World War II \nvet, leaving her mom widowed at age 29, with 5 kids, four girls and a \nboy. The boy, my brother-in-law, went into the Coast Guard and he did \n20 years in the Coast Guard and he still works for the Coast Guard. He \nis an electrical engineer in the Coast Guard. He is the second most \nimportant man in my son's life. My son was able to get a master's \ndegree in mechanical engineering from MIT.\n  My three sisters-in-law and Franni went to college on Pell grants and \nscholarships. At that time the full Pell grant paid for 85 percent of a \npublic\n\n[[Page S2251]]\n\ncollege education. Now it pays for less than 35 percent. The Presiding \nOfficer knows, because my mother-in-law ended up going to the \nUniversity of Maine. But the Presiding Officer knows that today, kids \nwho go to the University of Maine have debt. All of us know our kids, \nour students have debt. In Minnesota the average debt is $29,000.\n  My wife's family lived on Social Security survivor benefits. My \nmother-in-law went to college on the GI bill. She got a loan on the GI \nbill. She became a teacher, teaching title I kids--because of Social \nSecurity, because of the GI bill. My wife's family was able to just \nbarely get by. They barely made it. Sometimes there wasn't enough food \non the table. Sometimes they turned the phone off, but they made it.\n  We have people now--they all made it into the middle class. The \nladder was there. We are trying to preserve that. They tell us to pull \nourselves up by our boot straps in this country. Sometimes people just \nneed the boots first. The government gave my wife's family the boots, \nand they are all productive members of our society because of programs.\n  We had a hearing in the HELP Committee, and we had a witness whom the \nRepublicans called, and he testified about what creates the middle \nclass. They called a witness who was from the American Enterprise \nInstitute. They are good people at the American Enterprise Institute. \nThe witness's testimony ended with the idea that government can create \njobs is a myth. So when it got to my turn to question him, I said: Have \nyou heard of the Erie Canal? He had. The Erie Canal opened the Midwest \nto Europe. It made shipping our timber and our agricultural goods 97 \npercent more efficient. I asked him if he had heard of the Interstate \nHighway System. He had. I asked him if he understood that we were on C-\nSPAN, as we are right now, the Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network. \nI asked him if he knew who put up the first satellites; it was the \nDefense Department.\n  I noted that he had gone to the University of California at San \nDiego. I asked him if any of his professors had helped him at all. He \nsaid they had. He got his doctorate at UCLA. I asked him if he had \nheard of the Internet. He had.\n  By the end of my questioning, he said: To say that the government \ncan't create jobs would be absurd. It started with the idea that \ngovernment can create jobs is a myth, and he ended his testimony with \nsaying: To say the government can't create jobs would be absurd. There \nwas a 180-degree difference except he added absurdity. So he injected \nit. That is what I used to do. I used to identify absurdity.\n  There is absurd stuff going on and being said here. We are hearing \nthings cited that have been disproved so many times.\n  The budget we are proposing today is based on three guiding \nprinciples. First, we must protect our fragile economic recovery by \ncreating jobs and investing in economic growth. Second, we must tackle \nour deficits in a responsible way. And finally, we need to honor the \npromises we have made to our seniors, our veterans, and our middle \nclass families. This budget does all of those things--and in doing so, \nit reflects our values and our priorities. In contrast, the budget \nbeing debated in the House provides massive tax breaks for the wealthy \nand big corporations, while slashing critical investments that will \nendanger our economic recovery.\n  Everyone agrees we shouldn't saddle our children and grandchildren \nwith insurmountable debt--addressing our debt is a responsibility we \ntake very seriously. But at the same time, if we fail to make the \nnecessary investments in economic growth, public health improvements, \nquality education, rural development, and clean energy, our children \nand grandchildren will inherit an equally unacceptable burden.\n  Drastic cuts to infrastructure, innovation, and education are penny \nwise and pound foolish. Even if we save a little on paper upfront, the \nrealistic long-term effects are costly and devastating. That is why our \nbudget includes a $100 billion infrastructure recovery plan that will \nget workers back on the job, repairing our crumbling schools and \nbridges, and building up our technology infrastructure, so schools and \nsmall businesses, even in rural Minnesota, can stay competitive.\n  It also lays the groundwork to pass a comprehensive 5-year Farm Bill \nthat will provide certainty and support for Minnesota's farmers. This \nbudget plan protects Head Start, early childhood education, and Pell \ngrants--which make a quality education possible for all students, \nregardless of background, and will prepare our children for the 21st \ncentury workforce.\n  This budget demonstrates our commitment to responsible deficit \nreduction. Since the Simpson-Bowles proposal, Congress has reduced the \ndeficit by $2.4 trillion--$1.8 trillion coming from spending cuts, and \n$600 billion from allowing tax rates for the wealthiest to return to \nprior levels. This budget builds on that deficit reduction with an \nadditional $1.85 trillion. That is a total of $4.25 trillion in deficit \nreduction--which exceeds the goal set out in Simpson-Bowles.\n  This budget shares other principles of Simpson-Bowles--that deficit \nreduction should be achieved through a mix of spending cuts and new \nrevenues, and that deficit reduction should not be done on the backs of \nthe most vulnerable.\n  At one point in time, there was enthusiasm among some of my Senate \ncolleagues from the other side of the aisle for Simpson-Bowles. One \nsuch Senator said, ``Say yes to Simpson-Bowles . . . I'm willing to say \nyes to Simpson-Bowles.'' Another said, ``Everybody knows what the \nsolution is, and that's Simpson-Bowles . . . I mean, everybody knows \nthat that's the template for what we need to do.'' Another called the \nplan ``a good starting point and should be seriously considered by \nCongress.'' Our budget exceeds the deficit reduction goal in Simpson-\nBowles, and follows the same general principles--yet my colleagues on \nthe other side have not yet come around to supporting it.\n  Finally, in addition to growing our economy and responsibly \naddressing the deficit, our budget honors the promises we have made to \nour seniors, our veterans, and our most vulnerable. This is in sharp \ncontrast to the budget being considered in the House.\n  My colleagues and I pay into Medicare every month, and so we are \nentitled to Medicare benefits when we reach age 65. The fact that we \nare entitled to these benefits is not a bad thing. In fact, it is a \nvery important thing for millions of American seniors. In 1965, we \ncreated Medicare and Medicaid so seniors could count on having access \nto medical care in their retirement. As a nation, we promised our \nparents and grandparents they could count on Medicare and Medicaid as a \nsafety net in their golden years. And the Senate Democratic budget \nprotects that safety net.\n  However, the House Republican budget would undermine the very \nfoundation of the promise, and end Medicare as we know it. Their budget \nwould replace Medicare's guarantee of health coverage with a voucher, \nand would raise the Medicare eligibility age. In my home State of \nMinnesota, this proposal would shift costs to more than 800,000 seniors \nwhen they can least afford to bear that burden. It would end the \nguarantee of health coverage that Medicare has made for decades. In \nfact, it would end Medicare as we know it.\n  The House Republican budget would also turn Medicaid into a block \ngrant. Now, a lot of people think Medicare will provide long-term care \nservices for seniors since Medicare is thought of as the health care \nprogram for seniors. But it is actually Medicaid that provides those \nlong-term services and supports. Medicare does not cover those.\n  So when the House Republicans talk about turning Medicaid into a \nblock grant, what they are actually talking about is ending the \nguarantee that seniors can get the care they need when they need it \nmost. In my home State of Minnesota, that means the nearly 100,000 \nseniors who depend on Medicaid would no longer be able to count on \ngetting the care they need. Our Senate budget protects the Medicaid \nprogram so seniors can access that care when they need it.\n  I also want to talk for a moment about the SNAP program, or food \nstamps. The House Republican budget would cut the SNAP program by $135 \nbillion. This could mean that as many as 13 million people would be cut \nfrom the program. More than a quarter of these people would be low-\nincome seniors and people with disabilities. That\n\n[[Page S2252]]\n\nis as many as 3 million seniors who would no longer have the assistance \nthey need to buy food. Fortunately, the Senate budget protects the SNAP \nprogram so that seniors can continue to buy food.\n  This budget also keeps our Nation's promise to our veterans. We just \nmarked the 10-year anniversary of the beginning of the Iraq War. We \nhave responsibly brought that war to an end. We remain in Afghanistan, \nwhere we have been for well over a decade, though we are also bringing \nour participation in that war to a responsible end. Well over 2 million \nAmericans have deployed during those wars as part of our all-volunteer \nforce.\n  The budget funds veterans programs so that veterans can get the \neducation they need, the jobs they are seeking, the homes every \nAmerican should be able to depend on, and access to the health care \nthey have earned and deserve.\n  I am proud of our budget, and of the values it reflects. It reflects \na commitment to the success of future generations, and to the middle \nclass. It puts the interests of regular people above those of our most \nprofitable corporations. It tackles our budget deficits in a way that \nwill promote growth and prosperity.\n  I have also filed several amendments that reflect priorities for \nMinnesota--in particular, the expansion of rural broadband, the \npromotion of college affordability, encouraging public-private \npartnerships in workforce training efforts, expanding access to skills \ncourses for the unemployed, and promoting clean energy on tribal lands.\n  I thank Chairman Murray for her leadership during this process, and \nlook forward to carrying out this budget's priorities alongside her in \nthe coming years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nMinnesota, as we prepare to go through a series of votes, for reminding \nus that a budget is not just numbers on a piece of paper. It really is \na statement of our values and what we care about and how we are going \nto invest in our country so we have strong jobs in the future and a \nstrong economy. We really base this budget on those principles, and the \nSenator from Minnesota reminded us all of that so well today, and I \nthank him for his statement.\n  We are within a minute of beginning the vote, so I would remind my \ncolleagues we have a busy day ahead of us. We on our side are very \nproud of the budget we have put forward that focuses on jobs and the \neconomy, in this fragile time getting people back to work, getting them \nthe resources they need to have a strong future, whether it is \neducation or infrastructure or the research and development that \ncreates the kind of jobs that the Senator from Minnesota has focused \non. We on this side do deeply understand the need to manage our debt \nand deficit responsibly. It is why we have put forward a credible \napproach, a balanced approach, that makes sure we are cutting, in many \nprograms the Presiding Officer and I care deeply about, but \nunderstanding this is the time we are in, where we have to relook at \nthese programs and manage them effectively, and we have done that in \nour budget. There are many tough choices we have in front of us, but \nthe tough choices we have put forward in this budget reflect the \nbalance the American people have asked us to make in our budget \napproach.\n  I look forward to having it passed sometime, I am sure, in the wee \nhours of the morning. This budget moves us toward a place where we can \nwork with colleagues on both sides of the aisle and both sides of this \ncity to come together in a way that gets us back on a path so we are \nnot managing this country from crisis to crisis, but are working \neffectively together to move forward in this country.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 431\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 2 minutes equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 431, \noffered by the Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Mikulski, the first \namendment she has offered is a very important one.\n  We all know pay discrimination in the workplace is very real. We know \nwomen are nearly half of our workforce, but they still only earn about \n77 percent of what men earn, and women of color are much worse off. \nAfrican-American women make 70 cents on the dollar. Hispanic women make \nonly 60 cents on the dollar. We want to make sure all of our families \nare strong and stable in the future, and pay discrimination is \nsomething that is holding women and families and communities back.\n  So a ``no'' vote on this means you are actually OK with women earning \nless pay than men--women not being able to contribute to their families \nin a strong way so their children can be taken care of and they can pay \ntheir mortgage or their rent and put food on the table.\n  A ``yes'' vote on this amendment means you acknowledge this as a \nproblem and agree that women must receive equal pay for equal work.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Maryland for her long-time advocacy \non behalf of women in many ways, but particularly on making sure they \nhave equal pay.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we would urge our colleagues to support \nthe Mikulski amendment. It sets the goal of equal pay for equal work. \nFortunately, it does not specify any coercive method by government to \ncompel that outcome. We think it is a worthwhile aspiration. As a \nfather of two daughters, I certainly hope their work is rewarded by \nequal pay to that of their counterparts who are young men.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to support the Mikulski amendment, with \nthat understanding that we are talking about the marketplace setting \nthat outcome rather than coercive policies from the government.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a request for the yeas and \nnays?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would suggest we take this amendment \nby voice vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, on our side I believe we are happy to \nhave a voice vote on this amendment. And I urge a strong yes. It sets a \ngreat tone, by the way, for the rest of the day.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 431) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 158\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There will now be 2 minutes equally \ndivided on the Ayotte amendment.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Ayotte \namendment No. 158. We should not be increasing taxes now at the expense \nof jobs, so my amendment would simply bring a budget point of order to \nprohibit tax increases while unemployment is above 5.5 percent.\n  The President said if we passed his stimulus package--his team said \nwe would be at 5.1-percent unemployment now. I have heard from so many \nbusinesses, with the $1.7 trillion in tax increases that have already \nbeen brought by the President and the Democrats here, jobs are hurting. \nNow is not the time to raise taxes. Our small businesses are being \nkilled by this.\n  Mr. President, 23 million Americans are out of work. So many are \nstruggling, with the unemployment rate at over 7 percent. That is why I \nhave offered this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's not increase taxes at the expense of \njobs. So please support my amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as I have said many times, this budget \nasks the wealthiest Americans and our biggest corporations to pay just \na little bit more, both to get our fiscal house in order and to make \ncritical investments that will help drive broad-based economic growth.\n  Economists across the political spectrum will tell you that raising \nrevenues from those who can afford it most will not hurt our economy. \nIn fact, our experience during the 1990s proves that fact. In fact, \nraising revenues by closing loopholes and cutting inefficient spending \nin the Tax Code for the\n\n[[Page S2253]]\n\nwealthiest Americans, as our budget proposes, actually stands to boost \nthe economy by removing tax breaks that distort the allocation of \ncapital.\n  This amendment that is being offered would effectively end the \nprivileged status of a balanced and fair budget plan, such as this one, \nthat calls on the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share in order \nto address our deficits and get our economy going again.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, tomorrow is the 3-year anniversary of the \npassage of ObamaCare. ObamaCare is hurting. It is hurting seniors, it \nis hurting Hispanics, it is hurting African Americans, it is hurting \nsingle moms, and it is hurting the economy. It should be repealed.\n\n  Yesterday over 70 Members of this body voted to remove one of the \nmost pernicious taxes in ObamaCare, the tax on medical device \nproviders. I happily voted for the amendment, but I would point out \nthis is a wealthy industry which can afford to hire lobbyists.\n  We should be responsive not only to wealthy corporate lobbyists but \nto the people and small businesses that are being hurt by ObamaCare and \nto the workers who are being hurt by ObamaCare. We should be responsive \nto the American people. For that reason, this amendment would create a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund to defund ObamaCare and repeal ObamaCare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this will be the 36th time we have voted \nto repeal the Affordable Care Act. I know the Senators on the other \nside want to revote to repeal it. That is fine. I wish to warn you, due \nto the way this amendment is drafted, it also repeals what we put in \nthat bill on education; to wit, we put in money to increase Pell \ngrants. We put in money to increase funding for Historically Black \nColleges and Universities. We put in money also to help the community \ncolleges, $2 billion. We also included the more generous income-based \nrepayment system to ensure people don't need to pay more than 10 \npercent of their discretionary income to pay back their student loans. \nAll of that is wiped out in the Senator's amendment.\n  Again, maybe it is just a drafting error. But I think Senators should \nknow you are not just voting to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. \nThat is fine if you want to do that. I don't think Senators on the \nother side of the aisle who are here wish to vote to decrease Pell \ngrants and to decrease funding for universities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we \nare going to have a lot of amendments, so if we have a lot of floor \ndiscussion, this is only going to delay it. I would encourage Senators \nthroughout the day to please take their conversations off the floor \nafter the votes so Senators who are speaking on the amendments on both \nsides of the aisle have the consideration of being heard.\n  I will take my 1 minute on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senate budget already includes a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund for tax relief. This amendment would make \nthat relief for low- and middle-income Americans explicit, but it would \ndo it in a way that preserves the health care benefits in the \nAffordable Health Care Act.\n  Unfortunately, the amendment that follows this one will gut the ACA \nand leave millions of Americans back in a position where they have to \nworry about a preexisting condition or a health illness that could \nbankrupt their household. We have to make sure\n\n[[Page S2254]]\n\ntaxes do not hit low-and middle-income families, but we should do it in \na responsible way that doesn't take away health care for millions of \nAmericans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Budget \nCommittee member Senator Toomey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I am not rising in opposition to this \namendment because I oppose it. We Republicans don't want to raise taxes \non low- and middle-income families because we don't want to raise taxes \non anybody. But the irony of this is that this budget is an exercise in \nraising taxes on middle-income families. It is necessarily the case.\n  By the way, that is above and beyond the huge tax increases my \ncolleagues imposed when they voted for ObamaCare--$1.2 trillion of tax \nincreases, much of which lands squarely on middle-income families.\n  The fact is the President showed how he wants to raise taxes on the \nwealthy, and he has a plan that does that. It raises $600 billion. My \ncolleagues have reconciliation instructions for $1 trillion. The \ndifference is going to inevitably come from the middle class. We don't \nwant that to happen.\n  I would suggest we will accept this amendment. We could accept it on \na voice vote. But it doesn't change the central fact that the \nDemocratic budget is all about raising taxes on middle-income families.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 222 offered by \nthe Senator from Idaho, Mr. Crapo.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, although it has been a couple of years now \nsince we passed the health care law, it is becoming evident to all \nAmericans that there were in fact many new taxes--almost $1 trillion of \nnew taxes--in the health care law. And despite the President's firm \npledge at that time not to raise taxes by even one dime on middle-\nincome Americans, I at that time asked the Joint Tax Committee to \nevaluate the law and tell us if there were such taxes in the law.\n  The letter I received back from the Joint Tax Committee indicated \nthere were at least seven taxes in the health care law that did \nsquarely hit the middle class--and not just in a small way. It is at \nleast a quarter trillion dollars of new taxes that the middle class \nwill pay if we don't fix it. In fact, it is 73 million American \nfamilies that will ultimately pay this new tax in the ObamaCare \nlegislation if we don't reform it.\n  This is an amendment I brought during the consideration of the health \ncare law. It was defeated then by a claim that there were no taxes in \nthe bill. We now know there are taxes in the bill, and this is our \nchance, now that these taxes are beginning to be implemented, to remove \nthem from the law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is ironic that a number of those taxes \nare in the Ryan budget that our colleagues voted for last night. But \nlet me say this. The ACA is going to extend health care coverage to \nnearly 30 million people. They are mostly low- and middle-income people \nwho don't have access to affordable coverage. The law also fully pays \nfor the costs of expanding health insurance coverage and does it \nwithout increasing taxes on our middle class.\n  I believe expanding health care insurance coverage is one of the most \nimportant things we can do for our country and for our economy. The \namendment that is being offered would undermine the effort under way to \nbring health insurance to millions of currently uninsured people in a \nfiscally responsible fashion.\n  I urge our colleagues to oppose this amendment and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, amendment No. 438 establishes a deficit-\nneutral reserve fund to protect women's access to basic health care, \nincluding family planning and birth control. It ensures that employers \ncannot deny coverage for contraceptives.\n  We have seen that improving access to preventive care, including \ncontraception, is good health policy, and as a result it means \nhealthier women, healthier children, and healthier families.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, every Senator supports expanding access \nto health care. We may have strong differences on the best way to do \nit, but no one should doubt that commitment. However, we must also \nensure that we protect deeply held religious beliefs of our citizens.\n  In this regard, the Shaheen amendment--and the new health care law--\ngets it all wrong.

Mr. President, we are now in a period of 2 hours of \ndebate equally divided. I understand Senators on that side will begin.\n  I would like to notify all Senators we are now working through a \nprocess to get the next amendment set in order so that Members will \nknow. We do have 2 hours of debate, but Members should know that we may \nyield back some of that time. So please be ready. I think everybody has \na lot of amendments they want to have brought up, and the sooner we can \nget to that the sooner we will.\n  So, again, we will now move to 2 hours of debate equally divided.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nhours of debate equally divided between the managers or their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the number \nof Budget Committee staff for the minority granted access to the floor \nat one time be increased by two.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Senator Coburn for \n22 minutes. I also have on our schedule of Members, Senator Collins for \n10 minutes, Senator Cornyn for 10 minutes, Senator Inhofe for 10 \nminutes, and Senator Sessions for 8 minutes.\n  At this time I yield to Senator Coburn for 22 minutes. First, I would \nnote that Senator Coburn is doing something that every Member of this \nbody should be inspired by. He is actually working hard every day to \nidentify the problems we face with duplication and waste in our \ngovernment. We do far too little of that, and this budget does \nvirtually nothing about it. So I would like to thank Senator Coburn for \nbeing unparalleled in his commitment to financial responsibility, and I \nyield to the Senator 22 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent to \nuse oversized charts. I don't actually like to use oversized charts, \nbut I cannot get all the information I need to present on one regular \nchart because I am looking at one subject area.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. First of all, I wish to thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for bringing a budget to the floor. It is great that we have \ndone it.\n  We know the outcome of this budget vote already. The final budget \nvote will not come until sometime in the middle of the night. But in \nthat budget we are going to spend $47 trillion. There is a dispute \nbetween how we look at it and how our colleagues on the other side look \nat it, but there is at least $1 trillion in tax increases.\n  The new debt over the next 10 years is $7.3 trillion despite $1 \ntrillion in tax hikes. The debt that has been added since the last \nbudget passed this Senate is $5.5 trillion.\n  The spending increase above the projected growth over 10 years is \n$645 billion. The spending increase in this budget next year above \ntoday's budget level is $162 billion.\n  The deficit increase next year relative to the fiscal year 2014 \nprojection by CBO is a $95 billion increase in our debt--we are not \ngoing the other way.\n  The growth rate in the Federal budget over 10 years is going to be 60 \npercent, and in the mandatory programs it is going to be 80 percent, so \nwe are going to have the government growing at least 7 percent a year, \ncontinuing to grow at a rate faster than our economy, at a rate faster \nthan personal income.\n  The net deficit reduction over that 10 years over what was projected \nmay be $270 billion. The deficit reduction achieved through spending \ncuts will be zero in this budget--zero through spending cuts.\n  The deficit reduction through elimination of duplication, fraud, and \nwaste in this budget is zero.\n  The date this budget balances is never.\n  I am bringing these charts to the floor because I want the American \npeople to know how we are not doing our job. We are going to get a vote \non a lot of these things, I have told my colleagues. I haven't been \nallowed to offer a lot of these amendments on bills that have come to \nthe floor, so we are going to vote on them tonight and into the early \nhours tomorrow morning. The reason it is important for us to vote on \nthem is because the American people need to know whether or not we are \ngoing to act on them. Let me start to go through some of the programs \nand see if it matches any type of common sense that anybody in America \nmight have about how we could go about helping American citizens.\n\n[[Page S2256]]\n\n  Three years ago we forced the GAO to do a duplication study of the \nwhole Federal Government. We are going to get that last report about \n1\\1/2\\ weeks from now. They will have looked at the whole Federal \nGovernment. This is just the data based on the first two reports. Let \nme just go through it rather quickly so my colleagues can see.\n  We have 15 unmanned aircraft programs, 5 agencies, $37 billion a \nyear. Why do we have 15 of them? Does that make sense to anybody?\n  We have domestic food programs, 18 different programs, 3 different \nagencies, and we are spending $62 billion.\n  We have 21 different homeless programs--21 different homeless \nprograms. It is great that it is only one through one agency. Why do we \nhave 21 separate programs? Each one of these programs has a bureaucracy \nand office staff and overhead and administration. Why not have one or \ntwo?\n\n  Transportation services for transportation-disadvantaged persons: 80 \nseparate, different, distinctly designed programs in 80 different \nagencies. Why not in the transportation agency alone? Why not run it \nout of the department it should be run through?\n  Job training and employment, 47 programs for the able-bodied, 9 \ndifferent agencies, and it is actually $18.9 billion. We have actually \ndone all the oversight on this. In Oklahoma, we have 17 federally-run \njob training programs in a city that has less than 15,000 people and \nhas 400 people unemployed, 17 separate offices run by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Teacher quality, 82 separate teacher training and quality programs, \nnot run within the Department of Education but run within the \nDepartment of Education and nine other agencies. How does that fit? \nWhen we are in a time when we are trying to make hard decisions to \nprotect the future of this country and a fiscal balance, why won't we \naddress this? None of this stuff has been addressed. This has been \nknown for 2 years. None of it is in the budget. It is not even in the \nHouse budget.\n  Food safety, 30 different programs, 15 different agencies, $1.6 \nbillion. Do people realize if we buy a cheese pizza at the grocery \nstore it is controlled by the Department of Agriculture, but if \nsomebody buys a pepperoni pizza at the grocery store it is controlled \nby the FDA? Does that make sense to anybody? Why would we continue to \nbe stupid? And we are the ones being stupid because we will not address \nthese issues.\n  Military and veterans health services, we have four agencies running \nthat. I would think we would want the VA to run that, not the VA plus \nthree other agencies.\n  Economic development, we have 80 programs, 4 different agencies, and \n$6.5 billion a year.\n  U.S.-Mexican border region water needs, all right, we have Arizona on \nthat border, we have Texas on that border, and we have California on \nthat border. We have seven different agencies that control that. Why? \nWhy would we do that?\n  Financial literacy programs, I would make the point that we are not \nvery good in financial literacy within the Federal Government because \nall one has to do is look at our budget. There are 13 different \nagencies, 15 programs, plus the new Financial Consumer Protection Board \nis going to create another one--another one. We are spending $30 \nmillion a year on that.\n  Green buildings, 94 different programs, 11 different agencies, \nspending $1 billion a year.\n  Housing assistance, 160 different programs, 20 agencies--20 Federal \nGovernment agencies--spending $170 billion a year the overhead that is \nassociated with all of this, the duplication that is associated with \nit, the complications, the paperwork.\n  Department of Justice grant programs, 253 of them: They are within \nthe Department of Justice, but they are run through 10 other Federal \nagencies, not the Department of Justice.\n  Diesel emissions, 14 different programs, 3 different agencies. Why \nthree? Why do we have to interact with three different agencies to have \nour diesel emissions controlled, and why are there 14 different \nprograms?\n  Early learning and child care, 50 programs, 9 agencies, $16 billion.\n  Surface transportation, 55 programs, 5 agencies, $43 billion.\n  Support for entrepreneurs, 53 programs, 4 different agencies. We have \nsmall business, but guess what. We have one at Agriculture, we have one \nat Treasury, we have one somewhere else I can't remember; $2.6 billion.\n  Science, technology, education and math, we all agree it is \nimportant. The Pentagon has over 100 programs. The Pentagon itself has \nover 100 programs. Then we have another 105 or so programs spread \nacross the rest of the agencies. Thirteen different agencies have a \nscience, technology, engineering program. Why is that not within the \nDepartment of Education?\n  As I finish this, I will not go to the next chart just on the basis \nof time.\n  I outlined a whole bunch of different programs, and not one of them \nhas a metric on it that says we are successful or unsuccessful--not one \nof them. So even the agencies that have these multiple programs, \nrunning across multiple agencies, have no endpoint to say: Are you \ndoing anything?\n  What we have discovered on job training is we are real good in job \ntraining with Federal programs of employing people in job training. We \nare terrible in terms of giving them a life skill that will give them a \nlifetime work capability.\n  Let me take a short time to show some examples. Looking at this \nchart, we can see why we have such big charts.\n  Here are the Federal preschool and daycare programs. So if someone \nwants to provide that to somebody, look at the maze of bureaucracy they \nhave to go through just to qualify.\n  The pink areas on this chart show the different departments that run \nthem. The blue areas are the subagencies created out of the green ones. \nSo we can see, in Federal preschool and daycare, we have the General \nServices Administration, that has four programs; we have the Department \nof Agriculture, that has this multitude of programs. But even if you \nhave it at the Department of Agriculture, you cannot do anything \nbecause you have to talk to the Department of Education too, because \nthey are interrelated in how they are controlled.\n  Early learning. The Justice Department has a multitude of programs. \nThe Department of Health and Human Services has a multitude of \nprograms. We even have a tax expenditure program for childcare and \nearly learning. The Department of Labor has their own.\n  We can see what has happened to us is we have not done the oversight, \nthe work to eliminate the problems that are causing us to spend at \nleast $200 billion more per year than we need to spend.\n  Here are the Federal programs for surface transportation and \ninfrastructure. We can see why this is so big. Here is the Federal \nHighway Administration and here are all their subprograms for it. Then \nover here is the Office of the Secretary. Then we have the Federal \nRailroad Administration; we have the Maritime Administration; we have \nthe Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. If you are a State \ntransportation director, you have to meet the bureaucratic requirements \nof every one of these programs.\n  I talked about science, technology, engineering, and math. Look at \nwhat we have. What we have is a maze where nobody in the government \nknows what the other agency is doing. Nobody knows what somebody over \nhere in the Mickey Leland Energy Fellowship funding is doing compared \nwith the New Era Rural Technology Competitive Grants Program.\n  Here is the other thing we have found as we have gone through all \nthese programs: We have people who apply for a grant and get it from \none of these programs and then turn around and go over and apply for \nthe same grant from another program.\n  It is easy to see, when we continue to see multiple programs--here, \neven to get efficient in our Federal fleet, we have 5 different \nprograms, 20 different agencies, just to try to get fuel efficiency \nwithin the Federal Government. We started out with electronic health \nrecords systems for veterans and the military. We have 10 different \nprograms within that--not 1 program, not 2, but 10.\n  Just one other. Here is a chart with green buildings. We listed that: \na multitude of agencies, a multitude of programs. Every department in \nthe Federal Government has a green building\n\n[[Page S2257]]\n\ninitiative separate and apart from a central area where it ought to be \nand probably associated with the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology. That ought to be who is running it, but it is not.\n  We have all these things. All these require rules for you to comply \nwith if you are going to get a building permit or you are going to have \nany Federal contracts. It makes no sense.\n  I will end.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COBURN. Nobody in their right mind will agree that what we are \ndoing is smart, efficient, effective, and associated with common sense. \nBut yet when it comes to doing the hard work of oversight and \neliminating these duplications, nobody in the Senate wants to do the \nhard work of eliminating them. A conservative estimate is that we send \nout $670 billion worth of grants a year. A conservative estimate is \nthat $200 billion of that is totally wasted, and we are sitting here \nsquabbling about raising taxes. This budget raises $1 trillion over 10 \nyears. If we would do our hard work in terms of\n  Mr. President, there is so much distraction in the Senate I cannot \ntalk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. COBURN. If we would simply do our job, we would not have to have \ntax increases, we would not have to have spending cuts that will gut \nour military, although I can show a lot of waste in the military too, \nto the tune of $50 billion a year. But if we would just do our job and \nactually look in detail--the way GAO has recommended and the way \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs has oversighted through the \nyears, thanks to the leadership of Lieberman, Collins, Carper, and \nthose who preceded them--what we will see is we have all this research, \nwe have all this knowledge, we have all this stuff we know we can do, \nbut we have no leadership in the Senate to get it done, and we bring a \nbudget forward that perpetuates everything I just showed.\n  There is no mandate for every committee to eliminate total \nduplication in this budget. There is no mandate in this budget to \nconsolidate like programs and eliminate cross-agency interference and \nduplication. There is no mandate in this budget that every grant \nprogram ought to have a metric on it to see if it actually accomplishes \nsomething. There is no metric in this budget to give the agencies the \npower and the resources to actually administer the grants effectively \nso we know what they are doing--none of that. This is all ignored.\n  As long as we say the only problem is saving Medicare and saving \nSocial Security and saving the Defense Department, we are going to \ncontinue to waste $200 billion a year. I do not know what it is. I do \nnot know if it is that I am not an effective communicator or if people \nhave other priorities. But our grandchildren are totally dependent upon \nus eliminating so much stupidity. Yet nobody--the Appropriations \nCommittees do not want to. Most of the authorizing committees do not \nwant to. They will not do the hard work of eliminating the duplication.\n\n  I did not show the housing. I showed the total amount we spend. Do \nyou realize we had paid a housing administrator in Oklahoma for 2 years \nin a town that had no homes. Picher, OK--we cleaned it out because of \nlead contamination. But we kept paying the housing administrator for \nPicher for 2 years--until I found it. I said: Why are we paying this \nguy? There are no homes.\n  Those little things, multiplied by a billion times throughout \ngovernment programs, happen every day, and then we tell Americans we \nare going to raise your taxes because we will not do the hard work of \noversight. We deny our oath when we do that, but we also deny the best \ntendencies and the tradition of this country. We can do a whole lot \nmore with a whole lot less money if we would take care of this problem. \nBut leadership is lacking on doing it.\n  As long as we have our eye on the ball of saving Medicare and saving \nSocial Security and do not have our eye on the ball of the things that \nare spending money that we are getting no value for--or very limited \nvalue--we are going to continue to be in trouble financially as a \ncountry, even if we do save Medicare and Social Security.\n  Every dollar the American taxpayer pays into this country should be \nprecious to us. Our foreign aid budget, we never talk about it. Our \nforeign policy has not been reauthorized for years. There has not been \na full-time inspector general in the State Department in 6 years. We \nhave seven open spots for inspectors general to actually look at this \nstuff and to advise us and advise the agencies.\n  We are failing to do our job. My only wish for my colleagues is to \nget informed, and if they are on a committee, they do not have to solve \nit the way I solve it, but just solve it. It makes no sense to continue \nto duplicate things.\n  As a matter of fact, in job training, here is what GAO said: Of the \n47 job training programs for nondisabled people--we have another 53 for \nthe disabled--of the 47 all but 3 do exactly the same thing.\n  Either GAO is lying or they are not. If they are not lying, why \nwouldn't we, in the next 2 months in this place, fix those programs to \nmake them where they are actually giving real skills, for a real \nlivelihood, to people who need real job training. There is no effort at \nall to do that.\n  The House just passed a bill, and it barely passed because every one \nof these squares that we show on any one of these charts has a \nconstituency. In other words, they are dependent on money coming from \nthe Federal Government. So even though it is not efficient and not \neffective, our colleagues do not want to irritate anybody getting that \nmoney because we are more interested in getting reelected than fixing \nthe long-term problems of our country.\n  All you have to do is go to our Web site, coburn.senate.gov, and you \nwill need a strong anti-emetic for the rest of the week if you read the \nwaste and fraud and abuse and thievery that is going on with Federal \nGovernment programs. This budget does not address any of that waste.\n  Do you realize $200 billion out of $670 billion is $2 trillion over \nthe next 10 years. If we just fixed that, it would help pull us out of \nthe big hole. That is $2 trillion that has a very low economic \nmultiplier in our economy versus $2 trillion that might have a bit.\n  I will end on this last point: Last year we gave out $4 billion to \nforeign countries that own more than $100 billion of our debt. Ask the \ntypical American--we are borrowing money from China, and we are giving \nthem foreign aid. They own $850 billion of our debt. Why would we do \nthat? We are in debt, we are scrambling, we are borrowing $40 million a \nminute, and we are taking the money we are borrowing from China and \nturning around and giving it back to them in foreign aid. Why would we \ndo that? It just shows how out of control all the processes are in \nWashington because we fail to be informed and hold the administration--\nwhether it is a Bush administration or an Obama administration, all of \nthem are guilty. The reason they are guilty is because we are not \nraising the question.\n  I will tell my colleagues, they are going to get a vote on a lot of \nthis stuff. A lot of my amendments have bipartisan support. But we are \ngoing to vote. They get to vote on whether they think we ought to \neliminate duplication. They are going to have 17 separate votes on \nthat. I am going to try to wind those into two votes. Vote against \nfixing it and then go home and tell Americans you want to raise their \ntaxes $1 trillion, and you do not want to eliminate the stupidity going \non in Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to just take one moment before I \nyield time to the Senator from Delaware.\n  (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be no expressions from the gallery.\n  Mr. WARNER. I commend my friend, the Senator from Oklahoma, who has \nmade this a passion. I would acknowledge this is a challenge that \ntransfers between administrations.\n  When I was Governor of Virginia, under the previous administration, \nwe\n\n[[Page S2258]]\n\ntried to consolidate workforce training programs. We still had those 47 \nprograms and were not able at the State level to consolidate into a \nmore meaningful approach.\n  I recall when I first came to this body, I thought let's at least \nfind the low-hanging fruit, and we found those programs that both the \nBush administration and the Obama administration had agreed were \nduplicative and unnecessary--16 programs, $1 billion; but a billion \nhere and a billion there and you are talking about real money.\n  I am happy to report 11 of those 16 programs have been eliminated. \nBut the fact that there are those that both administrations agreed upon \nthat have not been eliminated means there is more work to be done. I \nwould simply point out to my friend from Oklahoma there has been \nlegislation that he and the ranking member, the Senator from Delaware, \nwho has also worked hard on these issues, supported 2 years back called \nthe GPRMA bill, the Government Performance Results Modernization Act. \nIn that bill for the first time ever, starting this year, there is a \nrequirement that each agency of the Federal Government identify not \nonly those programs that are the most successful, but those programs \nthat are the least successful.\n  So regardless of which administration, Republican or Democratic, \nthere will at least be some--beyond just OMB putting forward \ninformation that says where the actual agencies themselves think they \nare not getting good value for the dollar.\n  Mr. COBURN. Would the Senator, through the Chair, take a question? \nDoes the Senator know the number of agencies in the Federal Government \nthat actually know how many programs they have in their agency?\n  Mr. WARNER. I know the answer to this because we have talked about \nthis in the past. We do not have a complete list of all of the various \nprograms.\n  Mr. COBURN. There is one agency in the Federal Government that knows \nall its programs. Only one. The Department of Education. They actually \npublish it every year. They actually have done a great job. I \ncompliment them. Not one other Federal agency actually knows all of the \nprograms that run under their auspices.\n  Mr. WARNER. I turn now to my good friend, the Senator from Delaware. \nThis has been an extraordinary passion of his. I know as chairman of \nthe Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, along with the \nranking member from Oklahoma, this will be an area of great interest \nand focus.\n  With that, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. It is ironic; this reminds me of our church. Every now \nand then our minister is going full steam and preaching to our \ncongregation. He says: I know I am preaching to the choir, but even \nchoirs need to be preached to.\n  In this case, the folks, ironically, on the floor--Senator Warner, \nSenator Collins, Senator Sessions, and I think myself and Dr. Coburn--\nthere are probably no Democrats and Republicans more committed to \nfiguring out how do we get better results for less money in everything \nwe do. So even the choir needs to be preached to. We just had a pretty \ngood sermon.\n  I have a couple of posters here I want to share. I think they might \nbe of some interest and value in this discussion. I like to think of \nspending, as we are trying to rein it in and get it under control, in \nthree elements. One of those is entitlement spending, which now is over \n50 percent of what we spend in the Federal Government. It is growing. \nWe have something called discretionary spending, which includes \ndefense, and the domestic programs which are not entitlements, not \nMedicare, not Medicaid, not Social Security. Then you have got interest \non the debt. That is pretty much it. That is pretty much it. If you \nlook at, again, entitlement spending, Medicare, Medicaid, Social \nSecurity and other things that we are entitled to, it is over 50 \npercent and growing.\n  As it turns out, the part of our budget that is being squeezed is the \ndiscretionary spending. So about half of that is nondefense \ndiscretionary spending. That includes everything from transportation to \nagriculture, to housing, education, to homeland security, and a whole \nlot of other things as well. Then there is defense.\n  If you take a look at this chart, we find that this gray line here is \nactually nondefense discretionary spending. We start out in 1971. It is \nabout 4 percent of spending as a percentage of GDP. Today it is about 4 \npercent as well. The budget that I believe we received from the House \nof Representatives actually--where they actually drop their spending is \nin that money. That includes workforce development, it includes \neducation, it includes infrastructure--roads, highways, bridges, rail, \nports, all of the above. It includes investing in R, research and \ndevelopment, through the National Science Foundation, National \nInstitutes of Health, and creates among other things goods and services \nand products that we can sell all over the country and all over the \nworld.\n  Under the House-passed budget, that money, instead of spending about \n19 percent of our budget for nondefense discretionary spending, I think \nwe would end up down around 4 percent for all nondefense discretionary \nspending--4 percent of our budget. That is not consistent with the \npriorities of many of us, including those on this side of aisle, \ninclude our own congressional delegation.\n  Here we have health care. This is good. Health care as a percentage \nof GDP. I mentioned Medicare as a percentage of our entitlements, \nincluding Medicare as a percentage of our budget, now is up over 50 \npercent and climbing. If you look at health care as a percentage of GDP \nin this country, we are the green line. What we see from 1961 down to \nabout 2010, the green line keeps going up and up and up.\n  Today, health care as a percentage of GDP in this country is about \n17, almost 18 percent. I think the next closest country is France. We \nare way ahead of anybody else. We are almost twice as high as the \nJapanese, for example. We spend about 17, 18 percent of GDP. They spend \nabout 8 percent. They cover everybody. They get better results.\n  When you have health care, the big part of Medicaid spending, \nMedicare spending, in fact all of it, is growing as though it is toxic. \nEntitlement spending continues to grow. We have got to do something \nabout that. The discretionary spending part of our budget has actually \nbeen going down over 40 years by a significant amount of money. Today \nit is less than one-third of our total spending, if you combine defense \nand nondefense nondiscretionary spending.\n  So what do we do about it? What we try to do about it in our side in \nthe budget, created with a lot of input from Senator Warner, a lot of \ninput from Senator Sanders on our side, great leadership by Senator \nPatty Murray, who is the chair of the committee--they have come up with \na budget that is before us today that says: All right, we know we \ncannot continue to spend as we are doing. We have got to rein in the \nspending, not only on the entitlement side but also on the \ndiscretionary spending side. We need to raise some revenues.\n  They go back to take a page out of the Clinton playbook from, gosh, \n12, 13, 14 years ago, when we had a big deficit--not as big as this. \nBut they adopted a deficit reduction plan engineered by Erskine Bowles, \nthe Chief of Staff. They did a deficit reduction plan in 1997 with \nbipartisan support that said: For every dollar of spending that we cut, \nwe raise a dollar of revenues.\n  We ended up with four balanced budgets in a row. The budget that \ncomes out of the Budget Committee is similar in that it is dollar for \ndollar, a dollar of deficit reduction on the revenue side, a dollar on \nthe spending cuts. But unlike what happened 12 years ago--15 years ago \nactually--we do not get to a balanced budget. If there is a fault in \nthe budget that has come out of the Budget Committee, while it reduces \nour publicly held debt as a percentage of GDP from 73 percent, 72 \npercent down to about 70 percent in 10 years--it stabilizes and starts \nto bring it down as a percentage of GDP--we still will have a budget \ndeficit of over a half a trillion dollars 10 years from now. Is that \ngood enough? No. We need to do better. In terms of entitlement program \nspending, we need to find ways to save more money. We need to do it \nwithout savaging old people and poor people. We need to do it in a way \nthat preserves these programs for the long haul.\n\n[[Page S2259]]\n\n  We were in our caucus. We had some good presentations from a few of \nthe smartest people, health economists, doctors and so forth, that have \nbeen around. They gave us a whole bunch of good ideas on how to get \nbetter health care results for less money. We need to do that and more.\n  On the discretionary spending side, Senator Collins, who has \npreviously chaired the Homeland Security and Government Affairs \nCommittee--Senator Coburn and I have the privilege of leading it today. \nWe focus literally every day as an oversight committee, trying to do \noversight of the whole Federal Government, which is a whole lot for one \ncommittee to do. We do it in conjunction with the GAO. We work off \ntheir high-risk list, high-risk ways of saving money. Every few years \nthey give us these great to-do lists for the Federal Government. We \nwork on it in our subcommittee. We work on it with GAO. We work with \nOMB, Office of Management and Budget, we work with the inspectors \ngeneral across the agencies of the Federal Government. We work with \nnonprofit groups such as Citizens Against Government Waste.\n  Our whole idea is to focus on wasteful spending, as we ratchet down \nthe spending, figuring out where are we going to get good results and \nwhere are we not. In the programs where we get the kind of results we \nwant, we fund them more or we reduce them less. If we are not getting \nthe results we need, we close those programs, we reduce those programs. \nThat is the way it ought to be. That is the way it ought to be. That is \nthe way we are trying to do it.\n  Let me see if I have another chart here that might be relevant. When \nBill Clinton was President in the last 4 years of his administration, \nthey negotiated a deficit reduction deal with the Republican House and \nSenate in 1997, dollar for dollar, a dollar of revenue, a dollar of \ndeficit reduction on the spending side. And for those 4 years we had a \nbalanced budget, revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product. I \nthink it was about 19\\1/2\\ to 20 percent, right around 20 percent of \nGDP.\n  Last year, our revenues as a percentage of GDP were down around 16 \npercent, I think, between 15 and 16. Even with the fiscal cliff deal \nthat was adopted earlier, we will be up to about 18 percent of GDP by \nthe end of the 10-year period.\n  I would suggest there are three things we need to do here: No. 1, we \ncan build on a plan that has come out of the Budget Committee. It is a \ngood start but it is not the finish line. We need to find additional \nsavings in the entitlement programs that do not savage old people or \npoor people and preserve these programs for the long haul.\n  We need, in addition to that, revenue. We can do that by closing \ndeductions, loopholes, credits. We can means-test a bunch of stuff. But \nwe need to come up with the revenue to get closer to 20 percent.\n  The last thing, really in conjunction with what Senator Coburn was \nsaying, is we need to look at every nook and cranny of the Federal \nGovernment--every nook and cranny of the Federal Government, from A to \nZ, from Agriculture to Transportation and everything in between. We \nneed to ask this question: How do we get a better result for less money \nin everything we do? It is not just the responsibility of our \ncommittee, Homeland Security and Government Affairs, it is not just the \nBudget Committee, it is every committee. It is all of us who can win \nthis together. It is the administration. It is the taxpayers groups. We \nare all in this together. If we are going to get to where we want to \nbe, that is a fiscally sustainable roadmap to the future, it has to be \nall hands on deck. It has to be those three things: entitlement reform, \nadditional reform, and to really squeeze every dime on the spending \nside and move from a culture of spendthrift to a culture of thrift.\n  The budget resolution gets us going in the right direction. We are \ngoing to meet up in the House in a conference committee, their vision, \nour vision. That is where the real hard work begins. Out of that I hope \nwe end up with a real focus on those three things. If we do and we can \nwork together, and the administration and the President provide the \nleadership we need, we will get where we need to go in the future.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to Senator Collins. I \nwould note that she has been a leader in governmental reform through \nthe committee that she chaired and has been ranking member on. I would \nvalue her insight at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me thank the ranking member of the \nBudget Committee for all of his incredibly hard work on this issue. It \nis a hopeful sign that the Senate is finally debating a budget to set \npriorities for Federal spending and revenues in the coming year. While \nI am disappointed that we failed to perform this fundamental duty for \nthe past 4 years, and that the budget reported by the Budget Committee \nis, unfortunately, a partisan one, I nevertheless welcome this budget \ndebate.\n  I wish to describe the amendments I will be offering to the budget \nresolution later today. The first of these amendments is No. 144. It \nwould create a deficit-neutral reserve fund for the purpose of \ncorrecting ObamaCare's definition of what is a full-time employee under \nthe law. This amendment would allow employees to work more than 30 \nhours a week without triggering possible penalties on the businesses \nthat hire them.\n  ObamaCare requires businesses with 50 or more full-time employees to \nprovide qualified health insurance to their workers or face onerous \npenalties. These penalties begin at $40,000 for businesses with 50 \nemployees, plus $2,000 for each additional ``full-time equivalent'' \nemployee. These penalties are a huge disincentive for any small \nbusiness that wishes to grow and add new jobs.\n  One Maine business I know has 47 employees, and it would like to hire \nmore but won't because of these onerous penalties. Another employer \ntold me she is better off financially if she were to cancel the health \ninsurance she provides to her employees and instead pay the fines. The \nfines are cheaper than paying the health insurance premiums for her \nemployees. What perverse incentives ObamaCare has.\n  Greatly adding to the problem, ObamaCare defines full-time employees \nas averaging just 30 hours of work a week. This definition is \ncompletely out of keeping with standard employment practices in the \nUnited States today. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the \naverage American works 8.8 hours per day, which equates to 44 hours per \nweek. GAO, in looking at this issue, uses 40. We pay overtime after 40 \nhours per week. The number of hours set by ObamaCare as full time is \nnearly one-third lower than the actual practice.\n  By using this unreasonably low threshold of 30 hours per week to \ndefine a full-time employee, ObamaCare artificially drives up the \nnumber of full-time workers employed by a business, exposing the \nemployer and business to the risks of substantial penalties.\n  The consequences are some businesses are restricting their employees \nto no more than 29 hours per week to ensure their workers are \nconsidered part-time under ObamaCare. If more businesses follow suit, \nmillions of American workers could find their hours, and thus their \nearnings, are cut back at a time when many of them are already \nstruggling.\n  My amendment would allow for legislation setting a sensible \ndefinition of a ``full-time'' employee for purposes of ObamaCare \npenalties. This will help protect workers who otherwise will find their \nhours curtailed and their earnings cut as a result of the requirements \nin the ObamaCare law.\n  I would note this affects a wide range of employees. This is why you \nhave NAM, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the NEA, the \nNational Education Association--strange bedfellows indeed--both \nsupporting my amendment.\n  The second amendment I am offering is amendment No. 459. It calls for \nsensible regulatory reform. Its provisions are based on legislation I \nhave introduced in the past, the Clearing Unnecessary Regulatory \nBurdens Act or the CURB Act. This bill is designed to ease the \nregulatory burden on our Nation's job creators and is supported by the \nNation's largest small business advocacy group, the National Federation \nof Independent Business.\n\n[[Page S2260]]\n\n  My amendment would require Federal agencies to take into account the \nimpact on small businesses and job growth before imposing new rules and \nregulations. It does this in three ways: First, it requires Federal \nagencies to analyze the indirect cause of regulations, such as the \nimpact on job creation, the cost of energy, and consumer prices.\n  Second, it prohibits Federal agencies from circumventing the public \nnotice and comment requirements by issuing unofficial rules known as \n``guidance documents'' to avoid the review required under Executive \norders. Third, it helps small businesses avoid unnecessary penalties \nfor first-time, nonharmful paperwork violations.\n  The third amendment which I will offer is amendment No. 143. It would \nsimply require the President, Vice President, and Cabinet-level \nofficials to purchase their health insurance through the exchanges \nestablished by the Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare.\n  ObamaCare requires individuals to purchase qualified health insurance \nor face a penalty. Those who cannot obtain coverage through their \nworkplace or another source are required to purchase insurance through \nthe exchanges which would be created under this law. ObamaCare \nspecifically requires most Members of Congress and their staff to \nobtain health insurance through exchanges. If the exchanges are good \nenough for Members of Congress and their staffs, then surely that same \nrequirement should apply with respect to the President, Vice President \nand Cabinet-level officials. My amendment would extend this requirement \nto them.\n  Finally, I am also pleased to be cosponsoring an amendment with my \ncolleague Senator Casey of Pennsylvania to prevent government waste in \nthe Job Corps Program by requiring the long-overdue implementation of \nfinancial management, internal controls, and updated program integrity \nprotocols at the Employment and Training Administration.\n  What has happened with the Job Corps Program is an utter disgrace. \nThis program has significant shortfalls, which are caused entirely by \nthe inexcusably poor management of this program for 2 years in a row by \nthe Department of Labor. Job Corps is expected to be in a shortfall \nagain next year.\n  The impact has led the administration to suspend new student \nenrollment into the Job Corps Program. These programs are critical for \nat-risk youth. They provide education, training, and job skills. It is \na disgrace the administration has had such terrible management in \nWashington that furloughs are happening and students are being denied \nservices.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to adopt my \namendments today.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 47 minutes \nremaining, and the Senator from Alabama has 23 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. May I ask the Senator from Alabama if the Senator from \nVirginia may speak for 10 minutes? I see the Senator has some speakers \non his side?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I believe that would be appropriate.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Virginia \nfor helping to craft this budget and for his intense focus on making \nsure we reach a balanced agreement for our Nation's future. This has \nbeen his lifelong passion, and he has done a great job. He is a great \nworking partner, and I appreciate all of his experience.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let me thank the Chair for her good work \nand putting this budget together, which I believe is the first step as \nwe try to resolve this issue.\n\n  The Senator from Washington has mentioned this has become my passion \nin this body. I absolutely believe getting our debt and deficit under \ncontrol, getting the country's balance sheet right has almost become a \nproxy for whether our democratic institutions such as Congress may \nactually work in the 21st century. This debate we are going through is \nan important step in that direction.\n  We are about to proceed to the section of debate where a host of \namendments will be put up, debated, and decided. It is my hope sometime \nlater tonight or early tomorrow morning we will be able to conclude \nthis process and move on to the next steps.\n  As I listen to my colleagues, particularly from the other side, I do \nwish to make three quick, brief points because there are actually a lot \nof agreements between us. I think we all realize that in addition to \ntrying to get our tax policies and spending policies right--I agree \nwith the Senator from Oklahoma--there are areas of duplication which \ncould be improved upon.\n  I would point out one amendment this Budget Committee put together in \na bipartisan fashion--the majority and minority were working together--\nwas looking at the area of workforce training programs for further \nconsolidation. We are able, not just in workforce training but across \ngovernment, to find better ways to combine our programs and obtain more \neffective use of our tax dollars. I look forward to working with \nMembers on both sides of the aisle to do that.\n  I would also say while we have this problem about how we are going to \nraise our revenues and how we are going to spend, an important \ncomponent of all of this is how we grow our economy. One of the \nchallenges I find--and the proposal mostly from the House, which \nappears to be the proposal endorsed by many of our colleagues on the \nother side--I am not sure their budget proposal puts forth a growth \nagenda.\n  At the end of the day, countries, just as private companies--and I \nspent 20 years in business, longer than I have in public life--need a \nbusiness plan. Any good business plan invests in three things: people, \nplant and equipment, and an investment plan to stay ahead of the \ncompetition. Companies do the same thing; namely, invest in education, \ninfrastructure, and R\n  Unfortunately, the proposal which has been put out by the other side \nof the House would cut our government's investment in domestic \ndiscretionary spending from what is already at a very meager rate, \ncloser to the Eisenhower administration rates. We currently spend about \n16 cents on every Federal tax dollar on all of our domestic \ndiscretionary budgets combined. Over a period of time their plan would \ntake that 16 cents to less than 5 cents.\n  I spent 20 years investing in business. I would never invest in a \nbusiness which spent less than 5 percent of its revenues on its \nworkforce, its plant and equipment, staying ahead of the competition. \nNo country can stay competitive against emerging nations such as China, \nIndia, and Brazil. And Europe, facing financial crises, is trying to \nreset itself as well. Any of those nations are spending a larger \npercentage of their Federal revenues or their national revenues on \ntraining the workforce, building their roads, airports, broadband, and \nports. They are trying to do research and development, which creates \nthe intellectual capital which will drive our economy in the 21st \ncentury. Every other nation in the world with which we compete has a \nmuch more aggressive business plan than the business plan that would \nhave been put forward by the House. Unfortunately, it would be put \nforward by many of our colleagues on the other side if they were \nallowed to cut domestic discretionary spending at the levels they \npropose.\n  We have often heard a lot of discussion on this floor about revenues. \nI don't think anyone on either side wants to be taxed more than is \nnecessary.\n  The other side says we have a spending problem but refuses to look at \nthe other side of the balance sheet. As a business guy, I find that \ntroubling. I agree there are a number of areas where we need to cut \nback spending.\n  Look at revenues on a historic basis, look at revenues on the basis \nof when America had the fastest growth rate in recent time. During the \n1990s, with President Clinton, our Nation added jobs at a record level. \nOur Nation made innovative grants, innovation and discovery of great \nnew intellectual property at an unprecedented level. In the 1980s \nAmerica was considered to have seen our best days. We came roaring back \nin the 1990s.\n\n[[Page S2261]]\n\n  I didn't hear many complaints about our Tax Code in the 1990s during \nthose periods of enormous growth because of those investments and \nbecause of that growth early in the beginning of this century. Around \n2003, I think this body, and both parties, were part of it and made a \nmistake on assuming that the roaring good times were going to last \nforever. We cut $4.5 trillion over a 10-year period out of the revenue \nside.\n  Anybody who runs a business knows you must look at spending and you \nmust look at revenues. We took $4.5 trillion out of our revenue stream \nat the very same time we doubled defense spending and increased \nspending on homeland security. We went to war twice entirely on the \ncredit card. We provided new benefits for our seniors with prescription \ndrugs, and seniors were going through the normal aging process. Many of \nthose spending initiatives, again, were supported by both sides. But \nwhen the music stopped, we realized we had a structural budget deficit \nthat now accounts for $16.5 trillion in debt and it goes up by $3 \nbillion a night. While we have to take steps to rein in spending, we \nalso have to realize not to grow government but, just to pay our bills, \nwe have to put some of those revenues back into the revenue stream if \nwe are ever going to get to some level of balance.\n\n  Well, what does this side of aisle propose? Have they said, You know, \nwe need to go willy-nilly and go out and dramatically increase taxes \neven beyond what was proposed in the 1990s? No. Do the folks in this \nbudget on the Democratic side say we at least ought to put 70 cents of \nthat $4.5 trillion back into the revenue stream? No. Do we say we ought \nto put half of the revenues back into the revenue stream that we took \nout? Again, the answer is no. This budget, combined with what we did on \nNew Year's Eve, puts approximately $1.575 trillion over a 10-year \nperiod back into the revenue stream--literally only one-third of the \nrevenues that were taken out under the so-called Bush tax cuts back \ninto the revenue stream.\n  Yet to hear what folks on the other side say, it sounds as though \nthis is apocalyptic. Well, I have to tell you, as somebody, again, who \nwill match my business credentials against anybody in this body, you \nhave to look at both sides of the balance sheet. We have to find ways \nto rein in spending but we also, finally, have to find ways to make \nsure we have a revenue stream to allow us to meet our obligations.\n  A final point I wish to make--because I know my colleague, my good \nfriend from Oklahoma, wants to rise to speak as well--is that I believe \nvery strongly we have to get a handle on our entitlement programs. \nMedicare and Social Security are the two most successful programs our \ngovernment and, for that matter, probably any government around the \nworld, has ever implemented and we need to make sure the promise of \nMedicare and Social Security is going to be here for our kids and our \ngrandkids.\n  Around some of those programs some of the basic math has changed. \nWhen I was a young person, there were 16 people working for every 1 \nperson who was on Medicare and Social Security. Today, it is 3. In 15 \nyears, it will only be 2. So we do have to make changes. And this \nbudget starts us down that path--$275 billion in entitlement changes, \non top of $700 billion in entitlement changes that were part of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  If we are going to make comparisons, apples to apples--and this gets \na little bit technical, and I will again try to be very brief--I have \nnot heard a lot of my colleagues acknowledge this. When this debate \naround debt and deficit really picked up steam--it started back in 2010 \nwith a lot of very good bipartisan work done by the Simpson-Bowles \nCommission that pointed out we were on an unsustainable path and if we \ndidn't take action we would send our Nation over a fiscal cliff. In the \nSimpson-Bowles report, they pointed out we needed to make substantial \nchanges, for example, in Medicare and Medicaid. Well, they had some \nproposed changes that would have amounted to roughly over $400 billion \nin savings over a 10-year period.\n  What is remarkable, and is not mentioned, is that because--whether it \nis recession or the Affordable Care Act--the rate of increase of our \nhealth care programs and our entitlement programs over the last 3 years \nhas dropped dramatically, and independent of the $275 billion of \nentitlement savings in this budget, based upon the assumptions that \nwere made in 2010, based upon the Center for Budget Priorities, in \n2020, because of the declining rate of increase of cost, we will have \nan additional $500 billion in health care savings that are already \nbuilt into this proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds, and \nI will finish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would simply say that I want to commend this debate we \nare having and commend Members on both sides of the aisle. As I said at \nthe outset, no budget is going to be perfect for every Member, but this \nis a credible, important first step in this process, and one of which I \nthink we can all be proud. I look forward to finishing this debate and \nmoving on to the next stage to make sure we put this question of our \nNation's balance sheet in order and then move on to the other important \nissues our country faces.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague and friend \nSenator Inhofe. I think Senator Inhofe was told he had 8 minutes but \nthis says 5.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would respond to my good friend and say I will take the \n8.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. All right. There is 5 minutes, and if the Senator needs \nto go over that a little bit, I will understand.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Alabama very much.\n  We have been very much involved--not just myself but the Senator from \nAlabama and others--in this whole sequestration thing. The longer we \nhave these hearings on this, the more we come to the realization we are \nnot sure a lot of the things we are doing in these cuts are actually \ngoing to have the effect of cutting. If they did, our concern would be \nthe fact that defense, which consumes 18 percent of the budget, would \nbe getting 50 percent of the cuts, and that is over and above what this \nPresident has already done, projecting out in 10 more years at $487 \nbillion in cuts.\n  This sequestration is projected to be--the way it was drafted in the \nObama sequestration--an additional $\\1/2\\ trillion. I remember when the \nprevious Secretary of Defense was there and he used the word \n``devastating.'' It was devastating.\n  One thing that has not been observed is the possibility that some of \nthe things that are on there and are designed to be done will actually \ncost more money. Let me share, if I may, some quotes by some of the \nmilitary.\n  First of all, Department of Defense Comptroller Hale said--and this \nis very significant:\n\n       We would also be forced to disrupt as many as 2,500 \n     investment programs, driving up costs at the very same time \n     we are trying to hold them down.\n\n  In other words, he says that particular part of this could actually \ncost more than the cuts.\n  General Odierno said this at one of our hearings:\n\n       The Army agrees that the hidden costs of sequestration may \n     actually nullify any savings anticipated to be gained through \n     sequestration.\n\n  There again, it could actually cost us money, not save us money. \nAdmiral Ferguson said the same thing. I like his statement. He said:\n\n       Much like an automobile owner who chooses to skip a series \n     of oil changes today to realize near-term savings . . . \n     eventually his decision will result in the need for a costly \n     engine overhaul later, the downstream cost of cancelled \n     maintenance . . .\n\n  And that is what is going to have to be done under sequestration--\n\n       . . . is both reduced operational availability and much \n     higher depot-level type repairs in the future.\n\n  This is something that was understood by the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee and myself when Senator Levin and I jointly signed a \nletter to the budget people saying we have a problem; that \nsequestration could cost more, and we recommended that in those areas \nwhere it costs more, then we would add $16 million--that would be one-\nthird--to the OCO account so that could be used in the\n\n[[Page S2262]]\n\nevent--only in the event--we find we are spending more money on that.\n  As I say, I did give a copy of this letter as a reminder to the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Levin. So all we are doing is what \nwe requested be done some time ago. Most likely, it is not going to \ncost anything and it is not scored. This is the OCO account, and it is \nincreasing it $16 million more, to $66 million. It is interesting that \nin the budget that came over from the House it was $95 million, so this \nis considerably less than that.\n  I think this is a good thing to do, and I honestly believe it will \nenjoy enough support that we will be able to get it with a voice vote. \nI can't imagine anyone being against it. Because what we are saying is, \nin an area where it is costing more, we will have something to cover \nthat rather than it coming out of the defense budget.\n  I will not take a long time on this other one. I don't have the \nassurance yet that we are going to have a vote on it, but I think it is \nvery important. There are a lot of us here, and I daresay a majority of \nus in the Senate, who are looking at this United Nations arms trade \ntreaty and thinking: Why in the world would somebody want to cede to \nthe United Nations, or to any multinational group, the power to make \ndeterminations as to with whom we trade arms? We may have an ally out \nthere that maybe the United Nations doesn't agree with and they would \nbe able to keep us, through a treaty, from trading arms with our \nallies--an ally such as Israel, as an example.\n  So I have an amendment--amendment No. 139--that I will try to get a \nvote on because I think we should. This may end up being the only vote \nthat is addressing this real hot issue of guns right now, and that is \nall we have heard about in the last few weeks. I am going to tell you \nthe actual wording of this so we are not hiding anything.\n  If you are for gun control, you won't like this. If you are for the \nmultinationalists being in a position to determine with whom we trade, \nyou are not going to like this. And to show you what this is, I will \nread the new language in the bill. It says:\n\n       . . . upholding Second Amendment rights . . . preventing \n     the United States from entering into the United Nations Arms \n     Treaty.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am going to try hard and encourage our leadership to \nallow a vote on this very significant amendment. And I would say, if we \ncould pull out maybe 3 or 4 amendments of all the 200 or 300 \namendments, this would have to be one that most people would consider \nto be a very significant amendment.\n  With that, I would only mention one other thing. I am not going to \nbring this up, but I do have an amendment--amendment No. 282. A lot of \npeople in States such as Alabama and Oklahoma recognize that our banks \nwere not the problem. We didn't have problems in my State of Oklahoma. \nSo when we talked about State banks and community banks, we were in a \nposition to take care of our own needs and we should not be a part of \nit. So this amendment--and then I will close--merely says we are going \nto come forth with legislation. We are going to draw a distinction, not \njust on Dodd-Frank and that type of legislation, but between community \nand State banks and Federal banks. The latter is where the problem is, \nso let's not try to correct something or fix something that doesn't \nneed fixing.\n  Before I yield the floor, let me ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the letter from Senator Carl Levin and myself \ndated March 1.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 1, 2013.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Patty and Jeff: In accordance with your request, we \n     are forwarding our recommendations for the FY 2014 budget \n     resolution. As you know the Department of Defense races an \n     unprecedented level of fiscal uncertainty. Congress has not \n     completed action on FY 2013 appropriations, the government is \n     operating under a continuing appropriations resolution that \n     expires on March 27, and the FY 2014 budget has been delayed. \n     Additionally, discretionary accounts face sequestration \n     starting on March 1. Sequestration is expected to increase \n     the cost of defense programs, placing additional demands on \n     the DOD budget in the long run. We urge our colleagues to \n     support passage of full-year FY 2013 appropriations as well \n     as legislation that would eliminate sequestration in FY 2013.\n       Normally, the Committee would use the President's budget \n     submission as the starting point for developing our \n     recommendations for the FY 2014 budget resolution. While we \n     do not have a 2014 request the Committee notes that last \n     year's budget, submitted to the Congress on February 13, \n     2012, projected $579.7 billion in discretionary budget \n     authority for the Department of Defense in FY 2014. This \n     total included $535.5 billion for the base budget and $44.2 \n     billion for overseas contingency operations. The budget \n     request also projected $17.2 billion for defense programs in \n     the Department of Energy in FY 2014. Last year's budget \n     request, together with the out-year budget projections, was \n     developed pursuant to a new defense strategy released in \n     January 2012. We anticipate that meeting our national \n     security requirements and providing for our men and women in \n     uniform and their families will require the FY 2014 National \n     Defense discretionary and mandatory budget projections that \n     were included in last year's budget submission. We recommend \n     that the budget resolution for fiscal year 2014 include the \n     projected amounts of budget authority and the associated \n     outlays (subject to any technical revisions by the \n     Congressional Budget Office) for national defense.\n       If sequestration is implemented over the next seven months, \n     it will impose significant long-term costs on the Department \n     of Defense to recover acceptable readiness levels and carry \n     out the national military strategy. Accordingly, if Congress \n     is unable to enact legislation avoiding sequestration, we \n     recommend that the base budget for the Department of Defense \n     be increased by two to three percent to enable the Department \n     to address these problems. If such legislation is enacted, \n     the increase in funding will not be necessary.\n       The Committee recognizes the requirement pursuant to \n     section 411 of the fiscal year 2010 budget resolution that \n     directed Committees to review programs in their jurisdictions \n     to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse, and to include \n     recommendations for improving government performance. Last \n     year, the Committee was responsible for the enactment of the \n     FY 2013 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which \n     reduced the authorization levels for the Department of \n     Defense and the national security functions of the Department \n     of Energy by $29 billion when compared with the levels \n     authorized in FY 2012.\n       The FY 2013 NDAA included a number of cuts to the \n     President's budget request. For example, the FY 2013 NDAA: \n     cut more than $660.0 million from the President's budget for \n     military construction and family housing projects; prohibited \n     the obligation or expenditure of FY 2013 funds for the Medium \n     Extended Air Defense System eliminating a $400.9 million \n     expenditure; cut $200.0 million from the Commander's \n     Emergency Response Program; cut $197.0 million from Army and \n     Marine Corps' ammunition procurement accounts; cut $190.0 \n     million for the Joint Tactical Radio System; cut $175.0 \n     million from excess unobligated balances; and cut $77.1 \n     million from the request for development of the KC-46A \n     aircraft program.\n       In addition, the FY 2013 NDAA included a number of \n     provisions to improve defense contracting and reduce waste in \n     the operations of the Department of Defense. For example, the \n     legislation:\n       Requires the Secretary of Defense to implement a plan to \n     rebalance and reduce the DOD civilian employee workforce and \n     service contractor workforce, achieving a savings of 5 \n     percent in each workforce over a 5-year period while \n     providing the Secretary flexibility to exclude critical \n     elements of the workforce and to phase in reductions.\n       Improves the cost-effectiveness of DOD contracting by \n     strictly limiting the use of cost-type contracts for the \n     production of major weapon systems; enhancing protections for \n     contractor employee whistleblowers; restricting the use of \n     ``pass-through'' contracts; and clarifying DOD access to \n     contractor cost-and price-information.\n       Strengthens the authority of the senior DOD official \n     responsible for developmental testing on major defense \n     acquisition programs.\n       Restricts the use of ``pass-through'' contracts by \n     requiring a contracting officer determination to support any \n     contract on which more than 70 percent of the work will be \n     performed by subcontractors.\n       Requires DOD to review its existing profit guidelines and \n     revise them as necessary to ensure an appropriate link \n     between contractor profits and contractor performance.\n       Requires DOD and other agencies to conduct risk assessments \n     and take steps to mitigate significant risks associated with \n     contractor performance of critical functions in support of \n     overseas contingency operations.\n       Requires DOD and other agencies to establish clear chains \n     of responsibility for key acquisition functions in support of \n     overseas contingency operations.\n       Added funds to support the DOD Corrosion Prevention and \n     Control program. DOD estimates that corrosion in military \n     equipment costs the Services over $22.0 billion per year;\n\n[[Page S2263]]\n\n     expenditures in this area have yielded an estimated 14:1 \n     return on investment by reducing the bill for repair and \n     replacement of corroded systems and parts.\n       Added funds to support the DOD Inspector General (IG), to \n     enable the IG to continue growth designed to provide more \n     effective oversight and help identify waste, fraud, and abuse \n     in DOD programs, especially in the area of procurement. DOD \n     IG reviews resulted in an estimated $2.6 billion savings in \n     FY 11--a return on investment of $8.79 for every $1 spent.\n       The Committee will continue to develop recommendations to \n     improve the efficient management of taxpayer funds, including \n     identifying additional savings across the full range of \n     defense programs.\n       The Committee notes that last year the Department of \n     Defense submitted a program that included $487 billion in \n     budget cuts over ten years. The Secretary of Defense has \n     testified that the additional cuts required by sequestration \n     would be devastating to defense programs and would require a \n     new strategy with an unacceptable degree of risk to our \n     national security. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \n     has also stated that the military cannot absorb such cuts \n     without direct impacts to missions and capabilities. We agree \n     with these assessments and urge the Budget Committee to \n     develop a plan that avoids sequestration.\n       At this time, absent receipt of the FY 2014 budget request, \n     we believe that the funding levels we are recommending will \n     allow us to meet our current national security requirements. \n     We may wish to amend our recommendations after receipt of the \n     budget request and we look forward to working with you to \n     create a budget that supports our national security.\n           Sincerely,\n     James Inhofe,\n       Ranking Member.\n     Carl Levin,\n       Chairman.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time be divided equally between both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I allot myself 5 minutes of the time \nallotted to Senator Cornyn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the spending \ndecisions that are crippling the long-term budget outlook and the \nfutures of our children and grandchildren.\n  I am one of two accountants serving in the Senate, so the purpose of \nthe budget resolution makes a lot of sense to me. It is like an \naccounting ledger--a blueprint that lays out spending priorities for \nthe country for the next fiscal year. Back in my accounting days, I \nmade sure that the ledger balanced. I would look carefully line by line \nat what was being spent and where it was being spent. If the ledger \ndidn't balance, I looked at what could be trimmed from the overall \nbudget. To do that, I would sit down and prioritize what was needed to \nmake the business work, and what could be cut with the least impact on \nthe business or its customers. I would also look at where the business \nmight be duplicating some of its efforts and what could be cut there.\n  But that is not what we are doing in this exercise. We are not taking \na serious look at spending and making the necessary and tough choices \nabout what we can afford.\n  We aren't even able to vote on spending items that both sides agree \nare duplicative or wasteful, as we saw during the weeklong exercise \nwith the continuing resolution that passed yesterday.\n  What we should be doing is asking every agency to prioritize what it \ndoes from the best to the worst, and then we would be able to compare \nthat list to the wasteful and duplicative items that have been \nidentified, including some by my colleagues, such as Senator Coburn. He \nhas been tireless in his effort to identify these spending items and \nbring them to the attention not only of his fellow Senators but the \nAmerican people. Then we should cut what the Federal Government isn't \ndoing well.\n  We can also use the principle behind my One Percent Spending \nReduction Act--also known as the penny plan. This is a bill that has a \nsimple and direct plan to achieve the spending cuts necessary to \nbalance the budget. It would accomplish the task by cutting a single \npenny from every dollar the government spends every year for 3 years \nand end with a balanced budget after those 3 years. Taking this \napproach, each agency and program within that agency could determine \nits priorities and decide where to cut 1 percent of its budget. \nGuaranteed, if given the choice, agencies and programs--I hope--would \ncut the least important, the least likely to affect staff and overall \noperations. In other words, they would cut what they could do without, \nand every business and every agency has those things.\n  The problem is that every program has a constituency. Every program \nhas folks who are telling me or my colleagues: Yes, we understand the \nneed to cut spending, but my program is an integral part. So don't cut \nme, cut someone else.\n  At this point we have to step to the plate and say that there are no \neasy choices left. If we all feel a little bit of pain now, we can \navoid the pain we will face if we continue to kick the can down the \nroad when it comes to our long-term budget outlook. We have to get \nserious about providing a blueprint for future spending that provides a \npath to a balanced budget. We need a blueprint that funds the \ngovernment and necessary programs but takes an honest look at where \ntaxpayer dollars are going and makes changes to spend less and spend \nmore wisely.\n  Some of my colleagues across the aisle have talked about providing \nfor future generations in the budget resolution. With this budget we \nare providing for future generations--we are providing them with less \nprosperity and fewer opportunities by refusing to make some hard \ndecisions and saddling them with unpaid trillions of dollars in bills.\n  I have three children and four grandchildren who live in Wyoming. \nMany of my colleagues have children, grandchildren, nieces, and \nnephews. It is because of them and families across the country that we \nhave to make tough choices on our spending priorities, and we have to \nmake them now. This budget resolution doesn't do that. Instead, it is \nanother missed opportunity, another ledger that just doesn't balance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum, \nand I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would recognize Senator Cornyn for up to 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, tomorrow marks the third anniversary of \nthe Affordable Care Act--the law that President Obama said would reduce \nhealth care costs and strengthen our economy without forcing anyone to \nlose their existing coverage and without raising taxes on anyone making \nless than $200,000. Those were the promises of ObamaCare, but over the \nlast 3 years we have seen the reality, which is far different.\n  Reality No. 1: Amid the slowest economic recovery and the longest \nperiod of high unemployment since the Great Depression, ObamaCare \nrepresents a $1 trillion tax increase that will affect all Americans, \nnot just those making less than $200,000.\n  Indeed, ObamaCare is a tax increase that will affect everyone, from \nyoung people with health savings accounts, to middle-class workers with \nfamilies, to senior citizens on fixed incomes. It is a tax increase \nthat will punish investment and hinder medical innovation, a tax \nincrease that is already discouraging job creation and already hurting \nthe economy.\n  Reality No. 2: ObamaCare has not solved the problem of rising health \ncare costs, and in the years ahead it will make the problem much, much \nworse.\n  Remember, during the 2008 campaign, President Obama told us his \nhealth care plan would reduce family premiums by $2,500. Yet the cost \nof family\n\n[[Page S2264]]\n\npremiums has increased by nearly $2,400 between 2009 and 2012. And once \nthe President's health care law is fully implemented, premiums will \nsoar even higher.\n  All we need to do is look at the front page of the Wall Street \nJournal, which reports:\n\n       Health insurers are privately warning brokers that premiums \n     for many individuals and small businesses could increase \n     sharply next year because of the health-care overhaul, with \n     the nation's biggest firm projecting that rates could more \n     than double for some consumers buying their own health plans.\n\n  The truth is that young people will be hit the hardest, people the \nage of my daughters--31 and 30 years old. The American Action Forum \nrecently projected that premium costs for young and healthy Americans \nwill ``increase by an average of 169 percent.'' Such a dramatic \nincrease in health care premiums will come at a time when middle-class \nworkers and families are already struggling to make ends meet. After \nall, the median household income in America has fallen more than $2,400 \nsince 2009.\n  Reality No. 3: Even if you like your existing coverage, you probably \nwon't be able to keep it.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, 7 million Americans \nwill lose their health insurance because of ObamaCare. Another study \nestimated that 30 percent of employers would drop their employees from \ntheir employer-provided coverage. In short, millions and millions of \nAmericans who want to keep their existing coverage will be forced to \ngive it up.\n  Which brings me to reality number four. For starters, ObamaCare is a \nmassive job killer. No. 1, it increases a new tax on medical devices \nthat is already prompting companies to reduce investment in the United \nStates and lay off workers, including in my home State of Texas.\n  The Michigan-based company Stryker has recently shut down two of its \nfacilities and is cutting 5 percent of its workforce; the Indiana-based \nCook Medical has cancelled plans to build five new U.S. manufacturing \nfacilities; and New York-based Welch Allyn is slashing its workforce by \n10 percent.\n  Texas has more than 66,000 jobs in the medical technology industry, \nwhich ranks as among the top 10 States nationwide. But those jobs are \nat risk. According to one study, the medical device tax could destroy \nas many as 1,400 jobs in Texas alone, and reduce our economic output by \n$252 million. This tax will also hamper innovation and reduce patient \naccess to advanced medical devices.\n  Not surprisingly, the medical device tax is now facing strong \nbipartisan opposition. In fact, last night 79 Members of this Senate--\nRepublicans and Democrats alike--voted to repeal it. Seventy-nine out \nof one hundred Senators voted to repeal it.\n  Unfortunately, the medical device tax is not the only job killer in \nthe President's health care law. But as we consider this litany of \nbroken promises and as we sort through all of the unintended \nconsequences of ObamaCare, I can only shake my head in frustration.\n  Three years ago this Chamber had a unique opportunity to pass \ncommonsense, market-driven reforms that would have made health \ninsurance more affordable and health care more accessible, while \nsafeguarding the doctor-patient relationship and boosting our economy. \nI still believe we can achieve those goals. But the President's health \ncare law--now 3 years after it was passed--remains a huge obstacle \nstanding in our way.\n  That is why I supported an amendment to the continuing resolution \nthat would have defunded ObamaCare and an amendment to the budget that \nwould have repealed it. Both of these amendments were introduced by my \ncolleague Senator Cruz. Along with Senator Cruz, I will continue \npushing to replace the President's health care law with more sensible \nalternatives.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Cornyn for his remarks. I think it is a \ncautionary tale that when you pass a bill with the very stated idea \nfrom the Democratic leader in the House that ``We will find out what is \nin it after we pass it'' then you know we are in trouble.\n  ObamaCare is a monstrosity of a bill that has 1,700 references that \nsay we will execute this legislation pursuant to regulations to be \nissued by some nameless, faceless government operative somewhere. It \nwill bind and affect the very health care of millions of Americans. I \nhave become more and more convinced it will not work.\n  The budget that has been presented to us today fails to meet the \nchallenge of our time. It does not alter, confront, or reform and put \non a safe path our important Social Security and Medicare Programs, \nboth of which are heading to deficit and disaster. They need to be \nfixed now. The sooner we fix them, the better off we will all be. And \nit can be done. It just requires some willingness to stand up and be \ncounted and do the right thing.\n  There is no reform of the wasteful government duplicative spending \nthat goes on. Senator Coburn just went through a whole litany of \nduplicative programs: 47 job-training programs, many education \nprograms, huge duplication in highway programs throughout different \nagencies and departments of the government. We know those exist, and \nnothing has been done about it. It does not alter the debt course we \nare on and, in fact, keeps it at the same rate.\n  It says we are going to raise $1 trillion in taxes and we are going \nto cut spending $1 trillion, and this is the balanced approach. We have \nbeen told that over and over: This is a balanced approach.\n  But that is not what the budget does. It does indeed raise taxes--at \nleast $1 trillion actually--and it increases spending. So the net \nresult of this budget over 10 years is to have no effect on the deficit \neven though it raises taxes $1 trillion. A balanced approach, in the \nterms of my Democratic colleagues, is to raise taxes $1 trillion and \nraise spending $1 trillion. This is irresponsible.\n  I am baffled by the willingness of my colleagues to proceed in that \nfashion, representing the budget to be something it is not. I think \nthey have a guilty conscience, perhaps. We have been trying to keep up \nwith how many times they have used the word ``balanced.'' How many \ntimes in the last 2 days have the Democratic speakers all across the \nboard--who have their poll-tested language used the word ``balanced,'' \nwhen in fact they have an unbalanced budget that does not change the \ndebt course and leaves us on a financial path that the CBO Director \nsaid is unsustainable. But you know the American people want a balanced \nbudget, so you say: We have got a balanced approach, a balanced plan, a \nbalanced priority, and you use that word over and over, with the idea \nthat it sinks into somebody's mind and they begin to believe that you \nhave a balanced budget. I can hear an ad agency explaining how this \nworks.\n  But we don't have a balanced budget. It never balances. It has no \ngoal of balancing. It is no closer to balancing than the current \nbaseline and current law we are spending on.\n  So we have calculated--and the numbers have gone up every hour--201 \nreferences on the floor of the Senate to ``balanced.'' It just now \nbegins to highlight the fact of how unbalanced this is, how unbalanced \nthis budget is, how it does not do what we need it to do.\n\n  Back when I opposed the nomination of Jack Lew, who was Chief of \nStaff and OMB Director, to be Secretary of the Treasury, we talked \nabout his first budget. It was the same way. They decided in early \n2011, after the 2010 shellacking, to produce a budget that did not come \nclose to balance. They had a little problem because the American people \nhad just whacked the big spenders in the 2000 election. So what did \nthey decide to do? They just said it would balance. They said we are \nonly spending money we have. We have a budget that does not add to the \ndebt. We have a budget that begins to pay down the debt. All three of \nthose things were utterly false. The lowest single deficit, in his own \nnumbers he submitted to us, was $600 billion. That was the least that \nhe had in his entire 10-year budget of what the deficit would be that \nyear--$600 billion deficit. Yet he said we have a budget that pays down \nthe debt, we have a budget that only spends money we have, and a budget \nyou can be proud of.\n  That is what we have here. I hate to say it. My colleagues have \nproduced a budget that utterly fails to alter the\n\n[[Page S2265]]\n\ndebt course we are on. It raises taxes, but it does not use the taxes \nto reduce the deficit. It uses the taxes to fund new spending. It truly \ndoes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. HEITKAMP). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is the concern we have today. We will head now \ninto the votes. I thank Senator Murray for allowing us to have free \nability to speak and debate. We do not agree on these issues, but we \nwill head into an afternoon that hopefully will allow our Members a \nfull opportunity to get a vote on amendments, if they believe strongly \nin them. We hope we do not have needless amendments, that Members are \nlooking and understand the needs of our time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, the only time left in debate right now \nis Democratic time. But in a spirit of bipartisanship, I yield 5 \nminutes of our Democratic time to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nproviding time. I rise to discuss three of my amendments that I filed \nto the budget, amendment Nos. 293, 476, and 477.\n  My first amendment deals with an issue that is very important to my \nhome State of Nevada and nearly one dozen Western States where a bird \ncalled the sage grouse is found.\n  The Department of the Interior has engaged Western States in \ndeveloping State-specific Greater Sage-Grouse management plans to \naddress the threat of an Endangered Species Act listing for the bird.\n  Nevada is one of several Western States have convened task forces to \ndevelop recommendations for their respective Governors to serve as a \nfoundation for State-level sage-grouse management.\n  These State plans are designed to conserve the species and its \nhabitat while maintaining predictable land use policies as well as the \nability to foster a healthy economy and preserve the Western way of \nlife.\n  These goals can only be achieved if the States, Federal Government, \nand other concerned stakeholders use this opportunity to forge a \npartnership under the ESA.\n  My amendment simply reaffirms the importance of this partnership. It \nensures that States can continue to be drivers in ways to find a \nbalance between economic development and reasonable protections for \nwildlife.\n  My two other amendments, Heller Nos. 476 and 477, deal with another \nissue important to Nevada, namely, veterans. My first amendment is a \nstraight forward amendment that says that the Department of Veterans' \nAffairs needs to ensure that they meet the needs of a growing veterans \npopulation, female veterans.\n  As the dynamics of our Armed Forces are changing so, too, are our \nveterans.\n  This measure simply calls on the VA to take into account the \npopulation of female veterans when planning, leasing or building \ninfrastructures that will house veterans.\n  Ensuring that our female veterans have a lock on their door or a \nseparate wing in the VA facility or separate restroom ensures a level \nof safety and privacy that should be provided without question.\n  Last Congress I introduced legislation that focused specifically on \nmeeting the needs of female homeless veterans. My amendment builds upon \nthis legislation to ensure that it includes all VA facilities.\n  Another important component of our growing homeless veterans \npopulation are their dependents. My other amendment, Heller No. 477 \nsimply ensures that dependents of homeless veterans who are receiving \nservices at a VA-funded shelter are eligible for services as well.\n  In Las Vegas last year, there were more than 1,300 homeless veterans \nroaming the streets. Some of these individuals have their children with \nthem.\n  Right now if a homeless veteran brings their child to a VA facility \nfor the night, that facility is not authorized by Congress to provide \nservices to the child.\n  My amendment ensures that children of homeless veterans--veterans who \nbravely fought to preserve our freedoms--are not turned away from \nreceiving services if they are with their parent at a VA facility.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, we have about 12 minutes remaining. I \nask unanimous consent to give 2 minutes of my time to my colleague for \nhis closing remarks, and I will take the last 10 minutes.\n  I want all of my colleagues to know that we will start votes right \nafter we are finished with our closing remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator Murray. She has been a \ngreat person to work with. She is firm, clear, and tough, and has moved \nus forward. I always felt that when she made a decision, it was \njustified. She kept us under control and let us fuss and complain a \nbit. The content of the plan that the majority has moved forward I \nthink explains why they have had difficulty revealing it from the \nbeginning. It is because it is not the kind of budget that can be \ndefended effectively. Honest people can disagree on policy, but there \ncan be no disagreement, I believe, on the need to change our Nation's \ndebt course. A singular truth that no one can escape is that the House \nbudget changes our debt course while the Senate budget does not.\n  The Senate budget increases taxes, increases spending, and during \nthat 10-year period another $7.3 trillion will be added to the debt. \nThere will be no real deficit reduction, and it never balances. \nRepublicans have given opportunity after opportunity, through votes, to \nproduce a balanced budget, but that has been rejected.\n  The massive debt we racked up to finance our wasteful government is \npulling down economic growth today. This is so important for us to \nunderstand. Gross debt--over 90 percent of GDP--weakens growth; not \ntomorrow, it is weakening growth today. In other words, continuing to \nborrow to bail out the government, and keep checks flowing, creates \ndebt that pulls down wages, jobs, and job creation. It is time to stop \nshielding the government bureaucracy, which is hurting people today.\n  There is nothing virtuous about defending a broken welfare state that \nis trapping millions in poverty. Every time our colleagues raise taxes \ninstead of reforming the government, they are enriching that \nbureaucracy at the expense of the people. When they demand more money, \nthey are saying that reform is not important, just send us more money; \nwe are not at fault.\n  I will conclude and say, we have to move away from a budget and a \nplan that enriches the bureaucracy at the expense of the American \npeople.\n  I thank Senator Murray for her courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I want to thank all of my colleagues in \nthe Senate--and in particular, my ranking member Jeff Sessions--for \ntheir valuable contributions to the debate we have had over the last \nfew days and weeks. While there are clear areas of disagreement about \nhow to restore our Nation's fiscal health, this is an important \nconversation, and one we can build on.\n  We all like the word ``balanced.'' As chair of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, a critical part of my role is making sure the voices of the \nAmerican people\n\n[[Page S2266]]\n\nare heard in the budget process. I believe that budgets are about far \nmore than numbers on a page. They are about the values and priorities \nof the American people. In their daily lives, families across our \ncountry will feel the impact of the plan we lay out in a budget, and \nthey deserve a seat at the table. That is why at one of my first \nhearings as chairman, we invited inspiring Americans to speak about how \nthe Federal budget impacts their day-to-day lives and the opportunities \nthey have had to reach their own goals.\n  A young woman from New Hampshire named Katyanne Zink attended my \nhearing. She grew up in a low-income neighborhood in New Hampshire. Her \nparents didn't go to college themselves, but they desperately wanted \nthe best for their children. Thanks to a great public school teacher \nwho encouraged her to aim high, and with the help of Pell grants and \nstudent loans, Katyanne was able to go to college. She is now giving \nback to her community as an urgent care nurse. Tara Marks of Pittsburgh \nalso spoke at our hearing. Tara never expected to find herself in \npoverty, but when she was suddenly hit by hard times, she temporarily \ndepended on food stamps to feed herself and her young son. Tara firmly \nbelieves that without help when she needed it the most, she would not \nhave been able to get back on her feet.\n  We heard from Patrick Murray, who is an Operation Iraqi Freedom \nveteran. Patrick explained that after suffering severe injuries while \nserving his country, Federal support helped him live independently so \nhe could focus on finishing his degree.\n  The stories that Katyanne, Tara, and Patrick shared are just a few of \nthe millions we must keep at the forefront of this discussion because \nthe interest of hard-working Americans must come first in our \ndecisionmaking. I am proud that the Senate budget my colleagues and I \nput forward does exactly that. The first priority of our Senate budget \nis creating jobs and economic growth from the middle out, not from the \ntop down.\n  With an unemployment rate that remains stubbornly high and a middle \nclass that has seen their wages stagnate for far too long, we cannot \nafford any threats to our fragile recovery. That is exactly why our \nbudget responsibly replaces the harmful and arbitrary cuts from \nsequestration. It removes the unnecessary burden on our economy that \nwould lower employment by almost 750,000 jobs this year alone. \nFollowing the advice of experts across the political spectrum, the \nSenate budget invests in education and job creation targeted through \ninfrastructure and training initiatives while putting in place a \nresponsible plan for deficit reduction over the long term. To secure \nstrong economic growth in the future, our budget invests in our \ngreatest resource, the American people, by strongly supporting high-\nquality education from preschool through college and career training.\n  As my colleague Senator Warner said so eloquently here earlier on the \nfloor, we have to stay ahead of our competition. Our budget supports \nFederal R, which will help us make sure that growing industries and \nthe jobs which come with them take root in the United States, not in \nChina or India.\n  This budget also recognizes that getting our debt and deficit under \ncontrol is crucial to our Nation's economic strength in the coming \nyears. Our Senate budget puts forward serious, responsible deficit \nreduction that reflects the recommendations of bipartisan experts and \nthe values and priorities of the American people.\n  Back in 2010, the Simpson-Bowles Fiscal Commission recommended \nfinding about $4 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years. This has \nbecome, as we all know, the benchmark for other serious bipartisan \nproposals. Building on the $2.4 trillion in deficit reduction put in \nplace over the last 2 years, our Senate budget pushes us past that $4 \ntrillion benchmark with $1.85 trillion in deficit reduction that is \nevenly divided between responsible spending cuts and new revenue from \nthe wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations.\n  This budget cuts spending responsibly by $975 billion, and we make \nsome pretty tough choices to get there. By taking the balanced approach \nthe American people have consistently called for, our Senate budget \nmatches those responsible spending cuts with $975 billion in new \nrevenue, which is raised by closing loopholes and cutting unfair \nspending in the Tax Code for those who need it the least. This should \nnot be controversial. There is bipartisan support for reducing the \ndeficit by making the Tax Code more fair and more efficient.\n  If our Senate budget is enacted, the total deficit reduction since \nthe Simpson-Bowles report will consist of 64 percent spending cuts, 14 \npercent tax rate increases on the rich, and 22 percent new revenue by \nclosing loopholes and cutting wasteful spending in the Tax Code for the \nwealthiest Americans and biggest corporations. We will have put our \ndebt and deficit on a downward, sustainable path. This is a responsible \napproach. It is a balanced and fair approach. It is one that is \nendorsed by bipartisan groups and experts, and it is one supported by \nthe vast majority of American people.\n  The Senate budget takes the position that the solution to our fiscal \nchallenges will not be found in deep cuts to programs vulnerable \nfamilies depend on. It maintains crucial services that mothers such as \nTara and millions of other families struck by hard times have used as a \nway to make ends meet while they recover. The Senate budget preserves \nand protects Medicare for seniors today and into the future.\n  As Senator Stabenow explained on the floor so well yesterday, \nMedicare is vital to the health and well-being of more than 50 million \nseniors and Americans with disabilities. Upholding our commitment to \nseniors and helping struggling Americans get back on their feet is not \njust good for our economy, it is the right thing to do.\n  I realize there are serious differences between the parties, and in \nthe last few years it has been especially polarized here in Congress. \nBut the House has now passed its budget resolution. We will be working \nhere in the Senate to pass ours sometime late this evening. We have \npresented very different visions for how our country should work and \nwho it should work for, but I am hopeful that we can bridge this \ndivide.\n  As we look ahead now, I urge my colleagues to think of the millions \nof Americans such as Katyanne, Tara, and Patrick. I urge them to think \nof the millions of middle-class families across the country who are \nlooking to all of us to get this right; families who want us to invest \nin them and their communities; who want us to focus on the economy and \non opportunity and the future; who are not looking for a handout, just \na hand up when they need it; a government that works for them during \nthe good times and the bad; and who desperately want us to break \nthrough this gridlock and end the dysfunction that is hurting our \neconomy and costing them jobs. They are what this debate is about. They \nare who sent us all here to represent them.\n\n  The Senate budget works for families. It is a balanced and \nresponsible plan that will tackle our economic and fiscal challenges in \na way that puts the middle class and broad-based economic growth first.\n  When this comes up for a final vote tonight, I am going to be proud \nto vote for it, and I hope all of my colleagues will do the same.\n  When this passes the Senate, by the way, the work is far from \ncomplete. I will be working with Chairman Ryan in the House and anyone \nelse who is interested in coming together to make some compromises, and \nto get to a balanced and bipartisan deal that the American people \nexpect and deserve. It is not going to be easy, but I am hopeful it can \nbe done. I know the families who sent us here expect nothing less.\n  I wish to thank Senator Sessions again for working with me on this. \nWe have different views on many issues, but I am proud of the work we \ndid together to make sure we had a robust and fair debate in the \ncommittee and here on the Senate floor. I also wish to thank all of his \nstaff who have worked so hard, all of our staff who are continuing to \nwork--all of them--very hard behind the scenes to pull this together. I \nwish to thank all of my colleagues again on the Budget Committee for \ncontributing their ideas and their thoughts and their values to this \nresolution. I believe we have a very strong budget here. I am proud to \nvote for it, and I am very glad to have worked with so many people to \nget us to this point and, hopefully, in not too many hours we will pass \nthe budget in\n\n[[Page S2267]]\n\nthe Senate and can go to work for the American people.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Alabama has asked for 2 minutes and I \nwould be happy to oblige him as we are trying to work out an agreement \nto get going on votes. I yield him 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. How much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I will try to be careful and quick. I wish to thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington for yielding the time.\n  I rise today to once again express my concerns about the fiscal \nproblems facing our Nation. Thus far this year I have held public \nmeetings in 61 of my State's 67 counties. Without exception, my State's \ntop concern is our Nation's unsustainable debt and its effect on job \ncreation and economic growth.\n  Alabamians know the Federal debt currently stands at nearly $17 \ntrillion. Yet they see that the Democratic budget before us does not \nbalance--not in 10 years, perhaps not ever. They know the Federal debt \nhas increased by $6 trillion under President Obama. Yet they see that \nthe Democratic budget proposes to pile on $7 trillion more.\n  My constituents know that excessive taxes are choking job creation in \nthis country. Yet they see that the Democratic budget costs $1.2 \ntrillion of new job-killing taxes. They know the stimulus package was \nan abject failure.\n  My constituents understand that the more we borrow, the more we must \npay back in interest. Yet they see that under the Democratic budget, we \nwill pay more in interest on the debt--$791 billion--than we will spend \non national defense. They know that fiscal reform without entitlement \nreform is meaningless. Yet they hear no mention of entitlements in the \nDemocratic budget.\n  It has been 1,423 days since the Senate passed a budget. My \nconstituents waited that long for this. There is little wonder that \ntrepidation over our Nation's future is so prevalent. No dominant power \nin world history has remained strong with a weak economy--not the \nPersians, not the Greeks, not the Romans, not the British, not anyone. \nUnder the Democratic budget, our Nation would learn that lesson the \nhard way.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank all of our Members for their \npatience. I think we have an agreement put together, and we will be \nable to get going, so I would ask for everybody's attention.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the next amendments in order to be \ncalled up after the disposition of the Republican side-by-side \namendments to Shaheen No. 438 be the following: Menendez No. 651, \nCoburn No. 409, Whitehouse No. 652, Blunt No. 261, Boxer No. 622, \nHoeven No. 494, Durbin No. 578, Murray No. 653, and Collins No. 144; \nand that the only second-degree amendments in order prior to the votes \nin relation to the amendments listed above be the following amendments \nto the Durbin amendment No. 578: Enzi No. 656, Ayotte No. 657, and \nBaucus No. 658, to be offered in that order en bloc; that \nnotwithstanding all time having expired on the resolution, there will \nbe 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote, with the exception of \nthe vote prior to the Enzi second-degree amendment No. 656 to Durbin \nNo. 578, where there will be 40 minutes--10 minutes each for Senators \nDurbin, Enzi, Ayotte, and Baucus, or their designees; that the order of \nvotes with respect to the second-degree amendments to Durbin No. 578 be \nthe following: Enzi, Ayotte, and Baucus; that upon disposition of the \nCollins amendment No. 144, the majority have the next amendment in \norder; finally, that all after the first vote will be 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, we are now going to be starting a \nseries of votes. I would ask Members to stay in the Chamber. We are \ngoing to be very strict on the time in making sure we move through \nthese.\n  Again, I would ask all Senators to please respect those Senators who \nare speaking so that they can be heard, keep the conversations in the \ncloakroom, and be ready to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 239\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I would call up amendment No. \n239.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Udall], for himself and Mr. \n     Barrasso, and Mr. Wyden proposes an amendment numbered 239.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide additional suppression resources to the Forest \n   Service and the Department of the Interior for the protection of \ncommunities, homes, water supplies, utility infrastructure, and natural \n                 resources from catastrophic wildfires)\n\n       On page 20, line 19, increase the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 20, line 20, increase the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 46, line 11, decrease the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 46, line 12, decrease the amount by $100,000,000.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, wildfires threaten \ncommunities all across my part of the country, the West, but I daresay \nall around our great country. That is why I am proud to partner with my \ncolleagues, Senators Barrasso, Wyden, Bennet, Merkley, and others from \nthe West, to introduce what is a commonsense, bipartisan, and deficit-\nneutral amendment to the 2014 budget.\n  We need to reduce the Federal budget deficit. We all agree that is \nimportant. But if we don't invest in firefighting efforts and \nmitigation, that will levy an unacceptably steep and entirely avoidable \ncost upon Colorado and the entire country. So my amendment would allow \nfor an increase of $100 million in funding available for wildfire \nsuppression.\n  I yield time to my friend and colleague and cosponsor Senator \nBarrasso to speak on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I am pleased to cosponsor Udall \namendment No. 239. Communities in Wyoming and other Western States \ncontinue to be threatened by wildfires stemming from excessive fuel \nloads in our national forests, continued drought, and excess beetle-\nkilled timber. I speak in favor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I suggest we do this by voice vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, our side is amenable. If both Senators \nagree, we will do this by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 239) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S2268]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 630\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk, No. \n630, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mrs. Fischer], for herself Mr. \n     Cruz, Mr. Enzi and Mr. Johanns, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 630.\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to protect \n women's access to health care, including primary and preventive care, \n      in a manner consistent with protecting rights of conscience)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR DEFICIT RESERVE \n                   RELATING TO WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     related to women's access to health care, which may include \n     the protection of basic primary and preventive health care, \n     in a manner consistent with the First Amendment to the \n     Constitution, sections 506 and 507 of Division F of Public \n     Law 112-74, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, \n     the protection of religious beliefs and moral convictions and \n     without raising new revenue, by the amounts provided in such \n     legislation for those purposes, provided that such \n     legislation would not increase the deficit over either the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2013 through 2018 or the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2013 through 2023.\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise today to offer a side-by-side \namendment to Senator Shaheen's amendment No. 438.\n  My amendment defends the rights of employers opposed to subsidizing \ncertain health care services because of conscience objections or \nreligious beliefs.\n  We have all heard from employers, hospitals, and physicians who have \ntold us about their concerns about inadequate exemptions for those with \nreligious objections to certain types of health care services. In my \nhome State, the Nebraska Medical Association passed a resolution in \n2012 calling for increased protection of conscience rights for licensed \nphysicians. I am pleased that this amendment does just that.\n  The amendment does not add a dime to the deficit, it protects the \nquality of women's health care, and it defends the conscience rights \nand religious principles of employers and physicians. I strongly \nencourage my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, this amendment would allow any employer \nor insurance company to refuse to cover any health care services for \nwomen based on their own religious beliefs and moral convictions that \nhave nothing to do with the health needs of those denied coverage.\n  The compromise put forward by President Obama ensures that religious \nliberty is respected while ensuring that women can get access to the \nhealth care they need. Last year, Judge Carol Jackson, who was \nappointed by President George H.W. Bush, ruled in support of this \ncompromise, saying that Federal religious freedom law is ``a shield, \nnot a sword . . . it is not a means to force one's religious practices \nupon others.''\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nLautenberg) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 44, nays 55, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 55 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--44\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Enzi\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Lee\n     Manchin\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Pryor\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--55\n\n     Baldwin\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Collins\n     Coons\n     Cowan\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Hirono\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Lautenberg\n       \n  The amendment (No. 630) was rejected.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, for the information of all the \nSenators, that vote went a little bit over. We will not let votes go \nover. Anyone who is not in the Chamber is going to miss a vote. We have \nto be able to do this in order to move expeditiously. I want to let all \nSenators know they leave at their own peril.\n  With that, I am going to turn to Senator Menendez so he may offer his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 651\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 651.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Menendez], for himself, \n     Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Warren, and Mr. Cowan, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 651.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To call for a comprehensive approach for wage index reform)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3__. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND TO MAKE COMPREHENSIVE \n                   IMPROVEMENTS TO MEDICARE HOSPITAL WAGE-RELATED \n                   PAYMENTS.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     motions, or conference reports that would adjust Medicare \n     payments for hospitals, which may include adjustments to \n     reflect area differences in wage levels, by the amounts \n     provided in such legislation for those purposes, provided \n     that such legislation would not increase the deficit over \n     either the period of the total of fiscal years 2013 through \n     2018 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2013 through \n     2023.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, this is a side-by-side to Senator \nCoburn's amendment, and while I stand in strong opposition to the \nunderlying amendment of Senator Coburn, I do recognize the need for a \ncomprehensive examination to the current Medicare wage index system. \nHHS and MedPAC and others have issued detailed reports highlighting \nthat very fact, showing that the current system is full of special add-\nons, reclassifications, and other provisions that distort the overall \nsystem.\n  In essence, that amendment would create such harm in so many \nhospitals across this Nation from Alaska to New Hampshire, to Nevada, \nCalifornia, Colorado, Connecticut, Rhode Island, just\n\n[[Page S2269]]\n\nto mention a few. Our effort is to look at this comprehensively. We \nneed to look at the entire Medicare hospital wage index system. We \nshould not pick out one small provision that does so much harm to so \nmany hospitals across the country instead of addressing the system as a \nwhole.\n  I am joined in this with Senator Warren, Senator Cowan, and Senator \nLautenberg, among others, and I urge my colleagues to support the side-\nby-side amendment so we can address this in a comprehensive and \nresponsible way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. My colleagues might want to hear the other side of the \nstory. My amendment reverses $4.6 billion that was taken from rural \nhospitals all across this country and given to two States. Every \nMember's rural hospitals lose money based on the earmark placed in the \nAffordable Care Act. All this does is reverse that.\n  There is nothing in the amendment by the Senator from New Jersey \nabout wage neutrality, which is the whole problem in the first place. \nThe cosponsors, I am sure, of the two States have markedly benefited at \nthe expense of every other rural hospital across this country.\n  A vote for the Menendez amendment keeps us in line to continue to \ntake $4.6 billion over the next 10 years out of rural hospitals. If \nSenators vote for my amendment, we go back to a fair distribution for \nthe rural hospital payments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

All we are \ntrying to do is reverse what was done inappropriately.\n  There is no question we need to do some adjustment on wages. That is \nfor another time when we actually try to save Medicare.\n  This amendment requires all States but two over 10 years to increase \nthe payments to rural hospitals back to what they would have been had \nthe amendment by Senator Kerry in the Affordable Care Act not been \nthere. So that is the whole purpose, to bring us back to where we were.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator offer the amendment?\n  Mr. COBURN.

Mr. President, if there is no opposition, nobody on my \nside wishes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition.\n  First, there was an error made in the number for the Whitehouse \namendment for this sequence of votes. I ask unanimous consent that the \nWhitehouse amendment No. 646 be put on the list instead of Whitehouse \nNo. 652.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the amendment the Senator has offered \nwould reverse a provision in the Affordable Care Act which required \nthat Medicare's area wage index changes be spread budget neutrally \nthroughout the entire Nation.\n  I, as do many, recognize that Medicare's area wage index \nreimbursement system does require a thorough review and revision. But \nthe amendment in front of us now singles out one provision that \nnegatively affects some areas while ignoring the larger payment reform.\n  I believe Congress should have a larger discussion on area wage index \nreform within the committees of jurisdiction, and I urge my colleagues \nto oppose this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, may I call up amendment No. 646. I \nbelieve it is the next one in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President and colleagues, we have a new Pope, \nPope Francis, who said last week that our relation with God's creation \nis not very good right now. God's creation runs by laws--the laws of \nnature, the laws of physics, the laws of chemistry--and God gave us the \npower of reason to understand those laws. But they are not negotiable. \nThey are not subject to amendment or repeal. And the arrogance of our \nthinking that they are is an offense to His creation.\n  We can ignore obvious facts, we can ignore the essentially unanimous \nscience, we can ignore our generals and admirals, we can ignore the \ninsurance industry's warnings, but we ignore carbon pollution at our \nperil, and we have subsidized it long enough. It is past time to wake \nup from our sleepwalking. This vote is a test. Whether we pass or fail \nis a measure of us.\n  I urge that we support this amendment that will allow us to put a \nprice on carbon and protect the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I would have some hesitation anyway about \nopposing my good friend from Rhode Island, but to have to oppose the \nPope is really ominous.\n  I know the Pope also mentioned, more times than he mentioned carbon \ntax, helping the poor. This amendment says that if there is a carbon \nfee, we will use it to reduce the Federal deficit, to reduce Federal \ntax rates, to have other direct benefits.\n  I would just say, when the poor family cannot pay their utility \nbill--the family who is the last family to get the new refrigerator, \nthe family who is the last family to get the insulated windows, the \nfamily who is the last family to insulate their ceiling--I guess we \ntell them there are going to be some Federal tax rates that will be \nadded for a family who cannot pay their utility bill.\n  By the way, there are other direct benefits you might be able to use \nwhenever you do not have heat or you do not have cooling.\n  This is a tax that slows down our ability to compete. The most \nvulnerable among us are the most impacted by this, and I oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask \nunanimous consent it be called up on behalf of Senator Thune and me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Blunt], for himself and Mr. \n     Thune, proposes an amendment numbered 261.\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To create a point of order against legislation that would \n            create a Federal tax or fee on carbon emissions)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST LEGISLATION THAT WOULD \n                   CREATE A TAX OR FEE ON CARBON EMISSIONS.\n\n       (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the Senate \n     to consider any bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, or \n     conference report that--\n       (1) would result in revenues that would be greater than the \n     level of revenues set forth for the first fiscal year or the \n     total of that fiscal year and the ensuing fiscal years under \n     the concurrent resolution on the budget then in effect for \n     which allocations are provided under section 302(a) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974; and\n       (2) for any year covered by such resolution, includes a \n     Federal tax or fee imposed on carbon emissions from any \n     product or entity that is a direct or indirect source of the \n     emissions.\n       (b) Waiver and Appeal.--\n       (1) Waiver.--Subsection (a) may be waived or suspended in \n     the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n\n[[Page S2271]]\n\n       (2) Appeal.--An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be \n     required to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. This amendment would protect consumers from energy price \nspikes and workers from significant job loss by providing a point of \norder against a carbon tax or a fee on carbon emissions.\n  Energy-intensive jobs are the first to go when you utility prices get \nuncompetitive. Your ability to compete in the world marketplace, the \nprice of American-made goods, what families pay at the pump, what they \npay for heating and cooling, what they pay for every American product \nthey make would be impacted by a carbon tax.\n  I urge the support of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, except perhaps in Congress, and in the \nboardrooms of ExxonMobil, it is no longer credible to deny what carbon \npollution is doing to our atmosphere and to our oceans. We aid and abet \nthat harm by subsidizing carbon, distorting the market, by violating \nthe rule that the cost of a product should be in its price. \nNonrepealable laws of nature, laws of physics, laws of chemistry are at \nwork. History's judgment will be harsh if we continue to fail in \nrespecting those laws.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote and yield back to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending \namendment is not germane to the underlying resolution and therefore \nviolates section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 622.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to \n  protecting the interests of the United States in making a decision \n                 relating to the Keystone XL pipeline)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3__. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND TO PROTECT THE \n                   INTERESTS OF THE UNITED STATES IN MAKING A \n                   DECISION RELATING TO THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for 1 or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to expeditiously analyzing and making decisions on \n     the Keystone XL pipeline, which may include whether the \n     pipeline is in the national interest if it increases oil \n     prices, harms domestic energy security, including through \n     exporting energy products, uses materials not manufactured in \n     the United States, adversely affects individual property \n     rights, otherwise adversely affects job creation in the \n     United States, or our national security by the amounts \n     provided in the legislation for those purposes, provided that \n     the legislation would not increase the deficit over either \n     the period of the total of fiscal years 2013 through 2018 or \n     the period of the total of fiscal years 2013 through 2023.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my amendment simply ensures important \nissues will be addressed, such as how much oil will stay here versus \nhow much will be exported and, therefore, will we suffer from higher \nenergy prices? How much steel will be made in America? How many private \nproperty rights suits will result from this pipeline? We have had a lot \nof them on the southern lake.\n  How will this affect our national security, the dirty tar sands oil? \nOur American national security experts warn us against the instability \nworldwide caused by climate disruption.\n  I urge an ``aye'' vote on this amendment, regardless of how you feel \nabout Keystone. These are essential issues which must be addressed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask this amendment be opposed. It is an \neffort to prevent construction of the most studied pipeline in the \nhistory of the United States. After four environmental impact \nstatements, every one of the reports has shown no environmental impact. \nEvery State on the route has approved this project. The studies which \nare asked for in this amendment have been done.\n  In 2011, the Department of Energy provided a report and said the oil \nwill be used in this country, and we will need more. In addition, this \nwould preclude local eminent domain laws which would prevent the \npipeline from being constructed. It also says you can't use any \nmaterials manufactured in Canada for a pipeline which is built half in \nCanada and half in the United States.\n  I urge a ``nay'' vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 494\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, this amendment is a bipartisan amendment. \nIt puts the Senate on record in support of the Keystone Pipeline \nproject, and that is just appropriate. As I said just a minute ago, \nevery State has approved the project. The Department of State has done \nfour environmental impact statements over the last 5 years--four--and \nhas said there are no significant environmental impacts. So it is time \nthe Senate stepped up with the American people.\n  In a recent poll 70 percent of the American public said: Build the \npipeline. Only 17 percent said they opposed it. So it is time for us to \nenjoin every single State on the route to say we support this project. \nWe support this pipeline. After 5 years, let's build it.\n  This is energy, this is jobs, this is getting our economy going and \ngrowing, and this is making sure we don't have to import oil from the \nMiddle East. It is not just oil from Canada, it is oil from the great \nState of North Dakota and Montana--light, sweet crude we need to get to \nour refineries. Please join me in voting yea.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator call up the amendment?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I call up the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Hoeven], for himself, \n     Mr. Baucus, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Manchin, Mr. Roberts, Ms. \n     Heitkamp, Mr. Barrasso, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. \n     Begich, proposes amendment numbered 494.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to promote \n investment and job growth in United States manufacturing, oil and gas \n   production, and refining sectors through the construction of the \n                         Keystone XL Pipeline)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3__.

The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, Mr. President, the handwriting is on the wall. I \nsee it. But I do believe when my colleague argued against my \namendment--and he was quite successful--it was not an accurate \nargument.\n  The fact is his amendment has already made the decision for us that \neverything is hunky-dory with this pipeline. Well, it is not true that \nall the work has been done. We don't know how much of the steel will be \nAmerican; we don't know how many of the jobs will be American; we don't \nknow if our national security people think that dirty tar sands is \ngoing to create climate disruption.\n  Wake up. This is the only place in America where people don't \nunderstand that real climate disruption is very dangerous.\n  You want to talk about polls? Look at what the people think about \nextreme weather. Look at what the people think about too much carbon \npollution. So there will be another day to fight, but I want to say to \nmy friend--he is a good guy, and we have worked well together on this. \nBut I hope we will vote no and allow the process to continue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, before we go to this vote, I would just \nremind all Senators that at the end of this vote there will be up to 40 \nminutes of debate before the next amendment. I would ask all Senators \nwho leave the floor to be back here by 6:30, maybe a little bit before \nthat. But I would remind all of my colleagues that if you drift back in \nfor half an hour on the first vote, it will be later and later as we \nget through this. So I would really ask everyone who leaves after they \nvote to be back here at 6:30 at the latest. We may yield a little bit \nback, but please be back by that time.\n  With that, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding under the unanimous \nconsent request there was 40 minutes of debate allocated between those \nof us in support of the Marketplace Fairness Act and those who are \noffering amendments, Senator Ayotte and Senator Baucus; is my \nunderstanding correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does the Senator mind if I say a word in opening?\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act is known to every Member of the Senate \nbecause I have spoken to everyone on this side of the aisle, and I \nthink Senator Enzi and Senator Alexander have spoken to everyone on the \nother side of the aisle. First, give credit to the Senator from \nWyoming, Mr. Enzi. He began this effort 14 years ago. He is a small \nbusinessman by profession and when he came to the Senate he saw a \nproblem that needed to be solved and he has done yeoman's work to reach \nthis point in the debate.\n  I salute him for that effort. I thank him for allowing me to join and \nbring it to the floor this day. Special thanks to Senator Alexander \nfrom Tennessee, who has been an able partner in allowing us to bring \nthis matter before the Senate.\n  This is an issue every American can understand. We now live in the \nInternet age. Internet retailers are selling things over the Internet \nthat we are buying every single day. Estimates are that $150 billion in \nsales are made each year over the Internet. That is part of America. It \nis part of our economy. But it has created an unfairness which we need \nto address with this legislation.\n  Back home in Massachusetts, in Illinois, in Tennessee, in Florida, \nthere people with shops and businesses who get up every morning and \nopen those shops, watch their employees file in and do business \nlocally. When they make their sales of goods and services, they collect \nthe sales taxes which each State requires and they collect other taxes \nas well. Their taxes sustain businesses, sustain schools and highways \nand police protection.\n  Unfortunately, a Supreme Court decision of almost 20 years ago, the \nQuill decision, basically said if we are going to require the Internet \nsales to collect sales tax, Congress has to do it. That is why we are \ntonight on this Marketplace Fairness Act.\n  What we are proposing is not a new tax. It is the collection of an \nexisting tax, a sales tax that is basically owed in all but four States \nacross the United States.\n  We believe this is a fair thing to do so those local businesses have \na fighting chance; otherwise, they are competing against retailers who \ndo not collect sales taxes and have that price advantage over them.\n  That is not fair to the businesses on Main Street across America. It \nisn't fair to our economy. What we are looking for is basic fairness.\n  At this point, I yield the floor to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Durbin and Senator Enzi \nfor their hard work. They have taken a problem and simplified it and \nsolved it, in my opinion. This is an 11-page bill, a rarity. It does \nonly one thing. It gives States and State legislatures the right to \ndecide to collect sales and use taxes that are already owed from all \nthe people who owe it rather than just some of the people who owe it.\n  I have a very conservative friend over here on the Republican side \nwho said to me: I hate taxes, but the one thing I hate worse is people \nwho owe taxes who do not pay them. That is what this is about. But for \nme as a former Governor, there is something even more important; that \nis, the importance that we respect our constitutional framework, which \nsays Governors and legislatures should make their own decisions about \ntheir services and their taxes.\n  That is the spirit of the 10th amendment. That is the spirit of this \ncountry. We don't require States to play Mother May I to the Congress \nof the United States. So we say to the Governor of Tennessee and the \nlegislature of Tennessee: You decide whether you want to allow people \nwho owe the sales tax not to have to pay it because the sellers do not \ncollect it.\n  That is why many Democratic Governors support this. But a growing \nnumber, an honor role of conservative leaders and Governors, support \nthe Marketplace Fairness Act. Al Cardenas, chairman of the American \nConservative Union, supports it. He says the system we have today is \noutdated and unfair. After that, Governor McDonnell of Virginia, \nGovernor Corbett of Pennsylvania, Governor Haslam of Tennessee, Chris \nChristie of New Jersey, Mike Pence of Indiana, Mitch Daniels, Jeb Bush, \nHaley Barbour, Rick Snyder--they all say: Look, we are Governors of the \nStates. We should have the responsibility for doing that.\n  There have been some strange arguments made against this, such as \nwait for tax reform. How can you do this in tax reform if it not in the \nTax Code? Have we sunk to a new low where we use the State budgets to \nbalance our own budget?\n  No, this is a straightforward issue. Are we going to respect, as we \nswore to do when we took an oath to this constitutional framework--are \nwe going to respect the States, recognize that States have the right to \nbe right and the States have the right to be wrong; that Illinois is \ndifferent than Tennessee and Tennessee is different than Wyoming. \nGovernors in those States can decide what their tax structure should \nbe, how they want to direct it, and they should decide, in my opinion, \nalthough we do not have to decide that here, that they would not pick \nand choose between sellers, pick and choose\n\n[[Page S2274]]\n\nbetween taxpayers and businesses. If I walk into the National Boot \nCompany and try on a boot and buy it, the seller collects the tax, \nsales tax. If I order in a catalog the seller does not. The Governor of \nTennessee wants to be able to treat them the same.\n  I think we should do this. I fly up here every week for an hour. That \nhour plane ride doesn't make me any smarter than I was when I left \nNashville. I think our Governor, our Lieutenant Governor, our \nlegislature--very conservative, very Republican--understand that they \ndo not like taxes, but they do not like, worse--they do not like, \nworse, people who owe taxes but do not pay them, and they want the \nright to fix that problem.\n  I am in strong support and stand with the 15 or so Senators on both \nsides of the aisle who endorse the Marketplace Fairness Act. I \ncongratulate Senator Durbin and Senator Enzi for their hard work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will yield a couple minutes to myself.\n  Different States have different regimes. Some States decide they want \nto have income tax. Other States have big property taxes. Other States \nsay they want to have sales tax but not income tax. There are many \nStates with no income tax and those States are States some people \ngravitate to because they do not want to pay State income taxes.\n  But I think States should have the right to choose their own taxation \nsystem, and we should not pass legislation which tends to force a \ncertain State taxation system on the others. That is what this \nlegislation does. It basically forces all States to have sales taxes, \nwhether they want one or not. In my State of Montana, sales tax is \nanathema. Nobody touches a sales tax.\n  What this says is: OK. You can have a sales tax, eventually, in my \nState, because we don't have a sales tax, and, therefore, businesses in \nMontana don't collect sales tax, but they will have to collect tax on \nsales for other States. In effect, we are going to be forced to have \none and we don't want one. We are going to fight it fiercely.\n  Second, basically, the language says, I will read it to you, allowing \nStates to `` . . . enforce State and local use tax laws and collect \ntaxes already owed under State law on remote sales by the amounts \nprovided in such legislation for those purposes. . . . ''\n  Essentially, it says a person in California can use State law to \nenforce and collect--and audit even, probably--a businessperson in \nanother State. I have never heard of this happening before. Just think \nof it. We are asking, and telling, and directing States to force law on \nanother State, at least on another businessman in another State. I have \nnever heard of this. This sets a terrible precedent. We don't want to \ndo this.\n  Next is the complexity of this thing. The authors of this have been \nworking on this issue for 12 years, saying they have all these computer \nprograms that can do it. We have never seen it. There is no indication \nthat all the bugs, over thousands of jurisdictions in States and \nlocalities and municipalities--just put yourself in the position of a \nsmall businessperson trying to figure out what in the heck is the law \nin this jurisdiction. What about that? It is going to be changed this \nyear or next year, changed in lots of jurisdictions all over the \ncountry. How are we going to deal with it? We are not going to be able \nto do it. It is just a maddeningly complex situation.\n  I have lots of other points I wish to make later, but those are two. \nI believe it makes much more sense, with all the complexity in this \nthing, for the committee of jurisdiction, the Finance Committee.\n  I disagree with my good friend from Tennessee. Of course it is a \ntax--not a State tax, not a payroll tax, it is a sales tax. It is a \ntax. We could easily deal with this in the Finance Committee. That is \nour jurisdiction. That is what we are supposed to be doing. Then he can \ndeal with all these complexities that have not been addressed in this \nresolution. There are no protections in this resolution whatsoever.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire to \nuse in any way she wants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I stand in opposition to this so-called \nMain Street Fairness Act. There is nothing fair about Federal \nintervention in the Internet marketplace. We have seen so much \nentrepreneurship in the Internet marketplace. Yet what this does is \nforce the Internet marketplace and online businesses to become tax \ncollectors.\n  This act should be called what it is--the Internet tax collection \nact. This act essentially forces States to become tax collectors for \n9,600 State and local tax jurisdictions across this country. It \ntramples on States rights. It tramples on the rights of private \nbusinesses in all States but especially in States such as mine, New \nHampshire. It creates a bureaucratic nightmare for these States that \nwill have to comply with almost 10,000 tax jurisdictions across this \ncountry. Guess what. They could be subject to nearly 10,000 tax audits \nwithin those jurisdictions. One of the businesses in New Hampshire--and \nI see Senator Shaheen is here as well--said that it is a job killer. \nCompliance with this act is absolutely terrifying and another blow for \nso many small businesses that are using the Internet.\n  Finally, I say to my conservative friends, there is nothing \nconservative about this. It is the long arm of the Federal Government \npunishing States such as mine that don't have a sales tax and have made \nfiscally responsible choices. It picks winners and losers instead of \nletting the marketplace do it.\n  There are a whole host of conservative groups that have come out \nagainst this act, including the Heritage Foundation and the Campaign \nfor Liberty. The Americans for Tax Reform has, in fact, said this \nlegislation can only be viewed as a tax increase. In addition to the \ngroup I just mentioned, the Cato Institute, the National Taxpayers \nUnion, and The Heartland are against this as well. There is nothing \nconservative about this. This tramples on States rights. Think about \nit. This act turns online sellers into tax collectors because States \nare cash-strapped. It is wrong. I hope my colleagues will vote against \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think it is time for those on the other \nside to say a word or two.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate the compliments from the two \npeople who are from States that don't have the sales tax. We are not on \nthe bill. This is an amendment to find out if a majority of the Senate \nis in favor of making sure we go through with some legislation that \nwill actually solve the problem that is over 20 years old.\n  This is a problem the Supreme Court decided on and said Congress was \nthe one that needed to fix it. They didn't say States should fix it, \nthey said Congress should fix it. What we have been trying to do is fix \nit.\n  I had a complicated bill before called the streamlined sales tax \nbill. It took care of a lot of the problems we are talking about, such \nas multijurisdictions, and allows for one check to be dispensed to one \nlocation and then distributed to those who are participating.\n  Senator Alexander had a better idea, and that is the one which is in \nthe bill that is before us, and that is one which makes it States \nrights. It is where States can decide what they are going to do and how \nthey are going to do it provided they follow a certain number of rules. \nThis is not as definitive as that bill yet because that bill would have \nto pass through this body as well.\n  I can assure everyone that no person in a State that doesn't have a \nsales tax now would have to pay a sales tax. If there is a business \nselling into a State that does have a sales tax, yes, they would have \nto collect that sales tax and forward it to that State. If there are \ncomplexities or conflicts with that, those can be worked out as the \nlegislation goes through too.\n  Nobody mentioned that there is a $1 million exemption in the bill. So \nwhen we talk about small businesses, if they have less than $1 million \nin sales, they don't have to do this. Once they reach $1 million in \nsales, they have to do it the next year so it doesn't become a problem \nthat starts in the middle of the year.\n\n[[Page S2275]]\n\n  It also requires that the States provide the information and the \nprograms for them to do this. So it is a States rights issue, and that \nis what the Supreme Court suggested when they suggested we needed to \nfix this.\n  If Senators talk to their small businesses, they will find that they \nwant it fixed because there is not fair competition anymore. People \nwill come into a store--I was in the shoe business--and try on shoes. \nThey get all the help they need, find out what they want, and then just \norder it over the Internet. I think it is kind of interesting when they \nsay: Well, I got free shipping. When someone goes into a store and \ntries on shoes, they can get it that day. There is not even a day's \ndelay; express shipping is not even needed.\n  I hope we are able to work on the bill and actually complete a bill \nand take care of the difference that is taking money away from States. \nThey are not asking the Federal Government for a single dollar. They \nare not asking for the Federal Government to enforce this. They are \nasking for the right to have their States rights.\n  I yield the floor, and I will keep the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 7 minutes, the \nSenator from New Hampshire has 7 minutes, the Senator from Wyoming has \n7 minutes, and the Senator from Illinois has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the \nSenator from Oregon. I might say that I yield 1 minute to the other \nSenator from Oregon as well. I urge the Senator not to use it all right \nnow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Durbin-Enzi amendment forgets that we \nare in a global economy. This measure does not and cannot reach foreign \nretailers. A small business, for example, in Montana is sacked with the \nburdens of this bill. It is an administrative nightmare, which Senator \nBaucus and Senator Ayotte have outlined. Some businesses are just going \nto say: Why not do business in Canada or Mexico or even China. Now, I \nknow my colleagues who are advocating this don't intend this result, \nbut their legislation really ought to be called the shop Mexico bill or \nthe shop Canada bill or the shop China bill. I don't think that makes \nany sense.\n  Chairman Baucus handles these global economic kinds of questions in \nthe Finance Committee, and that is the place we ought to look at it, \nand that is why we ought to reject this amendment today.\n  I yield the floor and reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, in Oregon we don't like the sales tax, \nand that is why we don't have one. It is regressive and more expensive \nto collect. What we hate even more is some State telling us what we \nhave to do. I have heard people on this floor talking about States \nrights all the time, and now folks are standing up here and saying: We \nwant your retailers to collect our tax, and we are not even going to \ncompensate them for their time or effort. That is virtually a taking.\n  As my colleague pointed out, this is really about attacking business \nin America, small- and medium-sized businesses in America, which will \njust end up benefiting our foreign competitors. That is wrong, and we \nshould oppose this for those multiple reasons.\n  I yield back time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to my colleague from New \nHampshire, Senator Shaheen.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nNew Hampshire, Senator Ayotte, and the other opponents of this \namendment.\n  Senator Alexander said that States should be able to decide what to \ndo about taxes. Well, in New Hampshire we have decided. We don't want a \nsales tax. We don't collect one, and we don't ask our small businesses \nto collect one. And the fact is that this amendment would harm small, \nfamily-owned retail businesses in New Hampshire.\n  I talked to a business in Hudson, NH, which is along the border with \nMassachusetts. He has six employees, and he is about to reach $1 \nmillion in sales. He said that under this legislation, his company \nwould have to start collecting taxes not just in New Hampshire but for \n45 other States. It would put him at such a disadvantage that he could \nnot continue to grow. Just as Senator Wyden said, what these businesses \nare going to do then is go look for someplace else where they don't \nhave to worry about collecting these taxes over the Internet.\n  I agree with Senator Alexander. I think we should ensure States \nrights and ensure that small businesses are protected, but we don't do \nthat by passing this amendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield a couple of minutes to my \ncolleague from Montana, Senator Tester. I understand Senator Ayotte is \ngoing to yield additional time.\n  Mr. TESTER. I thank the senior Senator from Montana. I thank the \nSenator for allowing me to be a part of this discussion.\n  This is an incredible overreach. The Senator from Wyoming talked \nabout the fact that they are not forcing a sales tax on any State, but \nthat is what this does. This amendment will require our small \nbusinesses to collect taxes from other States. This is an incredible \nviolation. It changes the entire standard for tax collection. It is not \na road anyone wants to go down. Yet we are going to allow businesses in \nTennessee or Illinois or Wyoming or any other State in the Union that \nhas a sales tax to walk into my State and tell my small businesses that \nthey are going to collect taxes for other States. Who is going to pay \nfor that and who is going to do the audit?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire said it is a job-killing bill. Well, \nit is a job-killing bill, but it is a great job creator in the \nbureaucracy. We are going to create bureaucracy in this government for \ntax collection like we have never seen before. There will be auditing \nlike we have never seen before. Who pays for it?\n  I guarantee it is not fair to force this kind of tax collection for \nanother State and then tell another State what they have to do to \ncollect taxes. It makes no sense.\n  There are State and local taxes. There are all sorts of different \nmechanisms here. If there is a State that collects a 5-percent tax and \nanother one that collects 10 percent, the business that has a 5-percent \nsales tax will have to collect another 5 percent and bring it back to \nthat other State. Does it sound complicated? It is. It is very \ncomplicated.\n  We do not want to go down this road. This is a bad, bad, bad public \npolicy. I encourage everyone in this Chamber and everyone who is \nwatching on C-SPAN to vote this amendment down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 2 minutes, the \nSenator from New Hampshire has 5 minutes, the Senator from Wyoming has \n7 minutes, and the Senator from Illinois still has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest their side has more time \nremaining, so they should speak next.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thought my colleagues from New Hampshire \nand Montana might share with us a little bit about the amendments they \nare proposing, but in light of them not doing that, I yield 2 minutes \nto the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming. I will \nyield my time to the Senator from North Dakota, who was a party to the \nQuill decision, which was before the U.S. Supreme Court 20 years ago, \nand who has also served as tax commissioner in the State of North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I would like to make a couple of points \non foreign corporations. We already collect sales tax and impose use \ntax on foreign corporations all the time. In fact, North Dakota does \nrequire probating so long as they have a physical presence in North \nDakota.\n\n[[Page S2276]]\n\n  On the issue of New Hampshire and Montana, I will bet I could find \nsmall businesses that are in New Hampshire and in Montana that already \ncollect sales and use taxes for other States. The only thing that this \ndoes is change the rules regarding what is required on nexus. What is \nthe single thing that happens that requires a collection \nresponsibility? For years, not just in the Quill case, but National \nBellas Hess said there has to be a physical presence. The world has \nchanged since we have physical presence. We now say economic presence \nis adequate for equal protection to be satisfied.\n  What we are asking for is that we look at economic presence the same \nway we do across the boundaries and create fairness for mainstream \nbusinesses. What do I mean by that? I mean Main Street businesses that \nevery day compete against Internet sellers unfairly, Main Street \nbusiness that are struggling, Main street businesses that put ads in \nfliers for local schools and contribute to their community but yet \ncannot survive because they cannot afford a 7-percent or 8-percent or \n9-percent disadvantage in the marketplace. It is not fair. It is not \nfair to Main Street. We need to recognize the reality. We have heard \nabout the global economy. My colleague is right, the economy has \nchanged. How we do business doesn't depend on physical presence \nanymore, it is economic presence, and $1 million is a lot of economic \npresence in the marketplace.\n\n  So I yield the remainder of my time back to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, things are getting a little down to the \nwire here. How much time is remaining?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, is there any time remaining of the time \nyielded from the Senator from Wyoming?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has 4 minutes \nremaining.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will be very brief. Under this amendment, we could not \ntouch an online retailer that is wholly overseas shipping into the \nUnited States with UPS. We could not touch them.\n  What the Senator from North Dakota is talking about is obviously \nforeign corporations, people with physical presence. But if you are \nwholly overseas, an online Internet retailer shipping into this \ncountry, you get a free ride under this legislation. That is why it is \ngoing to create an incentive to take American jobs from here and locate \noverseas where they get a free ride.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I yield 3 minutes of my time to the Senator from Florida, \nMr. Rubio.\n  Mr. RUBIO. This is a very interesting debate. It is a very \ninteresting topic to talk about. I have talked to a few Members who \nhave had this debate internally with their staff, and from an \nintellectual perspective it is a very interesting issue. But I want \nMembers to understand what they will have to explain to people in their \nStates.\n  If something like this were to happen, there will be businesses in \nyour State that at the end of the year will have to be audited by or \ninteract with States across the country, on the other side of the \ncountry; places where they don't know anybody, places where they don't \nhave a lawyer or a lobbyist or anybody representing them. They will \nhave to deal with States they have nothing to do with. That is what \nMembers will have to explain to the businesses in their States.\n  The businesses in your States are going to have to comply with laws \nand courts and regulatory agencies and others they have nothing to do \nwith, other than the fact that someone who lived there happened to buy \nsomething from them. So try explaining that. It sounds great here, but \ntry to explain that to a business man or woman in your community or in \nyour State, and I guarantee you are going to get puzzled looks.\n  Here is another thing I will tell my colleagues, because I understand \nthere is an exemption for businesses with $1 million in revenue, but \ndepending on what you sell, it may or may not be that much. I would say \nthat over time, that figure is going to be less and less in terms of \nwho doesn't have to comply.\n  I dealt with this issue when I was in the State legislature in \nFlorida, especially the last 2 years when I was the Speaker. I will be \nfrank. This is about the fact that according to some, there is $23 \nbillion of what they claim is uncollected sales tax receipts across the \ncountry. You don't think that gets their attention? You don't think \nthat is what this is about? That is what this is about. I am not saying \nthat on the retail side they are not interested in the way the business \nis conducted and what it means in comparison to their competitors, but \nI promise my colleagues from the governmental side this is about the \nmoney they think they can get their hands on and what it would mean for \ntheir government and their ability to function.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will inquire again as to the time \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 1 minute.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Does the other side have any time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators from Wyoming and Illinois have 5 \nminutes each.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. We have heard a lot of complaints from primarily the non-\nsales-tax States about the amendment we have proposed, but we haven't \nheard about the amendments they have proposed. I thought they would use \npart of their time to make the case for what they were proposing. I am \nstill expecting them to do that, and when they do that, then we ought \nto have some time for rebuttal. That is why we have saved some of our \ntime. So I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In the interest of moving this forward, we have scheduled \na vote on the Ayotte amendment next, after the vote on the Enzi \namendment. I urge everyone who votes for the Enzi-Durbin-Alexander \namendment to oppose the Ayotte amendment because she includes a \nprovision in that amendment which absolutely destroys the whole effort \nhere. She requires physical nexus.\n  As Senator Heitkamp has said, that is what this debate is all about--\nwhether one has to be physically present in order to have an obligation \nto pay sales tax.\n  So I urge all of my colleagues who support the Marketplace Fairness \nAct to oppose the Ayotte amendment. I hope she will explain why she \nwants--I think we understand from the arguments why she takes that \nposition.\n  May I say one or two things about what has been said? To my friend \nfrom Oregon, Senator Wyden, who talked about the impossibility of \ncollecting sales tax from foreign entities, that is just not true. The \nsame collection mechanisms presently available to States to obtain and \nenforce judgments against foreign entities would be available to States \nwith respect to foreign entities failing to comply with the MFA. States \ncurrently have, and would continue to have, access to customs \ninformation on imported goods. Accordingly, States can and do use that \ninformation as a means of encouraging remote sellers to collect sales \ntax. States currently have, and would continue to have, the ability to \nimpose liens on any property owned by remote sellers, even property in \ntransit. So to argue we can't collect taxes from international entities \nis to ignore existing law.\n\n  Let me say a word about the small businesses in Montana. After the $1 \nmillion exemption, I would ask my Senator friend from Montana if he \nknows how many Internet retail sellers would be affected by the \nMarketplace Fairness Act in Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Too many.\n  Mr. DURBIN. There are 3. There are 3 out of 975 Internet retailers \nwith over $1 million in sales. There are 3 in the State of Montana. \nThis is an undue burden on the small businesses of Montana?\n  What I would say to the Senator from Florida and the Senators from \nMontana, what we are saying is very basic. You aren't forced to sell in \nIllinois. There is no reason you have to sell in Illinois. You choose \nto do it. If you choose to do it, all we say is follow our law. Our law \nsays if you make a sale in our State, there is a sales tax to be paid. \nIf you don't want to get involved in that, you don't have to sell in\n\n[[Page S2277]]\n\nour State. Keep your marketplace limited to places where you want to do \nbusiness. That is your right as a businessman. But if you want to sell \nin our States, you have a legal obligation to pay in our States.\n  If you want to open a business on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, you \nknow you would have to pay plenty of taxes. Why is it if you want to \nsell to the same people living on Michigan Avenue, you have no \nobligation to pay a sales tax? That is what this is about.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I would say this: I can't imagine that \nbusinesses in New Hampshire or businesses in Wyoming or other \nbusinesses now--if this is passed, not only are they going to have to \ncollect--all businesses--all 9,600 tax jurisdictions. But, heaven \nforbid, they are audited because now they are going to have to get on a \nplane, find a lawyer in another State, and deal with some other State's \njurisdiction. That is the nightmare of this. I can't imagine that \npeople would want to support it.\n  I also want to mention the privacy implications of this. I know the \nSenator from North Dakota mentioned a case she had. I actually had a \ncase when I was attorney general where New Hampshire refused to collect \ntax for Massachusetts. They tried to bring us into court and I won that \ncase.\n  Do my colleagues know what one of the big issues was that won it? \nPrivacy--asking our retailers to ask people who bought things from \nthem, where are you from, what are you going to use it for, and that is \nexactly the problem. There are serious privacy implications with all of \nthe information that we are going to be gathering with this so-called \nmaking our businesses across the country tax collectors.\n  Generally, States do collect taxes, but we don't generally ask \nprivate businesses to do the job of the State and become tax \ncollectors.\n  My amendment is simple. It respects States rights. If anyone wants to \nrespect States rights and make sure there is a level playing field for \nall States to make their decisions in protecting data as well as to \nprotect the rights of their States against foreign entities, that is \nwhat the amendment does.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee and then my \nfinal minute to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President. We talked about how \ndifficult this is. This is a good example of why we need to get this \nout of Washington and back in the States. For the last 15 years the \nStates have been figuring out how to do this. They have it pretty well \nworked out, and in just a 20-minute debate we make it sound \ncomplicated.\n  Here is how hard it is. If I buy some ice cream ingredients from \nWilliams Sonoma, and they are in another State, I use my credit card, I \nput in my ZIP Code, and the software automatically tells Williams \nSonoma what the sales tax is that is owed. They collect it and they \nwire it to the State government. That is all that happens.\n  This debate sounds like it happened in 1890 before the horse and \nbuggy, before the Internet. I mean, we live in a different world.\n  Here is what is fair. What is fair is allowing a State--not \nWashington--listen to the chairman of the American Conservative Union \nAl Cardenas. He says:\n\n       When it comes to state sales taxes, it is time to address \n     the area where federally mandated prejudice is most \n     egregious--the policy towards Internet sales, the decades-old \n     inequity between online sales and in-person sales as outdated \n     and unfair.\n\n  If I am trying to run the International Boot Company, I have to pay a \n10-percent penalty to somebody who is out of State. If somebody is out \nof State and by catalog or by Internet they want to sell to the 6 \nmillion people in Tennessee, they don't have to do that. They can sell \nin Kentucky, they can sell in Ohio, they can sell everywhere else. But \nif they want to sell in our State, they should live by the same rules \nTennesseans do.\n  We don't believe in picking and choosing winners and losers. We don't \nbelieve in treating one taxpayer this way and another one that way. We \ndon't want to pick one business this way and another that way, and we \ndon't like the idea of Washington making us play Mother May I to come \nup here and ask permission to decide whether we are going to collect a \nsales tax from everybody who already owes it rather than just some \npeople who owe it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for making that point. \nAs to this notion that there is something fundamentally unfair that we \nwould ask an Internet retailer that wants to sell in Illinois that they \ncollect the same sales tax for that sale as the businesses in Illinois, \nfor goodness' sake, you are asking for a safe haven, an advantage over \na lot of good small businesses in my home State. As Senator Alexander \nsaid, if you don't want to abide by the laws of Illinois, for goodness' \nsake, make your sales elsewhere.\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act levels the playing field for all \nretailers, Internet and direct. It provides software free of charge to \nhelp retailers calculate sales and use taxes.\n  I heard my friend, the Senator from Montana, talk about how complex \nthis was, how difficult this was.\n  I just made a recent purchase on Amazon which endorses the \nMarketplace Fairness Act, and I paid sales tax. They didn't ask for any \nadditional time to calculate it. It assumes I put in my ZIP Code, and \nthey knew exactly what to collect from me. That is how easy and simple \nit is these days.\n  This bill will also provide liability protection to ensure that if \nthe software calculates the wrong tax, Internet retailers are held \nharmless.\n  Finally, the bill protects small businesses, as we mentioned earlier, \nby exempting small sellers with less than $1 million in annual remote \nsales nationwide.\n  I know as well that there are other elements of this that ought to be \nconsidered, but we ought to consider this: There was a time when we \nstayed away from this issue. I remember the Senator from Oregon, Mr. \nWyden, was in on this conversation about the Internet being brandnew, \nthe baby in the crib, let him get started, let's make sure they are \nsolid and moving forward. We can't ask them to do certain things.\n  That day is over: $150 billion in sales. It is in our lives, \neverybody's lives. We use the Internet every day. What is wrong with \nasking them to pay sales tax for the sales into the States where they \nare doing business? Otherwise, look at the disadvantage we create for \nbusinesses.\n  The State of Oregon, represented in this debate, the State of \nMontana, the State of New Hampshire, and one other have decided they \ndon't want a State sales tax. There is nothing in this bill which will \nrequire the residents of that State to pay one penny in sales tax on \nanything they purchase, period. There is no requirement to change that.\n  I know, as Dale Bumpers used to say, they hate sales tax in your \nStates like the devil hates holy water, but we are not imposing a sales \ntax on you, only if your New Hampshire business wants to sell in \nanother State. Then, of course, I think they ought to play by the rules \nof that State. That is basically what we are asking.\n  So at this point I ask how much time is remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Is there any time remaining on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute remains.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I wish to say this: The Senator has it all \nwrong because when the business from New Hampshire--when the person \nfrom Illinois buys from the business in New Hampshire, it should be up \nto Illinois to enforce against their own residents because they are \nessentially buying from New Hampshire.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Montana.\n\n[[Page S2278]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nOregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Baucus.\n  Senator Durbin is right. Things have changed. The Internet now is the \nshipping lane of the 21st century, and foreign retailers are going to \nget an advantage.\n  Colleagues, if this were enforceable as Senator Durbin and Senator \nEnzi are saying, Europe would go out and put it in place tomorrow and \ndo it to our sellers.\n  It is not enforceable. It violates the World Trade Organization. It \nadvantages foreign retailers at our expense. I hope my colleagues will \nreject the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from Oregon is right. And I \nsee the Senator from North Dakota shaking her head. With all due \nrespect, I think she is not correct. This is either enforceable on \nforeign countries or it is not. It is impossible to force our laws on \nother countries unless other countries consent. Just to say so in a \nstatute here does not make it true, in a bill does not make it true. \nThere has to be a treaty, a tax treaty. There has to be some way for \nthe foreign jurisdiction to agree; otherwise, we cannot possibly \nenforce this in other jurisdictions or on the other side, if we do, \nthen those other countries can come back and do the same thing to the \nUnited States.\n  Do we want Chinese direct sellers to come back to the United States \nor, vice versa, for the Chinese to collect in the United States? The \nSenator from New Hampshire had it exactly right: It should be the \npurchaser who pays the tax, and that is where it should be enforced, \nnot the tax collector, the small businessman in another State.\n  I might sum up by saying, we will take this up in the Finance \nCommittee and work out all these different kinks and wrinkles on it, \nbut that is where it should be done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, do I have the last minute remaining?\n  Let me just say, my friend, Senator Heitkamp from North Dakota, knows \nthis subject so well. The case you want to read is Buckley v. State of \nCalifornia as to whether State laws are enforceable against foreign \ncompanies. And they are. That decision has already been reached. This \nargument does not hold water.\n  What does hold water is this: There is no reason why any State \nretailer should have an unfair advantage doing business in my State or \nany other State. If they want to compete with my businesses that pay \ntheir taxes, as they are supposed to do, let them do business under the \nlaws of the State of Illinois. If they do not want to play by these \nrules, then they do not have to come to Illinois. This is a question of \nfairness.\n  The last point I will make is this: This is voluntary--voluntary--\nunder the Marketplace Fairness Act. States have to voluntarily decide \nthat they want to be under this act. If they do not care to be, they do \nnot have to be. So there is no heavy hand of the Federal Government \nhere. The States can make this decision. It is up to them. I hope that \nall of those who support the Marketplace Fairness Act will support the \nEnzi-Durbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, my understanding is that all the debate \ntime on this has expired, all the time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. And that the Enzi amendment is pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, the next amendment that is in order is my \namendment. I would like to yield to Senator Collins to speak on the \namendment following mine, Amendment No. 144.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, my amendment is No. 144. I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be called up at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 144.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to restore a \n sensible definition of full-time employee for purposes of the Patient \n                  Protection and Affordable Care Act)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO THE \n                   DEFINITION OF FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     motions, or conference reports related to employer penalties \n     in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which may \n     include restoring a sensible definition of ``full-time \n     employee'', provided that such legislation does not increase \n     the deficit or revenues over either the period of the total \n     of fiscal years 2013 through 2018 or the period of the total \n     of fiscal years 2013 through 2023.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, my amendment would allow for legislation\n\n[[Page S2279]]\n\nsetting a more sensible definition of ``full-time employee'' under the \nAffordable Care Act. Under the Affordable Care Act, also known as \nObamaCare, the definition of a full-time employee averages just 30 \nhours a week. That definition is not found in other areas of the law. \nIt is creating this perverse incentive where employers are actually \nreducing the number of hours their employees work in order to keep \nunder that 30-hour threshold and thus avoid penalties.\n  All this amendment does, however, is call for a more sensible \ndefinition of what a full-time employee should entail. I ask unanimous \nconsent that we voice vote the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I was going to offer amendment No. 653, \nbut I am not going to call up that amendment.\n  I would agree with Senator Collins on her amendment and ask for a \nvoice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 144) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we \nhave now gone through all of the amendments from the unanimous consent \nagreement. We are within a couple of minutes of having a unanimous \nconsent request for the next group of amendments. I would ask that all \nSenators stay in the Chamber because it will just be a matter of \nseveral minutes and we will ask unanimous consent for the next group of \namendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the next \namendments in order to be called up be the following: Begich No. 341, \nAlexander No. 51, Merkley No. 398, Rubio No. 292, Hagan No. 278, and \nIsakson No. 138; that there be no second-degree amendments prior to the \nvotes in relation to any of these amendments; that notwithstanding all \ntime having expired on the resolution, there will be 2 minutes equally \ndivided prior to each vote; that upon disposition of the Isakson \namendment No. 138, the majority have the next amendment in order; \nfinally, all these votes be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object, I think this is a good \nlist. I look forward to moving on. I will try to work with Senator \nMurray and others. Perhaps we may avoid the gaps we have been \nexperiencing. We have a lot of Senators here, a lot of things to do. \nThere is an anxiousness we shouldn't be having so much downtime, and we \nwill be working toward that.\n  I thank the Chair and would not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would agree with the Senator. We are trying to work \nthrough. Members have a lot of priority amendments. We are trying to \nmake sure our lists match. Our staffs are working very hard to go back \nand forth so everybody has equal time on the amendments which are a \npriority to each side. I apologize for taking time to do it. We are \ntrying to come to an agreement, and sometimes it takes a few minutes.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 341\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 341.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Begich], for himself, Ms. \n     Cantwell, and Ms. Murkowski, proposes an amendment numbered \n     341.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to the \n                labeling of genetically engineered fish)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3__. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO THE \n                   LABELING OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FISH.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for 1 or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to the labeling of genetically engineered fish, \n     without raising new revenue, by the amounts provided in the \n     legislation for those purposes, provided that the legislation \n     would not increase the deficit over either the period of the \n     total of fiscal years 2013 through 2018 or the period of the \n     total of fiscal years 2013 through 2023.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote on amendment No. \n341 offered by the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Begich.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, this amendment deals with labeling \ngenetically engineered fish, the first hybrid animal being proposed for \nhuman consumption. The FDA is reviewing this precedent-setting action \nnot as a food but as a drug. They haven't studied the long-time health \nimpacts and I can see why because all of these chemicals are added to \nthis fake fish.\n  At a minimum, this fish should be labeled. Consumer Reports indicates \n95 percent of the population want products labeled. Last year 1 million \npeople wrote to the FDA asking for this product to be labeled. Labeling \nis done in 60 other countries. Three weeks ago, major retailers, Whole \nFoods, Trader Joe's, have assured they are not going to sell this fake \nfish.\n  We urge support for this amendment and ask it be passed.\n  I yield time to Senator Murkowski.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I join my colleague in urging Members to support this \namendment. All it does is require labeling of this fish, this fake \nfish. If you are going to be serving your family a good-quality \nproduct, you want to know it is good and it is quality. Allow us to \nlabel this fish.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I believe we can pass this amendment on a \nvoice vote, unless there is an objection. Seeing none, I suggest we do \nthis by voice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 341) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I believe Senator Alexander's amendment is up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Senator Alexander is off the floor. \nSenator Merkley is here. I would ask unanimous consent to reverse the \norder of these two amendments and go to Senator Merkley and then back \nto Senator Alexander.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 398\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 398.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Merkley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 398.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase investment in high-impact breakthrough clean \n   energy technologies through the Advanced Research Projects Agency-\n                  Energy of the Department of Energy)\n\n       On page 18, line 23, increase the amount by $50,000,000.\n\n[[Page S2280]]\n\n       On page 18, line 24, increase the amount by $3,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 3, increase the amount by $5,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 7, increase the amount by $10,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 11, increase the amount by $18,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 15, increase the amount by $13,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 19, increase the amount by $2,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 23, increase the amount by $1,000,000.\n       On page 46, line 11, decrease the amount by $50,000,000.\n       On page 46, line 12, decrease the amount by $3,000,000.\n       On page 46, line 16, decrease the amount by $5,000,000.\n       On page 46, line 20, decrease the amount by $10,000,000.\n       On page 46, line 24, decrease the amount by $18,000,000.\n       On page 47, line 3, decrease the amount by $13,000,000.\n       On page 47, line 7, decrease the amount by $2,000,000.\n       On page 47, line 11, decrease the amount by $1,000,000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote on amendment No. \n398.\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, this amendment increases the Advanced \nResearch Projects Agency-Energy of the Department of Energy by $50 \nmillion. This is essentially what we know as ARPA-E. This is the most \nbasic research to create breakthroughs in areas which range from \nrenewable energy to energy conservation, so on and so forth. Energy is \nthe lifeblood of our economy. It is the lifeblood of putting ourselves \nin a position to be one of the nations which sells technology to the \nworld, rather than buying it from the world. This is a huge leverage \nissue, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I request Senators be recognized to speak at this \nmoment.\n  Mr. President, I believe, as I indicated last night, Mr. Lomborg of \nEurope, who has done a lot of research on these issues--energy research \nis preferable to mandating requirements which would utilize inefficient \nsources and oversubsidizing. Breakthroughs might happen. This is a \npaid-for amendment. I would suggest we take it by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 398) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Senator Alexander is on the floor, and I \nwill yield to him to offer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 515\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I call up amendment No. 515.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Alexander], for himself and \n     Mr. Paul, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Rubio, and Mr. McConnell, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 515.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund related to the \n education of low-income children, which may include allowing funding \n  under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to follow \n  children from low-income families to the school the children attend)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3__. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR SCHOOL CHOICE.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     related to the education of low-income children, which may \n     include allowing funding under the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 to follow children from low-income \n     families to the school the children attend, by the amounts \n     provided in such legislation for those purposes, provided \n     that such legislation would not increase the deficit over \n     either the period of the total of fiscal years 2013 through \n     2018 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2013 through \n     2023.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote on amendment No. \n515 offered by the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nSenator Paul and myself, with Senators Toomey and McConnell \ncosponsoring. It is designed to help 11 million low-income children in \nthis country. We appropriate $14.5 billion every year through our title \nI Federal funding. It is supposed to go to them but it doesn't get \nthere. That is agreed upon by both the left and the right.\n\n  For example, Marguerite Roza, writing for the Center for American \nProgress, says the difference between school expenditures is often \nsubstantial, and she pointed out the money goes to schools where \nteachers are paid more but the children aren't necessarily the poorer \nchildren. So the poorer children--the ones we intend to help--are left \nin schools with less money. And sometimes the money can add up to quite \na bit.\n  The same analysis has been found by the Fordham Foundation--I would \nsay that is a center-right organization--because of the Federal formula \nwe use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. So we are suggesting to let the money follow the child \nto the school, whether it is public or private and accredited.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield our time to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the way this amendment is drafted means \nthe money that goes to title I could then be taken and go to private \nschools. That is the first thing.\n  Secondly, we have tried this before. The District of Columbia has a \nvoucher program that we passed in Congress in 2003. And guess what they \nhave found since 2O03? It made no impact whatsoever on student \nachievement, and now the program is to the point it is being phased \nout.\n  Again, at this point in time when we are worried about uncertainty in \nour schools, teacher salaries, and we have the sequester taking money \nfrom schools, this isn't the time to take even more money out of our \npublic school system.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 292.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Rubio] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 292.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate to enact the Child \n                 Interstate Abortion Notification Act)\n\n       At the end of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 5__. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CHILD INTERSTATE \n                   ABORTIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) laws requiring parental notification or consent prior \n     to an abortion, or in the alternative judicial waiver, are in \n     effect in more than half of the States, but these laws are \n     often circumvented by interstate activity in which minors \n     travel or are transported across State lines to avoid laws \n     requiring parental involvement;\n       (2) abortion providers use targeted advertising to minors \n     across State lines, using avoidance of parental notification \n     requirements as a selling point;\n       (3) when an abortion provider performs an abortion on a \n     minor without parental notification, the provider is likely \n     to lack the complete medical history of the minor, and \n     parents of the minor are unaware of the need to watch for \n     complications that may develop after the abortion when the \n     minor is sent back to her State of residence, far from the \n     provider; and\n       (4) parental notification and parental consent laws are \n     supported by overwhelming majorities of the public in the \n     United States.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) a physician who performs or induces an abortion on a \n     minor who is a resident of a State other than the State in \n     which the abortion is performed should be required by Federal \n     law to provide, or cause an agent of the physician to \n     provide, at least 24 hours advance notice to a parent of the \n     minor before the abortion is performed;\n       (2) such a Federal requirement for interstate parental \n     notification should not apply if--\n       (A) the minor declares in a signed written statement that \n     she is the victim of sexual abuse, neglect, or physical abuse \n     by a parent, and, before an abortion is performed on the \n     minor, the physician notifies the authorities specified to \n     receive reports of child abuse or neglect by the law of the \n     State in which the minor resides of the known or suspected \n     abuse or neglect;\n       (B) the abortion is necessary to save the life of a minor \n     whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical \n     injury, or physical illness, including a life endangering \n     physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy \n     itself, provided that the attending physician or an agent of \n     the physician notifies a parent of the minor in writing that \n     an abortion was performed on the minor and of the \n     circumstances of the abortion within 24 hours;\n       (C) the abortion is performed or induced in a State that \n     has in force a law requiring parental involvement in the \n     abortion decision of a minor and the physician complies with \n     the requirements of that law;\n       (D) the physician is presented with documentation that \n     shows with a reasonable degree of certainty that a court in \n     the State of residence of the minor has authorized that the \n     minor be allowed to procure an abortion; or\n       (E) the minor is physically accompanied by a person who \n     presents the physician or an agent of the physician with \n     documentation showing with a reasonable degree of certainty \n     that he or she is in fact a parent of that minor;\n       (3) a parent who suffers harm by a violation of the \n     interstate notification requirement should be entitled to \n     obtain appropriate relief in a civil action, unless that \n     parent has committed an act of incest with the minor;\n       (4) whoever has committed an act of incest with a minor and \n     knowingly transports the minor across a State line with the \n     intent that the minor obtain an abortion should be subject to \n     imprisonment of up to 1 year for such transportation, in \n     addition to any other penalties; and\n       (5) Congress should enact S. 369, the Child Interstate \n     Abortion Notification Act (CIANA), to accomplish these \n     purposes.\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, abortion is a divisive issue in this \ncountry, and I deeply respect everyone's opinions with regard to this \nissue. But there is one thing that is not dividing us. There is one \nthing we are united upon as a people, and that is the idea that parents \nshould know what their children are being involved in, especially when \nit comes to a medical procedure of this magnitude. That is why so many \nStates have passed parental notification laws that require parents to \nbe notified before their child--a minor--undergoes an abortion.\n  Unfortunately, in this country there are people who are transporting \nthese children across State lines in order to avoid these notification \nlaws. This sense of the Senate is based on a bill I have filed, and \nothers have supported in the past, that makes that illegal, that does \nnot allow that to happen.\n  You will hear arguments against this in terms of maybe the child is \nliving in a very unstable environment or a dangerous environment. Maybe \none of the parents--God forbid--is involved in the pregnancy that led \nto this, and that is why there are judicial overrides at the State \nlevel, so they can go to courts to override it. That is why this sense \nof the Senate is built on a bill that has exceptions for things like \nrape or incest or medical emergencies or a hostile home. So this is an \nimportant point, and I hope it can garner the support of as many \nMembers as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield my time to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Rubio amendment hurts families. It is \nopposed by respected doctors organizations and many women's groups.\n  Colleagues, under the Rubio amendment, a doctor and a grandmother \nwould go to jail if the grandmother brought her grandchild across State \nlines, say, after she was raped. Senator Rubio insists that only a \nparent be there. But what if the mom is ill or the dad is in \nAfghanistan or she is scared to death to tell her mom or her dad? \nColleagues, there are cases of daughters dying due to their desperation \nand fear of telling their parents. Let's not endanger our children and \nplace government against our grandmothers. Please vote no.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment is \nnot germane to the underlying resolution. It, therefore, violates \nsection 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. I move to waive the rule with regard to the applicable \nportion of the act and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). Is there a sufficient second? \nThere appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nLautenberg) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 48, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 64 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--48\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Burr\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Donnelly\n     Enzi\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Lee\n     Manchin\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Baldwin\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Collins\n     Coons\n     Cowan\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Hirono\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n\n[[Page S2282]]\n\n\n     Nelson\n     Reed\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Lautenberg\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote in relation to \namendment No. 278, offered by the Senator from North Carolina, Mrs. \nHagan.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, this amendment establishes a deficit-\nneutral reserve fund for families of servicemembers and veterans. My \nhome State has the third largest military footprint in the Nation. One \nout of every three people is in the military, a veteran or related to a \nservicemember or veteran. We are proud that we make military families \nwelcome in North Carolina because supporting military families is one \nof the best ways we can support our troops.\n  This amendment is deficit neutral. It will not add one penny to our \ndeficit. It helps to create room in the budget for legislation to help \nmilitary families in areas ranging from health care to housing and from \neducation to job placement while their loved ones are serving our \ncountry away from home.\n  A vote for this amendment is a vote for our military families, for \nthe sons, daughters, husbands, wives, and families who sacrifice for \nthis Nation alongside our troops.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nNorth Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 278.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, unless there are any Senators who wish \nto speak in opposition to this amendment, I know we are all in very \nstrong support of veterans. This amendment would make it easier to pass \nlegislation, but that legislation would be required to be deficit \nneutral. I think we have to know that nothing comes from nothing. If we \nstart new programs, they have to be paid for. But we certainly support \nthe goal of this amendment. I suggest we could take it by voice vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if there is no objection, I suggest we \nvoice vote this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 278) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, this is an Isakson-Shaheen budget \namendment that creates a deficit-neutral fund for the purpose of \nconverting our appropriations and budget process to a 2-year process \nwhere we budget and appropriate in odd-numbered years.\n  We would budget and appropriate in odd-numbered years and do \noversight for efficiencies, finding abuses and finding those programs \nthat are not working in even-numbered years. This is a process asked \nfor by every President, from Ronald Reagan to our current President, \nand endorsed by Democrats and Republicans in this body. The person who \nknows the most about it is Ms. Jeanne Shaheen, former Governor of New \nHampshire and a Senator, who is my partner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator Isakson. I \nwas a Governor for three budgets, and we were able to balance them \nevery other year every cycle because biennial budgeting gives us an \nopportunity to prioritize scarce resources and provide more oversight \nto the budgeting process.\n  This is idea whose time has come. We need this reform and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

There are some very \nserious matters that have not yet been put on this list that will need \nto be voted on.\n  With that, I withdraw my objection.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object. The Senator \nfrom Alabama talked about Senators who have been waiting for a long \ntime. It happens that I was among the very first to put all of mine \nin--I was ready to go--and cut it down to two votes. I am still \nwaiting. I will not wait beyond the next time; I am serving notice.\n  At this time, I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we finalize these amendments, and we will \nhave disposed of 41 amendments. Senators are going to have to \nunderstand that this is not going to go on forever. The average is \nabout 30 or 35 votes. After we finish, it will be 41. Everyone should \nunderstand that we had 400 amendments that had been offered, and we are \nnot going to do that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Voice votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I will again remind Senators that if anyone has an amendment, please \nlet us know very quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We look forward to working hard as we go forward and \ntake up new amendments. It is unfortunate that we are coming to the end \nof the week as we have. We still would have a week when we come back--\nthe week of April 8--but I know the majority leader wants to finish. So \nwe are going to try to cooperate, and I know he will cooperate with us \nas we seek to get as many amendments done and as many people satisfied \nwith the issues they are concerned about as is possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the spirit of what our leader said \nabout us trying to move along, I think while we may have a variety of \nviews, we all know we are $16.5 trillion in debt--a debt that goes up \nby $3 billion every night. The last thing we should do is dig this hole \nany deeper.\n  This amendment is paired actually with an amendment that will be \noffered by the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune. The Thune \namendment would repeal the estate tax without the ability to offset \nwith additional revenue.\n  I believe the estate tax is actually a meaningful part of our Tax \nCode. We put in place appropriate exemptions: $5 million a person, $10 \nmillion a couple. That means the estate tax right now only applies to \nabout 3,800 people a year. Yet, if we were to repeal the estate tax \nwithout any offset, that would add $600 billion to our debt.\n  We have spent a lot of time over these last number of months talking \nabout the dramatic cuts in defense from sequester--$550 billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues, if we want to repeal \nthe estate tax and pay for it, to vote for the Warner amendment No. \n693.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I appreciate the effort being made by the \nSenator from Virginia. He is moving in the right direction. We do need \nto get rid of this once and for all. I would be happy to accept his \namendment by voice if he would be willing to do that. But I think it is \nimportant to have a vote on eliminating the death tax.\n  The death tax is a punitive tax. It hits farmers and ranchers \nsquarely in the face at a time when they are trying to pass on their \nfarm or ranch operation to the next generation of Americans.\n  By the way, the amendment I will offer is a deficit-neutral reserve \nfund; it would be offset. The point the Senator from Virginia made \nabout it not being offset is not accurate.\n  The way we would approach this, it would have to be offset, but it is \ntime that we put a stake in the heart of the death tax and end it once \nand for all.\n\n[[Page S2286]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there now will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 307, offered by the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this amendment will create a deficit-\nneutral reserve fund to completely--completely--eliminate the Federal \nestate tax burden that is facing America's family farmers and small \nbusinesses. There are lots of reasons to support elimination of this \ndestructive and inefficient tax, but for me the issue comes down to \nbeing able to tell the farmers and ranchers I represent that I am doing \neverything I can to make sure they can pass on their family farm to the \nnext generation without a double tax imposed from Washington, DC.\n  Behind me is a chart. This is data selected from the latest \nAgriculture Department report on farmland values. Farmers in the States \nrepresented on this chart truly are land rich and cash poor. These \nfarmers literally have to sell off land or spend large sums in \nfinancial planning solely because of the estate tax--all of that to \nbring in less than one-half of 1 percent of all Federal revenue.\n  Next year the estate tax will generate $15 billion--that is all--\nrelative to all the harm that it causes to farms, ranches, and small \nbusinesses in this country. It is time to end this tax. It is time to \nput a stake through the heart of this tax. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport the repeal with this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there are strong feelings of opinion in \nthis body about the estate tax. I personally believe the current estate \ntax--with a very generous $5 million-per-person exemption, and $10 \nmillion per family; an estate tax that only applies to 3,800 families \nper year--is a fair part of our Tax Code. Others may disagree.\n  But in our previous amendment, Warner amendment No. 693, we said if \nyou are going to replace the estate tax, you have to pay for it. The \nunfortunate thing about the Senator's amendment is it says if you \nrepeal the estate tax, you cannot use revenues to replace that. It will \nonly have to be replaced with additional cuts.\n  The problem we have at this point--$16.5 trillion in debt--is because \nwe have not recognized to get a budget balanced you have to look at \nboth sides of the balance sheet, revenue and spending. You cannot just \nkeep taking revenue away on every item. So I would urge my colleagues \nto oppose the Thune amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, this amendment would create a deficit-\nneutral reserve fund to protect disabled veterans and their survivors, \nwhich may not include a chained CPI--no chained CPI.\n  This amendment is cosponsored by Senators Harkin, Hirono, and \nWhitehouse. This amendment is strongly supported by the American Legion \nand all of the veterans organizations. It is supported by the AARP and \nall of the senior organizations because they do not want to see cuts in \nSocial Security. It is supported by the AFL-CIO and the National \nOrganization for Women, among many other groups.\n  After all of the fine Memorial Day speeches about how much we love \nand support our veterans, the Disabled Veterans of America, the Gold \nStar Wives----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the Sanders amendment. \nI urge my colleagues to support it. I support chained CPI, just as the \nPresident, as it relates to entitlement reform. The fact is, if we want \nto protect veterans, then the important amendment is the next one. It \nis the amendment that bans excessive taxes from being applied to our \ncountry's veterans.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 697.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment that will \nactually protect veterans, one that will protect them from the massive \ntax increases in this budget. The budget before us today raises $1 \ntrillion but does not tell us how. My amendment would ensure that the \nDemocrats in the Chamber cannot raise a dime of that trillion dollars \non the backs of our Nation's veterans. It would strike their ability to \nfast-track any tax increases through this body.\n  I encourage all Members to vote for the amendment that will actually \nprotect veterans from the threat before them. That threat is higher \ntaxes that will come from this budget.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment. \nRepealing this budget's revenue increase and striking reconciliation \nwould be irresponsible. Our budget would not raise taxes on veterans.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. What this amendment basically says is it does away with \nthe revenue that the committee has put into the bill. It says the only \nway to do deficit reduction is to cut, cut, cut--cut Social Security, \nveterans programs, Medicare, Medicaid. One out of four corporations \ndoes not pay a nickel in taxes today. No problem. We are losing $100 \nbillion with companies putting their money in the Cayman Island's tax \nhavens. No problem. The only way to go forward is to cut, cut, cut. The \nAmerican people do not support that concept. This amendment should be \ndefeated.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment is \nnot germane to the underlying resolution and therefore violates section \n305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The point of order is \nsustained and amendment No. 697 falls.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to reconsider the vote and lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to reconsider was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 482\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to amendment No. 482, offered \nby the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. This bipartisan amendment, cosponsored by Senator Collins, \nSenator Merkley, and others, would add resources to energy programs for \nthe purpose of increasing support for the Weatherization Assistance \nProgram. It would also include weatherization in the investments under \nthe deficit-neutral reserve fund on clean energy and environmental \nprotection.\n  Weatherization does several things: It puts people to work, helps \nlow-income people control their energy bills, and helps us move toward \nenergy independence. We need to do more of this, not less. This \namendment will put us back on the track of doing more, not less.\n  I would urge passage of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator and his cosponsors for their work \non this amendment. I note it would double the budget number for the \nweatherization program. Also, the Recovery Act of a few years ago, the \nstimulus bill, provided $5 billion for the weatherization program. \nWhile I am dubious about the wisdom of the doubling of this program, it \nis offset. Therefore, I would accept a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Without objection, we will move to a voice vote on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 482) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider and lay that motion \non the table.\n\n[[Page S2288]]\n\n  The motion to reconsider was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 263\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on amendment No. 263 offered by the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, Mr. Paul.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the President is fond of calling for a \nbalanced approach. Today, I rise in this body to offer a balanced \napproach to budgets. I offer a budget that balances in 5 years.\n  This budget is called the Revitalize America Budget. It reforms and \nsaves Social Security and Medicare, making them solvent for 75 years; \nit creates millions of jobs by letting taxpayers keep an additional \n$600 billion of their income; it repeals ObamaCare; and it requires \nCongress to vote to approve or disapprove all major regulations.\n  Our ever-expanding debt is costing us millions of jobs a year. It is \ntime to stop burying our kids in debt. I suggest a vote for this 5-year \nbalanced budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the budget resolution before the Senate \nrepresents the values and priorities of the pro-middle-class agenda. \nThe Paul budget that is being offered includes tax savings for the \nwealthy and eliminates the programs that strengthen our economy and \nsupport our middle class.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

There are now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote on amendment No. 314 offered by the Senator from Louisiana, \nMs. Landrieu.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am proud to offer this amendment on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Chambliss, Senator Vitter, Senator \nBlumenthal, Senator Isakson, Senator Murphy, and Senator Udall of New \nMexico that will fix a problem in the way CBO is scoring the leasing of \nveterans clinics.\n  This amendment, if adopted, will have no impact on the deficit. It \nwill allow veterans clinics in 30 States to be able to finance their \nbuildings. It is something that must be done in order to solve this \nproblem for our veterans, and I think we can take this by voice vote.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe Senator Coburn wished to speak \non this amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I understand what the Senator from \nLouisiana is trying to do, but it goes toward the bigger problems of \nGSA. I will give you a great example.\n  In my hometown they are building a brand new U.S. Attorney's Office \nwith four other sites that are available that could have been leased, \nand they are going to lease this one as well. So leasing doesn't solve \nthe problem. What we need to attack is the inefficiencies and \nineffectiveness of GSA.\n  I am sure we will take a voice vote on this, but I am not sure I \nagree with the solution of the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. This is only for veterans clinics, and I ask for a \nvoice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if there is no discussion, we will take \nthis by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 314) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 247\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 247, offered by \nthe Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 247 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this is an amendment which would \nfacilitate passage of legislation that would deny pay to the personnel \nat the Office of Management and Budget for such time as they delay in \nthe statutory requirement for the President to submit a budget for \nconsideration by the Senate.\n  As we all know, the law requires the President to submit a budget the \nfirst Monday in February, but the President has not done so 4 out of \nthe last 5 years, nor will he do so this year reportedly until April. \nThe problem with that is we will finish our work here this week, the \nHouse will finish their work, and the President has rendered himself \nentirely irrelevant.\n  We know because the House passed the No Budget No Pay bill that it \nprompted the first budget in the Senate in more than 1,400 days, and \nthat is good, that is progress. We would like to do the same now with \nthe Office of Management and Budget to encourage the President to be \nrelevant to the budget debate and require him to submit his budget on a \ntimely basis.\n  So I would ask my colleagues for their vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, there is no opposition. We suggest a \nvoice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 247) was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 606 Withdrawn\n\n                           Amendment No. 483\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Menendez \namendment listed in the previous order, amendment No. 606, be replaced \nwith Udall amendment No. 483.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment \nNo. 606 has been withdrawn.\n  The clerk will report amendment No. 483.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] for Mr. Udall of \n     New Mexico, proposes amendment numbered 483.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to \n                hardrock mineral royalty and fee reform)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n[[Page S2289]]\n\n     SEC. 3__.

There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote on amendment No. 483, offered by the Senator from New Mexico, \nMr. Udall.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, let me just say that I very \nmuch appreciate the help on this amendment from both Senator Wyden, who \nis here and is the chairman of the committee, and also Senator \nMurkowski, who has been working with me on this amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if there is no opposition, I would \nsuggest a voice vote.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understand there have been discussions \nabout this, and it is on the agreed list for a voice vote. I would have \nno objection unless others do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 483) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 689\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote on amendment No. 689, offered by the Senator from Louisiana, \nMr. Vitter.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 689.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, there have been at least three independent \nstudies now recently that underscore that too-big-to-fail is still \nalive and well, and that too-big-to-fail policies give Wall Street \nmegabanks a subsidy in comparison to their competitors--an unfair \nadvantage, creating an uneven playing field. And not coincidentally, \nthat is why these megabanks dominate the market--the biggest market \nshare ever in history.\n  This amendment is very simple. It says we should do away with the \nFederal policies that create that subsidy, the uneven playing field. It \ndoesn't say we forcibly break up the banks, it doesn't say we tax them, \nit just says that.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Brown of Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we ask support for the Vitter-Brown-Corker-\nPryor amendment. The community banks of America support it because they \nknow the playing field isn't level.\n  One real quick statistic. Eighteen years ago, the six biggest U.S. \nbanks had assets equal to 18 percent of GDP. Today it is 65 percent of \nGDP.\n  I ask for your support of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I don't believe there is any opposition \nto this amendment. I would ask the Senator if we could have a voice \nvote on this amendment as well.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, we believe this is an important matter, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At this moment there is not a sufficient second.\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nLautenberg) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin).

There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote in relation to amendment No. 537, offered by Mr. Tester.\n  Mr. TESTER. I rise on behalf of amendment No. 537.\n  First of all, I thank Senator Coons and Senator Heller for \ncosponsoring this amendment. It would allow the children under the \nCivilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, otherwise known as CHAMP-VA, to remain eligible for coverage \nuntil their 26th birthday. These children are the children of veterans \nwho have been rated permanently and totally disabled and children of \nveterans who have died from a service-connected disability or service-\nconnected disease.\n  With the enactment of the Affordable Health Care Act, children up to \n26 years of age can now be covered on their parents' health insurance \nif they are unable to receive health insurance from their employers. In \ncontrast to private insurance plans, or TRICARE, children under the \nCHAMP-VA program are only eligible for coverage until age 18 or 23 if \nthey are a full-time enrolled student. This amendment is offered on \ntheir behalf to allow them to be on the CHAMP-VA program up to age 26.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This is a budget-neutral reserve fund, and it \nessentially says, using that language, if the authorizing committee can \npay for this bill, it will not be subject to a budget point of order. \nIt should be offset to avoid that. This is certainly a worthy goal. We \nwould like to see if this can be done. It would be a challenge for the \nauthorizers because nothing comes from nothing. It could well end up \ncutting other veterans benefits. But I think this is a worthy goal. I \nthink the Senator would suggest we take it by a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Seeing no opposition, I suggest we take this by a voice \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 537) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 535\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote in relation to amendment No. 535, offered by the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Toomey.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 535.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n\n[[Page S2290]]\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. As we know, the ObamaCare bill raises taxes by $1.2 \ntrillion. Much of that is on middle-income families. One in particular \nis a tax increase on people who incur and then deduct catastrophic \nmedical expenses.\n  Imagine a woman slips and falls at home, is seriously injured, runs \nup huge medical costs which she pays for out her own pocket, and then \non top of her personal and physical misery ObamaCare hits her with a \ndouble whammy by reducing the amount of medical expenses she is allowed \nto deduct. Who does this hurt? Disproportionately, middle-income \ntaxpayers; 96 percent of these deductions are for people who earn less \nthan $200,000. It adds up to $30 billion over 10 years. Madam \nPresident, 60 percent of these deductions are by senior citizens. The \nfact is the ObamaCare tax increase imposes this tax on people who can \nleast afford it, the sick, elderly, middle-income folks.\n  My amendment repeals this ill-conceived tax on victims of \ncatastrophic illness and repeals the reconciliation instructions in the \nbudget.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second.\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, again, for our colleagues, the goal of \nour budget is to tackle our deficit and debt responsibly in a way that \nworks for our middle-class families and our economy. That means a \nbalanced mix of responsible spending cuts and new revenue from those \nwho can afford it most.\n  I remind all Senators every bipartisan group who has examined our \nbudget situation has acknowledged that reality. Simpson-Bowls, the Gang \nof 6, Domenici-Rivlin--all recommend several times more revenue than \nthe roughly $600 billion that was generated by the yearend deal. In \nfact, Simpson-Bowles and the Gang of 6 each recommend well over $2 \ntrillion in new revenue. So striking this reconciliation instruction, \nwhich is what this amendment does, and reducing the revenue level, goes \nin exactly the wrong direction.

I call up amendment No. 442.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. CASEY. This amendment creates a neutral reserve fund that \nsupports the Edward Byrne memorial justice assistance grants. It helps \nevery one of our States. It has been cut by one-third over the last 2 \nyears. We provide support for local and State law enforcement. The \nmoney is used to support innovative, evidence-based approaches to \npublic safety--by way of example, special courts that have new \ntechnological innovations to help reduce and fight crime in our \ncommunities.\n  In part, it is supported by--and this is only a partial list--the \nNational Sheriffs' Association, the International Association of Chiefs \nof Police, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the National Narcotics \nOfficers' Association.\n  I am grateful for the work that was done by so many people on this \namendment--especially Senator Grassley--and urge for its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I hope all of us begin to think a \nlittle bit here. We have a lot of votes that have gone forward. Each \none seems to be an attempt to spend more money. It sets deficit-neutral \nreserve funds that require offsets. In my view, we are really thinking \ntoo much with a mindset that we have money, and I believe we are in \ndenial about the financial condition of our country. Truly, we should \nbe looking to have more amendments that save some money and use that \nmoney to pay down the debt rather than fund some new spending program.\n  This country is on an unsustainable debt path. We have to get off of \nit, and it cannot be done all by tax increases. Trust me, we have to \nhave some spending reductions. Our spending rate of growth is more than \ntwo times the rate of economic growth, and that really--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I suggest a voice vote. I appreciate my colleague's \nwork on this amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I believe we can take this by a voice \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 442) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to a vote in \nrelation to amendment No. 273, offered by the Senator from Maryland, \nMr. Cardin.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I believe the pending amendment is \nCoats amendment No. 514.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair stands corrected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 514\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes equally divided in the usual form prior to a vote in relation \nto amendment No. 514, offered by Mr. Coats of Indiana.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 514. It is a \nbipartisan amendment with Senator Manchin. It clarifies that a \nPresidential exemption exists for utilities that despite their good-\nfaith efforts have been unable to complete the necessary measures to \ncomply with the standards of the EPA regarding the mercury toxic \nelements issue. That deadline is 2016.\n\n  This amendment does not repeal or weaken the existing standard, the \nMATS rule. It simply allows powerplants that qualify for a Presidential \nexemption additional time to finish their upgrades and provides much-\nneeded stability and reliability to the electric grid.\n  It is the President's decision, and if he sees that a utility is \nacting in good\n\n[[Page S2291]]\n\nfaith and needs a little more time to complete it to meet those \nstandards, he can make that decision to provide that additional time.\n  It is a bipartisan amendment supported by both sides, and I urge our \ncolleagues to vote for this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I strongly oppose this amendment. I \nagree with the Senator from California, and I yield her my time in \nopposition.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, the Coats amendment allows open-ended \nexemptions to the mercury air toxic rule. This is not a 1-year \nextension, it is a permanent extension if any President, now or in the \nfuture, simply decides it. It doesn't even require any finding.\n  Let me tell my colleagues a little bit about mercury. It is \ndangerous. It is poison. It harms the brain, the nervous system, and \nchildhood development. It is especially damaging to infants and \npregnant women. Mercury harms a child's ability to speak, to hear, to \nwalk, to see, and to think. Can't we protect our children?\n  I want to give my colleagues 11,000 reasons to oppose the Coats \namendment. That is how many premature deaths will be avoided with the \nrule he wants to eviscerate. Just last June we held on this rule. Let's \nvote no on the Coats amendment.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote in relation to amendment No. 273, offered by the Senator from \nMaryland, Mr. Cardin.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, this amendment would set up a deficit-\nneutral reserve fund.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Heinrich be added as a cosponsor \nof the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. It would improve the oral health care for our children \nwho are Medicaid-eligible. We still have major problems. The majority \nof our children who are Medicaid-eligible have untreated tooth decay, \nwhich affects their general health.\n  Let me respond to my good friend from Alabama, Senator Sessions, and \ntell him why this amendment will not add to the deficit but will save \nus money.\n  I will give the example of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old who died in \nmy State of Maryland from untreated tooth decay. He needed an $80 tooth \nextraction. Instead, we spent $\\1/4\\ million dollars in unnecessary \noperations and he lost his life.\n  This amendment gives us a chance to find ways to save money in order \nto expand oral health for our children, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator Cardin for his hard \nwork. He is correct that oral care for children is important. It does \nrequire that it be paid for if a new program is advanced.\n  I suggest a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, hearing no opposition, I suggest we \nhave a voice vote on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 273) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. \n373, offered by the Senator from Utah, Mr. Lee.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, under this budget, by the year 2020 we will \nbe spending more every year on interest on our national debt than we \nspend on our national defense. This is alarming and ought to be a \nconcern to every one of us. This amendment creates a point of order \nthat would address this problem and all similar problems in the future \nwith other budgets that have the same defect.\n  While we are on this note, I would like to add that I am concerned \nabout the amendment process. I heard from our majority leader a few \nminutes ago a statement suggesting that he might cut off debate, cut \noff the amendment process--this after he promised us at the beginning \nof the week that there would be unlimited amendments. And he repeated \nthat phrase twice.\n  It is imperative that we finish this job. Each of us was elected to \ndo a job. Each of us deserves to have our amendments called up. We have \nno business taking a 2-week vacation until we have gone through every \namendment that any Senator from either side of the aisle wants to \npresent.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I too am committed to meeting the needs \nof our military to defend the Nation and our interests abroad. That is \nexactly what this budget does.\n  We should not be linking defense funding with unrelated benchmarks. \nThis amendment is unnecessary. The Senate budget does fund defense \nabove net interest in fiscal year 2014 and over both the 5- and 10-year \nwindows.\n  I recommend that my colleagues oppose the amendment.\n  Madam President, may I just respond and say that we have been very \nhard at work here. We have had a number of amendments come before us. \nAll of our staffs are working together to have as many amendments as we \ncan put together for the next group of votes.\n  Really, I do want to thank all of our Senators. I know everybody has \nbeen working really hard to get their amendments up so we can have them \nin order. I think we are going to keep working on that, and I \nappreciate everybody's focus.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n\n[[Page S2292]]\n\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, a lot of progress has been made. We are \ndoing extremely well. I admire the progress made by the two managers of \nthis bill.\n  Over the last two decades, after the expiration of debate time on \nthose budget resolutions, the Senate has offered and the Senate \ndisposed of an average of 35 amendments. Today, since the expiration of \nthat debate time on this resolution, we have now disposed of 33 \namendments. We have considered and disposed of 44 amendments on the \nresolution in total, counting those we did yesterday.\n  We need to continue working. There are a lot of things that people \nwant to have offered. But, you know, there are 400 amendments that have \nalready been filed. Senator Byrd, whom we all revere, said, and I will \nquote:\n\n       I once described vote-aramas as pandemonium, which was the \n     Palace of Satan in Milton's Paradise Lost. But that term \n     fails to describe the ignominy of the Senate when it becomes \n     engulfed in these budget vote carnivals.\n\n  So we are doing fine. We are not at the carnival stage yet. Let's \nproceed and try to finish this with a lot of dignity. I again tell \nSenator Murray and Senator Sessions what a good job they have done. We \nneed to proceed to see what else we can get done.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 366, 213, 455, and 597\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I would add to what the majority leader \nsaid. Senators have been very good in helping us work through our list \non both sides. We will have some more amendments to be offered in a \nunanimous consent in a short while once we work through these four.\n  Again, I would ask all Senators to please work with the leader on \nyour side, Mr. Sessions on the Republican side, and myself. We need to \nknow which amendments you have to have votes on so we can start letting \nSenators know where we are going to end up here. I would ask everybody \nto continue cooperating with us. I appreciate everybody who has been \nworking so hard.\n\n[[Page S2293]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 366\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote in relation to amendment No. 366 offered by the Senator from \nMissouri, Mrs. McCaskill.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, the budget already includes a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund to assist servicemembers and veterans. It \ncontains a provision supporting the transition of our military to the \nworkforce by recognizing the process is too cumbersome for them in \nterms of credentialing requirements and licensing requirements.\n  What my amendment does is it clarifies this section to ensure that a \nservicemember's military training, education, and experience shall be \ntaken into account for both Federal and State licensing requirements.\n  These men and women have performed technical jobs in the most \ndifficult circumstances imaginable. We should recognize that and accept \ntheir service and their experience and their training and allow them to \nbe easily credentialed when they return home. It helps them so much in \nthe search for jobs.\n  I would ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, hearing no opposition, I suggest we \nvoice vote this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 366) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 213\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote in relation to amendment No. 213, offered by the Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Johnson.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Madam President, I would call up my \namendment No. 213.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Madam President, this is a very simple \namendment. It recognizes I think what most of us recognize; that is, \nthe entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare, are the primary \ndrivers of our debt and deficit. So it is a very simple amendment. It \nestablishes a budget point of order that any budget resolution that is \nbrought forward that does not count or does not prepare for a 75-year \nsolvency for both Medicare and Social Security would be considered out \nof order.\n  We in the next 20 years will be paying out $5.1 trillion in benefits \nin excess of what we are bringing in in terms of dedicated revenue \nthrough the payroll tax. The unfunded liabilities of Social Security \nalone are $20.5 trillion. For Medicare the unfunded liability is $42.8 \ntrillion. Those programs must be reformed so they are saved for future \ngenerations.\n  Again, I would hope everybody would support a budget point of order \nfor any budget that does not have a 75-year solvency for Medicare and \nSocial Security.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, Social Security and Medicare have \nplayed a very critical role in providing a foundation of financial \nsecurity and health care for millions upon millions of Americans over \nthe decades. Democrats are committed to preserving and protecting them. \nWhen analyzing the solvency of these programs, it must be over more \nthan just a 10-year budget window; we must measure them over a 75-year \nwindow.\n  This amendment, however, does nothing to protect the integrity of the \nMedicare and Social Security trust funds, and it does not do anything \nto improve their solvency. We should have a debate about the solvency \nof these programs but not on the budget resolution.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and lay \nthat motion upon the table.\n  The motion to lay upon the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 455\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to amendment No. 455, offered \nby the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Brown.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I rise and join with Senator Blunt in a \nbipartisan amendment, No. 455, in support of a national network for \nmanufacturing innovation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from \nthe National Association of Manufacturers, Semiconductor Industry \nAssociation, United Auto Workers, and others.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                                Manufacturers,\n\n                                                   March 22, 2013.\n       Dear Senator: The National Association of Manufacturers \n     (NAM)--the nation's largest industrial trade association--\n     appreciates efforts in the Senate this year to advance a \n     budget plan for fiscal year 2014 (S. Con. Res. 8). \n     Manufacturers remain extremely concerned about the impact of \n     the historically-high levels of the federal deficit and the \n     national debt on manufacturing and the overall U.S. economy \n     and believe that we need a budget plan that puts us on a path \n     to reduce the federal debt and deficits, focusing both on \n     real and immediate spending cuts and longer term structural \n     changes to our nation's entitlement programs. In addition to \n     advocating for debt and deficit reduction, the NAM also \n     supports comprehensive tax reform to promote economic growth \n     and U.S. competitiveness.\n       Unfortunately, the budget blueprint approved by the Senate \n     Budget Committee on March 15, 2013, does not adequately \n     address needed spending cuts and also would impose roughly $1 \n     trillion in job-killing, anti-growth tax increases on the \n     American economy. During the Senate's consideration of the \n     budget plan, we strongly urge you to support the amendments \n     described below that would improve the Senate budget and \n     reject the amendments below that would make the plan even \n     more anti-growth and anti-manufacturing.\n\n            Promoting U.S. Manufacturing and Economic Growth\n\n       NAM members strongly believe that our current tax system \n     discourages economic growth and U.S. competitiveness and that \n     comprehensive, revenue neutral reform of our current system \n     is critical to our nation's economic future. In contrast, tax \n     reform that increases the tax burden on U.S. businesses and \n     individuals will discourage job creation, investment and \n     economic growth. Consequently, we strongly support amendments \n     that would eliminate provisions in S. Con. Res. 8, as \n     approved by the Budget Committee, that call for more than $1 \n     trillion in tax increases on American businesses and families \n     and allow Congress to advance pro-\n\n[[Page S2294]]\n\n     growth, revenue-neutral tax reform that would spur job \n     creation and investment. We also support an amendment offered \n     by Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) that would require a \n     supermajority of the Senate to increase tax rates on \n     businesses and individuals.\n       In addition, it is critically important that tax reform \n     addresses the tax treatment of both corporations and \n     individuals. Thus, Manufacturers oppose an amendment filed by \n     Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) that provides for corporate-only \n     reform. About two-thirds of manufacturers are organized as \n     ``flow throughs'' and pay taxes at individual rates. Any tax \n     reform effort that includes a higher tax burden for these \n     flow through companies would negatively impact their ability \n     to invest in their business and create and retain jobs.\n       Manufacturers also have long led the business community in \n     providing quality retirement benefits, including defined \n     benefit and defined contribution plans to their employees. As \n     such, we support amendments offered by Senator Richard Burr \n     (R-NC) that would protect these benefits from being a source \n     of revenue for additional government spending.\n       Innovation is the lifeblood of U.S. manufacturing and the \n     NAM strongly supports polices to ensure that manufacturers in \n     the United States are the world's leading innovators. To that \n     end, the NAM strongly supports an amendment filed by Senator \n     Orrin Hatch (R-UT) that would preserve and make permanent the \n     R tax credit. A strong, permanent and competitive R \n     credit will allow manufacturers in the United States to \n     continue as global leaders in technology and innovation.\n       Similarly, NAM strongly supports public-private \n     partnerships that promote manufacturing research efforts \n     focused on base-building technologies and processes. The NAM \n     supports an amendment to the budget blueprint filed by \n     Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Roy Blunt (R-MO) that will \n     accelerate the development of advanced manufacturing \n     technologies without adding to the deficit. This will result \n     in innovative products going to market faster, providing an \n     overall benefit to the U.S. economy.\n       NAM also supports an amendment filed by Senator John Thune \n     (R-SD) that will allow for the full and permanent repeal of \n     the estate tax. Many small and medium size manufacturers are \n     family-owned businesses. Planning for and paying estate taxes \n     take away important resources from these important job \n     creators. While NAM supports the reforms of the existing \n     system enacted at the beginning of 2013, our long term goal \n     is full repeal of the estate tax, which is the best solution \n     to protect family-owned businesses from the estate tax.\n       Manufacturers however, oppose efforts to increase taxes on \n     U.S. global companies. Current U.S. tax laws make it \n     difficult for U.S. companies with worldwide operations to \n     thrive and compete in the global marketplace. If American \n     companies cannot compete abroad, where 95 percent of the \n     world's consumers are located, the U.S. economy suffers from \n     the loss of both foreign markets and domestic jobs that \n     support foreign operations. In order to make U.S. \n     multinationals more competitive, the NAM supports the \n     adoption of a competitive territorial tax system. In \n     contrast, increasing taxes on U.S. companies with overseas \n     operations will make it even more difficult for them to \n     compete in the world markets while reducing their ability to \n     grow and add jobs in the United States.\n\n                        The Affordable Care Act\n\n       NAM members also support amendments to the budget plan that \n     would improve our current tax system by eliminating job-\n     killing taxes on manufacturers. In particular, amendments \n     that would eliminate several tax increases that were included \n     in the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Thus, we applaud the Senate \n     for recently approving, a bipartisan amendment offered by \n     Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) that \n     would repeal the current 2.3 percent excise tax on the gross \n     sales of medical devices.\n       By increasing the costs of medical devices, the excise \n     tax--which took effect at the beginning of 2013--hurts the \n     device manufacturers and their workers and also stifles the \n     research and innovation that leads to the development of \n     medical products that contribute to the health and well-being \n     of all Americans. The additional costs imposed by the tax \n     make it more difficult for U.S. medical device manufacturers \n     to compete in the global marketplace and threaten U.S. jobs, \n     investment and our nation's leadership in life sciences.\n       Manufacturers also support an amendment to repeal the \n     Health Insurance Tax (HIT) included in ACA filed by Senator \n     John Barrasso (R-WY). This new tax--to be levied on health \n     insurance companies beginning in 2014--will have the \n     unintended result of increasing costs for many small \n     manufacturers that provide health care benefits for their \n     employees.\n       Recent analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation confirms \n     that this additional cost for insurers will be shifted to \n     consumers in the form of higher premiums for private \n     coverage. Manufacturers will bear a significant burden from \n     this cost shifting. Based on a recent survey, nearly 70 \n     percent of NAM's small and medium-size manufacturers buy \n     health insurance in the fully insured marketplace. Moreover, \n     this additional cost for companies will be on top of the \n     nearly 10 percent average health insurance premium increases \n     experienced last year by NAM's small and medium-size members.\n       The NAM also supports an amendment offered by Senator Dan \n     Coats (R-IN) that would repeal the 3.8 percent investment \n     income surtax also included in ACA. The investment income \n     surtax, which took effect at the beginning of the year, will \n     discourage savings and investment. When the surtax is added \n     to the recent increases in the top tax rates on investment \n     income, some taxpayers now pay a tax rate of 23.8 percent on \n     capital gains and dividends, up from just 15 percent last \n     year, an increase of over 50 percent. Manufacturers strongly \n     support the repeal of this burdensome tax that would increase \n     the tax on savings and investment and reduce the amount of \n     capital business owners have available to invest in their \n     companies. This tax will ultimately result in the loss of \n     vital funds needed for business operations and job creation \n     and for that reason we support the amendment.\n       Beyond the tax area, the NAM also supports amendments that \n     address other shortcomings of the ACA. Specifically, the NAM \n     supports amendments filed by Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) to \n     clarify the definition of a full-time employee, Senator Pat \n     Roberts (R-KS) to protect patients from using data collected \n     as a part of comparative effectiveness to deny coverage under \n     federal programs, and Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) to repeal \n     the employer mandate.\n\n                    Reducing Costs for Manufacturers\n\n       The NAM also supports several amendments that protect \n     manufacturers against new costs and burdens that would result \n     from poorly-crafted proposals to regulate greenhouse gases \n     (GHGs). It is, on average, 20 percent more expensive to \n     manufacture in the U.S. than any of our nine largest trading \n     partners. Placing unilateral restrictions or prices on U.S. \n     GHG emissions, without similar regulations in operation on \n     other major emitting nations, would further disadvantage U.S. \n     manufacturers, costing jobs in the process. For instance, a \n     recent NAM study performed by NERA Economic Consulting found \n     that a carbon tax would impact millions of jobs and result in \n     higher prices for natural gas, electricity, gasoline and \n     other energy commodities. The resulting net negative effect \n     on consumption, investment and jobs would lead to lower \n     federal revenues from taxes on capital and labor. The NAM \n     study concluded that any revenue raised by a carbon tax would \n     be far outweighed by the negative impacts to the overall \n     economy. Thus, the NAM supports an amendment filed by \n     Senators Roy Blunt (R-MO) and John Thune (R-SD) opposing a \n     carbon tax.\n       Manufacturers also support an amendment filed by Senator \n     John Barrasso (R-WY) that would protect exports from being \n     blocked by unnecessarily broad environmental reviews under \n     the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Expanding NEPA \n     to consider the environmental impact of the cargo could \n     hamper exports of many products, such as cars, tractors, \n     agricultural products, electronics, toys, steel, chemicals, \n     pumps, air conditioners, elevators and airplanes.\n       The NAM also supports amendments that would enhance North \n     American oil and gas production by expanding and accelerating \n     onshore and offshore leasing, as well as an amendment from \n     Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) that would support final \n     approval and construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. \n     Construction of Keystone XL would create tens of thousands of \n     jobs and keep manufacturers competitive by providing access \n     to crude oil from Canada and the Bakken formation in North \n     Dakota and Montana. The states along the pipeline route have \n     signed off and the federal government has found that the \n     project will have no significant environmental impact. The \n     delay and red tape for this project is inexcusable; Keystone \n     XL is shovel-ready and it is time for Washington to get out \n     of the way.\n       In addition, an amendment from Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) \n     supported by Manufacturers would encourage diversification of \n     sources of rare earth metals. Rare earths are used in a wide \n     range of applications, from consumer electronics to renewable \n     energy to aerospace and defense. Until very recently, the \n     U.S. imported 100 percent of the rare earths it used; as \n     recently as 2009, 96 percent of this supply came from China. \n     Senator Manchin's amendment, would encourage research into \n     alternative technologies, promotion of recycling, and \n     encouragement of domestic production.\n\n                     U.S. Trade and Competitiveness\n\n       The NAM also supports amendments that will strengthen \n     America's competitiveness in the global economy through trade \n     agreements and export promotion. In particular, the NAM \n     supports amendments offered by Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT) \n     and Rob Portman (R-OH) to renew trade promotion authority to \n     enable the United States to negotiate and implement trade \n     agreements eliminating barriers to greater access overseas. \n     The NAM also supports amendments offered by Senator Hatch to \n     maintain a strong Office of the United States Trade \n     Representative and to strengthen U.S. government efforts \n     promoting innovation and protecting intellectual property \n     rights worldwide. Similarly, Manufacturers support amendments \n     offered by Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Kay Hagan (D-NC) \n     and Deb Fischer (R-NE) that would make improvements in export \n     promotion programs for small businesses to increase \n     commercial opportunities and support and grow jobs.\n       In contrast, the NAM strongly opposes amendments that will \n     undermine manufacturers' ability to access foreign markets. \n     In\n\n[[Page S2295]]\n\n     particular, NAM opposes an amendment offered by Senator Mike \n     Lee (R-UT) to defund the Export-Import Bank, which supported \n     more than $170 billion in exports in 2012. Manufacturers also \n     oppose an amendment offered by Senator Lee to defund efforts \n     to implement the Law of the Sea Convention that is an \n     important framework, which the United States should ratify, \n     to help create greater predictability for offshore resources \n     and operations.\n\n                           Overreach by NLRB\n\n       Manufacturers have long been concerned about the direction \n     of the National Labor Relations Board and recent actions \n     taken by the NLRB have borne out this concern. In particular, \n     manufacturers are troubled by the Board's apparent disregard \n     for the U.S. Appeals Court decision regarding the \n     appointments of Members Block and Griffin. The New Process \n     Steel Supreme Court ruling made it clear that the NLRB cannot \n     make case decisions or promulgate regulations without a \n     properly constituted quorum of at least three members. As \n     such, the NAM supports the amendments by Senators Lamar \n     Alexander (R-TN), Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) \n     to limit funds available to the Board.\n       In addition, the Board's decision in the Specialty \n     Healthcare case represents the most dramatic change in labor \n     law in over 70 years. The decision sets forth a new standard \n     for determining which group or ``unit'' of employees will \n     vote in the union election. By establishing a new standard, a \n     bargaining unit could now consist of as little as two \n     employees. These ``micro-unions,'' could cripple an \n     employer's ability to manage operations in an effective way, \n     and result in a facilities operating with separate unions for \n     each job category and unnecessarily dividing employees. The \n     NAM support, an amendment filed by Senator Johnny Isakson (R-\n     GA) to prevent funding to implement the new ``micro union'' \n     standard established by the Specialty Healthcare decision.\n\n               Addressing Manufacturers' Workforce Needs\n\n       World-class manufacturing demands world-class talent. \n     Today, approximately 600,000 manufacturing jobs go unfilled \n     because of the skills gap. Consequently, NAM members strongly \n     support efforts to develop a more productive and skilled \n     workforce. S.Con.Res. 8, as approved by the Budget Committee, \n     does include provisions for improving workforce development, \n     job training, and other reemployment programs. Manufacturers \n     also support an amendment offered by Senator Kay Hagan (D-NC) \n     that would also ensure that training leading to nationally \n     recognized post-secondary credentials would be included as \n     one of the goals of new legislation. This amendment clearly \n     supports NAM's policy of promoting industry-recognized \n     credentials.\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Thank you in advance for considering the views of \n     Manufacturers. Clearly our nation's fiscal challenges are of \n     critical importance not only to the future of American \n     manufacturers, but to the future of all Americans. NAM \n     members firmly believe that it is critically important that \n     any budget blueprint puts the country on a path to address \n     these important issues without raising taxes on manufacturers \n     and other job creators and American families. We look forward \n     to working with you and your colleagues to advance a pro-\n     growth, pro-manufacturing budget plan for fiscal 2014 that \n     addresses our nation's fiscal challenges.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Aric Newhouse,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Semiconductor Industry\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                                   March 22, 2013.\n     Hon. Sherrod Brown,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Roy Blunt\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Brown and Senator Blunt: I am writing in \n     support of the bipartisan amendment to establish a deficit \n     neutral reserve fund for the National Network for \n     Manufacturing Innovation. This network could bring together \n     industry, universities and community colleges with federal, \n     state and local governments to accelerate manufacturing \n     innovation.\n       Public-private institutes to leverage investments in \n     industrially-relevant manufacturing technologies bridge the \n     gap between basic research and product development, provide \n     shared assets to help companies all along the supply chain \n     and can stimulate manufacturing and jobs. Including students \n     from community colleges and training facilities to build a \n     workforce with the advanced manufacturing skills we need.\n       We have seen the success of regional hubs in California, \n     Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, and Texas, and we \n     believe this model can be broadened locally and replicated \n     nationally to create manufacturing excellence. Manufacturing \n     is an important sector in our economy, and continued U.S. \n     leadership in advanced manufacturing of semiconductors is in \n     the national interest.\n       Given the bipartisan nature of this deficit neutral \n     amendment, we believe it should be accepted by the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Brian Toohey,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n         International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & \n           Agricultural Implement Workers of America--UAW,\n                                                   March 22, 2013.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the UAW's more than one million \n     active and retired members, I write to strongly urge you to \n     vote in support of the Amendment to S. Con. Res. 8 to be \n     offered by Senators Brown (D-OH) and Blunt (R-MO) when it \n     comes to the floor. The purpose of this amendment is to \n     establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to create a national \n     network for manufacturing innovation. This fund would bring \n     together the best minds from both the private and public \n     sectors. It would create joint public-private institutes that \n     leverage investments to broadly applicable manufacturing \n     technologies for proven manufacturing industries within the \n     United States.\n       This type of partnership would help bridge the gap between \n     basic research and product development, and provide assets to \n     particularly help small and medium sized manufacturing \n     businesses access cutting-edge technology and create a 21st \n     century pipeline for the education and training of students \n     and workers in advanced manufacturing skills.\n       A strong manufacturing sector is critical for our economy. \n     The resurgence of the domestic auto industry has proven the \n     resiliency of the U.S. manufacturing base, leading the way \n     towards the retention and creation of tens of thousands of \n     good-paying middle class jobs through the worst of the \n     recession. The continued growth and prosperity of \n     manufacturing sectors like the auto industry is directly \n     reliant on a shared public and private commitment to \n     developing the next generation of advanced manufacturing \n     technologies.\n       In our global economy, we must invest in the next \n     generation of workers and technologies to ensure we remain a \n     step ahead of our international competitors. Similar programs \n     have already been successfully deployed in other countries. \n     The model offered by this amendment would help fill the gap \n     between U.S. manufacturing innovation and infrastructure and \n     we must not miss the opportunity to make a vital investment \n     in the future of our domestic manufacturing sector. We \n     strongly encourage you to vote in support of the Brown-Blunt \n     amendment when it comes to the floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Josh Nassar,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               The Association for\n\n\n                                     Manufacturing Technology,\n\n                                                   March 21, 2013.\n     Hon. Sherrod Brown,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Roy Blunt,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Brown and Blunt: On behalf of AMT--The \n     Association For Manufacturing Technology and its over 600 \n     member companies, I am writing in support of your efforts to \n     establish a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation \n     (NNMI) by offering an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2014 \n     Senate Budget Resolution. I sit on the board of the pilot \n     institute, the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation \n     Institute, located in Youngstown.\n       AMT members are the innovators that make modern life \n     possible--from lightning speed communications and efficient \n     transportation to revolutionary medical procedures and new \n     energy exploration. In order to continue to outpace, out-\n     innovate and outperform the global competition, these mostly \n     small and medium-sized companies need access to the best \n     research tools and talent available. Public-private \n     collaborations, such as the NNMI, that focus on providing \n     that access and accelerating the pace of manufacturing \n     technology innovation are the best multipliers of government \n     R dollars.\n       AMT's Manufacturing Mandate urges a three-pronged approach \n     to strengthening manufacturing for economic growth and job \n     creation. First, increase global competitiveness by leveling \n     the playing field for U.S. businesses. Next, build an \n     educated and trained manufacturing workforce that can meet \n     the challenges of today's workplace. AMT calls it the \n     ``Smartforce.'' Finally, support R and rapid innovation \n     through collaborative projects like the NNMI.\n       Thank you again for your leadership in getting this \n     exciting program off the ground. I am taking the liberty of \n     letting AMT members in Ohio and Missouri know of your support \n     for boosting American manufacturing innovation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Douglas K. Woods,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    The Ohio State University,\n\n                                                   March 22, 2013.\n     Hon. Sherrod Brown,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of The Ohio State University, I \n     write to express my support for your amendment to the FY 2014 \n     Senate Budget Resolution to establish a deficit-neutral \n     funding source for the National Network for Manufacturing \n     Innovation (NNMI). I appreciate your continued support of \n     manufacturing in Ohio, and of the University's role as a \n     critical industry partner. The proposed NNMI will address \n     critical needs facing our nation's manufacturing sector and \n     represents a worthwhile and necessary investment by our \n     federal government.\n       Manufacturing continues to be a vital sector of our economy \n     and one that must adapt\n\n[[Page S2296]]\n\n     to the evolving structures of industry, workforce, and \n     technology on which it depends. The NNMI targets these needs \n     by bringing together industry, government, and academia to \n     enhance our national competitiveness and economic security. \n     This is especially important to a state like Ohio, which is \n     ranked third in the nation in manufacturing output and \n     workforce, and in which nearly 18% of the state domestic \n     product is impacted by manufacturing.\n       As you know, Ohio State's land-grant mission drives our \n     faculty to engage in research that supports industry from \n     discovery to deployment. As a national leader in industry-\n     sponsored research, Ohio State recognizes the importance of \n     connecting with those who will help carry scientific \n     discoveries beyond the laboratory, and the NNMI will foster \n     these partnerships across the country. Equally important is \n     our commitment to training and ensuring opportunities for the \n     next generation of manufacturing innovators. The NNMI will \n     strengthen our manufacturing sector to better serve not only \n     today's workforce but tomorrow's as well.\n       I recognize that leaders in Washington are making difficult \n     choices regarding the federal budget. I believe this is the \n     right time for establishing a national resource such as the \n     National Network for Manufacturing Innovation. The Ohio State \n     University firmly supports this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    E. Gordon Gee,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, this amendment--the NNMI--offers one \ncommonsense approach by partnering with private industry to bring \ntogether companies, small businesses, research institutions, and \ncommunity colleges so we can outinnovate the rest of the world.\n  I ask for its support and yield the remainder of my time to Senator \nBlunt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I would just say these entities would \nallow basic research to come together with product development. It \nbrings the research elements, the universities, and others together \nwith private capital, and even some government agencies, in ways that \nlet things happen that wouldn't otherwise.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Brown in offering this to the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator in Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I don't believe there is any opposition \nto this amendment and I ask that we take it by a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 455) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ENZI. I move to lay the motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 597\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes \nof debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. \n597 offered by the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Scott.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. SCOTT. Madam President, my amendment is very simple. It prohibits \nthe automatic deduction of union dues from Federal employees' \npaychecks.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, the Senator has yielded back his time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I would speak in opposition.\n  Gains in quality, productivity, and efficiency year after year, in \ndepartment after department, would not have been possible without the \nreasonable and sound use of collective bargaining and worker \nrepresentation. This amendment is just another in a long line of \nattempts to kill public-sector unions--unions that represent and ensure \nquality public service.\n  I strongly recommend that my colleagues oppose this amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote in relation to amendment No. 706, offered by the Senator from \nMaryland, Mr. Cardin.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, we have two amendments that are going to \nbe considered, one I am offering, one Senator Inhofe is offering.\n  Senator Inhofe's amendment is a rather extreme amendment. It cuts the \nfunds to the Environmental Protection Agency and basically prohibits \nthem from regulating carbon emissions. I would hope most of us would \nconsider that a rather extreme position to take, to prevent the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency from protecting the environment.\n  My amendment is an amendment that says the carbon emissions standards \nmust be cost-effective--and we all agree they should be cost-\neffective--it should be based upon best-available science and benefit \nlow-income and middle-class families. I would hope we can all agree on \nthe amendment I would offer, and I would hope we would do that and \nallow the Environmental Protection Agency to carry out its critical \nmission on behalf of the people of this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I wish to ask one question of the \nauthor. First of all, this does not authorize the EPA to regulate in \nany way. This sets the standards. Is that correct?\n  Mr. CARDIN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I support this amendment. I suggest we \nvoice vote it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 706) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 359\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote in relation to the amendment numbered 359, offered by Mr. \nInhofe of Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, people at home are going out of business \nevery day--I think everybody knows that--from the overregulation that \nis out there. A lot of people talk about the problem with the taxes. I \ncontend that the imposition of these regulations is even worse than the \ntaxes. And this regulation does one thing: It stops the EPA from having \nthe jurisdiction over the regulation of carbon.\n  Madam President, I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, Senator Inhofe's amendment will cut \nmoney from the Environmental Protection Agency that has already gone \nthrough, I think, three rounds of cuts from sequestration, and then \nprevents it from carrying out its mission to regulate our environment.\n  It is a very extreme approach. We have already approved the Cardin \namendment that establishes the right standards for regulating carbon \nemissions.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Inhofe amendment, and I reserve \nthe remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, did I have 30 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, he has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. INHOFE. They have been trying to regulate carbon now \nlegislatively for 10 years and have been unable to do it. I actually \nhad a bill up where we got 50 votes, but it took a 60-vote threshold to \nmake it happen. So we know the votes are here and the people are \nconcerned about the regulation.\n  I would only leave you with a quote from Dr. Richard Lindzen from \nMIT, who said that regulating carbon is the bureaucrat's dream. ``If \nyou regulate carbon, you regulate life.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest you vote in favor of this amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, has all time been used on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Murray has 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let me point out that the framework that \nis set up to protect our health has to be based upon best science, it \nhas to protect low-income and middle-income families, and it has to be \ndone in a cost-effective way. That should be our mission, and that is \nwhat we have already approved.\n  I would urge us to reject the Inhofe amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I think I had 5 seconds remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

There is now 2 minutes equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 705, offered by \nthe Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, is my amendment called up, No. 705?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, this side-by-side with Senator Sessions \nis very straightforward. It restates current law. Let me repeat that. \nIt restates current law, which already explicitly excludes undocumented \nimmigrants who are in this country from obtaining benefits such as tax \ncredits and cost-sharing subsidies when obtaining health insurance \ncoverage.\n  We debated this policy at length during health care reform, and this \nexemption was included in the final bill to address concerns of some of \nour Republican colleagues that undocumented immigrants would somehow be \nable to\n\n[[Page S2299]]\n\nreceive the benefits we included in the law. That is why we \nspecifically and explicitly excluded them from being able to gain this \ntype of coverage.\n  Finally, addressing the issues of immigrant families is currently \nbeing done in a bipartisan fashion. The last thing we need to do in \nthis budget process is to try to muck that up.\n  This is not a great way to do your outreach to the Hispanic and \nimmigrant community. I urge our colleagues just to stay with present \nlaw. Let's restate it once again, support our amendment, and reject the \nSessions amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I agree that the Senator's amendment \nrestates current law. I have no objection to that. I would accept that. \nBut the question is and what has been suggested in the paper from what \nI have seen is that if a person is in our country illegally and they \nare rewarded with some legal status, do they then immediately become \neligible for Federal health care benefits? It is a different situation \nthan somebody who came legally and has legal status.\n  So I would say I would accept a voice vote on this.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. My amendment will deal with the next question.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I believe there is no opposition. If we \ncould take a voice vote on this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate? Hearing none, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 705) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 614\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There now is 2 minutes equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 614, offered by \nthe Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, under current law, if a person is here \nunlawfully and becomes ``lawfulized,'' in some fashion, they then \nbecome qualified for this program. That is what we are talking about. \nSo the question is, Should they then become qualified for ObamaCare or \nMedicaid? I think the answer is no. I think that is what people have \nsaid they believe.\n  My amendment would simply say that if you are here illegally, did not \nenter legally, and you get a lawful status in the United States, you \nthen do not qualify for the Federal programs of ObamaCare and Medicaid.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, nothing changes present law, and nothing \nis contemplated to change--which I think the Group of 8 wouldn't mind \nme saying--what the Senator is concerned about in our negotiations. It \nwould have to come before this body before, in fact, it could be \nchanged.\n  The current law is very clear. They do not have access to any of the \nbenefits that the Senator is worried about because present law \nprohibits an undocumented immigrant from having access to those \nbenefits. That is why this is unnecessary. It is just the need of some \nto have an immigration amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

There is now 2 minutes equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 696, offered by \nthe Senator from Oregon, Mr. Merkley.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, under the American system of justice \nwhere Lady Justice is blindfolded, there should never be a prosecution-\nfree zone. But that is what the Department of Justice announced there \nis on Tuesday, December 11 of last year. They said they would fine but \nthey would not indict and they would not prosecute Hongkong and \nShanghai Banking Corporation for laundering $800 million in illicit \ndrug money; for laundering $600 million in transactions that violated \nU.S. sanctions against Iran, Sudan, Cuba, and other countries against \nAmerican law; and for allowing $200 trillion to bypass the sanctions \nand money-laundering filters.\n  As the New York Times reported, the Department of Justice decided not \nto indict HSBC ``over concerns that criminal charges could jeopardize \none of the world's largest banks, ultimately destabilizing the global \nfinancial system.'' Our Attorney General repeated this justification on \nMarch 6, 2013, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying: I am \nconcerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large, \nit does become difficult to prosecute them.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask unanimous consent for 20 more seconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, is there opposition?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. How much time?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask for 20 seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Twenty seconds.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you.\n  Too-big-to-jail is wrong under our Constitution. It promises equality \nunder the law. Let's send a strong message by supporting this.\n  I thank my Republican sponsors, Senators Grassley, Heller, Cornyn, \nand Shelby; and Democrats Tester, Warren, Begich, and Levin; and our \nIndependent Senators, Sanders and King.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there may be someone else here, but I \nhave prosecuted banks before and big institutions and put some people \nin jail. But we have--this is serious. I don't think the deficit \nreserve fund is the way to go about it, frankly, but it is an issue \nworthy of discussion. It should be brought up in the authorizing \ncommittee--the Judiciary Committee--and considered. And I am very \ninclined to believe we have had too little prosecution in these cases. \nBut I think the right thing to do is to take this by voice vote. People \ncan decide how they want to vote on it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I believe there is no opposition. We can \ntake it by a voice vote. Senator Merkley has asked for a loud vote.\n\n[[Page S2300]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 696) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 187\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is now 2 minutes of debate \ndivided equally on amendment No. 187.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, this amendment would prohibit funds for \npromotional and marketing materials that promote the affordable health \ncare act and its benefits at taxpayer expense.\n  According to HHS's own documents obtained by the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, which issued the subpoena last year, HHS spent almost $52 \nmillion in behalf of the affordable health care act public relations \nwork using outside contractors. That is just not right. When the media \nis reporting more and more problems, more costs, more regulations, more \nlost jobs, higher premiums, this is a gratuitous use of taxpayer \ndollars. It sets a very bad precedent for the Department of Health and \nHuman Services stretching the truth, at best, at public expense.\n  This administration should not be using American taxpayer dollars to \nfund marketing and promotional campaigns promoting a law and \nregulations that a majority of Americans oppose.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this ought to be known as the Harry Potter \ninvisibility cloak amendment.\n  Anyone who has read ``Harry Potter'' knows he had this invisibility \ncloak he put over himself and people couldn't see him. They have tried \n36 separate times to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. They can't do \nthat, so now they want to put an invisibility cloak over it.\n  The Roberts amendment says we can't tell people, for example, that \ntheir kids can stay on their policy until they are 26; we can't tell \npeople that now they can get coverage even though they have a \npreexisting condition; we can't tell people they can go on the exchange \nstarting this October, where they can get good health care.\n  Let's vote down the Harry Potter invisibility cloak amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. No, I accept it on a voice vote. Harry Potter accepts it \non a voice vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for a voice vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 187) was rejected.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas will state \nhis parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I respectfully ask the Parliamentarian if the official \nSenate decibel meter indicates that the ruling by the distinguished \nParliamentarian that the count--or that the vote was not accurate on \nthe last vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, the \nnoes had it.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Perhaps a hearing problem.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 619\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 2 minutes equally divided \nprior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 619, offered by the \nSenator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, this amendment would allow for better \ncoordination of our flood mitigation programs to meet the unmet needs \nof victims of disaster.\n  As homeowners along the Jersey Shore seek to recover from Superstorm \nSandy, they are not just faced with the task of rebuilding, they also \nhave to comply with new, incredibly costly elevation requirements. \nSeniors who have lived in their modest homes their entire lives now \nface tens of thousands of dollars in unanticipated costs, all in \naddition to the costs of rebuilding. And while there are Federal \nprograms available to help coordination among these programs, it is \nincredibly poor and leads to a lot of victims never being helped. For \nexample, there are hazard mitigation grants available, but homeowners \nwill lose eligibility if they begin work before their application was \napproved, even if they complied with every other rule and regulation.\n  My amendment would allow coordination and fine tuning of these \nmitigation programs so they operate more effectively and meet the unmet \nneeds of disaster victims. The amendment would not cost any money, nor \nwould it add another penny to the deficit. It just encourages the use \nof current programs in a more wise and coordinated fashion.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think we can accept this by a voice vote.\n  I would note that the House has nonreserved funds. The Senate now has \nabout 50 we have adopted already. We have reserve funds adopted for \neducation, clean energy, infrastructure, farm payments, food stamps, \nhealth care, pensions, housing, tooth decay, and now homeowners. So \nthese create 50 ways to pass taxes more easily. It turns the budget \ndiscipline, if we don't watch it, into mush and makes it difficult to \nmaintain the integrity of the Budget Act and avoids really in some ways \nthe hard work of setting priorities.\n  So I think we should do this by voice vote, but I did want to call \nthe attention of my colleagues to the fact that reserve funds too \nreadily used can undermine the integrity of the budget process.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there any further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 619) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 152\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is now 2 minutes equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 152 offered by the \nSenator from Ohio, Mr. Portman.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment that actually saves \nsome money. It is an amendment that instructs the Judiciary Committee \nto produce savings of over $60 billion by cutting back on frivolous \nlawsuits through medical malpractice reform.\n  Today, patients and physicians alike are held hostage by a broken \nmedical liability system that continues to incentivize defensive \nmedicine, which leads to a lot of wasteful spending and unnecessary \ntests and studies. PricewaterhouseCoopers has released a study showing \nthat the estimated cost of this defensive medicine is about $210 \nbillion a year.\n  Comprehensive medical malpractice reform has been proposed by \nSimpson-Bowles, by Rivlin-Domenici, and by other bipartisan deficit-\nreduction groups. It has also been examined in depth as a means for \ndeficit reduction by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. In \nfact, CBO has told us that sensible medical malpractice reform could \nreduce the deficit by over $62 billion over 10 years. CBO also points \nout that comprehensive reform could alleviate shortages of certain \nkinds of physicians around the country.\n  The amendment provides maximum flexibility for the Judiciary \nCommittee in allowing the committee to determine the best way to \nachieve deficit reduction by reforming the current system. This \nflexibility, by the way, includes the ability to enact reforms that\n\n[[Page S2301]]\n\nwould only come into effect if States fail to act.\n  ObamaCare has not only led to rising insurance premiums and loss of \nemployer-sponsored coverage, but it has also missed this crucial \nopportunity to reduce costs while maintaining access to critical \nspecialty care.\n  So let's set this reform in motion today as part of this budget \nprocess.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment. Malpractice \npremiums and claims and claim payouts have all gone down in recent \nyears, partly as a result of steps many of our States have already \ntaken. Caps on noneconomic damages limit compensation for such harms as \nloss of fertility or severe disfigurement or loss of mobility or loss \nof a spouse or a child. Damage caps do not affect frivolous lawsuits \nbut, rather, impact the victims who have been seriously injured and who \nwould win in court.\n  Tort reform can create enormous risks and costs. Immunizing health \ncare providers against accountability for their mistakes risks \nincreasing the number of preventable medical errors.\n  So this proposal would cut losses for insurers by curbing our \npatients' right to sue, but there is no requirement in these proposals \nfor insurers to pass on any savings to the doctors who pay their \npremiums.\n  So I recommend a ``no'' vote on this amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nLautenberg) is necessarily absent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

There is now 2 minutes equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 624, offered by \nthe Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Johanns.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, this amendment restores a family's \nability to plan ahead for health care costs and afford care. It \neliminates a cap on flexible spending accounts.\n  It also eliminates the silly requirement that Americans get a \ndoctor's prescription to purchase over-the-counter medications with \ntheir FSA or health savings account.\n  In addition, the health savings account can be used for people who \nhave disabilities, so this eliminates the possibility of doing that \nbeyond the cap.\n  I ask my colleagues to support me in eliminating the cap and \neliminating this crazy requirement about getting a doctor's \nprescription to use a common medication.\n  It is supported by the National Downs Syndrome Society, the National \nCenter for Learning Disabilities, and the Chamber of Commerce. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have looked at this amendment. I do \nhave some concerns about the implementation, but I think we can work \nthem out. I would be willing to accept this on a voice vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 624) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 295 Withdrawn\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is now 2 minutes equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 295 offered by the \nSenator from Tennessee, Mr. Corker.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, we saw during this last CR that there is a \nprocess called ChIMPS where you can take money out of mandatory \nspending temporarily and spend more in discretionary spending, which \nover the last 2 years has allowed us to spend $35 billion more than the \nBudget Control Act allowed. Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby both \nagree that there is a problem here. They have agreed to try to work \ntoward a solution to keep this gimmick from being used in the future. I \nwill say that this came over from the House this way. It is not \nsomething that originated here in the Senate. But because they have \nagreed to work toward a solution, I withdraw my amendment and thank \nthem for their cooperation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nTennessee first for consulting with Senator Shelby and me. You are \nexactly right, he has identified a problem. We are concerned. I promise \nthe Senator we will definitely work with him. I appreciate the Senator \nwithdrawing the amendment. I am going to say publicly in front of my \ncolleagues, we will definitely work with the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 232\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is now 2 minutes equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 232 offered by the \nSenator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I believe that the next amendment in \norder is the Burr amendment No. 232.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, very quickly, the purpose of my amendment is \nvery simple. It is to protect the American people and strengthen our \nnational security by fully funding the Biomedical Advanced Research and \nDevelopment Authority and the BioShield Reserve Fund. BARDA and \nBioshield are critical components of our Nation's medical \ncountermeasure enterprise. Today these programs ensure that we have the \ncountermeasures necessary to protect the American people against the \nfull range of chemical, biologic, radiological, and nuclear threats \nwhether natural or the result of manmade attacks. After 9/11 Congress \nestablished Bioshield to encourage the development of these \ncountermeasures. Supporting BARDA and Bioshield at their authorized \nlevels is a matter of national security and should be a priority.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am speaking for my counterpart. This is \nanother deficit-neutral fund, which I know Senator Sessions has been \nexpressing his concern about all evening. I am delighted to accept this \namendment on a voice vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If there is no further debate, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 232) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 538\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is now 2 minutes equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 538 offered by the \nSenator from Mississippi, Mr. Wicker.\n  Mr. WICKER. This amendment simply puts us back where we were several \nyears ago, at a 60-vote point of order for unfunded mandates. \nWashington should not use extensive unfunded mandates to shove the \nweight of irresponsible government growth down to State and local \ngovernments. The threshold now is 51 votes to wave a point of order on \nunfunded mandates. This amendment would simply put it back the way it \nused to be in the law to 60 votes.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I think this amendment is unnecessary.\n\n[[Page S2303]]\n\nWe already have proper points of order. I will not hold it up. I will \nnot oppose it if you want to do a voice vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there any further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The nos appear to have it.\n  Mr. WICKER. Division. Mr. President, the Chair accepted the \namendment. If we are going to start enforcing this, I will marshal my \nforces and we will learn to yell louder. But the Chair accepted my \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I believe that the voice vote was a \n``yes'' vote. I would ask my colleagues if we can redo the vote so we \ncan hear it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 538) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 412\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is now 2 minutes prior to a \nvote in relation to amendment No. 412 offered by the Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Coburn.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a simple vote. The Postal Service \nlost $15.8 billion last year. Political parties contributed to that \nloss by our getting a discount on all of our mail. All this will do is \nput us at the same rate as everybody else commercially in terms of the \nmailing. It is probably about $50- to $60 million if we pass this \namendment that we will increase the revenue to the Postal Service.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will not oppose this amendment. I am \ndelighted to see another deficit-neutral reserve fund put into place on \nthis bill that I know my colleagues on the other side of this aisle \nhave not been very happy about throughout the process. But in the \nspirit of good will, I am happy to accept this amendment on a voice \nvote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 412) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 340\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is now 2 minutes equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 340 offered by the \nSenator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, this amendment would create a deficit-\nneutral reserve fund for legislation that requires financial regulators \nto perform rigorous cost-benefit analysis of their proposals. If this \nanalysis determines that a proposed rule's cost exceeds its benefits, \nthe rule should not be implemented. Given the far-reaching scope many \nnew financial rules will have on our markets, I believe it is \nimperative that regulators conduct thorough cost-benefit analysis to \nfully understand how these rules will affect our economy.\n  Independent final regulators operate under a patchwork of Federal \nlaws that require varying degrees of economic analysis and provide too \nmuch discretion to regulators. As a result, American job creators are \nunder siege from capricious rulemaking activities. Regulations should \nbe based on solid evidence and supported by robust economic analysis, \nnot the arbitrary preferences of bureaucrats.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield my time to the Senator from South \nDakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise in strong \nopposition to amendment No. 340. The amendment is another attempt to \nblock Wall Street reform. This amendment would slow down rulemaking and \ninvite Wall Street to bring lawsuits against their financial \nregulators.\n  GAO recently found that the recent financial crisis may have cost us \nover $13 trillion. We should not hamstring the cops on the beat as they \ntry to prevent another crisis. Efforts to undermine sensible \nregulations are opposed by many organizations, including AARP, CFA, and \nthe AFL-CIO. I oppose this amendment and I urge my colleagues to do so \nas well.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I join my colleague in opposing this \namendment. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nLautenberg) is necessarily absent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I have not yet delivered my maiden speech. I will be very \nbrief. I plan to withdraw this amendment, and I understand there will \nbe a point of order raised against germaneness with a 60-vote threshold \nI can't overcome. I just want to make the point this body has done good \nwork in the last 2 years on a bipartisan basis to get rid of the \nscourge of earmarks and the abuse of earmarks which has taken place in \nboth this Chamber and the House.\n  This amendment would have simply been for a point of order to be \nraised if earmarks were contained in legislation. I would encourage \nthis body to continue the practice which has occurred over the past 2 \nyears and not have congressional earmarks. I thank you for your \nindulgence.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 329\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the next amendment is offered by Senator \nGraham, amendment No. 329.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. We need to vote on this.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This amendment will get your attention.\n  About 500,000 or 600,000 Federal employees will be furloughed because \nof sequestration. They are going to miss 1 day a week of pay. We can't \ndock our own pay constitutionally, but I am asking through this \namendment that all of us, beginning in April, take 20 percent of our \nsalary and give it to the charity of our choice or anybody we would \nlike so that we would feel what other people are feeling because of \nsequestration.\n  Thank you. Have a good night.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there an amendment?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. What is the question?\n  I will take a voice vote, absolutely.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to take a voice vote on this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there any further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The Chair is in doubt.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The noes appear to have it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Wait a minute. I ask for a rollcall vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, may I have the floor for a moment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I was really trying to focus on what the \nSenator was saying. It was very difficult for me to understand, and I \nthink many of us were confused about the amendment. I support the \namendment, and I ask for a voice vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 329) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 293\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 293, \noffered by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Heller.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, my amendment reinforces the important role \nof States having primary responsibility for wildlife management. If the \nsage-grouse is listed as an endangered species, it will hurt most \nStates in the western portion of the country. It will make important \nactivities, such as renewable energy and grazing, in many cases \nimpossible.\n  I need help and support. I urge support for this amendment, and I \nappreciate the help and support I have gotten from Senators Hatch, \nCrapo, and Risch.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this actually is a commonsense approach, \nand I do urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I will be happy to accept it on a voice vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 293) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 527\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is now 2 minutes equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 527, offered by \nthe Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Boozman.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, this amendment would discourage the \ntaking of private property to transfer to another private, \nnongovernmental use. It does not diminish the use of eminent domain for \ncustomary purposes, including the acquiring of property for public use, \nfor public rights-of-way, to acquire abandoned property, or to remove \nimmediate threats to public health or safety.\n  In the past, we have had significant bipartisan support in regard to \nprotecting property rights, so I would encourage us to vote in favor of \nthe amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I do not oppose this amendment, and I am \nhappy to have a voice vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate?\n  The question is agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 527) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 153\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is now 2 minutes equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 153, offered by \nthe Senator from Ohio, Mr. Portman.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, this is a jobs amendment. This is about \nhaving authority to knock down barriers to trade.\n  I am offering this in connection with Senator Wyden today and also \nSenator Hatch. Expanding exports and enforcing our trade laws go hand \nin hand. That is why later I will be supporting the ENFORCE Act offered \nby Senator Wyden.\n  The bottom line is that not since 2007 have we had trade promotion \nauthority in this country, and without it we can't complete trade \nagreements. As a result, America is falling behind because other \ncountries are completing agreements, and the people who are getting \nhurt the most are our workers, our farmers, and our service providers.\n  So if you want to give our workers in this country a fair shake, a \nlevel playing field by knocking down barriers to trade, you can vote \nfor this amendment.\n  I yield to my colleague from Oregon.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n[[Page S2306]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, very briefly, I think this is an \nopportunity to update our laws, particularly looking at environmental \nprotection, labor rights, and digital trade. So I urge all colleagues \nto support this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am willing to accept this on a voice \nvote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 153) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 136\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is now 2 minutes equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 136, offered by \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, Ms. Ayotte.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, my amendment would establish a deficit-\nneutral reserve fund to prohibit funding for the Medium Extended Air \nDefense System, known as MEADS. This is a system our Army has said \nwould never work. We have already spent $3 billion on this system. It \nis essentially a missile to nowhere. In fact, the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Levin, has said he feels strongly that it \nis a waste of money. We have already appropriated $380 million in 2013 \nfor something our troops will never use.\n  Some have argued there is an agreement that we have to pay \ntermination fees. That is false. The actual agreement says the \nresponsibility of the participants will be subject to the availability \nof funds appropriated for such purposes. The language is clear.\n  With $16 trillion in debt, I would urge my colleagues to stop funding \nthe missile to nowhere and make sure our taxpayer dollars are used \nwisely.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to suggest that the amendment \nbeing offered by the Senator from New Hampshire is unnecessary. It \nrelates to fiscal year 2014. There will be no request for this missile \nsystem in fiscal year 2014.\n  I suggest that if she wants to pass this, she might, but perhaps she \ncan do it by voice vote because her amendment won't apply to any \nsuggested funding for this missile system in this next fiscal year.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am amenable to a voice vote.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the chairman be recognized. She \ntried to get recognition, and she couldn't.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, before we go to the rollcall vote on \nthis, I want to turn to all my colleagues and remind all of us that \nwhat we are here trying to do is to pass a budget out of the Senate.\n  I have heard from so many people for so many months about how \nimportant it is that we get a budget out so we can move to the next \nprocess in this whole thing of getting our country back on track, and \nwe are trying to do it in a responsible way.\n  We have had a really great debate in our committee, out here on the \nfloor, and many Senators have participated in it. We have now had I \nbelieve 62 or 63 amendments, and I think we have a responsibility to \nwork toward final passage.\n  I am aware that not every Senator had an opportunity to have an \namendment, but I think many, many Senators have to say they were able \nto get their amendments. We have had amendments on virtually every \ntopic here tonight, including the budget, but I would really ask all \nSenators to stop and think about what we are showing the American \npublic.\n  What we would like the American public to think is that the Senate as \na group of 100 people can have a process to move a budget forward and \nvote on it, whether we agree with it or we disagree with it. And I \nthink we are pretty much there in showing the American public that we \ncan have a good debate, have numerous amendments, have our voices \nheard. At the end of the day, it is a ``yes'' or ``no'' vote.\n  So while we have this next vote, I would really like everyone to take \na second and think about how we look to the American people and how \nimportant it is that we move this process along so that we can come to \na final conclusion and hopefully get bipartisan agreement to get our \ncountry back on track.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Murray for her \nleadership and for her fairness in helping us move a lot of amendments \nfairly and equitably tonight. We are in a situation where--no need to \ndebate it into the night--I wish we had not been in a position where \nthe majority leader was determined to finish this weekend. I wish we \ncould have started earlier in the week or to come back on April 8, but \nthat is not possible.\n  We have gone 4 years without a budget, and Members have been \nconstricted in the filing of amendments this year more than any other \ntime in probably the history of the Senate. One has to ask or beg \npermission to be allowed to have an amendment. Senator Ayotte is one of \nthose. Senator Moran and others had amendments. So they are frustrated, \nand they want their votes.\n  So I would just say, let's keep going. Let's keep in good humor. \nLet's try to get as many of these votes in as possible. I have had \nseveral Members suggest that we might vote from our chairs and not \nleave the Chamber and cut these rollcall votes down to a much shorter \nperiod of time. Maybe we could discuss that. But I think the list needs \nto be continued to be produced. A number of Senators haven't had \namendments, and they really feel as though they have a right to. And \nthis may be their only opportunity, the way things are going this year, \nto even get a vote on something they care about.\n  So that is my observation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we do have a vote that needs to occur but \na final word here. I would just say that we want to get a budget \npassed, and I know the minority wants us to pass a budget. We have been \ntold that time and time again. We can't pass a budget if we are \nfilibustered by amendments for the rest of the night.\n  So I would urge all our colleagues to have this vote, and let's have \nsome discussions and see if we can come to a final conclusion.\n  With that, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, point of information.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. I would like to ask the distinguished budget chair \nthrough the Chair what delay or what conflict with any other event \ncould this possibly pose until at least 6 or 7 a.m.? I don't understand \nwhat delay that would cause, to allow more votes on amendments, or what \nconflict that could possibly pose with any other events, including \nairplane flights, at least until several hours from now. None of us \nwants to delay the process, and none of us wants to prevent a vote. \nClearly, that is not an issue for several hours. I would just ask that \nof the distinguished chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator from Washington \nwish to respond?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I can keep on standing all night. I am \nsure a number of Senators can. I do have respect for a number of our \nSenators here who may not be able to stand as long as some of us or who \nare elderly, and I would ask consideration of them. That is just my \nrequest.\n  With that, I do think we need to get to a vote here.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There has been a request for the \nyeas and nays.\n  Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient \nsecond.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S2307]]\n\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the order, the majority has \nthe next amendment.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have been working throughout the last \nvote. I am hoping we are getting to a very short list in the near \nfuture.\n  I recognize there are Senators who are frustrated and that want an \nopportunity to speak out. I know there are a number of Senators who are \nvery tired. Everybody's patience is wearing thin. I would just ask \neverybody to hold your patience for just a few more minutes. I am going \nto put us into a quorum call. I am hoping we can get an agreement and \ngive everybody some certainty.\n  I know on our side we want to get a budget passed. We have been \nworking for a great deal of time. We want to move this process forward. \nWe know there are Senators on the other side who may not agree with our \nbudget but agree with us that we have to move to a process to get our \ncountry back on track.\n  So I would ask everybody's patience for just a short while; \nhopefully, we can get this resolved and we can get a budget passed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator from Washington yield \nfor a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will hold the floor and yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield for a question with regard to \nthe possibility of us starting one of the votes that will probably be a \nrollcall vote, and let's get started on that while we work out the \nfurther details.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would be willing to get an amendment \ngoing, but I haven't seen it yet. I would like the ability to take a \nlook at it, so I suggest the absence of a quorum. It will only be for a \nvery few minutes--patience, please--and then we will come back in and \nsee if we can get to a vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am proud of our Senators for having \npatience for exactly 30 seconds.\n  I yield to the Senator from Idaho to offer an amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 318\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 318.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Crapo] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 318.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with \nfurther reading of the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To amend the reconciliation instruction to include \ninstructions to the Committee on Finance to achieve the Budget's stated \n         goal of $275 billion in mandatory health care savings)\n\n       On page 50, line 1, after the number ``$975,000,000,000'' \n     insert the following: ``and sufficient to reduce outlays by \n     $275,000,000,000''\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, there is now 2 \nminutes of debate.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in the budget that has been put forward, \nthere is a reconciliation instruction for almost $1 trillion of new \ntaxes. On the spending side there is, I think, a relatively modest \namount--not adequate--but there is an amount of health care savings in \nthe amount of $275 billion. Interestingly, that is not in a \nreconciliation instruction. We do not have the protection and \nassistance of a reconciliation instruction for the economy reforms that \nare in the budget but we do for the tax increases that are in the \nbudget which results in this interesting circumstance. The tax \nincreases by this budget would be guaranteed to occur because the \nfilibuster would be avoided through reconciliation, and the reforms of \nthe entitlement system would be guaranteed not to occur because they \nwould face a 60-vote margin, having been kept out of the reconciliation \ninstructions.\n  What this amendment does is it would put the health care savings in \nthe budget into a reconciliation instruction so we can at least start \ndown the path of dealing with reforms of our entitlement system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Let me thank the Senator from Idaho, who has been very \ninvolved in a lot of discussions over time in trying to manage us \ntoward a better place with our Federal debt and deficit. I understand \nhis dedication, but I oppose this amendment. Over the last several \nyears we have enacted $1.8 trillion in spending cuts on a bipartisan \nbasis.

SENSE OF SENATE ON UNDERUTILIZED FACILITIES OF THE \n                   NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION \n                   AND THEIR POTENTIAL USE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     (NASA) is the ninth largest real property holder of the \n     Federal Government, with more than 124,000 acres and more \n     than 4,900 buildings and other structures with a replacement \n     value of more than $30,000,000,000.\n       (2) The annual operation and maintenance costs of the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration have increased \n     steadily, and, as of 2012, the Administration has more than \n     $2,300,000,000 in annual deferred maintenance costs.\n       (3) According to Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the \n     Administration continues to retain real property that is \n     underutilized, does not have identified future mission uses, \n     or is duplicative of other assets in its real property \n     inventory.\n       (4) The Office of Inspector General, the Government \n     Accountability Office (GAO), and Congress have identified the \n     aging and duplicative infrastructure of the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration as a high priority and \n     longstanding management challenge.\n       (5) In the NASA Authorization Act of 2010, Congress \n     directed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to \n     examine its real property assets and downsize to fit current \n     and future missions and expected funding levels, paying \n     particular attention to identifying and removing unneeded or \n     duplicative infrastructure.\n       (6) The Office of Inspector General found at least 33 \n     facilities, including wind tunnels, test stands, airfields, \n     and launch infrastructure, that were underutilized or for \n     which National Aeronautics and Space Administration managers \n     could not identify a future mission use and that the need for \n     these facilities have declined in recent years as a result of \n     changes in the mission focus of the Administration, the \n     condition and obsolescence of some facilities, and the advent \n     of alternative testing methods.\n       (7) The Office of Inspector General found that the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration has taken steps to \n     minimize the costs of continuing to maintain some of these \n     facilities by placing them in an inactive state or leasing \n     them to other parties.\n       (8) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has a \n     series of initiatives underway that, in the judgment of the \n     Office of Inspector General, are ``positive steps towards \n     `rightsizing' its real property footprint'', and the Office \n     of Inspector General has concluded that ``it is imperative \n     that NASA move forward aggressively with its infrastructure \n     reduction efforts''.\n       (9) Existing and emerging United States commercial launch \n     and exploration capabilities are providing cargo \n     transportation to the International Space Station and offer \n     the potential for providing crew support, access to the \n     International Space Station, and missions to low Earth orbit \n     while the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     focuses its efforts on heavy-lift capabilities and deep space \n     missions.\n       (10) National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     facilities and property that are underutilized, duplicative, \n     or no longer needed for Administration requirements could be \n     utilized by commercial users and State and local entities, \n     resulting in savings for the Administration and a reduction \n     in the burden of the Federal Government to fund space \n     operations.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the levels in this concurrent resolution assume--\n       (1) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     should move forward with plans to reduce its infrastructure \n     and, to the greatest extent practicable, make property \n     available for lease to a government or private tenant;\n       (2) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     should pursue opportunities for streamlined sale or lease of \n     property and facilities, including for exclusive use, to a \n     private entity, or expedited conveyance or transfer to a \n     State or political subdivision, municipality, instrumentality \n     of a State, or Department of Transportation-licensed launch \n     site operators for the promotion of commercial or scientific \n     space activity and for developing and operating space launch \n     facilities; and\n       (3) leasing or transferring underutilized facilities and \n     properties to commercial space entities or State or local \n     governments will reduce operation and maintenance costs for \n     the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, save money \n     for the Federal Government, and promote commercial space and \n     the exploration goals of the Administration and the United \n     States.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 348\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to prevent \n restrictions to public access to fishing downstream of dams owned by \n                        the Corps of Engineers)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3__.

I am now going to ask for unanimous consent for a number \nof amendments to get to final passage. I would say to all Senators that \nwe are going to have a number of votes. We would like to tell everyone \nto sit in your seat. We will get through these faster if we can have \nthe rollcalls and be done quickly. So I encourage everyone to be in \nthis room.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that on the next \nblock of amendments--we have talked to everybody who was talkable--we \nwould vote from our desks. There would be no recapping of the votes by \nthe tally clerks, and that they be 7 1/2-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the leader. I think it has \nreal potential. There still would be some votes that could go by voice \nvote, we would hope. But if we do this pressure in this way I think it \nwould speed up things. I thank the leader for that suggestion. I have \nheard it from our side for a while. I think it is a good idea.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\namendments nos. 184, 382, 526, 338, 471, 702, 673, 521, 414, 416, 709, \n                       154, 710, and 139, en bloc\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the next amendments in \norder to be called up be the following: Barrasso No. 184, Paul No. 382, \nVitter No. 526, Vitter No. 338, Cruz No. 471, Cruz No. 702, Lee No. \n673, Lee No. 521, Coburn No. 414, Coburn No. 416, Coburn No. 709, \nPortman No. 154, Leahy No. 710, a side-by-side to Senator Inhofe's No. \n139, and Inhofe No. 139; that there be no second-degree amendments \nprior to votes in relation to any of those amendments; that none of the \namendments be divisible; that notwithstanding all time having expired \nunder the resolution, there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each \nvote, and that all votes be 10-minute votes; that upon disposition of \nthe Inhofe amendment No. 139, the Senate proceed immediately to vote on \nadoption of S. Con. Res. 8, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Reserving the right to object, I will not object, but I \ndo want our colleagues to understand that some of these amendments the \nchairwoman just asked to be put in order are incredibly fundamental \nimportant foreign policy issues that you do not do at 3 in the morning \nand change the dynamics of the Middle East, and change the dynamics of \nour national security and interests in international organizations.\n  That is what some of these amendments will do. You do not do it in a \nbudget process, you do it through regular order in a committee that \nultimately can hear both sides as we have succeeded so far this session \nin a very bipartisan way. So I will not object because of the \nchairwoman's effort to get us to a conclusion. But I will be urging all \nof our colleagues to oppose all of those amendments because this is \nforeign policy on the fly. It is dangerous. We send very important \nmessages when we cast votes in certain ways that can affect the balance \nof stability in the Middle East, that can affect our relationships \nacross the world, that can affect our effectiveness in institutions \nthat we need at the end of the day to promote our national security, \nour national interests.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I would hope that we would defeat these \namendments. If there is no objection----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. We will then move to these amendments. Again, all \nSenators sit in your seats and vote. We will get through these as \nquickly as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I have an inquiry. I would like to make a unanimous consent \nrequest that we be able to use our electronic devices while we are \nsitting at our desks on the floor so that we might get any \ncommunication that we need from our staff, and also so we can be \nproductive.\n  Mr. REID.

There is now 2 minutes equally \ndivided prior to a vote.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, in 2010, President Obama set forth a \ngoal of doubling our Nation's exports in 5 years. Three years later we \nare not on the pace to achieve that goal. One problem is the EPA is \nblocking exports. EPA is blocking exports on account of the greenhouse \ngas emissions those exports would produce outside of the United States; \nthat is after they leave our shores.\n  This is a dangerous precedent. It will hurt exports of automobiles, \naircraft, and heavy equipment such as tractors. This amendment \nprohibits Federal agencies from blocking exports on account of \ngreenhouse gas emissions those exports would produce after they leave \nthe United States.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, before we go to the yeas and nays, can I \njust say, in setting an example for the evening, I will be less than 1 \nminute. We believe this is current law. We will accept a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays were already ordered on this \namendment. Does the Senator from Wyoming seek recognition?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. A voice vote will be acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the yeas and nays are \nvitiated.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 184) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 382\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. On behalf of Senator McConnell and myself, I have to \nintroduce this amendment to create a bridges fund. We have done \nconsiderable nation building abroad. I think it is time we do some \nnation building at home.\n  We have two bridges in our State, Brent Spence as well as the Sherman \nMinton Bridge, that need to be repaired and replaced. We do not have \nenough money in our highway trust fund. This would create a new bridges \nfund. It would come from money we are currently sending overseas to \nbuild bridges overseas. So it would bring foreign aid money back home \nto the United States where it is needed. It would also take some money \nfrom the Department of Energy loans, which I think can be more useful \nat home to build bridges.\n  So I urge adoption of this amendment which would allow a new creation \nof a bridges fund, which I think our country desperately needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senate budget resolution that is in front of us, \nthat we are hoping to get passed tonight, provides strong investments \nin transportation infrastructure. It fully funds MAP-21, the recent \nhighway bill. It provides $50 billion for urgent transportation needs \nand another $10 billion for an infrastructure bank.\n  We could put more funding toward transportation projects and fund \nsome good projects but not without making cuts to other vital programs. \nThe amendment before us will make unnecessary and deep cuts to foreign \naid and energy programs. I oppose this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Without objection, there is 2 minutes equally \ndivided prior to a vote on amendment No. 526 offered by Mr. Vitter.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment would require photo IDs to \nparticipate in Federal elections, which is allowed now by States. \nHowever, the Justice Department is trying to virtually shut down this \npractice unreasonably by opposing it in many States. This would be a \nclarification to mandate the Federal IDs, just as we do in many other \nless consequential acts such as air travel.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Voter photo identification laws are overly burdensome \nand have the ability to disenfranchise voters. We should not attempt to \nimplement these policies nationwide, especially at 3:15 in the morning \non a budget resolution.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Access to a telephone is beneficial for anyone trying to \nget a job or attempting to communicate with their family or receiving \nhelp in an emergency. Since 1985, the Lifeline Program has made it \neasier for low-income Americans to have a phone by providing a small \nmonthly subsidy toward basic service.

There is 2 minutes equally divided prior to \nthe vote on amendment No. 471 offered by Mr. Cruz.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, this amendment would create a deficit-\nneutral reserve fund to reduce foreign assistance to Egypt and to \nincrease funding for an east coast missile defense shield.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, the Secretary of State announced he had freed an \nadditional $250 million in an unconditional economic support fund for \nthe Government of Egypt. This was in the midst of the sequester and at \nthe same time the American people were told there were insufficient \nfunds to pay for police officers, firefighters and teachers, and even \nWhite House tours.\n  All of us are concerned about the situation in Egypt--a nation that, \namong other things, has repeatedly turned a blind eye to the abuse of \nwomen and to the persecution of Christians.\n  Last week the European Union threatened to hold its 5 million euro \npledge of economic aid to Egypt absent meaningful reforms. We should do \nat least as well as the EU. This amendment would reduce, in an \nunspecified amount, the foreign aid to Egypt and allow that money to be \nput to vital national security ends here at home; namely, missile \ndefense.\n  I ask the amendment be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield my time to the Senator from New \nJersey, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, that money the Senator referred to was \nmoney that was already existing and it was at a critical time.\n  The United States and Egypt have a longstanding security relationship \nthat is vital to the stability of the Middle East and the security of \nthe region. Our aid to Egypt is tied directly to the Camp David Accord \nwhich has acted to stabilize the Middle East and has helped to serve \nAmerica and Israel's security for the past 35 years. It is vital and it \ncan't be put at risk.\n  We also have significant interests in Egypt in countering terrorism, \naddressing the deteriorating security in the Sinai, and maintaining \npreferential access to the Suez Canal.\n  We cannot give the Egyptian leaders a blank check, but we also cannot \nhave a collapse of the Egyptian economy which Israel would face the \nimmediate consequences of.\n  This is the type of amendment that does not consider the checks and \nbalances necessary and the complexities of the issue, which we will \nhandle in the committee.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment would create a budget point \nof order prohibiting any measure that provides taxpayer funds to the \nUnited Nations while any member nation forces citizens to undergo \ninvoluntary abortions.\n  I recognize Members of this body have differing views on the right to \nlife, but surely all of us can be agreed that for a woman to be forced \nagainst her will to abort her child is a horrific evil. Yet the world \nwas shocked when photographs surfaced last year of 23-year-old Feng \nJianmei and her aborted child.\n  China recently acknowledged under its one-child policy it has carried \nout 336 million abortions, more than the entire population of the \nUnited States. Those are 336 million lives that never breathed a breath \nof life on this Earth.\n  In 1997, the House passed a Forced Abortion Condemnation Act that, \nunfortunately, died in the Senate. This body should condemn that \npolicy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield my time to the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, no one--no one--in this body supports \nforced abortions. No one. However, the United Nations has no authority \nto control the acts of any individual nation.\n  Instead of punishing the country that is carrying out the bad policy, \nthis amendment would go after an entity that has no control over the \npolicy and all the while negatively impacting our national interests \nbecause it takes away all funding to the United Nations if such a \nmember country is engaged in such acts. It would impact funding for \npeacekeeping operations in the Golan Heights, in Darfur, in Congo; \nfunding for Syrian refugees, which now exceeds 1 million and is \nthreatening the political and economic instability of Jordan and \nLebanon; funding to the International Atomic Energy Agency that we need \nto go after Iran.\n  These are all reasons this amendment should be voted against.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program was \nestablished to compensate local taxing authorities, such as counties, \nfor the tax revenue lost due to the presence of Federal public land. \nUnfortunately, the funding for this program has never been offered to \nthe degree necessary that it would, in fact, offset this revenue. In \nStates such as mine, where most of the land is owned by the Federal \nGovernment, this is a big problem because our taxing authorities are \nnot able to get the revenue they need from this land. As a result, \nprograms ranging from public education to fire and safety programs--the \nbasic services of government--are not able to be met because of \ninadequate revenue.\n  This amendment seeks to ensure that funding for the Payments in Lieu \nof Taxes Program is at least roughly equivalent to the actual lost \nproperty tax revenues due to the presence of Federal public land. I \nurge each of my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. We will take this on a voice vote.\n  Mr. LEE.

The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, with a lot of consternation, we are \nworried about how the sequester affects everybody--the Defense \nDepartment and all the other agencies. But in fact the Pentagon spends \n$67 billion on things that have absolutely nothing to do with defense. \nAll we will be doing is creating a deficit-neutral reserve fund to move \nthis nondefense spending--either move it or eliminate it from the \nDefense Department.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is important to reduce wasteful \nspending and ensure all Federal funding is spent efficiently and \neffectively.

There is 2 minutes equally divided prior to a \nvote on amendment No. 709, offered by Mr. Coburn.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, 3\\1/2\\ years ago we instructed the GAO to \ntell us where the government problems were, what are the government \nprograms, and where was there duplication. We have yet to pass one \npiece of legislation that would eliminate any of the duplication in the \nFederal Government--not one. What this does is combine 17 different \namendments that I had offered on this budget to create a deficit-\nneutral reserve fund to cause us--to force us--to look at all these \nprograms by area and consolidate them.\n  What this amendment would do, very specifically--it doesn't say you \neliminate; it says you consolidate. You get efficiency, you get \neffectiveness, and you look to make sure when we are spending tax \ndollars that they are actually accomplishing something and they are \ndoing it in the most efficient and effective ways.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The budget already includes a deficit reduction reserve \nfund for the elimination, consolidation, and reform of Federal programs \nto achieve savings. Our budget goes even further to instruct committees \nto review the GAO report on duplication and asks committees to use this \ninformation to reduce overlap and identify efficiencies. The budget \ndoes not single out individual programs because we believe that sorting \nthrough duplication should be the role of our authorizing committees. \nThat is why we have specifically instructed committees to review GAO's \nfindings on duplication in their high-risk list.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to a vote in \nrelation to amendment No. 154, offered by Mr. Portman.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, this should be an easy one. It is simply \nan amendment that says that here in the Senate we should have better \ninformation to be able to legislate better. By the way, it is \ninformation that the House of Representatives already has. Surely we \nwould want to have the same information in the Senate that the House of \nRepresentatives as they pursue tax reform.\n  This says the Congressional Budget Office should provide the Joint \nTax Committee macroeconomic analysis of tax reform. It only applies to \ntax bills over a certain amount, $5 billion a year. I worked with the \nJoint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office to \nensure this would not require more work because the analysis is already \ndone, but it is not provided to us.\n  Under a 2003 rule in the House, it is provided to the Ways and Means \nCommittee. It is required to be provided but not to us. We heard a lot \nof discussion over the last several days about the need for tax \nreform--Democrats and Republicans agree on that--and we agree it ought \nto be progrowth. The President called for it. This would enable us to \nlegislate more wisely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield to the Chair of the Finance Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the amendment requires something called \ndynamic scoring. The Joint Committee on Tax, which provides us with \ninformation on how to score revenue measures, uses conventional \nscoring, and has been doing this for years and years. And they do \nutilize the secondary effects when they do conventional scoring.\n  Dynamic scoring goes many steps farther. It tries to dissipate the \nmacroeconomic effect down the road, which is basically what Ben \nBernanke does. It is very difficult and arbitrary and very hard to do. \nIt would cause great swings. It may be close to the mark, it may be off \nthe mark.\n  In addition, this amendment required dynamic scoring only with \nrespect to revenue measures, but not required with respect to spending \nmeasures. When CBO does spending, they use conventional scoring. I \nmight also say that in the footnote, the Joint Committee on Tax already \ngives its best guess of what the dynamic scoring would be, although \nthat is not the numbers they use when they try to estimate the revenue \neffect.\n  I think it would be a big mistake to do that at this time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to a vote in \nrelation to amendment No. 710 offered by Mr. Leahy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this amendment is very clear, and it \nanticipates another amendment coming up by another Senator. The United \nStates negotiates treaties, for example, the Arms Trade Treaty. But \nunder the Supreme Court, Reid v. Covert, 1956, our Constitution trumps \nany agreement made in a treaty by our government.\n  So all my amendment does is make clear that the United States should \nnot agree to any arms trade treaty that would violate our second \namendment rights. It is straightforward, it respects our constitutional \nrights, but it also gives our government the flexibility it needs to \nnegotiate treaties.\n  I would be happy with a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think this is a good amendment. I want \nto make it very clear that this has nothing to do with my amendment No. \n139, which comes up next. This is merely talking about negotiating \ntreaties. Mine is about opposing second amendment rights.\n  I have no objection to taking this by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 710) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 525\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, before going to the next amendment, I \nhave one unanimous consent request. Senator Sessions and I have been \nable to clear Durbin-Moran amendment No. 525. I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 525) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 525\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to increase \n             funding for the National Institutes of Health)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3__.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes equally divided in the usual form prior to our final vote on \namendment No. 139 offered by Mr. Inhofe.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I want to make sure that everyone \nunderstands what the United Nations trade treaty is. The trade treaty \nis a treaty that cedes our authority to have trade agreements with our \nallies in terms of trading arms.\n  I want to very briefly read this so nobody over there or over here \nmisunderstands what this amendment does. This is right out of the \namendment. Uphold the second amendment rights, that is one thing. And \nsecondly, prevent the United States from entering into the United \nNations arms trade treaties.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield to the Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are presently negotiating an arms trade \ntreaty which will help to keep illicit firearms out of the hands of war \ncriminals and terrorists. It is a humanitarian issue. We have people \nsuch as Joseph Kony who is out murdering children. He is able to do it \nbecause he is taking part in the international arms trade. We are \ntrying to stop those things.\n  My earlier amendment makes it very clear, we cannot trump our own \nsecond-amendment rights, but we can stop these children from being \nkilled because of this, and that is why I oppose the Inhofe \namendment. Let our negotiators negotiate. Any treaty still has to come \nback here to get a two-thirds vote anyway.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 18 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, the idea that we would have \nto go to the international body to decide whether we would trade arms \nwith Israel is pretty disgusting. I want to make sure everyone \nunderstands. This is the first time--probably the last time this year \nthat we are going to have a chance, an opportunity to vote for our \nsecond amendment rights. I think my colleagues should take advantage of \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, first of all, over the last two decades the \naverage budget resolution considered 78 amendments. We have done 101. \nThe average vote-arama is 35 amendments. We have done 70--twice as \nmany. Doing this has been a Herculean feat, but it has been done by the \nleadership of Senator Murray, with Senator Sessions. I think we all \nshould recognize how hard this has been for Senator Murray.\n  (Senators applauding.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, of course. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Murray, \nSenator Sessions, and the majority leader for conducting an open and \ncomplete and full debate. I know everyone is exhausted, and people may \nnot feel it at the moment, but this is one of the Senate's finest days \nin recent years, and I commend everyone who has participated in this \nextraordinary debate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we don't have to have a quorum call. We are \nnot going to be voting from our desks, so everybody can go back to \nregular disorder.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I also would like to thank the staff. \nMy group is here. And I say to Senator Murray, your team is fabulous.\n  We work hard on bills that come through the Senate, and there are a \nlot of challenges. But few are bigger than this, with all these \namendments--hundreds of them that came through--and it was a real \nchallenge.\n  I congratulate the staff, I congratulate the Senator's team, and I \nhope we can continue to have good relations as we go forward and work \ntogether.\n  I would mention Marcus Peacock, my staff director, who was fabulous. \nHe enjoyed every minute of this. I asked him how he was doing, and he \nsaid: I am going to be sorry tomorrow when it is over. But maybe that \nis a sign of sickness. I do not know.\n  I want to express my appreciation to my staff: Dan Kowalski, Bill \nBeach, Greg D'Angelo, Gene Emmans, George Everly, Matt Giroux, Brittany \nGodwin, Tori Gorman, Graham Hixon, Andrew Herther, Chris Jackson, Cari \nKelly, Joseph McCormack, Greg McNeill, Carlton Milsap, Marcus Peacock, \nKim Proctor, John Selden, William Smith, Paul Winfree, Stephen Miller, \nAndrew Logan, Garrett Murch, and Katie Moses.

Mr. President, three years ago tomorrow, President Obama \nsigned into law the Affordable Care Act. This landmark law will extend \nhealth insurance coverage to millions of uninsured Americans when the \nreforms are fully implemented next year. Getting to this point has been \nan arduous process. But in the end, this achievement proved that real \nreform is possible, and that the voices of so many Americans who over \nthe years have called on their leaders to act have finally been heard.\n  Since its passage, Americans have seen the immediate benefits of the \nAffordable Care Act and 3 years later, those improvements continue. \nSeniors on Medicare who have high-cost prescriptions are continuing to \nreceive help when trapped within the coverage gap known as the doughnut \nhole. The Affordable Care Act completely closes the coverage gap by \n2020, and the new law makes it easier for seniors to afford \nprescription drugs in the meantime. In 2010, more than 7,000 Vermonters \nreceived a $250 rebate to help cover the cost of their prescription \ndrugs when they hit the doughnut hole. Last year alone, nearly 6,400 \nVermonters with Medicare received a 50-percent discount on their \ncovered brand-name prescriptions, resulting in an average savings of \n$765 per person. Since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, \nmore than 5,000 young adults in Vermont have gained health insurance \ncoverage under these reforms, which allow young adults to stay on their \nparents' plans until their 26th birthdays. The improvements we are \nseeing in Vermont go on and on: in 2011 and 2012, 71 million Americans \nand 151,000 Vermonters with private insurance gained access to and \nreceived preventative screening coverage with no deductible or copay, \nincluding more than 80,000 Medicare beneficiaries. These are just a few \nof the dozens of consumer protections included in the law that are \nbenefiting Vermonters and all Americans every day, and in many ways.\n  The law goes into full swing next year as even more consumer \nprotections are implemented and millions more Americans gain access to \nhealth insurance coverage. Beginning in January, insurance companies \nwill no longer be allowed to deny coverage to individuals with \npreexisting health conditions or to charge higher premiums based on \nhealth status or gender. Unfortunately, estimates show that 44,000 \nVermonters currently do not have health insurance, but with the \nMedicaid expansion contained in the Affordable Care Act, 84 percent of \nthese Vermonters will qualify for Medicaid or a premium tax credit. \nAlso important to Vermonters, to assist Vermont with our State's work \non implementing Vermont's State-based health insurance exchange--or \nmarketplace--Vermont has received more than $125,000,000 in grants for \nresearch and for information technology development, as well as almost \n$3,480,000 for maternal health programs. These tangible initiatives \nhelp at-risk families gain the support they need to improve their \nchildren's health and ability to learn, and they help prevent child \nabuse.\n  I was proud as well to work with Senator Grassley and others to \ninclude strong anti-fraud provisions in the law that already have \nhelped prevent and detect fraudulent activities that in the past have \ncost American taxpayers multiple millions of dollars each year. Thanks \nin part to these efforts, $4.2 billion was returned to taxpayers last \nyear alone.\n  In only 3 years, Vermonters across our State have seen the many \nbenefits of health care reform unfold in their lives. I see and hear \nabout these improvements and pocketbook savings in visits to every \ncorner of our State. At home in Middlesex and throughout Vermont, \nwhether I am in the grocery store, at the gas pump, or at church, I am \nconstantly reminded of how important access to quality affordable \nhealth care is to individuals and families. I applaud Vermont's efforts \nto expand the Affordable Care Act's reach even further to help every \nresident secure health insurance. I am proud that the Affordable Care \nAct offers Vermont the foundation it needs to reach this goal, and I \nlook forward to working to see that it is met.\n  Regrettably, opponents of the Affordable Care Act continue to \nmisleadingly attack the law in an attempt to undermine its \nimplementation. The moment President Obama signed this bill into law, \nopponents sought to continue their political battle by challenging the \nlandmark legislation in the courts. With the legal challenges now \nnearly resolved, we are now seeing amendments filed to every bill we \nconsider on the floor, aimed at repealing or gutting the Affordable \nCare Act. In fact, on the budget resolution we are considering today, \ndozens of amendments have been filed in an effort to block the \nAffordable Care Act's implementation, to undermine its success in \nmaking lives better across the land, or to repeal the law completely. \nThis is unfortunate, it is shortsighted, and it is cynical. Even more \nshameful is the budget resolution considered and passed by the House \nthis week. The House-passed budget would make drastic changes to the \nMedicaid Program causing 14 to 20 million Americans to lose health \ncoverage; it would replace Medicare with a voucher scheme costing \nseniors at least $6000 more per year; and would completely repeal all \nthe consumer protections included in the Affordable Care Act.\n  The Affordable Care Act is not perfect, but in the true interests of \nthe\n\n[[Page S2321]]\n\npeople we represent we should be working together to ensure its \nsuccess. We can make improvements where necessary, but we must allow \nfull implementation to continue. Already the Affordable Care Act has \nchanged so many lives for the better, and we must not turn our backs on \nthe millions more who will have access to health care next year because \nof these reforms.\n  The Affordable Care Act is a tremendous achievement that will improve \nthe lives of Americans for generations to come. This anniversary is a \ntime to renew our commitment to completing this important work on \nbehalf of the American people, who are counting on us to do the right \nthing. With each year that we move forward to implement the features of \nthis landmark health care reform law, the stories of families not being \nable to gain access to affordable coverage are becoming fewer and fewer \nand are being replaced by stories of the success of these reforms, one \nfamily at a time, all across Vermont and all across America. I look \nforward to continuing to work with Vermont and with the administration \nas the law moves forward in its fourth year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/22/senate-section/article/S2321-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BRATTLEBORO REFORMER CENTENNIAL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in visiting with fellow Vermonters in and \naround Brattleboro in southern Vermont last weekend, I appreciated the \nopportunity to be in town during the month The Brattleboro Reformer \nmarked its centennial anniversary. Local newspapers serve their \ncommunities in so many vital ways, and we in Vermont are blessed to \nhave so many that have endured and served for so long.\n  These are challenging times for newspapers, as newsrooms and \npublishers adapt to rapidly changing technologies and public \npreferences. The Brattleboro Reformer has been quick on its feet to \nmeet these challenges. I join with all Vermonters in congratulating The \nReformer's hard-working staff on this historic anniversary, and we wish \nthem many more.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a recent news \narticle about this milestone.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   The Brattleboro Reformer Turns 100\n\n               [From the Vermont Digger, March 10, 2013]\n\n                        (By Randolph T. Holhut)\n\n       BRATTLEBORO--The Brattleboro Reformer celebrated its 100th \n     anniversary as a daily newspaper with cake, coffee, and an \n     open house for well-wishers on March 1.\n       For Publisher Ed Woods, the fact that a small town in \n     Vermont has held on to its daily newspaper while other major \n     cities have seen their daily papers cut back in publishing \n     frequency, or close down altogether, is a testament to the \n     uniqueness of Windham County.\n       ``Southern Vermont is different from the rest of the \n     country,'' said Woods, who has been the Reformer's publisher \n     since 2008. ``We're providing news and information in the way \n     that our customers request it.''\n       That means delivering a paper-and-ink edition of the \n     Reformer every day but Sunday, while gradually building up an \n     audience that wants its news online.\n       According to the most recent circulation figures for the \n     Reformer by the Audit Bureau of Circulations, the paper's \n     total average daily circulation was 6,756 print editions and \n     1,093 digital editions, or a total of 7,849 as of March 31, \n     2012.\n       For the Saturday Weekend Reformer, circulation was 8,155 \n     print and 1,091 digital for a total of 9,246.\n       By comparison, in the March 31, 2007, report, total average \n     circulation was 9,684 on weekdays and 10,709 on Saturdays.\n       Although print circulation is down, Executive Editor Tom \n     D'Errico is quick to point out that the digital reach of the \n     paper is growing.\n       The paper currently has 6,000 followers of its Facebook \n     page, which D'Errico said it is using as a breaking news site \n     that complements www.Reformer.com, and there are 1,200 \n     subscribers to the paper's Twitter feed.\n       ``These things didn't exist for us two and a half years \n     ago,'' said Woods. ``Social media is bringing our news to a \n     new audience. The transition to digital is going to happen, \n     but it's going to happen more slowly here.'' He cited the \n     slow progress of bringing universal broadband coverage to \n     southern Vermont, and the older population of the county that \n     still prefers a paper-and-ink news source.\n       D'Errico, who became the managing editor of the Reformer in \n     2007, said that social media--Facebook, Twitter, and the \n     like--has become critical to the way his paper gathers and \n     disseminates the news. ``That's how people tip us off to \n     stories now,'' he said. ``It's easy and instantaneous, \n     compared to email or a phone call.''\n       And, with a newsroom that is smaller than it used to be, it \n     allows the four full-time reporters to cover more ground than \n     before.\n\n\n                              Long history\n\n       Although the Reformer published its first daily edition on \n     March 3, 1913, the paper had long history prior to that date.\n       Charles Davenport, a stalwart Democrat, started The Windham \n     County Reformer in 1876 as a weekly paper to counter what \n     Davenport believed was the pro-Republican bias of The Vermont \n     Phoenix--then the dominant weekly newspaper in Brattleboro.\n       Howard C. Rice bought an interest in the paper from \n     Davenport in 1905, and two years later, moved it into the \n     American Building on Main Street--the Reformer's home for the \n     next seven decades until it moved to its present location on \n     Black Mountain Road in October 1981.\n       Few had faith that Brattleboro could support its own daily \n     paper, but Rice eventually convinced Windham County that it \n     could consume its news in daily bites, and like it. That \n     began in 1913, when the Phoenix and Reformer merged. The \n     Phoenix continued as the weekly edition of the Reformer until \n     it was discontinued in 1955. By that point, the daily \n     Reformer's circulation had grown from less than 2,500 to more \n     than 7,000.\n       Rice stepped down as editor and publisher in 1950 and was \n     succeeded by John S. Hooper. The Rice family continued to own \n     the paper until 1966, when it was purchased by the Miller \n     family, owners of The Berkshire Eagle in Pittsfield, Mass.\n       Under the Millers, the changes came fast and frequent. \n     Offset printing was introduced in 1969, and molten lead and \n     Linotypes gave way to computerized typesetting and paste-up. \n     Typewriters gave way to video display terminals in the late \n     1970s. The biggest change of all, besides the move to the new \n     plant off Putney Road, was the switch from afternoon to \n     morning publication in 1982.\n       All of these changes were overseen by Norman Runnion, who \n     started at the Reformer as Hooper's assistant in 1969 and \n     became the managing editor in 1971.\n       By the time the Reformer celebrated its 75th anniversary as \n     a daily in 1988, circulation had grown to more than 10,000. \n     Runnion retired two years later, leaving a legacy of building \n     what former Boston Globe editor Tom Winship once called the \n     best small newspaper in New England.\n       But the next big change came in 1995, when the Miller \n     family sold the paper to Denver-based MediaNews Group (MNG), \n     ending more than eight decades of local ownership.\n\n\n                          Change is constant.\n\n       In the years since the sale of the paper to MediaNews \n     Group, the paper has made the change from analog to digital, \n     in the design of its news pages as well as its photography.\n       Delivery of the news changed also. The World Wide Web went \n     from a curiosity to a disruptive force in publishing in the \n     space of a decade, and papers large and small have scrambled \n     to keep up.\n       Meanwhile, MNG acquired the Town Crier family of free \n     weeklies in the late 1990s, and expanded the Black Mountain \n     Road plant to accommodate their new purchase. They also \n     bought the Original Vermont Observer, another weekly, in the \n     mid-2000s. The papers were ultimately merged into one weekly, \n     and were discontinued in 2012.\n       But for all the turmoil of a changing industry, and \n     changing economics, the Reformer endures. With MNG joining \n     the Journal Register Company to form Digital First Media in \n     2011, there has been a greater emphasis on transforming the \n     two newspaper companies into one online media company.\n       ``John Paton [the CEO of Digital First] has brought to us a \n     business model to make the transition to digital media,'' \n     said Woods. ``We are beginning to see the resources arrive \n     here to make that transition. Our mission to provide the news \n     hasn't changed, just the way we deliver the news.''\n       And both Woods and D'Errico say they have come to realize \n     what a humbling experience it is to run a newspaper that \n     people still feel passionate about, and are quick to offer an \n     opinion about.\n       ``A lot is changing in this industry, and it is impossible \n     not to embrace the change,'' said Woods. ``But our core \n     responsibility is not changing at all.''\n       ``Small-town newspapers offer something that can't be found \n     anywhere else,'' said D'Errico. ``While big city newspapers \n     are struggling, our focus on local news makes us as valuable \n     today as we were in 1913.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/22/senate-section/article/S2321-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2321-S2322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PATUXENT RIVER NAVAL AIR STATION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the 70th anniversary of \nthe commissioning of Naval Air Station, NAS, Patuxent River. On April \n1, 1943 the base was commissioned and the Navy Department issued the \nfollowing press release:\n  ``Naval Air Station, Patuxent, situated on a 6,500-acre tract at \nCedar Point, Maryland, was commissioned today with Rear Admiral John S. \nMcCain, U.S.N., Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics; Rear Admiral F. L. \nReichmuth, U.S.N., Commandant of the Potomac River Naval Command, and \nRepresentative Landsdale G. Sasscer of Maryland speaking at the \ncommissioning exercises.\n\n[[Page S2322]]\n\n  The commissioning address was made by Rear Admiral Reichmuth who \nturned the situation over to Commander William T. Rassieur, U.S.N., of \n1429 South Westmoreland Avenue, Los Angeles, California.\n  Naval Air Station, Patuxent, will be one of the finest and largest \nNavy aviation establishments in the East when construction work is \ncompleted. It will combine and concentrate flying and operating aspects \nof experimental work previously conducted at Naval Air Station, \nAnacostia, and Norfolk, and at the Naval Aircraft Factory, \nPhiladelphia. It will serve also as the East Coast terminal for Naval \nAir Transport Service, now located at Norfolk.\n  The new station is 60 airline miles southeast of Washington, D.C. Six \nthousand people have been employed constructing the station, beginning \nwork on March 1, 1942.\n  Facilities for both land and seaplanes have been installed, while \ndocks also have been constructed for vessels which will handle freight \nin connection with activities of the air transport unit.\n  In addition to seaplane ramps, the field has three runways for land \nplane. The largest is 10,000 feet in length and 500 feet wide, while \nthe remaining two are 6,000 feet long and 300 feet wide. Four hangars \nfor all types of planes are among the 45 buildings of the station.\n  When fully staffed the station will have several thousand officers \nand men.''\n  Mr. President, as noted earlier in the Navy's press release, my \nGrandfather then Rear Admiral McCain, was a speaker at the \ncommissioning in 1943. In his speech he said, ``I have every reason to \nexpect that under your expert guidance this work will be done more \nrapidly and more efficiently, and that it will rapidly increase in \nscope and its effectiveness, as it must do for naval aviation to meet \nits present problems and to hold its proper place as an outstanding \nmajor air service of the world.''\n  Mr. President, today NAS Patuxent River, commonly referred to as Pax \nRiver, hosts over 17,000 people, including active-duty servicemembers, \ncivil-service employees, defense contractor employees, and military \ndependents. NAS Patuxent River is home to the Naval Air Systems \nCommand, NAVAIR, Headquarters, Air Test Wing Atlantic, U.S. Naval Test \nPilot School, Scientific Development Squadron 1, Air Test and \nEvaluation Squadron 20, Rotary Wing Test Squadron 21, and Air Test and \nEvaluation Squadron 23.\n  For nearly 70 years, the dedicated men and women of NAS Pax River \nhave made the impossible possible, turning theory into experiment and \nexperiment into operational capability. The dedicated and skilled \nworkforce of NAS Patuxent River has made innumerable contributions to \nthe aerospace industry, the Naval Aviation Enterprise, and the economic \nand national security of the United States. Their attention to detail \nis directly reflected in the record of excellence of United States \nNaval Aviation. During both war and peace their meticulous and exacting \nwork to support the defense of our Nation has continued, ensuring, as \nmy grandfather expected, that naval aviation meets its present problems \nand holds its proper place as an outstanding major air service of the \nworld.\n  While the historic sites, natural resources, and technology contained \nwithin its gates make it a unique destination; it is undoubtedly the \npeople of Naval Air Station Patuxent River and their distinguished \nservice that make it an irreplaceable National asset. On April 1, 2013, \nthey will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the base commissioning. In \nrecognition of this major milestone I wish them continued success in \ntheir future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/22/senate-section/article/S2322-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2322-S2323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING CASSANDRA WOODS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier this month, I, my staff, and the \nentire State of Michigan lost someone very special. Cassandra Woods, my \nlongtime State staff director, passed away after fighting cancer for \ntwo decades.\n  Cassandra Woods was one of the most extraordinary people I have ever \nknown.\n  She became the heart and soul of my Michigan offices. After beginning \nas an intern more than 30 years ago, she served as my State director \nfor the last 12. She led a staff of 25 in 7 offices around the State \ninto becoming a cohesive team serving the public.\n  In countless efforts to bring growth and hope to our people, she \npressed forward and never wavered--from riverfront projects, to M-1 \nRail on Woodward Avenue, to Focus:HOPE, to our effort to bring a \nbaseball academy for kids adjacent to the old Tiger Stadium field, and \noh so much more in so many places around our state.\n  She was an invaluable source of advice and counsel to me and to my \nWashington staff. She represented me at public events and in meetings \nwith State and local officials. All the while, she kept adding her \nenergy and her way of looking at life to her own personal missions.\n  Cassandra brought to her family and to our community her unique \ncombination of great inner strength and an outward gentleness, an iron \nwill with a smiling demeanor, a way of being direct and blunt in an \nengaging and positive way, imparting tough love and discipline with \ncompassion and almost always with that wonderful laugh of hers.\n  Cassandra's legendary courage in her two-decade battle with cancer \nand the way she inspired others to take on that adversity with fierce \ncalm left an indelible impact on the countless people whom she lifted \nup.\n  I am fortunate enough in my job to meet some incredibly brave people. \nI have traveled many times to Afghanistan and other places where \nAmerican troops are in harm's way. I have met young men and women who \nhave done incredible things, shown unfathomable courage, faced dangers \nso great that, had they simply turned and fled in terror, none of us \ncould really blame them. And I have heard and remembered the stories of \nthose who chose not to flee, knowing that by standing their ground, \nthey would risk or even give up their lives.\n  Cassandra Woods' life was worthy of a different kind of awe. John F. \nKennedy once wrote, ``Without belittling the courage with which men \nhave died, we should not forget those acts of courage with which men \nhave lived.'' Cassandra had an unflinching courage to live and to pass \nthat courage on to others. She became a tireless and effective advocate \nfor cancer patients. After defeating cancer for the first time almost \n20 years ago, she felt a responsibility, with God's help, to assist \nothers, in her words, to ``come through the fire and come out whole.''\n  Her life-affirming commitment was present when she was on the \nfrontlines a few years ago in the electoral battle to permit stem cell \nresearch in Michigan and, of course, in her joyous activities in her \nchurch.\n  When Barb and I visited with Cassandra a few days before she passed \naway, she reminisced about many things. More than anything else, she \nspoke to us about her love of her family, her mother and her children. \nWith special passion, she spoke of her two grandchildren: Justin, with \nwhom she spent so much time and whom she took so much joy in watching \ngrow; and Bianca, who slept in Cassandra's bed after the two of them \nwould sing songs together to help Bianca fall asleep.\n  Cassandra applied a sense of family to our community. One Christmas, \nthe staff, who loved her so much and whom she loved so much, was \ndiscussing how long to close our offices over the holidays. Some wanted \nour offices closed for the whole week between Christmas and New Year's. \nCassandra wouldn't hear of such a thing. Christmas is a time of year \nwhen some of Senator Levin's constituents need our help the most, she \nsaid. We shouldn't close the office more than a day or two. And that \nwas the end of the discussion. It was so typical of Cassandra; she was \nalways thinking of others who might need help.\n  The poet Dylan Thomas urged us not to go ``gentle into that good \nnight'' but rather to ``rage against the dying of the light.'' \nCassandra Woods chose another way to leave us--by going gently, guided \nby her brave heart and her abiding faith and with the same grace and \nconfidence that marked her life, a life so full of a light that will \nnot die but will shine always in the hearts of all of us who loved her.\n\n[[Page S2323]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/22/senate-section/article/S2323-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2323-S2324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                50TH ANNIVERSARY OF GIDEON V. WAINWRIGHT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Monday marked the 50th anniversary of the \nSupreme Court's landmark decision in Gideon v. Wainwright. That \ndecision recognized that every person accused of a crime, whether \nwealthy or poor, is guaranteed the right to counsel. At its core, \nGideon is the promise of justice for all, including the most vulnerable \ncitizens of our society.\n  We need to celebrate that landmark ruling and to recognize Clarence \nGideon. In many instances throughout our history, it has been ordinary \ncitizens who have led to the most profound changes in our country, and \nthat is certainly the case here.\n  Clarence Gideon was a poor drifter with a history of drinking and \ngambling. He was charged in Florida with breaking and entering into a \npool hall and stealing money from vending machines. When he requested a \nlawyer be appointed to represent him, because he could not afford to \nhire an attorney, he was told that a lawyer was only provided to \ndefendants facing the death penalty.\n  From his prison cell at the Florida State Prison, Gideon wrote a \nhandwritten note to the U.S. Supreme Court seeking to overturn his \nconviction because he had not been appointed a lawyer. That note read, \nsimply: ``The question is I did not get a fair trial. The question is \nvery simple. I requested the court to appoint me attorney and the court \nrefused.''\n  That handwritten note led, 50 years ago Monday, to the Court \nunanimously declaring the ``obvious truth'' that ``lawyers in criminal \ncourt are necessities, not luxuries.'' As the Court made clear:\n\n       In our adversary system of criminal justice, any person \n     hauled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot \n     be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him.\n       From the very beginning, our state and national \n     constitutions and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural \n     and substantive safeguards designed to assure fair trials \n     before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands \n     equal before the law. This noble idea cannot be realized if \n     the poor man charged with crime has to face his accusers \n     without a lawyer to assist him.\n\n  Mr. President, since Gideon, there has been progress. Since 1963, \ngovernments have expended greater resources in defending accused \npersons, and many more criminal defendants receive fairer trials with \ndue process of law. And, we must acknowledge the thousands of lawyers, \nmany of whom have the education and skills to command much higher \nsalaries in the private sector, who have chosen to dedicate their \ncareers to ensuring the rights of our most vulnerable citizens, those \naccused of a crime. As just one example, I am proud that I recently \nrecommended Jane Kelly, a career Federal defender in Iowa, to the \nEighth Circuit Court of Appeals, and I look forward to her speedy \nconfirmation.\n  While we rightly celebrate Gideon and the progress over the last 50 \nyears, we must acknowledge that we have much work still to do. As \nAttorney General Holder recently said,\n\n       [a]cross the country, public defender offices and other \n     indigent defense providers are underfunded and understaffed . \n     . . Millions of Americans still struggle to access the legal \n     services that they need and deserve--and to which they are \n     constitutionally entitled.\n\n  Even when a defendant is provided an attorney, too many are \nrepresented by attorneys who do not have the time, training, or tools \nto do their jobs properly. Many defendants are ``represented'' by \nlawyers who have hundreds of other cases and who lack requisite \nexpertise and sufficient support staff. Too often the representation is \nperfunctory and so deficient as not to amount to representation at all.\n  According to a 2011 report by the Justice Policy Institute, only 27 \npercent of county-based public defender offices and 21 percent of state \npublic defender systems have enough attorneys to meet national \nguidelines. Only 7 percent of county-based public defender offices have \nenough investigators to meet national guidelines, and 87 percent of \nsmall county-based public defender offices do not have a single full-\ntime investigator.\n  As a result, too many defenders lack access to sufficient resources \nto interview key witnesses, collect or test physical evidence, or \ngenerally prepare a quality defense. A 2009 investigation by the \nConstitution Project, the National Legal Aid & Defender Association, \nand the National Right to Counsel Committee found documented instances \nin which public defenders carried as many as 500 active felony cases at \na time--the American Bar Association recommends 150--and as many as \n2,225 misdemeanor cases. The ABA recommends 400.\n  According to a Brennan Center report, the average amount of time \nspent by a public defender at arraignment is often less than 6 minutes \nper case. And, the National Law Journal article examining Gideon's \nanniversary highlighted the fact that in Wisconsin, private lawyers who \nare hired to represent indigent defendants are paid $40 an hour--\nunchanged since 1978. In Maryland, a State court of appeals last year \nruled defendants are entitled to counsel at bail hearings. Rather than \npaying to ensure this right, the State legislature repealed the law \ninstead.\n  Unfortunately, sequestration is exacerbating the problem. In Iowa, \nthe Federal defender has notified the Federal courts that because of \nthe sequester, each Federal defender employee will need to be \nfurloughed for 20 to 24 days between April 8 and September 30. The \nFederal defender is being forced to close the Southern District Office \non Mondays and the Northern District Office on Fridays. These furloughs \nand closings will put a strain on already overworked public servants \nand has the risk of jeopardizing the quality representation every \ndefendant in Iowa deserves.\n  When criminal defendants lack quality representation, there is a \nheightened risk of our justice system making egregious mistakes. We \nhave learned all too well, especially with the advent of DNA evidence, \nthat an unknowable number of genuinely innocent persons have been \nwrongly convicted. For innocent persons to lose their liberty or, in \nthe case of the death penalty, their lives, is a travesty of justice. \nIt is a national shame. And, as Attorney General Janet Reno once said, \n``in the end, a good lawyer is the best defense against wrongful \nconviction.'' There is no more telling example than Gideon himself. \nAfter the Supreme Court ruled in his favor, he was retried, only this \ntime with a lawyer. The jury took 1 hour to acquit him.\n  Recognizing that we must improve our system of representation for \nindigent Americans, I am proud to cosponsor the Gideon's Promise Act, \nintroduced Monday by Senator Leahy.\n  Not only does the basic right guaranteed for criminal defendants in \nGideon five decades ago remain not yet fully realized, it is also \noutrageous that there remains no guaranteed right to counsel in the \ncivil context. As James Sandman, president of the Legal Services \nCorporation, recently said,\n\n       Most Americans don't realize that you can have your home \n     taken away, your children taken away and you can be a victim \n     of domestic violence but you have no constitutional right to \n     a lawyer to protect you.\n\n  This issue is personal for me. Before I was elected to Congress, I \npracticed law with Polk County legal aid in Iowa. I can honestly say \nthe work I did with legal aid is some of the most important and \nrewarding of my career. I learned firsthand that, without access to an \nattorney, the poor are often powerless in the face of injustice and \nwrongdoing, even within a judicial system that purports to ensure equal \njustice under law.\n  At the Federal level, since the administration of President Nixon, we \nas a nation have supported civil legal aid programs through the Legal \nServices Corporation. And, make no mistake: these programs have made a \ncrucial difference to millions of low-income Americans. Recipients of \nLSC funding help clients secure basic human needs, such as wrongly \ndenied Society Security benefits and health care. Low-income Americans \nreceive aid with consumer, housing and employment issues. LSC-funded \nattorneys help parents obtain and keep custody of their children, \nassist parents in enforcing child support payments, and help women who \nare victims of domestic violence. In addition, LSC has greatly expanded \nits capacity to meet the legal needs of veterans, active-duty \nservicemembers and their families, and has been critical in providing \nlegal assistance to Americans impacted by deadly natural disasters.\n\n[[Page S2324]]\n\n  Unfortunately, however, too many Americans today cannot afford \ncritical civil legal representation. In many parts of the Nation, more \nthan 80 percent of those who need an attorney go without one. \nNationally, over 50 percent of applicants for federally funded legal \nservices who request legal aid are turned away because programs lack \nadequate funding. In other words, American citizens are being denied \njustice not because of the facts of their case or because of governing \nlaw, but solely because they cannot afford an attorney. This is not \njustice. And, to state the obvious, it makes a mockery of the principle \nof equal justice under the law.\n  I want to thank Senators Mikulski and Shelby for all of their hard \nwork and effort with respect to the fiscal year 2013 appropriations \nbill and for protecting critical funds for LSC. That bill provided $358 \nmillion for LSC, a $10 million increase over fiscal year 2012, which \nitself was a $56 million cut from fiscal year 2011. This is still far \nless than the amount appropriated in fiscal year 1995, which would be \nabout $594 million in today's dollars, and even further below the \namount appropriated in fiscal year 1981--about $800 million in today's \ndollars. But this week's bill was a critical increase in a difficult \nbudget environment and I am grateful.\n  At the same time, however, it is long past time for us as a nation to \nmake clear that all Americans, whether wealthy or poor, have the right \nto legal representation. It was President Nixon who created the Legal \nServices Corporation and who said,\n\n       I would suggest there is no subject which is more important \n     to the legal profession, that is more important to this \n     nation, than . . . the realization of the ideal of equal \n     justice for all.\n\n  As my former Republican colleague Pete Domenici declared:\n\n       I do not know what is wrong with the United States of \n     America saying to the needy people of this country that the \n     judicial system is not only for the rich. What is wrong with \n     that? . . . That is what American is all about.\n\n  On Clarence Gideon's gravestone in Hannibal, MO, is a quote drawn \nfrom the letter he wrote to Abe Fortas, who was appointed to represent \nhim before the Supreme Court. It reads, ``Each era finds an improvement \nin law for the benefit of mankind.''\n  Directly across from the Senate stands the marble judicial temple of \nthe Supreme Court, and above its entrance is engraved the most \nfundamental principle and ideal of our system of criminal justice. It \nsays, simply, ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' Let us as a nation continue \nto strive to fulfill the promise of our Constitution, for both criminal \nand civil litigants. ``Equal Justice Under Law'' must be more than an \naspiration chiseled on a marble facade; it must be a concrete reality \nfor ALL of our fellow citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/22/senate-section/article/S2324-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2324-S2325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO GEORGE ``CHIP'' WALTER, JR.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to George \n``Chip'' Walter, Jr. Chip, a career veteran of the Navy, currently \nserves as the Director of the Office of Congressional Affairs at the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, CIA. As the vice chairman of the Senate \nSelect Intelligence Committee, I have had the pleasure to work with \nChip in this position and have greatly appreciated his professionalism, \nknowledge, and dedication, which has benefited not only me but also \nnumerous other Members and staff here in Congress. He is an exemplar of \npublic service to our country.\n  Prior to his position at the CIA, he held numerous legislative \naffairs positions within the Department of Defense, including director \nof Legislative Affairs for Central Command, which included a year tour \nin Kabul, Afghanistan, as the legislative adviser to the commander of \nCentral Command. It was in Kabul where I and many other Members met \nChip as we traveled on codels to Afghanistan at the height of the war. \nHis professionalism and affable nature made a great impression on me \nand others.\n  His work with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence began with \nthe nomination and confirmation of GEN David Petraeus to be Director of \nthe CIA. Soon after, he was named director of the Office of \nCongressional Affairs at the CIA, where he managed the day-to-day \nrelationship between Congress and the Agency. The Congressional Affairs \nposition at the CIA is always a difficult job, but these last few \nmonths have been particularly challenging with the confirmation of a \nnew CIA Director, along with implementing lessons learned in the \naftermath of the September 11, 2012, Benghazi attacks. Chip showed a \nresolute trustworthiness through these difficult times that many \nMembers of Congress appreciated. Chip has given much to this Nation \nthrough his dedicated and selfless service. Let me take a minute to \nrecount some of his other accomplishments which include a long and \ndistinguished career as a naval aviator, from which he retired as a \ncaptain in 2011.\n  Chip, a native of Sudbury, MA, graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy \nin May 1983. He was designated a naval aviator in 1985. His first \nassignment was in Brunswick, ME, where he served as an instructor \npilot, mission commander, and formation instructor. During that \nassignment he completed three deployments to the Mediterranean and \nNorth Atlantic. In the summer of 1989, he reported to Fleet Replacement \nSquadron, FRS, THIRTY in Jacksonville, FL, where he earned the \ndesignations of FRS instructor pilot, advanced training instructor, \nformation instructor, and alternate naval aviation training and \noperations procedures standardization, NATOPS, evaluator for Naval Air \nForces Atlantic.\n  He served as the flag secretary of Carrier Group TWO in 1991, and in \nOctober 1992, he deployed in the USS John F. Kennedy Battle Group to \nthe Mediterranean in support of OPERATIONS PROVIDE PROMISE and PROVIDE \nCOMFORT. In August 1993, he attended the Naval War College, Newport, \nRI, and graduated with distinction in June 1994. In November 1994, he \nreported to Patrol Squadron TEN while deployed to Naval Air Station \nSignorelli, Sicily and later completed a tri-site deployment to \nKeflavik, Iceland; Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico; and Howard Air Force \nBase in Panama, serving as the operations officer. In November 1996, \nCaptain Walter began work in the Bureau of Naval Personnel as the \nassistant Washington placement officer.\n  Following his tour in the Bureau, he was assigned as the executive \nassistant to the Chief of Navy Legislative Affairs. In the spring of \n2000, Captain Walter reported to Patrol Squadron ONE as the executive \nofficer. He assumed command of the ``Screaming Eagles'' Squadron in \nFebruary 2001 and completed a Western Pacific deployment. After his \ncommand tour, he reported to the Joint Staff and served in the Force \nStructure, Resources, and Assessment Directorate, J8, and later as the \nChairman's deputy director of Legislative Affairs. In September 2005, \nhe was assigned as the executive assistant for director of Air Warfare, \nN88. In June 2006, he assumed duties as commander TASK FORCE SIX SEVEN. \nIn addition to traditional duties of the commander TASK FORCE SIX \nSEVEN, he was designated commander of the Black and Caspian Sea for \nNaval Forces Europe. In July 2008, he assumed the duties as the \ndirector, CENTCOM Legislative Affairs. He deployed to Kabul, \nAfghanistan, in July 2010, for a year tour as the legislative adviser \nto the commander, General Petraeus. Captain Walter became director of \nCongressional Affairs for the Central Intelligence Agency on September \n26, 2011.\n  Over the course of his career, Chip has consistently served in highly \nselective and challenging assignments, demonstrating the quality of his \ncharacter and abilities. Because of men like Chip, we have an able and \nready military that truly is a global force for good. Throughout his \ndistinguished career he has represented our country and Navy with \ndignity and honor, and this is why I am so privileged to pay tribute to \nthis fine sailor and American.\n  In a few weeks, Chip will be moving on to another assignment. I speak \nfor many of us who have worked with him when I say he will be missed \nand not easily replaced. I want to thank his wife, Kim, along with his \nthree children, Kristyn, Bethany, and Griffin, who have lovingly \nsupported him throughout his career in the military and government. \nChip, thank you for your distinguished service to our country.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a great American \ngovernor, dedicated public servant, and community leader from the State \nof Washington, Governor Booth Gardner.\n  He was born August 21, 1936 in Tacoma, WA and was a leader of \ntremendous compassion, dignity, and bravery whose service to our State \nwill live on far into the future. Booth was generous in sharing his \nwisdom and his time, and I will never forget the lessons he taught me \nwhen I was just beginning my political career in Olympia many years \nago.\n  I learned so much from Booth because he was a man that led by \nexample. He demonstrated governing was about the people you served and \nserved with, by learning everyone's name, what issues they cared deeply \nabout, and by taking the time to work with anyone who shared his desire \nto make Washington State a better place to live.\n  Booth also showed compromise and compassion were not competing ideals \nby being pragmatic when he needed to be, but by always working to \nprotect the needs of the most vulnerable.\n  Governor Gardner passed away on March 15, 2013 in Tacoma at the age \nof 76, after a long battle with Parkinson's. While I am deeply saddened \nby his passing, Booth's imprint on our State will long be seen in our \nclassrooms and the many open spaces he fought to protect.\n  Up until the very end of his life, Booth remained a fighter for the \nissues he cared most about. Those of us who knew him couldn't have \nimagined it any other way. I miss him greatly.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in paying homage to Governor Booth \nGardner. He lived a full life, and the people of Washington State will \nalways be indebted to him for his role in shaping the future of our \nState. Our thoughts are with his loved ones at this time of great loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/22/senate-section/article/S2325-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    REMEMBERING L. S. ``SAM'' SKAGGS\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I wish to pay special tribute \nto a man I have admired, L. S. ``Sam'' Skaggs. Sam was a private and \nquiet man yet had a resounding impact on Utah's business climate and \nmany community initiatives that will be felt for generations. Sadly, \nSam recently passed away leaving a void to many.\n  Sam was part of a large family dynasty whose name became known \nthroughout the country in the food and drug industry. Sam was just a \nyoung man when the sudden death of his father threw him into the \nleadership of the family corporation. It was apparent early on that his \naptitude for business and his strength as a leader would serve the \nfamily and its businesses well for many years to come.\n  During his leadership the chain of less than a dozen drugstores grew \nto more than 200 stores. He also oversaw the transition to the larger \nAmerican Stores brand. His name became synonymous with expertise in the \ngrowth of business employing the strategy of a low, high volume \napproach and the rapid expansion of many common outlets.\n  Sam was not only known for his business acumen--he was also a \ntremendously generous philanthropist. He helped found the L. S. Skaggs \nPharmacy Institute at the University of Utah College of Pharmacy to \nprovide students and future students of pharmacy to excel. He also made \na generous contribution to fund the Special Collections Section of \nBrigham Young University's Harold B. Lee Library.\n  His family's ALSAM Foundation has helped many Catholic charities \nwhich were close to his heart. He donated the Skaggs Catholic Center, a \n57-acre complex that houses Juan Diego Catholic High School, John the \nBaptist Elementary and Middle School, and the Guardian of Angel \nDaycare. Galey Colosimo, principal of Juan Diego High School, had this \nto say about his passing: ``It is a sad day, but we remember him with \ngratitude for all he has done for us.''\n  Sam also served his country and left his studies at Utah's \nWestminster College to enlist in the Army in World War II. It has been \nsaid that it was during his days of military service that he witnessed \nmany acts of compassion by Roman Catholic chaplains, which led to his \nconversion to the Catholic Church and prompted many of his kind acts of \nservice and generosity.\n  I am grateful that Utah was home to this great business and \nphilanthropic leader. He was a good man, and a true neighbor and friend \nto many. His memory will live on through the success of the businesses \nhe led and most significantly through the generosity he exhibited to so \nmany wonderful and worthwhile causes that he loved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/22/senate-section/article/S2325-3", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ARTS FOR LEARNING WEEK\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, over 60 years ago, the Young \nAudiences organization was founded with a mission to promote arts-\nintegrated education. Each year the Young Audiences Arts for Learning \nimpacts more than 5 million students in over 8,000 schools and \ncommunities. In honor of its commendable work around arts education, \nthrough its 30 affiliates across the United States, I am pleased to \nrecognize the week of March 24, 2013 as National Young Audiences Arts \nfor Learning Week.\n  I would especially like to highlight the work of the Young Audiences \nof Northeast Ohio, YANEO, which reaches more than 240,000 students \nacross 18 counties in my home State. YANEO's 120 professional artists \nassist young Ohioans by teaching dance, theater, music, visual arts, \nliterary, and media arts. Additionally, the Young Audiences Artworks in \nCleveland successfully pairs Ohio teenagers with local artists to \nmentor students and provide them with college and career advice.\n  Art programs help keep students engaged in their schools and \ncommunities. Music and visual arts not only serve as a form of personal \nexpression, but enable dynamic collaboration. Learning to dance, sing, \nand perform in front of a group can instill confidence in children. \nLearning to edit a film, record a song, or create a graphic design can \nprovide individuals with an invaluable set of skills which are \ntransferable to the workplace. Contributing to local communities \nthrough the arts--from outdoor murals to large theatrical \nperformances--offers young people a new sense of belonging, purpose, \nand achievement. The arts help to look at the world, and themselves, \nanew.\n  Including arts and music in a student's curriculum may also greatly \nimprove his or her grasp of math and scientific problems. It has been \ndemonstrated exposure to the arts endows children with insight, reason, \nand technical proficiency. Art education improves communication skills, \nacademic achievement, encourages discipline, and discourages high-risk \nbehavior. Students' ability to innovate and utilize new technologies \nthrough arts activities will not only better prepare students for 21st \ncentury jobs, but is also key to our Nation's competiveness in the \nglobal economy.\n  I commend both the students who participate in Young Audiences and \nthe hard-working parents, teachers, volunteers, and artists of Young \nAudiences who inspire future generations of artists and musicians. Your \npassion and commitment should be celebrated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/22/senate-section/article/S2325-4", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2325-S2326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DEANNA LONDON\n\n  (By request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record:)\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \none of New Jersey's great local leaders: Deanna London.\n  At the end of this month, Ms. London will end a remarkable 25-year \ntenure at the Human Needs Food Pantry in Montclair, NJ, a period that \nsaw her rise from volunteer to executive director. On any typical day, \nshe can be found meeting with families and individuals who have come \nfor a meal, courting community members for support, and overseeing the \nlarge operation she has helped to expand. No job is too small for her \nto tackle and no person unworthy of help.\n  When she first walked into the Human Needs Food Pantry in Montclair \n2\\1/2\\ decades ago, Ms. London was just looking for a volunteer \nopportunity, restless and eager for the chance to ``communicate with \npeople,'' as she said in a recent interview. Yet,\n\n[[Page S2326]]\n\nas a volunteer opportunity turned into a quarter century and an \nexecutive directorship, London built a legacy that should inspire every \nAmerican to serve. And in explaining that, ``I always thought that I \ngot more out of it, because there is something fabulous to being able \nto help somebody,'' London has offered a model of service that all \nAmericans should aspire to emulate.\n  Her dedication to her fellow New Jerseyans and the compassion she has \nshown for her neighbors in need is an inspiring example of an American \nputting everything aside to do all she can for others. It is what \nAmerica is all about--that we are all in this together.\n  I know that when Deanna London hands over the reins to former Tenafly \npolice chief Michael Bruno, the pantry will be in good hands. And I \nalso know that when she leaves in just a few weeks, her service to New \nJersey and this country will only continue.\n  New Jersey is a stronger State because of residents like Deanna \nLondon, and I wish her my very best as she completes one chapter of her \nlife and begins another.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/22/senate-section/article/S2326-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING THOMAS MADOLE\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in law enforcement there is \nspirited debate over who walks the toughest beat in America. The \nvillage public safety officers, or VPSOs, our first responders in the \nlast frontier, are rarely part of that debate because they largely \nfunction out of sight and out of mind of the broader community of law \nenforcement officers.\n  Alaska's VPSOs wear all four hats of first response. They are at the \nsame time police officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians \nand search and rescue coordinators. They are the sole first responders \nin the bush villages of Alaska--villages with populations that might \nnumber 400 to 600 people--and carry out their dangerous work with no \nbackup in the immediate community. The closest backup is often an \nAlaska State Trooper in a rural hub, who must fly in to the village by \nair--assuming weather conditions allow the troopers to fly. I would \nsubmit to you that our village public safety officers, who patrol \nunarmed, in fact walk the toughest beat in America.\n  This week the people of Alaska are mourning the line of duty death of \nThomas Madole, age 54, the village public safety officer in Manokotak, \nAK. Officer Madole was killed while responding to a report of a \npossibly suicidal person. He was unarmed. His assailant was not. The \nname Manokotak is an English transliteration of a Central Alaska Yupik \nword, and 94 percent of its residents are Alaska Native descendants of \nthe original people to occupy the Bristol Bay region.\n  Officer Madole is the second VPSO to give his life in the protection \nof his village. The first was Officer Ronald Zimin, whose end of watch \nwas October 22, 1986. A sad coincidence that Officer Zimin also lost \nhis life responding to a domestic violence call while serving in \nanother village in Alaska's Bristol Bay region. Officer Zimin's name \nappears on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Judiciary \nSquare, Washington, DC. I suspect that a delegation of Officer Madole's \nfriends and colleagues will journey from the Bristol Bay region to \nWashington, DC, to honor Officer Madole when his name is added to the \nmemorial in May 2014. I expect to join them.\n  The heroes of law enforcement are remembered for how they gave their \nlives and not the manner in which their lives were ended. There is much \nto say for how Officer Madole lived his life. He will be remembered as \na man of peace. An ordained minister of the Assemblies of God Church, \nhe preached and mentored in the Yupik hub community of Bethel, AK for 6 \nyears before moving to Manokotak. Patricia Zulkosky, a board member of \nthe Bethel Assemblies of God Church referred to Madole as ``a man of \nGod, he walked his talk.'' And in the community of Manokotak, Madole is \nremembered as a friend and a role model for the youth as much as a cop.\n  Officer Madole leaves behind a wife and a son. On behalf of my Senate \ncolleagues, I extend condolences to Officer Madole's survivors and the \npeople of Manokotak on this tragic loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/22/senate-section/article/S2326-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/22/senate-section/article/S2326-3", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/22/senate-section/article/S2326-4", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:27 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to eliminate conditions in foreign prisons and other \ndetention facilities that do not meet primary indicators of health, \nsanitation, and safety, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join today with the \nsenior Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, in reintroducing \nlegislation that has already attracted broad support from across the \nsocial and political spectrum. An almost identical version was reported \nby the Foreign Relations Committee two years ago, and then last \nDecember it was cleared by both sides for passage by unanimous consent \nbut the Senate adjourned shortly before it could be adopted.\n  This bill, titled the Foreign Prison Conditions Improvement Act of \n2013, seeks to address a much neglected, global human rights and \nhumanitarian problem--the inhumane treatment of people in foreign \nprisons and other detention facilities.\n  On any given day, millions of people are languishing in foreign \nprisons, many in pretrial detention having never been brought before a \njudge or formally charged or proven guilty of anything, deprived of \ntheir freedom in abysmal conditions, often for years longer than they \ncould have been sentenced to prison if convicted.\n  Others are imprisoned after being convicted of offenses, often after \nwoefully unfair trials, including for nothing more than peacefully \nexpressing political or religious beliefs or defending human rights. \nRegardless of their status they have one thing in common. They are \ndeprived of the most basic rights and necessities--safe water, adequate \nfood, essential medical care, personal safety, and dignity.\n  Anyone who has been inside one of these facilities, or seen \nphotographs or press reports of what they are like, understands that \nthis is about the mistreatment of human beings in ways that are \nreminiscent of the Dark Ages.\n  A few examples illustrate the point. In Haiti's National Penitentiary \nbefore the 2010 earthquake, more than 4,100 prisoners were confined in \na space built for less than 900. Many did not have room to lie down and \nhad to sleep standing up. Sanitation was practically non-existent. \nDeadly contagious diseases were rampant. The overwhelming majority of \ninmates had never been formally charged, never seen a lawyer or a \njudge. The earthquake damaged the prison and the prison guards fled, \nleaving the inmates to fend for themselves without food or water. They \nmanaged to get out, but the squalid facility filled up again.\n  Senator Whitehouse and I visited that facility just last month. It \ncurrently holds more than 3,700 prisoners of which more than 3,400 are \nawaiting trial. Thanks to the State Department, the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development, and a small Florida-based organization, \nHealth Through Walls, a new infirmary and X-ray machine have \ndramatically reduced the incidence of HIV and tuberculosis. A small \nVermont-based organization, the Rural Justice Center, is using USAID \nfunds to chip away at the pretrial detention problem. These are \nexamples of how modest funding can save lives and improve access to \njustice for prisoners in facilities plagued by abysmal conditions.\n  I recall a newspaper article about how in Benin, in West Africa, the \nskin of prisoners was ragged from the extraction of fly larvae, an \naffliction that is symptomatic of the deplorable conditions. Many \ninmates suffer from tuberculosis, scabies, parasites, lung infections \nor other illnesses. The prison in Abomey, located in southern Benin,\n\n[[Page S2336]]\n\nwas built in 1904 to house a maximum of 150 prisoners. A year or two \nago, more than 1,000 were reportedly confined there.\n  Last February, a fire at the Comayagua Prison in Honduras killed 360 \ninmates. In one overcrowded cell block only four of 105 prisoners \nsurvived. More than half of those who died were waiting to be charged \nor tried.\n  It is common in prisons from Latin America to the Middle East, \nAfrica, and Asia for inmates to be severely malnourished and to go for \nmonths without being able to wash. Many prisoners depend for survival \non food brought to them by relatives. In many countries individuals \nawaiting trial, young and old, are housed together with convicted, \nviolent criminals.\n  Prisoners and other detainees in many countries are also routinely \nvictimized by poorly trained, abusive guards who are virtually \nunsupervised and unaccountable to any higher authority. Sexual abuse of \nmen, women and children is common.\n  Prisoners in many countries die in prison from lack of proper medical \ncare. Inmates suffer from AIDS and other illnesses in facilities with \nno medical records, where doctors do not enter. Prisoners intentionally \ncut or otherwise harm themselves in the hope of receiving medical \nattention for life-threatening illnesses. If and when they are released \nthey infect the local population.\n  A New York Times article described how prisoners in one African \ncountry were punished by being stripped naked and held in solitary \nconfinement in small, windowless cells, sometimes for days on end, in \nankle-to-calf-high water contaminated with their own excrement. It is \nlike something out of The Count of Monte Cristo, only worse because it \nis happening in the 21st Century. But the article went on to describe \nhow that country's prison service conducted its own audit, appointed a \nnew medical director, and allowed human rights workers access to its \nfacilities. The legislation Senator Inhofe and I are introducing seeks \nto provide incentives for those kinds of improvements. Our bill would \ndo the following:\n  First, it calls attention to this long ignored problem. Most people \nknow little if anything about what goes on inside foreign prisons, and \nmany would prefer not to know.\n  Second, it sets forth primary indicators for the elimination of \ninhumane conditions in foreign prisons and other detention facilities, \nsuch as human waste facilities that are sanitary and accessible, and \nadequate ventilation, food and safe drinking water.\n  Third, it requires the Secretary of State to report annually on the \nconditions in prisons and other detention facilities in at least 30 \ncountries receiving United States assistance or under sanction by the \nUnited States, selected by the Secretary's determination that such \nconditions raise the most serious human rights or humanitarian \nconcerns.\n  Fourth, it encourages the Secretary and the Administrator of the U.S. \nAgency for International Development to furnish assistance for the \npurpose of eliminating inhumane conditions where such assistance would \nbe appropriate and beneficial.\n  For countries that are not making significant efforts to eliminate \nsuch conditions, the Secretary is to enter into consultations with \ntheir government to achieve the purposes of the Act.\n  The legislation also provides for training of Foreign Service \nOfficers, and directs the Secretary to designate, within the Department \nof State's Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, an official \nwith responsibility for implementing the provisions of the Act.\n  Finally, it authorizes the expenditure of funds to implement the Act.\n  Once enacted, the Foreign Prison Conditions Improvement Act of 2013 \nwill help foreign governments ensure that prisoners in their countries \nare treated as any people deprived of their freedom should be--as human \nbeings, with dignity, in safety, and provided the basic necessities of \nlife.\n  In countries around the world, the United States is helping to reform \njustice systems and strengthen the rule of law. No justice system can \nclaim to deliver justice if prisoners and other detainees are treated \nlike animals, or worse. By helping to change attitudes, and showing how \nwith relatively little money prison conditions can be significantly \nimproved, we can help advance the cause of justice more broadly.\n  Millions of people around the world look to the United States as a \ndefender of justice. This legislation will further that goal and it \nreflects the best instincts of the American people. It has been \nendorsed by a wide range of groups, including Amnesty International, \nUSA; Baptist World Alliance, Division of Freedom and Justice; Ethics \nand Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention; \nHuman Rights First; Human Rights Watch; International CURE; \nInternational Justice Mission; International Prison Chaplains' \nAssociation; Jewish Council for Public Affairs; Just Detention \nInternational; Justice Fellowship/Prison Fellowship Ministries; \nNational Association of Evangelicals; National Religious Campaign \nAgainst Torture; New Evangelical Partnership for the Common Good; Open \nSociety Policy Center; Penal Reform International; Religious Action \nCenter of Reform Judaism; United Methodist Church, General Board of \nChurch and Society; and the United States Conference of Catholic \nBishops. I want to thank these groups for their support and their \nefforts to focus attention on this urgent problem.\n  Identical legislation is planned for reintroduction in the House by \nRepresentative Chris Smith who cares deeply about this issue, so this \nis a bipartisan, bicameral effort.\n  Finally, I want to thank Senator Inhofe, who has visited many African \ncountries and has witnessed the problems this legislation seeks to \naddress, as well as his staff, who have been very helpful throughout \nthis process. At a time when some people seem to get satisfaction from \ncalling Washington broken, this is another example of how two Senators, \nof different parties, whose political views often differ, can work \ntogether in furtherance of a just cause.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join my \nfriend Senator Leahy from Vermont in introducing, the Foreign Prison \nConditions Improvement Act of 2013.\n  As I stated when we introduced this bill in the 112th Congress, our \nbill seeks to identify and eliminate unhealthy and unsafe prison \nconditions found in developing countries like Haiti and on the African \ncontinent where millions suffer inhumane conditions as well as to \naddress the dysfunctions in their legal systems.\n  The introduction of this bill comes at an appropriate time because \nJon Hammer, the imprisoned U.S. Marine being held in the Cedes Prison \nin Matamoras, Mexico was freed this past December 21st.\n  Corporal Hammer, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was arrested in \nAugust and charged with a Federal weapons felony--facing up to 15 years \nin prison, for carrying an antique gun into Mexico on his way to Costa \nRica for a hunting trip, despite, as I understand it, having a required \npermit and attempting to declare the gun. During the past 90 days, he \nfaced the same harsh conditions that our bill is trying to address. \nNamely, Hammer was housed in an overcrowded and unsanitary prison, \nbeaten by fellow inmates who were members of the murderous Mexican drug \ncartels, threatened with death in an extortion attempt by these inmates \nand chained to a bed.\n  I had been involved in seeking Jon's release for several weeks, and I \nwas heartened when he was released. His treatment, however, serves as \nan excellent example of the deficiencies found everyday in foreign \nprisons worldwide from Africa to no further away than our southern \nborder.\n  Our bill focuses on eliminating excessive pre-trial detention and \ndysfunctional justice systems which frequently result in prisoners and \nother detainees spending years in unhealthy prison conditions before \ntheir cases are even adjudicated. Tragically, inadequate, misplaced or \nlost records often result in the incarcerated being held indefinitely \nbecause their cases have never been heard. Unbelievably, such poor \nrecordkeeping has kept many in prison long after their sentences have \nbeen served. Our bill also encourages these nations to provide humane \nand sanitary prison conditions so that prisoners can be released in \ngood health, and thus stem one of the causes of the spread of HIV and \ntuberculosis among the general public.\n\n[[Page S2337]]\n\n  Our bill calls upon the Department of State to submit to Congress an \nannual report for five years that describes inhuman prison conditions \nat least 30 countries receiving U.S. foreign assistance. It gives the \nSecretary of State and Administrator of the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development the discretion to restructure, reprogram or \nreduce U.S. foreign assistance to these countries based upon whether \nthey are making ``significant efforts'' to eliminate inhuman conditions \nin their prisons and other detention facilities.\n  The goals of this bill are noble, but it will take close monitoring \nand hard work by our U.S. Foreign Service personnel on the ground \noverseas to fulfill this work. That is why our bill directs the \nSecretary of State to provide training to these embassy and consulate \npersonnel so that they can effectively investigate and assess prison \nconditions in foreign prisons as well as assist these foreign \ngovernments to adopt substantive prison reforms. The Secretary is also \ndirected to designate and task a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State \nwithin the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor with the \nresponsibility for gathering the information for the annual report and \nmake recommendations to the Secretary based off its conclusions.\n  I have made 128 African country visits over the past 16 years, and I \nbelieve that given the chance, the majority of Africa's leaders will \nwelcome the opportunity to interact with our embassy and consulate \npersonnel and adopt the best practices for achieving the elimination of \nunhealthy and unsafe conditions in their prisons and other detention \nfacilities. It is also my hope that our neighbors to the south will \nadopt safe and sanitary prisons conditions and correct the dysfunctions \nin their justice systems so that another U.S. citizen does not have to \nspend 90 days in prison for a paperwork error.\n  The task at hand reminds me of the teaching of Jesus in Matthew \n25:39:40 when he said, `` `When did we see you sick or in prison and \nvisit you?' And the King will answer them, `Truly, I say to you, as you \ndid it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.' ''\n  We are all our brothers' keepers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. GILLIBRAND (for herself, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Coons, Mr. \n        Blunt, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Warner, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 658. A bill to amend titles 10 and 32, United States Code, to \nenhance capabilities to prepare for and respond to cyber emergencies, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Vitter, \nCoons, Blunt, Landrieu, Leahy, Warner, and Murray in introducing the \nCyber Warrior Act of 2013 to build Cyber and Computer Network Incident \nResponse Teams in the National Guard.\n  This bill would establish a Cyber and Computer Network Incident \nResponse Team, CCNIRT, in each state and the District of Columbia, \nwhich could provide a scalable response, called into support by the \nGovernor in case of a domestic initial response or by the Secretary of \nDefense in a Title 10 status when the situation warrants it. These \nteams would combine both Active and Traditional Guard Members, thereby \nleveraging the private sector IT expertise and experience. The use of \nthe Guard would also support the goal of retaining the cyber training \nof military personnel when they retire.\n  The bill would allow the Guard to further develop cyber capabilities \nto address existing and potential future surge needs. This bill would \nalso allow the National Guard to support existing DHS, DOJ, Secret \nService, and State and Local cyber efforts with their unique \ncapabilities and expertise, as well as leverage their private sector \nexpertise.\n  The Guard members under this bill would add to existing Guard end \nstrengths. The funding to support this mission is intended to be born \nby the active duty, but not incur any new budgetary authority.\n  The bill would also authorize Governors to ask their National Guard \nto help train State and Local Law Enforcement and other Cyber \nResponders in cyber security, and help them develop sound best \npractices that allow more cohesive interaction with Federal-level \nresponders.\n  The bill requires cyber Guard Members to receive the same level of \ntraining that is available to the Active Duty cyber personnel, to the \nextent practicable. The bill would require the Secretary of Defense to \nreport on such training.\n  The bill would also require the Secretary of Defense to report to \ncommittees of jurisdiction on the following ways to attract and retain \nmore cyber warriors.\n  The bill requires description and assessment of various mechanisms to \nrecruit and retain members of the regular and reserve components of the \nArmed Forces; an assessment of the use virtual and/or short term \ndeployments in case of cyber incident responses; and a description of \nthe training requirements and physical demands in the cyber \nspecialties.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 659. A bill to reauthorize the Reclamation States Emergency \nDrought Relief Act of 1991, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few minutes \ntoday on the importance of reauthorizing the Reclamation States \nEmergency Drought Relief Act.\n  This past year was the warmest on record and we are witnessing more \nclimate-driven events, including drought. Over 60 percent of the nation \nexperienced some form of drought during 2012. In my home State of \nOregon, serious drought is likely to persist in the southeastern part \nof the State.\n  Last summer marked the Nation's most widespread drought in 60 years, \nstretching across 29 States and threatening crop production and power \nplant operations. The levels in many lakes and reservoirs have declined \nputting at risk a crucial part of our Nation's drinking water supplies. \nThe impacts of the drought are profound and the outlook for this summer \nisn't any better.\n  The Drought Act was originally reported out of the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee in 1992. Since then it has provided over \n$74 million in drought assistance activities to States across the West. \nIt not only authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to undertake \nconstruction, management and conservation activities that will minimize \nand mitigate the losses and damages resulting from drought conditions, \nbut it also gives specific considerations to the needs of fish and \nwildlife.\n  My proposed legislation would reauthorize the Reclamation States \nEmergency Drought Relief Act, which expired last year, for an \nadditional 5 years. Given the drought last year and the forecast for \nprolonged drought in parts of this country, it is reasonable to raise \nthe authorization level by $20 million, which this legislation does. As \none indication of the associated costs of drought, in 2012 the drought \ncaused an estimated $50 billion in damages.\n  In closing, I look forward to working with this administration and my \ncolleagues in the Senate to reauthorize this vital program and to \nensure the Bureau of Reclamation has the resources it needs to \nadequately address the drought conditions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 663. A bill to provide for the inclusion of the State of \nCalifornia as a separate Federal milk marketing order upon the petition \nand approval of California dairy producers of such inclusion; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today, on behalf of myself and \nSenator Boxer, to introduce the California Federal Milk Marketing Order \nAct. This legislation will allow California's dairy industry to operate \non a system that is consistent with the industry in other states.\n  The bill is as simple and straight forward as it gets--it's only two \nparagraphs long.\n  The first paragraph allows the California dairy producers to create \ntheir own ``regional order'' within the existing Federal Milk Marketing \nOrder Program, if they elect to do so.\n  If California dairy farmers do elect to join the Federal order, the \nsecond paragraph allows California to maintain its existing ``quota \nsystem,'' which I will explain in a moment.\n\n[[Page S2338]]\n\n  It is important for me to say up front how non-controversial this \nlegislation should be.\n  The legislation has broad bi-partisan support among the diverse \nCalifornia congressional delegation.\n  The bill would likely add no new burden to the Federal taxpayer.\n  Congress enacted an identical provision in 1996.\n  But the provision expired along with the 1996 Farm Bill. So \nessentially, the legislation I am introducing today is simply the \nreauthorization of that no-cost provision.\n  More importantly though, this legislation can help the struggling \ndairy industry. Prices have dipped back to near historic lows, and \nfarmers are often milking their cows at or below the cost of \nproduction.\n  In California, this has resulted in a drastic consolidation of the \nindustry. Forty-eight dairies went out of business in 2011. Eleven left \nthe business in 2010. And 100 more left the business in 2009.\n  With only 1,668 dairies left in the state in 2011, those losses \nrepresent more than a 10 percent contraction in just three years.\n  But this legislation has the potential to begin the turnaround for \nCalifornia by bringing the milk pricing formulas in line with the rest \nof the nation.\n  To explain how the turnaround could occur, I'd like to start with the \nbasics.\n  USDA operates 10 regional Federal Milk Marketing Orders for dairy \nfarmers in 42 States. The order sets up a system to pay farmers a set \nprice for their milk, even though food manufacturers pay different \nprices based on how the milk is used. For instance, farmers in the \nFederal order receive the same price for milk that is put in a carton \nfor drinking as milk that is converted into dry milk powder. This is \ntrue even though these products sell for significantly different prices \nat the grocery store.\n\n  However, California, the Nation's largest milk producing State, \noperates under a different system. The State elected to run its own \nmilk marketing order, so California farmers are paid different values \nfor their products, and they are playing by different rules.\n  One unique characteristic of the California Marketing Order, and the \nreason for this legislation, is the system known as ``quota,'' which I \nmentioned earlier.\n  Producers who own a portion of the ``quota'' receive a premium for \ntheir milk, roughly five percent more than other producers. Rights to \nquota can be bought or sold on the open market, and economists estimate \nthat the combined value associated with quota is roughly $900 million.\n  It is this $900 million value that the California Federal Milk \nMarketing Order Act authorizes to be converted into a Federal order.\n  Inclusion of the quota will not come at taxpayer expense. Producers \nwho own quota receive a higher price for their milk, but the additional \npayment is offset by a marginal increase in prices paid by dairy \nprocessors.\n  I know that dairy support programs can be convoluted and \ncontroversial. But I want to make sure that my colleagues know that \nthis legislation is not.\n  The bill simply gives California dairy farmers the option of entering \ninto the Federal order, at the time of their choosing.

Res. 90\n\n       Whereas the Government and people of the United States \n     stand with the people of Kenya following their national and \n     local elections on March 4, 2013;\n       Whereas the Governments of the United States and Kenya have \n     long shared a strong bilateral partnership, and Kenya plays a \n     critically important role as a cornerstone of stability in \n     East Africa and as a valued ally of the United States;\n       Whereas Kenya's disputed 2007 presidential election \n     threatened the country's stability and its democratic \n     trajectory, triggering an explosion of violence that resulted \n     in the deaths of some 1,140 civilians and displaced nearly \n     600,000, some of whom have still not returned home;\n       Whereas a mediation effort by former United Nations \n     Secretary-General Kofi Annan and an African Union Panel of \n     Eminent African Personalities, supported by the United \n     States, led to the signing of the National Accord on February \n     28, 2008, which facilitated a power-sharing arrangement and \n     led to a series of constitutional, electoral, and \n     institutional reforms to address underlying causes of the \n     crisis;\n       Whereas, as part of that reform process, the citizens of \n     Kenya participated in a national referendum in August 2010, \n     approving a new constitution that mandated significant \n     institutional and structural changes to the government;\n       Whereas those constitutional changes have led to important \n     reforms in the judicial sector and the electoral system in \n     Kenya that aim to build greater public confidence in \n     government institutions, and which demonstrate meaningful \n     progress;\n       Whereas Kenya's Independent Commission of Inquiry into the \n     Post-Election Violence (the ``Waki Commission'') concluded \n     from its investigation in 2008 that there had been ``no \n     serious effort by any government'' to punish perpetrators of \n     previous incidents of ethnic and political violence, leading \n     to a culture of impunity that contributed to the crisis that \n     followed the 2007 elections, and, since then, despite \n     laudable judicial reforms, few perpetrators or organizers of \n     that violence have been held accountable for their crimes in \n     Kenyan courts;\n       Whereas, based on the findings of the Waki Commission, \n     mediator Kofi Annan submitted a list of key suspects to the \n     Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court \n     (ICC) in 2009, and several have been subsequently charged at \n     the ICC with crimes against humanity;\n       Whereas the Department of State's 2011 Human Rights Report \n     on Kenya notes, ``Widespread impunity at all levels of \n     government continued to be a serious problem. The government \n     took only limited action against security forces suspected of \n     unlawful killings, and impunity in cases of corruption was \n     common. Although the government took action in some cases to \n     prosecute officials who committed abuses, impunity . . . was \n     pervasive'';\n       Whereas President Barack Obama's Strategy on Sub-Saharan \n     Africa, released in June 2012, states that the United States \n     will not stand by while actors ``. . . manipulate the \n     fairness and integrity of democratic processes, and we will \n     stand in steady partnership with those who are committed to \n     the principles of equality, justice and the rule of law'';\n       Whereas, prior to the March 2013 elections, concerns about \n     political violence in Kenya were high, and in the months \n     preceding there had been strong indications that local \n     politicians in various parts of the country were involved in \n     organizing or inciting violence in order to influence local \n     electoral outcomes;\n       Whereas, in a February 2013 message to the people of Kenya, \n     President Obama highlighted the power Kenyan communities have \n     to reject intimidation and violence surrounding the upcoming \n     election, resolve disputes in the courts as opposed to the \n     streets, and ``move forward towards prosperity and \n     opportunity that unleashes the extraordinary talents of your \n     people'';\n       Whereas, five years after Kenya's post-election crisis, the \n     country held its first general elections under the new \n     constitution on March 4, 2013, which were largely peaceful; \n     and\n       Whereas Kenya's presidential candidates and their political \n     parties committed themselves to a peaceful electoral process, \n     and to resolving any resulting disputes through the judicial \n     process, which is now underway with\n\n[[Page S2339]]\n\n     the filing of cases before the Kenyan Supreme Court on March \n     16, 2013: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the people of Kenya on their commitment \n     to peaceful elections, as demonstrated on March 4, 2013;\n       (2) calls on the people of Kenya to continue to reject \n     intimidation and violence, and encourages the peaceful and \n     credible resolution of electoral disputes in the courts;\n       (3) urges restraint on all sides, while recognizing the \n     right of the people of Kenya to peacefully exercise their \n     constitutional rights to freedom of expression, assembly, and \n     demonstration;\n       (4) urges accountability for anyone found to be complicit \n     in promoting violence or manipulating electoral processes or \n     results;\n       (5) notes that many of the underlying grievances that have \n     underpinned ethnic divisions and fueled the 2007-2008 \n     violence remain largely unaddressed;\n       (6) affirms that accountability for the 2007-2008 post-\n     election violence is a critical element to ensure Kenya's \n     democracy, peace, and long-term stability;\n       (7) calls on the Government of Kenya to respect commitments \n     to seek justice for the victims of political violence, \n     including by honoring its obligations under the Rome Statute \n     to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Court with \n     regard to the three cases that remain before the Court slated \n     to go to trial in 2013;\n       (8) recognizes that, while the Government of Kenya has made \n     important progress since the 2007 election, aspects of the \n     Kenyan reform agenda specified in the National Accord and \n     2010 constitution remain unfinished, particularly with regard \n     to police reform, devolution, land reform, and security;\n       (9) encourages the people and Government of Kenya to \n     support ongoing implementation of constitutional reforms, \n     rule of law, and efforts to strengthen governing, security, \n     and judicial institutions that respect the dignity and rights \n     of all the people of Kenya and ensure protection for judges;\n       (10) congratulates the many candidates elected to office in \n     the March 2013 election--including those at the newly-formed \n     county level--and expresses hope that newly-elected members \n     of government will herald a new generation of responsible \n     leadership in Kenya; and\n       (11) reaffirms that the people of the United States will \n     continue to stand with the people of Kenya in support of \n     democracy, partnership, and peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/22/senate-section/article/S2339-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 91--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL \n                           PUBLIC HEALTH WEEK\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico (for himself, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Brown, Mr. \nWyden, Mr. Tester, and Mr. Blumenthal) submitted the following \nresolution; which was:\n\n                               S. Res. 91\n\n       Whereas the week of April 1, 2013 through April 7, 2013 is \n     National Public Health Week, and the theme for 2013 is \n     ``Public Health is ROI: Save Lives, Save Money'';\n       Whereas, since 1995, public health organizations have used \n     National Public Health Week to educate the public, \n     policymakers, and public health professionals about issues \n     that are important to improving the health of the people of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas the value of a strong public health system is in \n     the air people breathe, the water they drink, the food they \n     eat, and the places where they live, learn, work, and play;\n       Whereas each 10 percent increase in local public health \n     spending contributes to a 6.9 percent decrease in infant \n     deaths, a 3.2 percent decrease in cardiovascular deaths, a \n     1.4 percent decrease in deaths due to diabetes, and a 1.1 \n     percent decrease in deaths due to cancer;\n       Whereas routine childhood immunizations save $9,900,000 in \n     direct health care costs, save 33,000 lives, and prevent \n     14,000,000 cases of disease;\n       Whereas childhood health problems linked to preventable \n     environmental exposures, such as lead poisoning, asthma \n     complications, and developmental disabilities, cost the \n     United States $76,600,000,000 in 2008, and those costs \n     increased from 2.8 percent of total health care costs in 1997 \n     to 3.5 percent in 2008;\n       Whereas the cost of providing dental care for Medicaid-\n     eligible children who live in communities without water \n     fluoridation is twice as high as the cost for providing \n     dental care for Medicaid-eligible children who receive the \n     oral health benefits of drinking water with fluoridation;\n       Whereas a $52 investment in a child safety seat prevents \n     $2,200 in medical costs, resulting in a return of $42 for \n     every $1 invested;\n       Whereas an investment in workplace wellness initiatives \n     reduces sick leave and results in a return of $3.27 in \n     medical costs alone for every $1 invested;\n       Whereas health problems linked to hunger and food \n     insecurity cost $130,500,000,000 annually;\n       Whereas, from 1991 to 2006, investments in HIV prevention \n     averted more than 350,000 infections and saved more than \n     $125,000,000,000 in medical costs; and\n       Whereas, by adequately supporting public health and \n     prevention, the people of the United States can transform a \n     health system focused on treating illness into a health \n     system focused on preventing disease and promoting wellness: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Public Health \n     Week;\n       (2) recognizes the efforts of public health professionals, \n     the Federal Government, States, municipalities, local \n     communities, and individuals in preventing disease and \n     injury;\n       (3) recognizes the role of public health in improving the \n     health of people in the United States;\n       (4) encourages increased efforts and investment of \n     resources to improve the health of people in the United \n     States through--\n       (A) interventions to promote community health and prevent \n     disease and injury; and\n       (B) strengthening the public health system of the United \n     States; and\n       (5) encourages the people of the United States to learn \n     about the role that the public health system plays in \n     improving health in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/22/senate-section/article/S2339-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 10--AUTHORIZING THE USE OF EMANCIPATION \n   HALL IN THE CAPITOL VISITOR CENTER FOR AN EVENT TO CELEBRATE THE \n                      BIRTHDAY OF KING KAMEHAMEHA\n\n  Ms. HIRONO (for herself and Mr. Schatz) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                            S.

SENSE OF SENATE ON UNDERUTILIZED FACILITIES OF THE \n                   NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION \n                   AND THEIR POTENTIAL USE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     (NASA) is the ninth largest real property holder of the \n     Federal Government, with more than 124,000 acres and more \n     than 4,900 buildings and other structures with a replacement \n     value of more than $30,000,000,000.\n       (2) The annual operation and maintenance costs of the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration have increased \n     steadily, and, as of 2012, the Administration has more than \n     $2,300,000,000 in annual deferred maintenance costs.\n       (3) According to Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the \n     Administration continues to retain real property that is \n     underutilized, does not have identified future mission uses, \n     or is duplicative of other assets in its real property \n     inventory.\n       (4) The Office of Inspector General, the Government \n     Accountability Office (GAO), and Congress have identified the \n     aging and duplicative infrastructure of the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration as a high priority and \n     longstanding management challenge.\n       (5) In the NASA Authorization Act of 2010, Congress \n     directed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to \n     examine its real property assets and downsize to fit current \n     and future missions and expected funding levels, paying \n     particular attention to identifying and removing unneeded or \n     duplicative infrastructure.\n       (6) The Office of Inspector General found at least 33 \n     facilities, including wind tunnels, test stands, airfields, \n     and launch infrastructure, that were underutilized or for \n     which National Aeronautics and Space Administration managers \n     could not identify a future mission use and that the need for \n     these facilities have declined in recent years as a result of \n     changes in the mission focus of the Administration, the \n     condition and obsolescence of some facilities, and the advent \n     of alternative testing methods.\n       (7) The Office of Inspector General found that the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration has taken steps to \n     minimize the costs of continuing to maintain some of these \n     facilities by placing them in an inactive state or leasing \n     them to other parties.\n       (8) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has a \n     series of initiatives underway that, in the judgment of the \n     Office of Inspector General, are ``positive steps towards \n     `rightsizing' its real property footprint'', and the Office \n     of Inspector General has concluded that ``it is imperative \n     that NASA move forward aggressively with its infrastructure \n     reduction efforts''.\n       (9) Existing and emerging United States commercial launch \n     and exploration capabilities are providing cargo \n     transportation to the International Space Station and offer \n     the potential for providing crew support, access to the \n     International Space Station, and missions to low Earth orbit \n     while the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     focuses its efforts on heavy-lift capabilities and deep space \n     missions.\n       (10) National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     facilities and property that are underutilized, duplicative, \n     or no longer needed for Administration requirements could be \n     utilized by commercial users and State and local entities, \n     resulting in savings for the Administration and a reduction \n     in the burden of the Federal Government to fund space \n     operations.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the levels in this concurrent resolution assume--\n       (1) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     should move forward with plans to reduce its infrastructure \n     and, to the greatest extent practicable, make property \n     available for lease to a government or private tenant or \n     report the property to the General Services Administration \n     (GSA) for sale or transfer to another entity;\n       (2) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     should pursue opportunities for streamlined sale or lease of \n     property and facilities, including for exclusive use, to a \n     private entity, or expedited conveyance or transfer to a \n     State or political subdivision, municipality, instrumentality \n     of a State, or Department of Transportation-licensed launch \n     site operators for the promotion of commercial or scientific \n     space activity and for developing and operating space launch \n     facilities; and\n       (3) leasing or transferring underutilized facilities and \n     properties to commercial space entities or State or local \n     governments will reduce operation and maintenance costs for \n     the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, save money \n     for the Federal Government, and promote commercial space and \n     the exploration goals of the Administration and the United \n     States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 624.

Law enforcement agencies \n     may request firearms traces for any reason, and those reasons \n     are not necessarily reported to the Federal Government. Not \n     all firearms used in crime are traced and not all firearms \n     traced are used in crime.\n       (2) Firearms selected for tracing are not chosen for \n     purposes of determining which types, makes, or models of \n     firearms are used for illicit purposes. The firearms selected \n     do not constitute a random sample and should not be \n     considered representative of the larger universe of all \n     firearms used by criminals, or any subset of that universe. \n     Firearms are normally traced to the first retail seller, and \n     sources reported for firearms traced do not necessarily \n     represent the sources or methods by which firearms in general \n     are acquired for use in crime.\n       Sec. 515.
