There will be up to 4\\1/2\\ hours of \ndebate prior to a series of rollcall votes followed by several voice \nvotes on executive nominations. Senators should expect the votes to \nbegin around 5 p.m.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Jerry Linnell\n\n  Mr. President, in ancient Greece the keeping of history was \nconsidered so important that Clio, daughter of Zeus, was believed \nresponsible for recording all that occurred on Earth--everything.\n  In the Senate we don't have Greek gods in charge of keeping our \nrecords, but we do rely on the superhuman efforts of a group of \nofficial reporters who transcribe every word we say. It is a hard, hard \njob. Official reporters have to accustom their ears to all sorts of \naccents from across our country, find ways to spell newly invented \nwords, try to listen to what I don't say very loudly, and all the other \nissues they have to deal with, and they have to suffer through talking \nfilibusters. In fact, they may be the only people who dislike \nfilibusters more than I do.\n  Today I recognize just one of those hard-working official reporters--\nthe chief reporter of debates of the Senate Jerry Linnell, who is \nretiring at the end of this month. For 32 years Jerry has been a staple \nhere in the Senate, ensuring that the words of Senators past and \npresent are correctly recorded for the American people. While he has \nbeen here, he has witnessed many events. He has seen five different \nPresidents occupy the White House, worked with eight different majority \nleaders, transcribed speeches on everything from the Berlin Wall to \nSenator Byrd's legendary lectures on the history of the Senate.\n  I wish Jerry all the best in his well-deserved retirement. I have no \ndoubt that he and his wife Jane will keep busy spending time with their \n7 children and 11 grandchildren. And, of course, Jerry will have his \nWashington Nationals to follow.\n  It has been a pleasant respite for me to spend time with Jerry \ntalking about baseball. He takes trips around the country that make me \nso envious--watching different teams in different stadiums. I think he \nhas watched a baseball game in almost every Major League Baseball \nstadium in America, and I am very envious of that.\n  The Senate is a better place because of Jerry's 32 years here. I, \nalong with every other Member of this body, thank Jerry for his many \nyears of service.\n\n\n                         Continuing Resolution\n\n  Mr. President, yesterday the House of Representatives passed a \ncontinuing resolution to keep our government from shutting down for the \nnext 3 months. In addition to keeping the government operating, this \nmeasure includes provisions important to our national security, such as \nfunding to combat ISIS--an evil organization--by training and equipping \nvetted Syrian opposition forces and aid to fight the spread of Ebola.\n  It is not perfect; that is for sure. But no legislation is. In this \nera of radical ideologies and endless obstruction, the funding \nresolution before us is infinitely better than the alternatives--\nanother shutdown of our government.\n  I think it speaks volumes that Speaker Boehner, Leader Pelosi, the\n\n[[Page S5726]]\n\nRepublican leader, and I are supporting this legislation. That should \nsay a lot to the American people. As every Senator knows, the funding \nbill we approve must first have passed the House of Representatives, \nand it did that. Breaking up the legislation the House sent us is not a \nviable option at this juncture. We need to complete our work on the \nHouse-passed resolution as soon as possible. We have an agreement in \nplace to vote on this measure no later than 5:30 p.m. this evening. \nWith the cooperation of Senators, we could vote even earlier today.\n  There is one final unanimous consent request.\n\n\n               Authorization To Appoint Escort Committee\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the President of the \nSenate be authorized to appoint a committee on the part of the Senate \nto join with a like committee on the part of the House of \nRepresentatives to escort His Excellency Petro Poroshenko into the \nHouse Chamber for the joint meeting today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Walsh). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Jerry Linnell\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it frequently happens when we head into \na recess that we have to say a reluctant farewell to some member of the \nSenate family. So before I yield the floor, I wish to say a word of \nthanks to Jerry Linnell, who has been a fixture here for more than 3 \ndecades as an official reporter of debates and for the past 15 years as \na somewhat hidden fixture up on the fourth floor as the chief reporter.\n  It is a tough job having to listen to the rest of us drone on every \nday, and as chief reporter Jerry has had the unenviable task of \nreviewing every single word we have said.\n  In his trademark suspenders, Jerry is a friendly and unmistakable \npresence up on the fourth floor, guiding his team through their daily \nrounds and maintaining a level of professionalism and integrity that \nhas always been a key characteristic of the office.\n  It is a proud group. Back in the 1930s Senator Huey Long is said to \nhave donated his own personal Bible to the office so they would have a \nhandy reference when he quoted from it. It quickly became a tradition \nfor new reporters to sign it when they were hired and then once they \nleft.\n  In a sign of how dedicated these reporters are, only 35 names have \nbeen entered in the Bible over the past 80 years. So it is a very \nvenerable fraternity, one that has its roots in article I of the \nConstitution. We thank Jerry for his many, many years of dedicated, \nhonorable service.\n  I know Jerry and his wife Jane look forward to spending more time \nwith their many children and grandchildren. After listening to us for \nall those years, I think he deserves it.\n  You have done your time. You have done it well. The entire Senate \nfamily thanks you. Jerry, all the best.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to ask that Republicans and \nDemocrats in the Senate to come together and unanimously pass \nlegislation to address the threat of American citizens fighting for \nISIS and bringing our statutory system into the 21st century to protect \nthe national security interests of our Nation.\n  As the American people are now painfully aware, the so-called Islamic \nState in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, has emerged as the new face of the \nradical terrorist threat that has bedeviled the West in recent decades. \nThis virulent jihadist group--so extreme they got kicked out of Al \nQaeda, which I will note is not easy to do--is rampaging across Syria \nand Iraq in a campaign of oppression and genocide, including the \nrelentless targeting and murder of Christians, of Jews, of Muslim \nminority sects, Yazidis--indeed, any who do not share their radical \nSunni theology.\n  While other terrorist organizations have been content with a \nparasitic relationship with state sponsors of terrorism--notably Syria \nand Iran--ISIS has a new agenda, which is to establish its own state or \ncaliphate. They now control a territory about the size of Indiana with \noilfields they can exploit on the black market to the tune of some $1.5 \nmillion a day. Their ranks have grown in the last 3 months alone from \nroughly 10,000 to now more than 30,000.\n  Unlike some regional jihadists, ISIS also represents a direct and \ngrowing threat to our citizens here at home, and increasingly to our \nhomeland itself. Just this week there were news reports of an online \nposting urging individual jihadists in the United States to attack \ntargets such as Times Square, the Las Vegas strip, and even locations \nin my home State of Texas, with homemade pipe bombs. This is not the \nfirst time we have heard such threats, but we have to take them \nseriously. ISIS has made no secret that its goal is not simply to \nestablish a caliphate in the Middle East; its desire is to impose \nSharia law on the Muslim population and to exterminate any religious \nminorities, and that desire is not confined by geography. When the \nleader of ISIS, Abu al-Baghdadi, was released from a detention camp in \nIraq in 2009, he reportedly remarked to Army COL Kenneth King, ``See \nyou in New York.'' This danger, this evil intends to come home to \nAmerica.\n  ISIS has in recent weeks graphically demonstrated their eagerness to \nmurder American civilians by beheading two journalists, gruesomely \ndemonstrating on the world stage their hatred for America. This is not \na situation where if we simply leave ISIS alone, they will leave us \nalone. This is a case where America's national security interests \ndemand a serious response, which should be both to attack ISIS directly \nand take them out in its claimed caliphate, as well as to defend \nagainst the attacks ISIS is planning to execute here at home.\n  The Obama administration's approach to this crisis has unfortunately \nlacked a clear focus on that issue. It doesn't help that ISIS is \nsurrounded by regional chaos borne out of a Syrian civil war, and ISIS \nhas exploited the inherent political weakness in Iraq. However, while \nboth the crisis in Syria and the upheaval in Baghdad are unfortunate, \nconcerning situations, we cannot allow resolving them to become \npreconditions to any military action we might need to take against \nISIS.\n  All too often, the Obama administration proposals threaten to become \nembroiled in the midst of these political crises. For example, they \nhave made training and equipping the Free Syrian Army a cornerstone of \ntheir plan to fight ISIS. But just this week, the leader of the Free \nSyrian Army reportedly announced he would not participate in the fight \nagainst ISIS unless we pledged to join in his fight against Syrian \ndictator Bashir al-Assad.\n\n[[Page S5727]]\n\n  While this is certainly understandable from his perspective, \nresolving the Syrian civil war is not our mission nor the job of the \nmilitary and we should not be making the Free Syrian Army, whose focus \nis Assad, central to the American plan of defending our Nation against \nthe jihadist threat of ISIS.\n  The administration's ISIS policy is also marked by internal confusion \nthat further demonstrates a lack of focus on what should be our clear \nmission. The President has repeatedly insisted that there will be no \nAmerican boots on the ground in Iraq and Syria, as he wants any action \nto be led by others, even while he increases U.S. personnel in the \ncountry by a few hundred here and a few hundred there. Earlier this \nweek, his top general, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nadmitted there were circumstances under which he would change his \nadvice to the President to recommending ground troops--a suggestion \nthat was subsequently echoed by the Chief of Staff of the Army and even \nVice President Biden. The American people need and deserve greater \nclarity on what exactly our military mission is, and how what the \nPresident envisions relates to the advice his Department of Defense is \ngiving him.\n  The disconnect between what we know or do not know about the \nAmericans fighting for ISIS in Iraq and Syria is equally concerning. \nEstimates range from about one dozen, according to one Pentagon \nspokesman, to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel's reassertion of about \n100 Americans fighting with ISIS in this week's Senate Armed Services \nCommittee hearing.\n  Either way, Secretary Hagel agreed with my characterization of the \nrisks posed that Americans will take U.S. passports after fighting with \nISIS, after training with ISIS, to come back and commit unspeakable \nacts of terror here at home. Secretary Hagel agreed that risk was \nsignificant. It seems only prudent to address that threat.\n  I am, therefore, going to be asking for unanimous consent for the \nSenate to pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act of 2014, which will make \nfighting for ISIS, taking up arms against the United States, an \naffirmative renunciation of American citizenship.\n  I should note the Expatriate Terrorist Act is very similar to the \nbipartisan legislation proposed by Senators Joe Lieberman and Scott \nBrown in 2010 to address Americans who were joining Al Qaeda overseas, \nnotably the radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, or here at home Faisal \nShahzad, who attempted to blow up a car bomb in Times Square.\n  The Expatriate Terrorist Act thus has applicability beyond the \nimmediate threat of ISIS. It is an important adjustment of our existing \nlaws governing the renunciation of citizenship. To reflect the threat \nposed by nonnation terrorist groups, as then-Secretary of State Hillary \nClinton said concerning the Brown-Lieberman legislation:\n\n       United States citizenship is a privilege. It is not a \n     right. People who are serving foreign powers--\n\n  Or in this case, foreign terrorists--\n\n     are clearly in violation of that oath which they swore when \n     they became citizens.\n\n  The Expatriate Terrorist Act of 2014 is only a very modest change to \ncurrent law. It is one small step in a larger and necessary effort to \nrefocus our ISIS strategy that I urge President Obama to consider \nimmediately.\n  We also urgently need to address the question of border security on \nour southern border so our failure to defend ourselves does not become \na weakness that ISIS and other terrorists exploit to carry out \nunspeakable acts of terror here at home.\n  The American people expect Republicans and Democrats to join together \nto speak in one uniform voice when it comes to protecting the national \nsecurity and when it comes to protecting the lives of Americans here at \nhome.\n  If we do not pass this legislation, the consequence will be that \nAmericans fighting alongside ISIS today may come home tomorrow with a \nU.S. passport, may come home to New York or Los Angeles or Houston or \nChicago. Innocent Americans may be murdered if the Senate does not act \ntoday.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 554, S. 2779. I further ask \nconsent that the bill be read a third time and passed and the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. This bill \nhas not been brought before the Judiciary Committee, which has \njurisdiction over these issues. This bill affects fundamental \nconstitutional rights and should be given the full deliberation of the \nSenate.\n  Legislation that grants the government the ability to strip \ncitizenship from Americans is a serious matter raising significant \nconstitutional issues. Again, we have not had the opportunity to fully \nconsider and register a significant bill.\n\n  In addition, objections to this bill are detailed in two letters, \nboth dated September 2014. The letters are from the bipartisan \nConstitution Project and the American Civil Liberties Union.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     The Constitution Project,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 17, 2014.\n       Dear Senator: On September 5, 2014, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) \n     introduced the Expatriate Terrorist Act (ETA). According to \n     Senator Cruz, the bill is a common sense counterterrorism \n     tool that would strip U.S. citizenship from Americans who \n     fight with or support foreign terrorist organizations working \n     to attack the United States. In fact, the ETA serves \n     virtually no practical purpose, raises serious constitutional \n     concerns, and would do nothing to keep America safe. I urge \n     you to oppose it.\n       Like previous iterations of the same idea, the ETA would \n     amend 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1481(a), which sets out limited \n     circumstances under which U.S. citizens can be denaturalized \n     or expatriated. The bill would add the following to the short \n     list of predicate acts that can result in loss of \n     citizenship: 1) taking an oath of allegiance to a foreign \n     terrorist organization; 2) joining a foreign terrorist \n     organization's armed forces while they are fighting the \n     United States; and 3) ``becoming a member of, or providing \n     training or material assistance to,'' a foreign terrorist \n     organization that the person knows or has reason to know will \n     engage in hostilities or terrorism against the U.S.\n       Senator Cruz has said repeatedly that his bill works an \n     ``affirmative renunciation'' of U.S. citizenship. To the \n     extent he means to suggest that, under the ETA, a person \n     would automatically lose citizenship simply by engaging in \n     the above conduct, he is wrong. The ETA does not and could \n     not achieve that result.\n       Citizenship is a constitutional right, and the Constitution \n     prohibits the government from revoking a person's citizenship \n     against his will under any circumstances. As the Supreme \n     Court has explained, ``the intent of the Fourteenth \n     Amendment, among other things, was to define citizenship . . \n     . [and] that definition cannot coexist with a congressional \n     power to specify acts that work a renunciation of citizenship \n     even absent an intent to renounce. In the last analysis, \n     expatriation depends on the will of the citizen rather than \n     on the will of Congress and its assessment of his conduct.'' \n     As a constitutional right, citizenship can be knowingly and \n     voluntarily waived, but it cannot be taken away from an \n     individual absent such a waiver. Thus, to revoke a person's \n     citizenship the government must prove not only that he \n     committed an expatriating act prescribed in section 1481(a), \n     but also that he did so voluntarily and with the specific \n     intent to relinquish his citizenship.\n       Given these requirements, the ETA will almost certainly \n     result in no additional expatriations. Unless Senator Cruz \n     expects citizens subject to expatriation proceedings freely \n     to admit that they joined or supported a foreign terrorist \n     group specifically intending to renounce their U.S. \n     citizenship, no one will in fact be expatriated. I doubt that \n     government officials would believe it an efficient use of \n     resources to try, especially given the broad reach of \n     existing laws that already provide harsh penalties for U.S. \n     citizens who engage in acts of terrorism.\n       The ETA also raises serious constitutional concerns. The \n     ETA makes membership in or ``providing training or material \n     assistance to'' certain foreign terrorist organizations a \n     predicate act to expatriation. There are two constitutional \n     problems with this provision. First, neither ``training'' nor \n     ``material assistance'' is defined. Similar language in 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2339B was ruled unconstitutionally vague until \n     Congress added specific definitions. Because Congress has not \n     done so here, this provision of the ETA suffers from the same \n     constitutional flaw.\n       Second, unlike other crimes currently listed in section \n     1481(a) that can result in loss of citizenship (see section \n     1481(a)(7)), Senator Cruz's addition does not require proof \n     of a conviction as a prerequisite. As the Constitution \n     Project's Liberty and Security Committee explained in \n     opposing similar past attempts to amend section 1481(a):\n       ``[T]he language of 1481(a)(7) expressly requires a \n     conviction as a necessary prerequisite to denaturalization or \n     expatriation proceedings. This requirement protects the\n\n[[Page S5728]]\n\n     constitutional right of due process, since one cannot \n     actually be said to have committed the acts specified in \n     Sec. 1481(a)(7)--each of which are crimes against the United \n     States--until and unless those acts have been proven to a \n     jury beyond a reasonable doubt. As the Supreme Court \n     expressly held in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, Congress \n     cannot deprive an individual of his or her citizenship as a \n     ``punishment'' absent the procedural safeguards of a criminal \n     trial.''\n       Congress has precious little time left before adjourning \n     until November to decide how and under what authority to \n     address the situation in Iraq and Syria. Members should spend \n     this time debating these grave questions, not preoccupied \n     with needless and likely unconstitutional legislation. In the \n     event that Senator Cruz moves forward with the Expatriate \n     Terrorist Act, I urge you to oppose it.\n           Sincerely,\n     David Cole,\n       Hon. George J. Mitchell Professor in Law and Public Policy \n     at Georgetown University Law Center; co-chair of the \n     Constitution Project's Liberty and Security Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 17, 2014.\n     Re Oppose Cruz Bill S. 2779, Expatriate Terrorists Act; S. \n         2779 Is Unnecessary and Dangerous.\n\n       Dear Senator: The American Civil Liberties Union urges you \n     to refrain from cosponsoring--and oppose if offered--S. 2779, \n     the Expatriate Terrorists Act, which is sponsored by Senator \n     Ted Cruz. The bill would strip U.S. citizenship from \n     Americans who have not been convicted of any crimes, but who \n     are suspected of being involved with designated foreign \n     terrorist organizations. S. 2779 is dangerous because it \n     would attempt to dilute the rights and privileges of \n     citizenship, one of the core principles of the Constitution. \n     As the Supreme Court explained in 1967 in Afroyim v. Rusk, \n     ``the Fourteenth Amendment was designed to, and does, protect \n     every citizen of this Nation against a congressional forcible \n     destruction of his citizenship, whatever his creed, color, or \n     race. . . . [It creates] a constitutional right to remain a \n     citizen in a free country unless he voluntarily relinquishes \n     that citizenship.'' The bill is also unnecessary because \n     existing laws already provide significant penalties for U.S. \n     citizens who engage in acts of terrorism.\n       The Supreme Court has consistently found that citizenship \n     is a fundamental constitutional right that cannot be taken \n     away from U.S.-born citizens unless voluntarily renounced. An \n     already overbroad federal statute, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1481, \n     provides that an American can lose his or her nationality by \n     performing either of the following broad categories of acts \n     with the intention of relinquishing his or her nationality:\n       acts that affirmatively renounce one's American \n     citizenship, such as taking an oath of allegiance to a \n     foreign government or serving as an officer in the armed \n     forces of a foreign nation; or\n       committing crimes such as treason or conspiracy to \n     overthrow the U.S. government, or bearing arms against the \n     United States, ``if and when [the citizen] is convicted \n     thereof by a court martial or by a court of competent \n     jurisdiction.''\n       The Expatriate Terrorists Act would add a new category of \n     expatriating acts--``becoming a member of, or providing \n     training or material assistance to, any designated foreign \n     terrorist organization.'' This implicates several \n     constitutional concerns.\n       First, the material assistance provision added by the bill \n     would treat suspected provision of material assistance as an \n     act that affirmatively renounces one's American citizenship. \n     Thus, unlike treason or conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. \n     government, this provision would not require a prior \n     conviction. It would only require an administrative finding \n     by an unspecified government official that an American is \n     suspected of providing material assistance to a designated \n     foreign terrorist organization with the intention of \n     relinquishing his or her citizenship. This provision would \n     violate Americans' constitutional right to due process, \n     including by depriving them of citizenship based on secret \n     evidence, and without the right to a jury trial and \n     accompanying protections enshrined in the Fifth and Sixth \n     Amendments. In sum, the bill turns the whole notion of due \n     process on its head. Government officials do not have the \n     power to strip citizenship from American citizens who never \n     renounced their citizenship and were never convicted of a \n     crime.\n       Second, the material assistance provision suffers from the \n     same constitutional flaws that plague other material support \n     laws, and goes far beyond what the Supreme Court has held is \n     constitutionally permissible when First and Fourth Amendments \n     rights are at stake. In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court \n     disappointingly ruled in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project \n     that teaching terrorist groups how to negotiate peacefully \n     could be enough to be found guilty of material support. That \n     logic might apply to criminal conduct; it should not cause an \n     American to lose his or her citizenship.\n       For these reasons, the ACLU urges you to refrain from \n     cosponsoring S. 2779, and oppose it if it is offered for a \n     vote. Please contact Arjun Sethi if you have any questions \n     regarding this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Laura Murphy,\n       Director, Washington Legislative Office.\n     Arjun Sethi,\n       Legislative Counsel, Washington Legislative Office.\n\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I object to the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I would note that the objection from my \nfriend from Hawaii observed that this legislation has not gone through \nthe Judiciary Committee, and that is true. It is true, of course, \nbecause the Senate is expected to adjourn this week as Senators return \nto their home States to campaign for elections.\n  If it were to go through the Judiciary Committee, it would mean it \nwould not pass in time to prevent Americans fighting right now with \nISIS from coming back and murdering other Americans. There is an \nurgency and exigency to this situation.\n  This is also legislation the Senate considered before. As I noted, it \nwas bipartisan legislation. Joe Lieberman, Scott Brown, Hillary Clinton \nare all in one accord.\n  It is unfortunate the Democratic Senators chose to object to this, to \nprevent this commonsense change in law. I would note when it comes to \nconstitutional concerns, I don't know if anyone in this Senate has been \nmore vigorous or more consistent in terms of defending the \nconstitutional rights of Americans than I have endeavored to be during \nmy short tenure.\n  I will yield to no one in passion for defending constitutional \nliberties, but I note there is an existing law that has been on the \nbooks for many decades covering the renunciation of U.S. citizenship.\n  It is current law right now that if someone goes and joins a foreign \nnation and takes up arms against America, that act has long been \nrecognized as constituting a constructive renunciation of U.S. \ncitizenship. As for the question of due process, existing law provides \ndue process that an individual who goes and takes up arms with ISIS--\nand all this does is treat ISIS, a nonstate terrorist group, on the \nsame footing as taking up arms with a foreign nation against America. \nIt is a recognition of the changed circumstances of this world that \nmany of the gravest threats facing this country are not coming from \nnation states but are coming from terrorist groups that sadly some \nAmericans are choosing to join forces. The existing law has \nconsiderable due process protection such that anyone who is determined \nto have affirmatively renounced his or her citizenship has a right to \nchallenge that in Federal district court and a full proceeding under \nexisting due process standards to have that matter resolved.\n  The question is very simple: Would any reasonable person want an \nAmerican who is right now in Iraq, who is right now training with ISIS, \nwho is right now taking up arms, who is right now participating in \ncrucifying Christians, who is right now beheading children, who is \nright now participating in beheading two American journalists, who is \nright now standing arm in arm with virulent terrorists who have pledged \nto take jihad to America--would anyone in good conscience of either \nparty want that person to be able to come back and land at La Guardia \nAirport with a U.S. passport and walk unmolested onto our streets? The \nobvious answer is no.\n  It saddens me we could not see Republicans and Democrats come \ntogether, and it saddens me that in an election year the Democratic \nSenator, who is up for reelection, chose to block this commonsense \nlegislation rather than to work together to protect the American \ncitizens.\n  I hope in time we see less election-year politics and more service to \nthe men and women whom all of us are obliged to protect.\n  I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On a different matter, today the Senate will consider \nHouse legislation to fund the government and address the threats of \nEbola and ISIL.\n  These are important issues. Many Members on both sides plan to \nsupport this legislation. I know others have some concerns too. I \nunderstand those concerns. I share some of them, but while no bill is \nperfect, I believe this legislation is worth supporting.\n\n  I would like to thank my fellow Kentuckian, Representative Hal \nRogers, for his leadership and work on this bill because it does a lot \nof important things and all without raising discretionary spending. It \nwould reauthorize important counternarcotics operations that help keep \nour children and communities safe and it would extend the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act until December, giving us a chance to secure a permanent \nextension.\n  It would block some of the administration's discretionary policies \nagainst Kentucky coal and help address the administration's veterans \ncrisis by providing more resources to address the backlog and \ninvestigations into potential wrongdoing that is a positive step toward \nthe more comprehensive reforms Republicans would like to see.\n  Critically, the legislation would provide authorization to train and \nequip a moderate Syrian opposition ground force, a key component of the \nPresident's efforts to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat ISIL.\n  While I am concerned about the ability of the coalition to generate \nsufficient combat power to defeat ISIL within Syria, I do support the \nPresident's proposal to begin the program. The authorization is of \nlimited duration and it now contains important reporting requirements \nthat will allow Congress to assess and oversee this program to measure \nwhether the mission is actually being accomplished.\n  The Ebola crisis is another area where the President deserves \ncongressional support. As you know, he recently announced several \nmessages to contain the spread of the disease in Africa and prevent it \nfrom reaching our shores.\n  Accordingly, the bill contains additional resources to support \nresearch and bolster our Nation's effort in assisting Africa to manage \nthis growing crisis.\n  In summary, this isn't perfect legislation, but it begins to address \nmany of our constituents' top concerns without raising discretionary \nspending. It positions us for better solutions in the months to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 35 \nminutes for the purposes of engaging in a colloquy with my colleagues \non the issue of the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tomorrow is the sixth anniversary of the \napplication for approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline. Six years. Six \nyears ago, September 19, 2008, the TransCanada company applied for a \npermit for approval to cross the Canadian border to build the Keystone \nXL Pipeline from Hardisty, Canada, down to Cushing and ultimately the \ngulf coast, to provide not only oil from Canada but to move oil from \nStates such as my State of North Dakota, of light, sweet Bakken crude, \noil from Montana, to our refineries here in the United States. Six \nyears ago, that application was filed, effective tomorrow. So we are \nhere today to talk about the need not only for a decision on the \nKeystone XL Pipeline but for approval of this vitally important \nproject.\n  The reality is we can make this country energy secure, energy \nindependent, working with our closest friend and ally, Canada. But to \ndo it we not only need to develop all of our resources, our energy \nresources in this country, and work with Canada as they develop their \nenergy resources, but we need the infrastructure to safely, \neffectively, efficiently, dependably move that energy to where it is \nneeded, to our consumers.\n  That is what the Keystone XL Pipeline project is all about. This is \ntruly about building the roads, the rails, the pipelines, the \ntransmission, the energy infrastructure we need as a vital part of our \nenergy plan for this country. We have bipartisan support. We have 57 \nSenators who support this legislation--57. The reality is I think by \nnext year we will have 60.\n  So while we sit here and wait--now for 6 years, effective tomorrow 6 \nyears, waiting for a decision from the President on the Keystone XL \nPipeline--ultimately I believe this decision will be made by the \nAmerican people, as it always is and as it always should be. Because I \nbelieve that after these elections in November as we go into next year \nwe will not only have 57 Senators who support this project, we will \nhave over 60.\n  Then Congress will pass legislation, a bill that we have submitted, a \nbipartisan bill we have pending before this body right now. We will \npass it. We will attach it to something the President will not veto. \nThe House has already passed this legislation. Because over 70 percent, \nI think in the most recent poll, of the American people want this \nproject. They want this project approved.\n  So here after 6 years--we are going to talk about some of the history \nof this and all of the work we have done. But before I do that, I want \nto turn to my colleague from Wyoming, somebody who is incredibly \nknowledgeable when it comes to energy, somebody who has worked on \nenergy in all different aspects, somebody who truly understands that, \nlook, for the benefit of the American people to build our energy future \nwe not only need to produce that energy, we need the infrastructure to \ntransport it safely, effectively, and well.\n  I wish to call on the Senator from Wyoming for his remarks on this \nsixth anniversary of the application, waiting for approval, waiting for \na decision from the administration on the Keystone XL Pipeline, for his \nthoughts and for his comments. I turn to the good Senator from Wyoming.\n  Can the Senator give us his thoughts as to why this project is still \nawaiting a decision from the administration, after the President told \nus, told our caucus last year, at a caucus we had here in an adjacent \nroom, that we would have a decision by the end of 2013, why we are here \nstill awaiting a decision on behalf of the American people?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I appreciate and want to salute the \nsignificant leadership we have seen on this issue from the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. He has been a stalwart fighter, very focused on this \nissue, and focused on putting together a bipartisan coalition of \nsupporters. Americans want the jobs, they want the energy, they want \naction. We have an opportunity, but we have been waiting 6 long years.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is absolutely right. It was at a \nmeeting in the Republican conference where the President of the United \nStates came in. I asked the specific question: When will we expect an \nanswer so we can get moving with the jobs and the energy that \nthe American people are asking for?\n\n  President Obama said: Well, by the end of the year. He said that \nalmost a year and a half ago. It was the end of the year 2013 that the \npromise was going to be fulfilled. Now here we are halfway--beyond \nhalfway--through 2014. Nothing yet. Not a thing from the White House, a \nWhite House held hostage by environmental extremists who are trying to \nblock important jobs and important energy and this important project.\n  We are here in the Senate today and the majority leader is ready to \nclose this place down until after the elections. He closed it down--if \nyou count the number of days from the beginning\n\n[[Page S5730]]\n\nof August, all through August, a few days in session in September, but \nmost of September not in session, and then all of October up through \nthe election, you are talking 3 months, with the Senate in session for \njust 2 weeks. It is embarrassing. Where is the accountability? We are \nsure not getting it from the majority leader. The majority leader ought \nto bring this for a vote today. But he is not going to. He is going to \nshut down the Senate today, making sure these jobs are not there, that \nthe energy is not there for the American people. The Keystone XL \nPipeline bipartisan support is an excellent example of a project that \ncould help us from the standpoint of energy security, from the \nstandpoint of economic growth, the standpoint of helping our economy \ngetting people back to work.\n  But yet the majority leader is not going to allow a vote today, 6 \nyears in the waiting on this specific important project. I would say to \nmy friend and colleague from North Dakota, I know our friends and \ncolleagues from Oklahoma and Georgia are here on the floor. I want to \nhear their comments as well. I salute the Senator from North Dakota for \nhis continued leadership, for his focus, and for continuing to work to \nmake America better, in terms of jobs, in terms of the economy, and in \nterms of energy. I know the Senator will not stop until we finally get \nthis project approved, completed, and constructed.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I wish to thank the Senator from Wyoming for his \ndiligence and for his work. This is a bipartisan issue. We have \nlegislation now with 57 supporters that is pending before this body. In \nfact, we have passed this legislation. We actually had passed very \nsimilar legislation, different only in the respect that it called on \nthe President to make a decision--this was back in 2012. I think we had \n73 votes on this issue. The difference is, the pending bill we have \nprovides congressional approval because the President once again \ndelayed the decision when we passed legislation calling on him to make \nthe decision earlier. So now we have come back with binding \nlegislation, after doing congressional research. This bill makes the \ndecision congressionally under the commerce clause that gives Congress \nthe ability to oversee commerce with foreign nations.\n  Simply what this does is we say to our closest friend and ally, \nCanada--TransCanada is a Canadian company--that: Yes, you can cross the \nborder with this pipeline, which is the latest, greatest technology we \nhave for pipeline transport.\n  Let me show one other chart here, so people understand. When we are \ntalking about pipelines, oil and gas pipelines in this country, this \ngives you a little sense of the pipelines we have--thousands of \npipelines, millions of miles of pipelines that move oil and gas around \nthe country, from where it is produced to the consumers who very much \nneed it. So that gives you a sense of all of the pipelines we have.\n  Now we are talking about one that has the latest and greatest \ntechnology that we are seeking to get approved. To put this into some \ncontext, the project we are seeking to have approved is the Keystone XL \nPipeline. The reason XL is because the Keystone Pipeline is this \npipeline here, which goes from Hardisty up in Alberta down to the \nPatoka, IL, area as well as Cushing. That is the Keystone Pipeline. So \nI want to make sure there is no confusion. That is the Keystone \nPipeline. That was approved in 2 years and built in 2 years.\n  So in 2006 the TransCanada company--I was Governor of North Dakota at \nthat time. You can see it runs right through North Dakota. Obviously \nthese things are immensely important. We are now the second largest \noil-producing State in the Nation. We produce over 1 million barrels of \noil a day--light sweet crude, second only to Texas. We have to get that \nto our markets and to refineries.\n  I started working on these projects when I was Governor. In 2006, \nTransCanada applied for approval of the Keystone Pipeline. Originally \nthat was supposed to carry 640,000 barrels a day. I think it now \ncarries 750,000 barrels a day. That application was applied for in \n2006. It was approved in 2008. The pipeline was built and came online 2 \nyears later. So 2 years to permit, and 2 years to build--4 years total.\n\n  When TransCanada applied for a second permit in 2008 for a sister \npipeline, Keystone XL, it seemed pretty logical that it was going to be \napproved, particularly when the initial project had been approved in 2 \nyears, built in 2 years. This is the actual pipeline infrastructure we \nhave. When they wanted to build the sister pipeline, 830,000 barrels a \nday, it seemed kind of pretty logical they would go through the process \nand get it approved.\n  On September 19, 2008, they applied for that approval to move oil \nfrom Hardisty, pick up additional oil in North Dakota, Montana, take it \ndown to Cushing and down to the refineries in the gulf, and get oil \nover to the refineries in Louisiana. September, 19, 2008. Tomorrow is \nSeptember 19, 2014. Six years later, no decision.\n  I wish to turn to my colleague, the senior Senator from the great \nState of Oklahoma. Cushing is a hub for oil from all over the country. \nIt is vital that we are able to move oil in and out of there, because \nthat is a huge transition point between where we produce oil, including \nour region, but from all over the country and Canada and move it to \nrefineries where it is distributed throughout the country. So we need \nto be able to move product in and out of Cushing, which is truly a hub \nfor the Nation. That is exactly what this pipeline does.\n  I would turn to the senior Senator from Oklahoma. I would ask him: \nWhy in the world, given what I have described here--we have thousands \nof pipelines, millions of miles of these pipelines. We have to get \nproduct from where it is produced to refineries and to our consumers. \nWe cannot put it all on rail or you create incredible congestion that \nleads to accidents and backlogs in shipping of other products. This is \nthe latest, greatest technology for pipelines, for the transport of \noil.\n  Why in the world--what rationale would there be not to approve this \npipeline?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me say first of all to leave that \nchart up, because it shows very clearly that I might have the biggest \ndog in this fight. I do not know. But I will say that Cushing, OK, has \nmore pipelines coming through, throughout the United States, than any \nother city in America. That is where they all come through.\n  A few minutes ago the Senator from Wyoming was talking about what the \nPresident said less than a year ago, that he was going to be \ncooperating, we are going to do this thing, it will be the best thing \nfor America. He has not done it. But I will tell you what is worse than \nthat. This right here: because of this pipeline, the hub we have in \nCushing, OK--the President went to Cushing, OK; this was about a year \nago--over 2 years ago he did--he went there to affirm to the American \npeople that he is going to do all he can to make sure this pipeline \nbecomes a reality. Read this, I ask my friend from North Dakota. It \nsays:\n\n       I am directing my administration to make this project a \n     priority, to go ahead and get it done.\n\n  He has made this--I am not going to use the L word because it sounds \ndisrespectful, and I lose credibility when I do that. He is saying \nsomething that is not true. He moved from that, and he has done \neverything since that time to destroy the pipeline.\n\n  That was when they were talking about the southern leg. Well, \nobviously the southern leg is not a problem because the southern leg \ndoes not cross an international border, so the President couldn't stop \nthat even if he wanted to. So he was taking credit for that, but he is \ncertainly underestimating the people of Oklahoma. In fact, nobody \nshowed up when he was there. So that portion between Canada and Cushing \nis where the problem began.\n  I am going to throw out something very briefly. I also did this \nyesterday on the floor, but I think it is important.\n  There is a new surge of opposition to this that wasn't there before \nthis happened. Tom Steyer is a very fine person, I am sure--I don't \nknow him--but Tom Steyer has put up $100 million--his words, not mine--\n$50 million of his own money, to do two things. One is to resurrect \nglobal warming, which is dead. If we read the polls today, people have \ncaught on. It is now No. 14 out of 15 of the environmental concerns, \naccording to all the polling data. So he is trying to bring that up \nagain. The second thing he is trying to do is stop the Keystone \nPipeline.\n\n[[Page S5731]]\n\n  I say to my friend from North Dakota, and I don't want to sound \ndisrespectful, but $50 million of that is his own money, and he has \nthat out there right now. I am going to quote him:\n\n       It is true that we expect to be heavily involved in the \n     midterm elections.\n\n  Fifty million of his own money.\n\n       We are looking at a bunch of . . . races. . . . My guess is \n     that we'll end up being involved in 8 or even more races.\n\n  The Keystone Pipeline would create 42,000 jobs and tens of thousands \nmore. If you look at my State of Oklahoma, about one-third of all those \njobs are in the State of Oklahoma.\n  Keystone is just the tip of the iceberg. When we look at this chart, \nwe can see all of the domestic energy resources that are being \ndeveloped around the county right now. We are going through a shale \nrevolution, and the only thing getting in its way is the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Look at this next chart. I can remember back when people considered \nthe only oil States to be west of the Mississippi, the Western United \nStates. But with the Marcellus coming through, you could argue--and I \nhave seen the argument in the State of Pennsylvania, for example--it \nprovides the second-most jobs in that State. Yet they need to be aware \nthat this is what is happening in the United States.\n  If we look at this map, it shows what we could do if we also had the \nFederal lands included in that. In fact, one of the shocking things we \nhear when we talk about the Federal lands is that in the past 6 years--\nand that is since President Obama has been there, and he has done \neverything he could to retard the progress of oil and gas since he came \nto office. The production on State lands is up 61 percent--that is in 6 \nyears, up 61 percent--and natural gas is up 33 percent. However, on \nFederal lands--land the President can affect--oil production is down 6 \npercent. How can production be up 61 percent on State lands and down 6 \npercent on Federal lands? I think that shows the commitment that is \nthere.\n\n  ICF International is a well-respected consulting firm. It is not \nRepublican or Democratic. They recently released a report that says \nU.S. companies will need to invest $641 billion over the next 20 years \nin infrastructure to keep up with growing oil and gas production. What \ndoes that mean for jobs? According to the analysis, spending on these \nnew pipelines alone will create 432,000 new jobs. It goes on and on \ntalking about this.\n  I asked the same question: How could it be--6 years ago I thought \nthat this was a piece of cake, that this was going to be done. What is \nthe argument against it? There are people who fight against fossil \nfuels. That is alive and well. But they know they are going to be \nproducing it anyway, and if it goes to China--and there are already \ndiscussions; that is public record--if it gets to China, they are going \nto have to go through the refining process, and they don't have any \nrestrictions on emissions in China. So the argument is that if they do \nit, there are going to be more emissions--if they find that to be so \noffensive--than if we do it here in the United States where we have the \ncapability to produce and have the jobs here.\n  When I go back to Oklahoma, people say: What are the arguments \nagainst it? I try to explain the argument they are using, but they \ndon't buy it. Of course, I am in Oklahoma talking to normal people.\n  Anyway, good luck. We are going to do all we can do to make this a \nreality. We are going to win this eventually, but I am afraid we have \nthe opposition of this administration, and unless we get that turned \naround, we will have to wait for another President.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I would like to thank the Senator from Oklahoma and pick \nup on a point he made very well. He made of number of points that are \nextremely compelling, but one of the points he made is that overall, \nsince about 2008, 2009, that area, our oil production in America is up \n40 percent. So people say: Well, we are producing 40 percent more oil \nthan we did in 2008, the end of 2008, so that is good. That is reducing \nthe amount of oil we have to import into this country. We were below 50 \npercent. Now we are closing in on 60 percent and more oil that we \nproduce. Together with Canada and Mexico, we are up over 75 percent, in \nterms of the oil that we consume, we produce in this country or get, as \nI say, from our closest allies and working on getting to 80 percent.\n  Well, people would say that is very good, but the Senator from \nOklahoma made a very important point. Understand that is because we are \nup 60 percent in oil production on private land--on private land. We \nare actually down in terms of our production on public land; we are \ndown between 6 and 7 percent. So when you net the two, we are up about \n40 percent, but that is because we are up about 60 percent on private \nland.\n  I will give an example of how that works on the ground. In North \nDakota 90 percent of the land is privately owned, so our oil production \nis growing tremendously. As I said, we are at about 1.1 million barrels \na day and on our way to 1.4 million barrels a day in a few more years.\n  In Alaska, on the other hand, production is going down because their \nland is 90 percent public land and a very small percentage is private \nland. They can't get the permits and they can't build the \ninfrastructure, so the amount of oil they produce is declining. The \nAlaskan pipeline can carry 2 million barrels of oil a day. It is down \nto less than 600,000 and declining. This is at a time when we are still \ngetting oil from the Middle East and we are dealing with entities like \nISIL, with terrorism, and with instability. How can we continue to be \ndependent on getting oil from the Middle East when we can produce that \noil right here in our country and in Canada? I would ask the good \nSenator from Oklahoma to comment for a moment on the technology that is \nenabling us to do so.\n  Hydraulic fracturing--I think the first well hydraulically fractured \nin this country was in about the 1950s in Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. My friend is correct. It was 1948 in Duncan, OK.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. So I ask my friend from Oklahoma to talk for a minute \nabout the technology and what that means for the future of this country \nand energy security.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling are to be \ncredited for this shale revolution we are going through now. We hear \nthis administration--knowing the American people want to use this \nabundance of good, clean, natural gas and oil--sounding supportive of \nthat, but he has done everything he can to retard our efforts to \ncontinue to use, as we have since 1948, hydraulic fracturing.\n  This is interesting because the first Director of the EPA who was \nchosen and confirmed during the Obama administration was Lisa Jackson. \nI asked her the question live on TV during one of our committee \nhearings--I said: Hydraulic fracturing--people are creating problems \nwith this. Yet we have never had a problem, and it all started in my \nState of Oklahoma. Has there ever been a documented case of groundwater \ncontamination with hydraulic fracturing?\n\n  Her answer, I say to my good friend from North Dakota, was no.\n  So we have the Obama administration saying there is no problem with \nit. Yet they are doing everything they can to federalize jurisdiction \nover hydraulic fracturing, with the idea that would make it much more \ndifficult to take advantage of this revolution we are in the middle of.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I again thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Since 1948, with the first well hydraulically fractured--there have \nbeen no cases of contamination since 1948. We are now using this \nhydraulic fracturing with the latest new greatest technology where, on \none pad, on one what we call eco-pad, we will now drill down as many as \n18 wells. These wells will have--we go 2 miles underground, and then we \ndrill laterals 3 miles long. Eighteen wells all on one site. Think of \nhow much we have reduced the environmental footprint with that \ntechnology. Think of how much less ground disturbance there is. You are \ncovering 1,280 acres. In the old days--and again maybe my friend from \nOklahoma would like to think of how many wells they would have had to \ndrill and how much infrastructure and well derricks and pumpers they \nwould have to have all over the landscape, and now we do it on one pad \ncovering 1,280 acres going out 3 miles in all directions from one eco-\npad. So it is not just about energy,\n\n[[Page S5732]]\n\nI would say to my friend from Oklahoma, it is also better environmental \nstewardship.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is also about technology. All of the environmentalists \nor extreme environmentalists who are trying to stop or fighting this \nwar against fossil fuels, they ought to be rejoicing that we have this \ntechnology now.\n  When we talk about the number of wells, it it is now past 1 million \nwells that have been drilled using hydraulic fracturing. By their own \nadmission, there has never been one documented case of groundwater \ncontamination. So the answer is that there is no reason not to do it.\n  This is our opportunity to be independent. We could be independent in \na matter of weeks if we had the opportunity to export.\n  It is not just private land, it is private and State land. All of the \nincrease we have had, the 63 percent we talk about, is all private and \nState land. How is it possible that increase could take place on State \nland while on Federal land it goes down 6 percent? That tells the whole \nstory.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I have one more question for my friend from Oklahoma \nbefore I turn to my good friend from the State of Georgia.\n  Answer, please, if you would. As we produce this energy \ndomestically--so we are producing energy here, we are creating jobs, we \nare creating economic activity, we are creating revenue without raising \ntaxes from a growing economy. We are helping national security because \nwe are not getting oil from the Middle East or Venezuela or places that \nare hostile to our interests. Now we are talking about environmental \nstewardship. We are talking about minimizing the footprint with these \nnew technologies. Why would we not want to move that product as safely \nas possible, with the latest, greatest type of pipeline, with the best \ntechnology and the most safeguards? Why isn't that an environmentally \nsound decision as well?\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have often said and many of the people who are very \nconscious about the environment--as I am and others--have said this is \nthe answer. I remember years ago when I was very young, I worked in the \noilfields. I can remember there were small wells all over and, of \ncourse, at that time there wasn't an effort. Now they have cleaned \nthings up, and nothing is greater in terms of the technology that has \ncome along for the environment than what we have experienced.\n  When we think about what is happening all over the world--I am glad \nthe Senator mentioned this--with ISIS and all of these problems we have \nright now, I believe we are facing a greater threat right now \nmilitarily than we have before. And that is where a lot of our energy \nis coming from, and it doesn't have to.\n  A good friend of the Senator and a good friend of mine named Harold \nHamm--he is from Oklahoma, but he does a lot of work up there--I asked \nhim a question in relation to the President repeatedly saying: Well, if \nwe were to go ahead and develop this on Federal lands, it would take 10 \nyears before that would reach the economy.\n  I was going to be on an unfriendly TV show, and I called up Harold \nHamm and I said: Harold, I am going to ask you a question, and be \ncareful in the way you answer it because I am going to use your name \nand your answer on nationwide TV. If you were set up someplace like New \nMexico on Federal land that had not been touched before, how long would \nit take that first barrel of oil to reach the economy?\n  Without hesitating, he said: Seventy days.\n  I said: Seventy days? Well, that is 10 weeks, not 10 years.\n  Then he went on to say what would happen each week for those 10 \nweeks. I have never been refuted since we used that.\n  In addition to all the arguments we are using, just think about what \nour oil independence, our energy independence could be in this country. \nIt is all there for the taking. This is the key element to make that a \nreality.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma, who has been a leader \nin energy for so many years.\n  This morning we were addressed by the President of Ukraine. Look at \ntheir situation. Because they haven't developed their own energy \nresources and because they don't have their own infrastructure, they \nare now dependent--Ukraine is dependent, along with most of the \nEuropean Union, on Russia for their energy.\n  They get more than one-third of their energy from Russia. So at the \nsame time that Russia is invading Ukraine, the European Union is \nreluctant to stand with the United States and our other allies on \nstrong sanctions to prevent that type of aggression. Why? Because they \nget their energy from Russia.\n  So when we talk about building the infrastructure we need in this \ncountry to work with our closest friend and ally, Canada, to make sure \nwe are energy secure and that we do not need to get energy from places \nsuch as the Middle East or Venezuela or other places that may have \ninterests that are antithetical to ours, think about how important it \nis for the security of our country with what is going on in the Middle \nEast with ISIL, and see what is going on in Ukraine and Eastern Europe, \nand Russian aggression.\n  So I turn to our colleague from Georgia, who has also been a staunch \nsupporter of this project, and ask him what is going on in terms of \nnational security, the situation we face today, and why in the world \nwould we not be building--not only producing our energy resources in \nthis country but deploying these new technologies we are talking about \nthat produce energy with better environmental stewardship and building \nthe infrastructure to move it to our refineries and move it to our \nconsumers.\n  Why are we waiting 6 years for a decision that would enable us to do \nthat very thing on behalf of the American people?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I am pleased to join with the distinguished Senator from \nthe State of North Dakota, and I am pleased to join with the Senator of \nOklahoma.\n  I am pleased to speak as an American from a State that is a net \nconsumer, not producer, of energy. The Senator's State is a great \nproducer of energy. Senator Inhofe's State is a great producer of \nenergy. Georgia is a great consumer. We don't have a lot of oil or \nnatural gas or coal, but I am here because I have a lot of experience \nin my lifetime--a lot of it with national security issues and with \neconomic issues. Our ability or our failure to approve the Keystone \nPipeline and fracking is, very simply, professional malpractice.\n  I wish to refresh everybody's memory. This is the sixth anniversary \nof a letter to the President of the United States. Do we know what it \nis the 35th anniversary of? The Arab oil embargo.\n  I was a real estate salesman in 1970 when something called the misery \nindex was developed. Does the Senator know what the misery index was? \nWe had double-digit inflation, double-digit unemployment, and double-\ndigit interest rates. Why? Because the Arab oil embargo in the middle \n1970s brought America to its knees.\n  This real estate agent salesman used to have to wait for 2 hours in a \nline at an ExxonMobil station with a $10 bill to get my ration of \ngasoline in the 1970s. Why? Because we depended on the Middle East and \nOPEC to supply us with energy.\n  We sit here on the cusp of being a net producer of energy. We can use \nit in our national defense, we can use it in our national security, and \nwe can use it in our economy. If we produced the energy that we know we \nhave available to us, and if we bring in the energy safely and \nenvironmentally soundly, as we know we have available to us, we can \nrule our foreign policy and our economy based on our own strength and \nnot as dependents on anybody else.\n  Thirty-five years ago is not just a time of the misery index, but it \nwas a time of failed U.S. foreign policy. Remember, it was the late \n1970s when the Iranians took the American Embassy hostage in Iran and \nfor 445 days held the strongest military power in the world hostage. \nWhy? In large measure because they controlled petroleum to our country. \nSo it is a national security threat.\n  When the President of the Ukraine spoke today, he didn't say this, \nbut I will say it: If America was producing the oil and energy it could \nwith the Keystone Pipeline and with fracking, if we were exporting to \nforeign countries, we could replace Russia in a heartbeat and be the \nnet supplier of energy to the Ukraine and to Germany.\n\n[[Page S5733]]\n\n  So it is important to the national security of our country and the \nemployment of our people and the soundness of our economy that we do \nhydraulic fracking for our natural gas in Haynesville and Marcellus, \nand that we bring the pipeline oil from Canada-Keystone XL Pipeline in \nto Houston and refine that petroleum with gasoline and energy for our \npeople.\n  The pipeline, to the Senator from North Dakota, is very interesting. \nI ran the State Board of Education in Georgia for years. By law we \ncouldn't build a public school in Georgia if it was within 2,000 feet \nof an underground pipeline. It is hard in Atlanta, GA, to find a piece \nof land that isn't within 2,000 feet of an underground pipeline. Today \nAmerica's energy and petroleum flows rapidly and safely and \nenvironmentally soundly in pipelines.\n\n  If we weren't using pipelines and we were bringing it on railcars or \ntrucks, we would be producing carbon out the kazoo because those \nengines would burn petroleum to get the petroleum to Houston. By using \nthe pipeline, it is safe, it is sound, and it is secure.\n  I think it is basically professional malpractice for this country to \nfail to approve the Keystone Pipeline or fracking because it hurts our \nnational defense, it makes us dependent on people we shouldn't be \ndependent on, it hurts our economy, and one day the misery index could \ncome back. If it comes back, it will be because we are held hostage by \nour own failed policy, not because somebody held us hostage because \nthey were strong.\n  I want a strong America. I want an America that has strong \nleadership. I don't want to be a part of any professional malpractice. \nI want to be a part of seeking the best for our American people--\nbringing energy to our American people, and being the most competitive \neconomy in the world today.\n  I appreciate the distinguished Senator from North Dakota for yielding \nme the time.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Georgia for his \nstrong support and his clear understanding of why we need this project \nand for putting the focus on national security.\n  In poll after poll two-thirds of Americans support this project. I \nthink in the final analysis the American people will make a decision \nhere. If the President after 6 years refuses to make a decision, \nclearly his strategy is to defeat this project with endless delays, \njust defeat by delay. So here we are in year 6 of the application \nprocess.\n  I would turn to my colleague from Georgia and ask his thoughts on \nthis body's ability to step up and make the decision and approve this \nproject on behalf of the American people. What does the Senator \nforesee? We have 57 who have signed on now. I believe we will get to \n60. What is the Senator's sense of our ability to get this done for the \nAmerican people?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. If, before we left today and had a final vote on the CR, \nthe majority leader would let a vote come to the floor to get 60 votes \nto go ahead and move forward on the Keystone Pipeline, in my belief it \nwould happen. For all the reasons I stated and what the American people \nwant and all the reasons the Senator stated, I quite frankly do not \nunderstand why one single person in this administration would hold back \nthe Keystone Pipeline.\n  Correct me if I am wrong, but the State Department has five times \napproved it; is that not correct?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. That is absolutely correct. We have the dates of the \napproval of five different environmental impact statements right here, \nall finding no significant environmental impact.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. So that is No. 1.\n  No. 2, there is no question that being independent in energy makes us \na stronger country in terms of our national defense and our foreign \npolicy; is that not correct?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. That is correct.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. No. 3, we will have more jobs, more employment, less \ninflation, and a more vibrant economy if we were developing this \npetroleum; is that not correct?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. That is correct.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Then I think, knowing the quality and the intellect of \nthe 100 Members of the Senate, there is no doubt that if the leader \nwould bring that vote to the floor today, we would get more than 60 \nvotes to move America forward and say: This Congress is ready to act. \nWe are not in professional malpractice; we in fact are doing good for \nthe American people. We want energy and we want it now.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the good Senator from Georgia.\n  I understand that our time has expired. I ask unanimous consent for 1 \nminute to wrap up this colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. On the facts and on the merits--which is how we have to \nmake decisions for the American people--this is a project about energy, \nproducing energy here at home so we don't have to get it from the \nMiddle East. We know what is going on with the Middle East with ISIL \nand other organizations that are creating huge problems and that are a \ndanger not only to this country but to the world.\n  It is about energy here at home and working with our closest friend \nand ally, Canada. It is about jobs. The State Department itself says \nmore than 40,000 jobs are created with this project. It is about \neconomic activity, a $5.3 billion project and not one penny of Federal \nspending, just private investment. It is about national security, as we \nhave talked about.\n  But it is also about congestion on our rails. It is about making sure \nwe don't try to move all this oil on rail so we have so much \ncongestion, we have accidents, and we have seen that happen. It is \nabout harvest and moving ag products from the heartland throughout the \ncountry. It is about using the latest, greatest technology to make sure \nwe produce more energy more dependably and with better environmental \nstewardship than without the project.\n  Six years. It is time for this body to step forward on behalf of the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5733-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5733-S5734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MATTERS OF WAR AND PEACE\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I don't think we should adjourn and go \nhome with matters of war and peace in front of us.\n  This Senator certainly intends to support the appropriations bill, \nthe continuing resolution necessary to keep the government functioning. \nBut one of the issues in this continuing resolution is the \nauthorization in order to start training the Free Syrian Army in Saudi \nArabia, and this Senator certainly supports that.\n  But the issues beyond just that training are very much in front of \nus, which involves the United States protecting our national security \nby going after ISIS--or ISIL or whatever you want to call them. It is \nthe group that has already declared war on us. Day by day we see their \nefforts, and then we hear their statements that they want to fly the \nblack flag of ISIS over the White House. What more do we need to know \nabout the national security being threatened?\n  Today in a joint session we heard a very inspiring and emotional \nspeech by the President of Ukraine. He so poignantly pointed out how \nRussia has invaded eastern Ukraine, and it is the Russian Army against \nthe Ukrainian Army. We certainly should be helping them as well, as we \nare, but it needs to be more.\n  So, too, the national security of the United States is definitely \nthreatened by ISIS. As I have said over and over, I believe the \nPresident has the constitutional authority to strike ISIS in Syria, as \nhe already has in northern Iraq, and that is under his constitutional \nduty as Commander in Chief. But this is not going to be a strike for a \nfew days; this is going to be a long effort to degrade and defeat--to \nuse the President's words--this threat to America.\n  So here the Congress of the United States is going to adjourn in the \nmiddle of September; and, as I calculate, starting tomorrow it is 55 \ndays until we would return. We need to be talking about war and peace. \nWe need to be talking about the Congress exercising its constitutional \nauthority to give the authority to the President for this long-term \neffort. The Senate has heard our colleague Senator Tim Kaine of \nVirginia speak very passionately about this. He believes it very \nfirmly. I only disagree with Senator Kaine to the point that I believe \nthe President has\n\n[[Page S5734]]\n\nthe authority to strike now to protect the interests of the United \nStates--and I expect President Obama will do that. I am talking about \nin Syria.\n  It is clear the President has already appropriately started the \nattacks, and has done it very well and successfully in the Kurdish \nregion and other regions of northern Iraq, and that will continue as \nthe President feels he has the authority, and I happen to agree. But \nwhen it comes to Syria--and that is where the head of the ISIS snake \nis; and if you are going to kill the snake, you have to go to where the \nhead is and chop it off--I think it is a mistake for us to go home. I \nthink it sends a very bad message not only to our countrymen, but it \nsends a very bad message to our allies and to our enemies. The opposite \nmessage would be sent if we would discuss these matters and come \ntogether with a resolution of an authorization for the use of military \nforce and to have that clearly stating that the United States is \nunified to go after this insidious, evil, brutal, uncivil kind of \nforce. It would send a message of unity not only to our allies, to this \ncountry of ours, but to our enemies.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, what is the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in a period of morning business with \nSenators allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able \nto speak until I conclude. It may go over that time, but not by much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5734-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5734-S5735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONTINUING RESOLUTION AND ISIL\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you so much, Madam President.\n  I am here because I want to respond to the colloquy that was held on \nthe Keystone Pipeline, but before I go there, I do want to make remarks \nabout the very important vote we are going to be taking today both to \nkeep the government open and to give the President the ability to train \nand equip vetted Syrian moderates so they can help us take the fight to \nISIL.\n  It is my privilege to serve on the Foreign Relations Committee. I \nhave served on it for a very long time, and yesterday we had an \nimportant hearing where the Secretary of State laid out the President's \nplans for how we are going to meet this threat posed by ISIL.\n  I have to say, before I explain the three options you have as an \nAmerican as far as which option you embrace, I think I need to lay out \nthe view of this organization ISIL or ISIS. There are different ways to \ndescribe them. They are an outgrowth of Al Qaeda in Iraq, which came \nabout because of the catastrophic Iraq war that was based on false \npremises, that put us in the middle of a civil war, and created the \nworst sectarian tensions. One of my proudest moments was voting no on \nthat.\n  Then the Bush administration said Saddam Hussein was involved with 9/\n11, that he had nuclear weapons, and none of it was so. None of it was \nso. As a result we got in the middle of this war.\n  We were told it would last 6 months, and then a year went by, another \nyear, years, years, years, and it became one of our longest wars, and \n4,000-plus Americans dead, tens of thousands wounded, some with very \nserious wounds--they will never get over them--and I would say well \nover $1 trillion that drew us into a terrible recession when we had \npreviously had surpluses. What a nightmare. So that is the beginning of \nISIL, an outgrowth of Al Qaeda.\n  There were two authorizations for the use of military force that I \ngot to vote on. One of them was right after \n9/11 when I voted to go after bin Laden and Al Qaeda and any other \naffiliate organization that would come out of Al Qaeda. That is one I \nvoted for. That is why I believe the President has the authority, based \non that document, to move forward and take the fight to ISIL.\n  The other authorization for use of force was permission to go into \nIraq and go after Saddam Hussein. I voted no on that.\n  I think it is important to the American people to remember why we are \nfacing trouble, but it is what it is. There are some who say--because \nthere are three approaches here--do nothing. There are some who say do \nnothing. My view is: How can we possibly do nothing in the face of a \ngroup that has beheaded two innocent freelance journalists? How can you \ndo nothing in the face of a group that sells 14-year-old girls as \nslaves? How can you do nothing in the face of a brute, ISIL, who, if \nthey don't sell a 14-year-old as a slave and they let her live, give \nher to a warrior as a reward? How do we sit back and do nothing?\n  We saw what they did to minorities, the Yazidis. They said: Either \nyou convert, flee, or we will kill you.\n  We cannot sit back. They did it to Christians, Yazidis. They did it \nto Turkmen. They have taken hostages including more than 40 Turkish \nhostages. We don't even know the count or what are the nationalities, \nbut we know their intent. This is a quote from them, that they are \ngoing to make sure their thirst for American blood is quenched. This is \na sick situation, and to the people who say do nothing, I say to them: \nI understand your concern for unintended consequences, but don't count \nme in your camp, because I cannot do that.\n  I am so cautious when it comes to voting to go to war. I know it is \nnot easy. We don't know every single thing that can happen, what can go \nwrong. Things do go wrong. But my view is in this case if I were to sit \nback and say I am too afraid, I am too nervous, that is exactly the \nwrong signal to send a group of terrorists such as this. I have never \nseen a group like this. So one path is to do nothing.\n  The other path is to start up the Iraq war all over again. Colleagues \nin this Chamber, pounding the table: Troops on the ground. Send our \nAmerican troops back. No way, no way. I am not going to send our troops \nback to the middle of a civil war. What we are going to do is another \nway--President Obama's strategy, which is the moderate strategy here. \nIt is to take our intelligence, our strategy, our Air Force assets, and \nmake sure those in the region who have the most at stake--remember, \nISIL has killed more Muslims than anybody else--that they will be the \nboots on the ground. We see that strategy is working in Iraq.\n  It is early. We don't know how it is all going to go. But we have \nstarted this strategy where they will take back key pieces of \nterritory--a dam, very important--and we seem to be able to coordinate \nwell with the Kurds and the Iraqi forces.\n  Clearly our President is right when he says this is about the whole \nworld. The whole world has to care about this, because this is about, \ntruly, civilization, and every civilized person has to stand up against \nthis. What the President is doing with the Secretary of State and our \nVice President is they are building coalitions. For the first time we \nsee the Arab nations coming forward.\n  So when I vote today for the continuing resolution, I want it to be \nclear to my constituents--and they are not all going to agree with me, \nI know that--that I am in favor of this strategy. I am in favor of \ntraining the moderate Syrians to take the fight to ISIL on the ground. \nAnd I can tell you because I was in Turkey in August--I had the \nprivilege of meeting with the head of one of the moderate Syrian \norganizations. His comments were very strong that ISIL is absolutely \ngoing against the moderate Syrians. So it is very important that the \nmoderate Syrians are able to fight back against ISIL. That is what we \nare voting for today, to allow the President to vet, train, and arm the \nmoderate Syrian opposition to the Syrian President and also in that \nregard go after ISIL.\n  I know everything is complicated in life and nothing is the perfect \nsolution, but if I could say rhetorically, what is wrong is to do \nnothing. What is wrong is to go back into the Iraq war. What is right \nis to organize the world through a coalition, use the American assets--\nbecause no one can do what we can do--but on the ground in the combat \nmission, utilize the regional forces.\n  I wanted to be clear today where I stand. There are three choices, \nand I choose the path President Obama has put together. I think the \nvote in the House was a very important vote yesterday because it showed \nthere is a majority of Democrats and Republicans who can come together.\n\n[[Page S5735]]\n\n  Following that, we were in the House this morning to hear the \nPresident of Ukraine. It was very touching and very moving. President \nPoroshenko laid out in the most beautiful language, I thought, because \nof its simplicity, the beauty of freedom and what they are fighting \nfor. What I loved so much about it was the fact that his speech united \neverybody in the room. There wasn't one group that sat down or didn't \nstand up to express their appreciation for what his countrymen are \ngoing through.\n  I hope we can get behind this President in this fight against the \nterror group that is probably the best-funded terror group ever in \nexistence, the most barbaric I have ever seen. I hope there will be a \ngood vote today. I think that would send a very important message that \nwe are sincere and will bring more people to our coalition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5735-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           KEYSTONE PIPELINE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I said I was going to talk about an \nissue I know the Presiding Officer and I don't agree on. I have total \nrespect for her view. The people of her State are so lucky to have her \nfighting their fight on energy. The people of my State have a \ndisagreement. We are very fearful about climate change. So we are also \nworried about the health impact of the tar sands.\n  I am going to make a few comments about why I think we should disrupt \nthe process that is happening now with Keystone. It is a well-\nestablished process for considering projects such as this. The purpose \nof the review process isn't just to waste time. It is to determine \nwhether the construction of the Keystone tar sands pipeline is in fact \nin the national interest. This is important. It is a major project.\n  In the past, Republicans have attempted to circumvent the review \nprocess for Keystone by creating shortcuts that in my opinion put our \nfamilies' health at risk.\n  I want to show you a chart. It shows you that tar sands oil is one of \nthe filthiest kinds of oil on the planet.\n  Let's look at a place in Texas where we see the tar sands oil being \nrefined. This is Port Arthur. We have had visits from the Port Arthur \ncommunity, and they said, please, we want to bear witness to the fact \nthat this is what it looks like when these tar sands are burned. It \nhurts the health of our people. Residents along the gulf coast are \nsuffering from asthma, respiratory illness, skin irritation, and \ncancer, and to get to the gulf coast the tar sands will be transported \nby pipeline through communities in environmentally sensitive areas in \nsix States. It will pass through key sources of drinking water.\n  Look what happened in West Virginia when they couldn't drink the \nwater there. It was a nightmare.\n  We have had experience with tar sands. People talk about how the \npipeline is one thing, but it is what goes through it that is critical, \nand what is going to go through it if it gets built is the dirtiest, \nfilthiest kind of water we know.\n  What happens in places such as Detroit and Chicago, where they store \nthe byproduct known as petcoke--take a look at this. This is what it \nlooks like. It looks like filthy, dirty pollution, and unfortunately \nfor the people, that is what it is.\n  When the wind is blowing, we see black clouds containing concentrated \nheavy metals. Children playing baseball have been forced off the field \nto seek cover to avoid the black dust that pelts their homes and cars. \nPetcoke dust is a particulate matter, which is the most harmful of all \nair pollutants. Why? Its particles are so small, they lodge in your \nlungs and cause terribly severe asthma attacks, aggravate bronchitis \nand other lung diseases, and reduce the body's ability to fight \ninfections. Asthma affects 12 out of every 26 people--and 7 million of \nthose are children.\n  If I could, I would ask the people in the gallery how many of them \nhave asthma or know someone who has asthma. I know a lot of them would \nraise their hands. It is ubiquitous. We don't need more asthma.\n  There are other ways to go, and my State and other countries are \nproving it. We can move to clean energy. We need to have a \ncomprehensive human health impact on the tar sands that would go \nthrough that pipeline because human health is important. If you can't \nbreathe, you can't work. It is as simple as that. If you can't breathe, \nyou can't go to school and get an education. If you can't drink the \nwater, it is a serious problem.\n  While my Republican friends come down and say: Let's bypass all of \nthis evidence and move forward, that is a dangerous idea. It is a \ndangerous idea.\n  I went to China about a year ago. You cannot see one foot in front of \nthe other in China. That is how bad the air is because they don't care \nabout the environment. They say: Oh, we don't need rules; we don't need \nregulations. Build, build, build. Do it, do it, do it, do it. Go and \nget it out of the ground.\n  There are moments we need to look at what we are doing. We are doing \ngreat right now on energy. Under this President we have become more \nenergy efficient. Yes, there are places to drill, there are places to \nget energy, but it has to be clean and it has to be good.\n  We have just come out of the hottest August ever known to humankind \nsince we began keeping the records in the 1800s. Climate change is so \nreal, the only place they don't know it is here is the United States \nSenate. They don't know. Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. \nEverything is great. Everything is good.\n  My colleague from Vermont is brilliant on this point, and we know the \nKeystone tar sands pipeline will create 17 percent more carbon than \ndomestic oil. This is a dirty, filthy oil that is the equivalent of \nadding 5.8 million new cars to the road, or eight new coal powerplants.\n  The State Department has concluded that the annual carbon pollution \nfrom just the daily operation of the pipeline will be the equivalent to \nadding 300,000 new cars on the road. If we do this, we will go backward \non climate change. We cannot afford to do it.\n  I know people get impatient with decisionmaking--whether it is \ndeciding how to take the fight to ISIL--and I am glad I have a \ndeliberative President who didn't just say: Do this and this. He \nthought about it and came up with an idea for a coalition to do it \nright. When you are looking at something such as the Keystone XL \nPipeline, which is going to vastly increase the importation of this \nfilthy, dirty oil, we ought to take our time.\n  My very last point. I am so proud to chair the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. Four former Republican EPA Administrators who served \nunder Presidents Nixon, Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush \nspoke out on the need to address the danger of climate change.\n  Really, this is not about bipartisanship. Ninety-seven percent of \nscientists tell us climate change is real and caused by human activity. \nPlease, let's take our time. When we are faced with a project that will \nset us back--the dirtiest, dirtiest oil--a picture is worth a thousand \nwords, and this is not what I want to leave to our children.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank Senator Boxer not only for her remarks today but \nfor her years and years of commitment to the environmental committee \nand pointing out the danger of climate change and the toxicity in our \nair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5735-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5735-S5737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  ISIS\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the dangerous \nand brutal extremist organization called ISIS, the terrorist army, \nwhich in recent months has overrun vast swaths of Iraq and Syria and is \na serious threat to the stability of the region, and, in fact, to the \ninternational community.\n  But before I do that, I also want to say that ISIS is not the only \nmajor problem facing our country. It would be a real tragedy if, in our \nlegitimate concerns about the dangers of ISIS, we continue to ignore \nthe very serious problems that are taking place right here in the \nUnited States of America and impacting tens of millions of working \nfamilies.\n  There are crises here at home we have ignored for too long. Real \nunemployment today is 12 percent, youth unemployment is 20 percent. We \ncan't ignore it. The minimum wage nationally is at a starvation wage of \n$7.25 an hour. We cannot ignore that reality. We have to raise the \nminimum wage.\n\n[[Page S5736]]\n\n  Women earn 77 cents to the dollar that men earn. That is unfair. We \ncannot ignore the issue of pay equity. We have to address that issue.\n  Senator Boxer was just on the floor talking about the planetary \ncrisis of global warming and the fact that virtually the entire \nscientific community is united in telling us that global warming is \nreal. It is significantly caused by human activity. It is also causing \ndevastating problems in our country and around the world. We cannot \ncontinue to ignore the crisis of global warming.\n  Last week many of us voted to overturn the disastrous Citizens United \nSupreme Court decision that allows billionaires the ability to spend \nunlimited sums of money to buy elections which will benefit candidates \nwho support the rich and the powerful. My point is that while we \naddress the very serious problems in the Middle East--and these are \nvery serious problems--we cannot take our eye off the very serious \nproblems facing tens of millions of Americans.\n  The issue involving ISIS, in my view, is enormously complex. Just one \nexample is Syria. The Assad government is a dictatorship which has \nkilled many thousands of its own people and has even used, we believe, \nchemical weapons against its own citizens--and these are the good guys. \nThe decisions we make now in Syria, in Iraq, and in the Middle East \nmust be made with great thoughtfulness.\n  As you know, President Obama has been attacked time and time again \nbecause he publicly stated a while ago that ``we don't have a strategy \nyet'' for dealing with ISIS. Frankly, I applaud the President for \ntrying to think through this incredibly complicated issue and not \nmaking rash decisions which would make a very bad and dangerous \nsituation even worse and more dangerous.\n  I remember back in 2002--I was in the House of Representatives then--\nwhen George W. Bush and Dick Cheney said they did have a strategy. They \nwere tough, they were forceful, they acted boldly, they acted swiftly, \nbut, unfortunately, what they did was dead wrong. In fact, it was the \nworst foreign policy blunder in the recent history of America and \nopened up a can of worms we are trying to deal with today.\n  Frankly, I must say I am not impressed with all of the tough talk. I \nwant smart policy that will work and that will, in fact, lead to the \ndestruction of ISIS, not sound bites that may be effective in a \npolitical campaign.\n  I will take a few moments to lay out some of my concerns. First, \nPresident Obama is absolutely right when he said this struggle will not \nbe successful unless there is a strong international coalition. Let's \nbe clear: ISIS is a terrorist threat not only to the United States but \nto Britain, France, Germany, countries throughout Europe, and, in fact, \nto nations throughout the world.\n  More importantly, ISIS, which wants to establish a new caliphate, \nwhich includes many countries across a large geographical area, is a \nmajor threat in the region to countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, \nTurkey, Qatar, Iran, Jordan, and other countries.\n  I very much appreciate the hard work that President Obama and \nSecretary of State Kerry have undertaken in trying to put together an \ninternational coalition that will effectively fight ISIS. We all know \nhow difficult that effort is, but at this point it appears to me the \nkind of coalition we need has yet to come together.\n  In my view, ISIS will never be defeated unless the countries in the \nregion--the people in the region, the Muslim world, including Sunni and \nShiite nations--stand up to this threat.\n  I know how hard President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry are \ntrying, but we are nowhere near where we need to be in terms of \nbuilding this coalition at this moment.\n  It may surprise many people to know that Saudi Arabia--a country run \nby an autocratic royal family worth hundreds of billions of dollars and \none of the wealthiest families in the world--is a country which was the \nworld's fourth largest defense spender in 2014. Most people don't know \nthat. According to a Reuters article from earlier this year--and I \nquote--``Saudi Arabia beat Britain to become the world's fourth largest \ndefense spender in 2013.'' In other words, Saudi Arabia is now spending \nmore money on arms and the military than is the United Kingdom.\n\n  The article goes on to cite a report by London's International \nInstitute for Strategic Studies which estimated Saudi Arabia was \nspending over $59 billion, a figure researchers said was extremely \nconservative, pushing it above Britain at $57 billion or France at $52 \nbillion. Once again, Saudi Arabia is spending more on their military \nthan is Britain or France.\n  Another article from Bloomberg provides additional details on Saudi \nArabia's military strength. It cites that ``in 2011, the U.S. \nGovernment signed an agreement with Saudi Arabia valued at $29 \nbillion.'' That is the end of the quote from Bloomberg. But according \nto Military Balance, ``The Royal Saudi Air Force has more than 300 \ncombat capable aircraft, including 81 F-15 C and D fighter aircraft, \n172 advanced F-15 S Typhoon and Tornado fighters capable of ground \nattack, dozens of C-130 transport aircrafts.'' This is what the Saudi \nArabian Air Force has.\n  Let me also quote from an article in Forbes which details the \nstrength and numbers of many of the militaries in the Mideast. The \narticle notes:\n\n       Countries in the region have more than enough power to \n     destroy the Islamic State. Turkey has an army of 400,000. \n     Iran has nearly as many in the army and paramilitaries. Iraq \n     has a nominal army of nearly 200,000 and some 300,000 police. \n     Saudi Arabia has nearly 200,000 army, national guard, and \n     paramilitary personnel. Syria's military, though degraded by \n     war, numbers some 110,000, plus paramilitaries. Jordan has \n     74,000 in the army. The Kurdish Peshmerga numbers in the tens \n     of thousands. All of these but Iraq and Kurdistan have some \n     air force ground attack capabilities.\n\n  Furthermore, not only are countries in the region not stepping up in \nthe fight against ISIS but, believe it or not, several of these gulf \nstates are empowering ISIS and Al Qaeda-related groups through their \nfinancial contributions. A recent article in the Washington Post noted:\n\n       Kuwait, a U.S. ally whose aid to besieged Syrian civilians \n     has been surpassed only by the United States this year, is \n     also the leading source of funding for al-Qaeda-linked \n     terrorists fighting in Syria's civil war.\n\n  Now, think back not so long ago when the United States of America \nwent to war to push Saddam Hussein's troops out of Kuwait and restore \nthe royal ruling family. Today we find that ``Kuwait is the leading \nsource of funding for al Qaeda-linked terrorists fighting in Syria's \ncivil war.''\n  The article goes on to state:\n\n       . . . the amount of money that has flowed from Kuwaiti \n     individuals and through organized charities to Syrian rebel \n     groups such as Jabhat al-Nusra totals in the hundreds of \n     millions of dollars.\n\n  Kuwait is hardly alone in this effort. As Treasury Department Under \nSecretary Cohen stated:\n\n       A number of fundraisers operating in more permissive \n     jurisdictions--particularly in Kuwait and Qatar--are \n     soliciting donations to fund extremist insurgents, not to \n     meet legitimate humanitarian needs.\n\n  On and on it goes.\n  Why is all of this of enormous consequence? The answer is pretty \nobvious. The worst action we can take now is to allow ISIS to portray \nthis struggle as East versus West and Muslim versus Christians, as the \nMiddle East versus America. That is exactly what they want and that is \nexactly what we should not be giving them. In other words, this is not \njust a question of whether young men and women in Vermont or in North \nDakota or in any other State of this country should be putting their \nlives on the line to defend the billionaire families of Saudi Arabia \nwhen Saudi Arabian troops are not in the struggle. This is not just \nwhether the taxpayers of our country and not the billionaire ruling \nfamilies of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and other countries should be \npaying for this war; more importantly, it is an understanding that at \nthe end of the day, this war will never be won by the United States \nalone but it must be won by the people in the region.\n  Should we, as the most powerful military in the world, be of help to \nthose people struggling against ISIS? The answer is obviously yes. \nAlong with the international community, we should be strongly \nsupportive of those countries in the region that are standing up to \nISIS. And I personally believe President Obama is absolutely right in \nhis efforts to judiciously use airstrikes which, at this point, have \nshown some success. But at the end of the day, in my view, the United \nStates of America\n\n[[Page S5737]]\n\ncannot and should not lead this effort. We must be supportive of other \ncountries in the region who are standing and fighting against the ISIS \nterrorist organization, but this fight will have to be fought by \ncountries in the region that are, in fact, most threatened by ISIS. \nThey cannot stand aside. They cannot say: Hey, go for it, United \nStates. Thank you, American taxpayers. But we in Saudi Arabia--no, we \ndon't want our young people involved in this war. We don't want our \nairplanes involved in the attacks. We don't want our billions to go \ninto this war. Thank you, America. It is really nice of you to do that. \nBy the way, while you do that, we may play both sides of the issue and \nsome families may actually fund terrorist organizations. But we really \ndo appreciate your stepping to the plate because we are not doing that.\n  So that is where we are today. It is a very complicated, difficult \nsituation. Again, I applaud President Obama and Secretary Kerry for \ntrying to work through this. But this is what I worry about: I worry \nvery much that supporting questionable groups in Syria--so-called \nmoderates who are outnumbered and outgunned by both ISIS and the Assad \ngovernment--I worry very much that getting involved in that area could \nopen the door to the United States, once again, being involved in a \nquagmire, being involved in perpetual warfare. And what happens when \nthe first American plane gets shot down or the first American soldier \nis captured? What happens then? I am hearing from some of our \nRepublican colleagues who are already talking about the need for U.S. \nmilitary boots on the ground. That is what they are talking about \ntoday, and that concerns me very, very much.\n\n  So I am going to vote against this continuing resolution because I \nhave very real concerns about the United States getting deeply involved \nin a war we should not be deeply involved in. At the end of the day, if \nthis war against this horrendous organization called ISIS is going to \nbe won, it will have to be Saudi Arabia, it will have to be Iraq, it \nwill have to be the people of Syria, it will have to be the people of \nthat region saying: No, we are not going to accept an organization of \nterrorists such as ISIS. And we should be there to help, as should the \nUnited Kingdom, as should Britain, as should France, as should Germany. \nThis has to be an international coalition. But the last thing we need \nis the United States being the only major military power involved in \nthis war.\n  So I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We are in the closing hours before the \nSenate takes the recess before the fall elections. In the middle of all \nthat, on October 1, our fiscal year begins. If we don't have a bridge \nbetween now and December 11 or around that, we could face a government \nshutdown. We do not want a government shutdown. We want to make sure we \nprovide funding and make sure the government will not be shut down and \nthat after the election we can return and do due diligence and pass \nthis in a more comprehensive way.\n  Our job as the Appropriations Committee in Congress is to put money \nin the Federal checkbook each year to keep the Federal Government \nfunctioning. The American people want their government to work as hard \nas they do. They want us to combat the threats against the United \nStates of America. They want us to honor our commitments to our \nveterans. They want us to meet the compelling human needs of the \nAmerican people, and they want us to have an opportunity ladder so the \nAmerican people can have a fair shot.\n  What we do is, we provide funding one year at a time. September 30 is \nour fiscal New Year's Eve. October 1 is the first day of the fiscal \nyear. If Congress leaves before we pass the continuing resolution, the \ngovernment could shut down. We don't want another government shutdown. \nI believe there is support on both sides of the aisle not to do that.\n  We know from last year that it was a terrible situation. Thousands of \nFederal workers were paid not to work. Other personnel, such as FBI \nagents, had to work for IOUs, even using their own money to put gas in \ntheir car as they pursued the people who wanted to undermine us. We \nknow we don't want a government shutdown.\n  What is our goal for this continuing resolution? To avoid a \ngovernment shutdown but to do more than that. To do no harm to existing \nprograms so that we can meet our compelling human needs, the national \nsecurity needs of the United States of America, and continue those \npublic investments in innovation that make America the exceptional \nNation and often the indispensable Nation.\n  It allows us also to lay the groundwork for an omnibus funding bill \nin December which will be a comprehensive funding bill including all 12 \nappropriations.\n  Also, it gives the President the fiscal resources to protect the \nNation, to deal with ISIL, to make sure we support the needs of Ukraine \nand NATO, and also to work on a global basis to stamp out Ebola.\n  What I want to say to my colleagues, who will look at this bill and \nscrutinize it, is the continuing resolution is only from now until \nDecember 11.\n  Remember, it is a temporary stopgap bill. Also, it is at current \nlevels of funding. So I want to say that there are no new programs and \nthere is no new funding. As I said, it meets these needs.\n  I worked very closely with my House counterpart, the distinguished \ngentleman from Kentucky, Mr. Hal Rogers, the chair of the \nAppropriations Committee in the House. We worked very hard to do bills \nwhere we thought we could bring individual ones to the Nation. Well, it \ndid not work out that way because one party stopped me from bringing \nbills to the floor. I am sorry we do not have that omnibus, but poison-\npill riders kept the Senate from considering appropriations bills on \nthe floor and also the demand for 60-vote thresholds. That is a debate \nfor another day.\n  So where are we in this continuing resolution? As I said, it keeps \nthe government running through December 11, operating at the same \namount of money as fiscal year 2014, with the same items and the same \nprograms and the same restrictions. People might say: Have things not \nchanged since last year? There are some technical adjustments that we \ndo, but we just simply are extending what we have.\n  Again, what we do here is help the President, though, with what has \nchanged--the three alarming threats that are facing us. No. 1, there is \nthis growing threat of an organization called ISIL. People say: Are you \ntalking about ISIS? No, I am talking about ISIL, because it goes beyond \nSyria--the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. What we have in here \nis the authority for the President to use title 10 of the United States \nCode.\n  What that does is allow the President to train and equip, with proper \nvetting, the moderates in the Syrian rebel forces. We also are \nsupporting our President as he works with NATO and tries to deal with \nthe Russian threat to Ukraine. Then there is another grim and ghoulish \nthing going around in Africa and spreading, which is Ebola. What we are \ndoing here is providing the President with the resources to help Africa \nfight this problem. At the same time, while we are fighting in Africa, \nwe make sure that NIH, FDA, and CDC have the resources to fight the \nissues here.\n  I could elaborate on this bill more. I want everyone to know that the \nCR is bicameral. It has already passed the House. It is bipartisan. I \nhave worked with my counterpart in the other party, Senator Shelby, who \nreally has worked in a very rigorous way here, bringing the principles \nof fiscal conservatism and flexibility so we have this.\n  But I know there are other Senators who want to debate. I want them \nto have the opportunity to debate this bill. I will have more to say \nwhen there are not others waiting.\n  I want to yield the floor, but before I do, I am going to thank \nSenator Shelby for the cooperation of his staff. We have not always \nagreed on the content or every line item. He is a very staunch fiscal \nconservative. But out of it all, working with civility, due diligence, \nand absolute candor, I think we have been able to bring a bill to the \nfloor. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will pass this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, this afternoon I rise in support of this \ncontinuing resolution which is now before the Senate. Overall, it is a \nrelatively clean bill that carries forward current levels for \ndiscretionary spending and avoids another government shutdown. It \ncontains a minimal amount of what we call anomalies or deviations from \na straight continuation of previous-year funding.\n  The anomalies it does contain are limited in duration and subject to \nrelitigation when we return after the break. The bill is also \nconsistent with the total level of discretionary spending enacted in \nthe Bipartisan Budget Act for the fiscal year 2014. But most \nsignificantly, this legislation will authorize assistance to elements \nof the Syrian opposition to help confront the threat presented by the \nso-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, ISIL.\n  While I believe action against this menace is long overdue, it is \nunfortunate, I believe, that the action once again requires the \ninvolvement of our military and our resources. This authority for \ntraining and equipping appropriate moderate elements in Syria is no \npanacea. We should remember this. We should not expect quick and easy \nprogress in turning the tide against this new terrorist threat that has \ndeveloped in the region while this administration withdrew and hoped \nfor the best.\n  History and our experience in the region tell us that this will not \nbe the last time Congress will struggle with this issue. Even if we can \nidentify, train, and equip a large number of fighters in a relatively \nshort period of time, there will come a time when more will be required \nto defeat this enemy. It will not be of a short duration. It is \nunfortunate, I believe, that\n\n[[Page S5739]]\n\nthe President has chosen to ignore the fact, thereby avoiding an honest \ndiscussion with the American people.\n\n  Nevertheless, I believe today it is important that we give the \nmoderates in the region a fighting chance. If proper training and \nequipment can do that, we should support it until it becomes clear that \nwe must pursue other means to achieve our goals. When that time comes, \nI expect Congress to have a full and open debate on that issue. But for \nnow, Congress, I believe, has the responsibility to carefully track \nwhat the administration is doing with any funds that it reprograms for \nthis assistance and how this fits into a broader regional strategy \nthere.\n  The language in this bill will ensure that the administration \nprovides the information to the Congress that we need to do our job. \nOnce again, support for this continuing resolution will achieve two \nvery important goals: one, avoiding a government shutdown, and \nmaintaining spending levels currently in the law--very important. For \nthese two reasons, I will be supporting the bill.\n  During the break that we are about to go on, and when we return in \nNovember, Senator Mikulski, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, \nand I will be working closely on an omnibus bill to put in place \nfunding for the remainder of the fiscal year. It is my hope that we \nwill be able to, once again, reach an agreement and complete the work \nof the committee before this Congress adjourns. I believe that this is \nan achievable goal as long as both sides come to the table with \nreasonable expectations. We have done it before. I expect that we can \ndo it again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, we have before us one of the most \nimportant duties of the Senate and the Congress; that is, to decide \nwhether we will be involved in war. I think it is inexcusable that the \ndebate over whether we involve the country in war--another country's \ncivil war--that this would be debated as part of a spending bill and \nnot as part of an independent free-standing bill.\n  It was debated as a free-standing bill yesterday in the House. There \nwas a free-standing amendment.\n  It takes 15 extra minutes. One might wonder why the Senate--the most \ndeliberative body of the world--does not have 15 minutes to debate \nseparately a question of war. It will be thrown into an amendment or a \nbill over spending. Instead of having a debate over war, we will have a \ndebate over spending. I think this is a sad day for the Senate. It goes \nagainst our history. It goes against the history of the country. \nTherefore, I have asked that the amendment that I will set before the \nSenate will separate the votes so we will have a debate over war and \nthen we will have a debate over spending.\n  I have an amendment at the desk that would cue up the two separate \nvotes on this legislation and allow the Senate to vote on the inclusion \nof the Syria language as a separate question.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to call up my \namendment No. 3856.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I want to acknowledge, first of all, \nthe longstanding views on foreign policy of the Senator from Kentucky \nand also on this process. What I want to say is that, No. 1, the Senate \nbill and the authorization in title 10 we have here takes us only to \nDecember 11. So this is temporary. What we hope is that the appropriate \ncommittees have additional legislation they are working on so that we \ncan really look at other matters, such as a greater authorization on \nthe war and the greater refinement of title 10.\n  So I acknowledge that there is much to be debated. I say to my \ncolleague from Kentucky, we have allowed 4\\1/2\\ hours to debate. Quite \nfrankly, if the Senator has views on it, I look forward to hearing \nthose views. So the objection is not meant to be pugnacious at all. But \nin the way that the leadership has agreed to move this bill, that is \nwhere we stand. I look forward to hearing the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, if there is a theme that connects the dots \nin the Middle East, it is that chaos breeds terrorism. What much of the \nforeign policy elite fail to grasp, though, is that intervention to \ntopple secular dictators has been the prime source of the chaos. From \nHussein to Assad to Qadhafi, it is the same history--intervention to \ntopple the secular dictator. Chaos ensues and radical jihads emerge. \nThe pattern has been repeated time and time again.\n  Yet what we have here is a failure to understand, a failure to \nreflect on the outcome of our involvement in Arab civil wars. They say \nnature abhors a vacuum. Radical jihadists have again and again filled \nthe chaotic vacuum of the Middle East. Secular dictators, despots who, \nfrankly, do terrorize their own people, are replaced by radical \njihadists, who seek terror not only at home but abroad.\n  Intervention, when both choices are bad, is a mistake. Intervention, \nwhen both sides are evil, is a mistake. Intervention that destabilizes \nthe Middle East is a mistake. Yet here we are again, wading into a \ncivil war. I warned a year ago that involving us in Syria's civil war \nwas a mistake, that the inescapable irony is that some day the arms we \nsupply would be used against us or Israel. That day is now.\n  ISIS has grabbed up from the United States, from the Saudis, and from \nthe Qataris weapons by the truckload. We are now forced to fight \nagainst our own weapons, and this body wants to throw more weapons into \nthe mix. Even those of us who have been reluctant to get involved in \nMiddle Eastern wars feel, now that American interests are threatened, \nthat our consulate and our embassy are threatened. We feel that if ISIS \nis left to its own devices maybe they will fulfill what they have \nboasted of and attack our homeland.\n  So, yes, we must now defend ourselves from these barbarous jihadists. \nBut let's not compound the problem by arming feckless rebels in Syria \nwho seem to be merely a pit stop for weapons that are really on their \nway to ISIS. Remember clearly that the President and his Republican \nallies have been clamoring for over a year for airstrikes against \nAssad. Assad was our enemy last year. This year he is our friend. Had \nall of those air strikes, though, occurred last year in Syria, today \nISIS might be in Damascus. Realize that the unintended consequences of \ninvolving ourselves in these complicated, thousand-year-long civil wars \nlead to unintended consequences. Had we bombed Assad last year, ISIS \nwould be more of a threat this year. ISIS may well be in Damascus had \nwe bombed Assad last year.\n  Had the hawks been successful last year, we would be facing a \nstronger ISIS, likely in charge of all Syria and most of Iraq.\n  Intervention is not always the answer and often leads to unintended \nconsequences.\n  But some will argue no, no, it is not intervention that led to this \nchaos, we didn't have enough intervention. They say if we had only \ngiven the rebels more arms, ISIS wouldn't be as strong now. The only \nproblem is the facts argue otherwise.\n  We did give arms and assistance to the rebels through secret CIA \noperations, through our allies, through our erstwhile allies. We gave \n600 tons--let me repeat that--we gave 600 tons of weapons to the Syrian \nrebels in 2013 alone. We gave 600 tons of weapons and they cry out and \nsay we haven't done enough?\n  Perhaps they are giving them to people who don't want to fight. \nPerhaps the fighters from ISIS are taking the weapons we give to the \nso-called moderate rebels. It is a mistake to send more arms to the \nSyrians.\n  According to the U.N. records, Turkey alone, in the space of a 4-\nmonth period, sent 47 tons in addition to the 600 tons of weapons. They \nsent 29 tons in 1 month. But there are rumors that the Turks are not \nquite that discriminating, that many of these weapons either went \ndirectly or indirectly to the very radical jihadists who are now \nthreatening us.\n  If you want to know are there any weapons over there, are there \nenough weapons, is it a lack of weapons that causes the moderate Syrian \nrebels to be not very good at fighting, well, there are videos online \nof the Free Syrian Army, the army our government\n\n[[Page S5740]]\n\nwants to give more arms to. We see them with Mi-8 helicopters, we see \nthem with shoulder-launched missiles, and yet we see them lose battle \nafter battle.\n  We see American-made TOW anti-tank weapons in the hands of Harakat \nal-Hazm, a so-called moderate group. The Wall Street Journal reported \nthat Saudi Arabia has been providing weapons such as this to the \nrebels. It also detailed millions of dollars in direct U.S. aid to the \nrebels.\n  We have not been sitting around doing nothing. Six hundred tons of \nweapons have already been given to the Syrian rebels. What happened \nduring the period of time we gave 600 tons of weapons to the moderate \nrebels in Syria? ISIS grew stronger.\n  They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and \nover, expecting a different result. We gave 600 tons of weapons to the \nrebels and they got weaker and weaker and ISIS grew stronger.\n  Perhaps by throwing all of these weapons into the civil war, we \nactually degraded Assad's ability to counter them. So perhaps Assad \nmight well have taken care of the radical jihadists and he can't \nbecause of the weapons. Perhaps we have created a safe haven.\n  The other night the President said in his speech that it will be a \npolicy of his administration to leave no safe haven for anyone who \nthreatens America. It sounds good, except for the past 3 years we have \nbeen creating a safe haven for ISIS. ISIS has grown stronger because we \nhave been arming the resistance that ISIS is part of.\n  A New York Times article reports that Qatar has used a shadowy arms \nnetwork to move shoulder-fired missiles to the rebels. According to \nGulf News, Saudi Arabia has also partnered with Pakistan to provide a \nPakistan version of a Chinese shoulder-launched missile. It doesn't \nsound like a dearth of weapons, it sounds like an abundance of weapons.\n  Iraqi officials have accused Saudi Arabia and Qatar of also funding \nand arming ISIS at the same time.\n  Kuwaitis--a Sunni majority country bordering Iraq--have funneled \nhundreds of millions of dollars to a wide range of opposition forces \nthroughout Iraq and Syria, according to the Brookings Institute.\n  According to the New York Times, over 1 year ago the CIA began \ntraining Syrian rebels in nearby Jordan, thousands of them, delivering \narms and ammunition. Over this period of time, what has happened? ISIS \nhas grown stronger. Perhaps sending more weapons into the Syrian civil \nwar is not working.\n  The New York Times also reports huge arms and financial transfers \nfrom Qatar to the Syrian rebels beginning as early as 3 years ago. No \none really knows where this is all going to end, where are these arms \ngoing to wind up.\n  Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Center noted that the transfer of \nQatari weapons to targeted troops has the same practical effect of \ntransferring the weapons to al-Nusra, a violent jihadist group.\n  Let me repeat. Jane's defense analysts say that if you give the \nweapons to moderate--the so-called moderate rebels--it is the same as \ngiving it to al-Nusra.\n  The New York Times further detailed that even Sudan has been sending \nanti-tank missiles and other arms to Syria. It is hard to argue there \nare not enough weapons floating around over there.\n  So the idea that these rebels haven't been armed is ludicrous. It is \nalso ludicrous to believe that we know where all the money and all the \narms and all the ammunition will wind up or who will benefit from these \narms.\n  Why? Because we don't even know who these groups are, even if we \nthink we do. The loyalty shifts on a daily basis. The groups have \nbecome amorphous with alleged moderates lining up side-by-side with \njihadists, not to mention that, guess what, some of these people don't \ntell the truth.\n\n  Finally, moderates have been now found to sell their weapons. In \nfact, there are accusations by the family of Steve Sotloff--who was \nrecently killed by the barbarians--that he was sold by the moderate \nrebels to the jihadists.\n  The Carnegie Endowment says there are no neat, clean, secular rebel \ngroups. They don't exist. They reiterate that this is a very dirty war \nwith no clear good guys on either side.\n  The German Ambassador to the United States has acknowledged this. The \nGermans are arming the Kurds. They are not sending anything into Syria. \nIt is a mess, and they are concerned that the weapons they send into \nSyria will wind up in the wrong hands.\n  Many former officials are very forthright with their criticism. \nAccording to the former ambassador to Iraq and Syria, our ambassador \nsays: We need to do everything we can to figure out who the non-ISIS \nopposition is because, frankly, we don't have a clue.\n  Think about this. We are voting or obscuring a vote in a spending \nbill to send $500 million worth of arms to Syria, to people who we say \nare the vetted moderate Syrian rebels. Guess what. One of the men with \nthe most knowledge on the ground, who has been our ambassador to Syria, \nsays we don't have a clue who the moderates are and who the jihadists \nare. And even if they tell you they are the moderates, they say: Oh, we \nlove Thomas Jefferson. Give us a shoulder-fired missile. We love Thomas \nJefferson.\n  Can you trust these people?\n  The rebels are all over the map. There are said to be 1,500 groups. \nIt is chaos over there. We will be sending arms into chaos.\n  The largest coalition is the Free Syrian Army. I say largest \ncoalition--really, all the Islamic fronts, al-Nusra, ISIS, Al Qaeda are \nall much bigger than the Free Syrian Army--but the biggest group that \nwe give to is the Free Syrian Army, which currently has three different \npeople who claim to lead the Free Syrian Army. We don't even know who \nis in charge of the Free Syrian Army. They voted out one guy, in \nanother guy, and he didn't even know they were voting.\n  There are estimates that half of the Free Syrian Army has defected, \nmany to al-Nusra, Al Qaeda, and to ISIS. These are the people your \nrepresentatives are going to vote to send arms to. Half of them have \ndefected. Half of them are now fighting with the jihadists. We have \nproven time and again that we don't know how to vet these leaders.\n  Two groups that were initially provided U.S. aid and help last year \nare good examples. A top official of Ahrar al-Sham, one of the largest \nrebel groups at the time, announced publicly that he now considers \nhimself to be allied with Al Qaeda.\n  Just yesterday, our most recent ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford, \nsaid the moderate forces have and will tactically ally with Al Qaeda, \nwith Al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra.\n  Listen carefully. Your representatives are sending $500 billion to \npeople who will tactically ally with Al Qaeda.\n  I asked Secretary Kerry: Where do you get the authority to wage this \nwar?\n  He says: From 2001.\n  Some of the people fighting weren't born in 2001. Many of the people \nwho voted in 2001 are no longer living.\n  We voted to go to war in Afghanistan--and I supported going into that \nwar because we were attacked and we had to do something about it. But \nthe thing is, that vote had nothing to do with this--absolutely nothing \nto do with this.\n  You are a dishonest person if you say otherwise. That sounds pretty \nmean-spirited. Hear it again. You are intellectually dishonest if you \nargue that something passed in 2001, to deal with the people who \nattacked us in 9/11, has anything to do with sending arms into Syria. \nIt is intellectually dishonest--and to say otherwise, you are an \nintellectually dishonest person.\n  I said it yesterday: Mr. President, what you are doing is illegal and \nunconstitutional.\n  The response from Secretary Kerry was: We have article II authority \nto do whatever we want.\n  It is absolutely incorrect. We give power to the Commander in Chief \nto execute the war, but we were explicit that the wars were to be \ninitiated by Congress.\n  There was debate over this. There were reports of Thomas Jefferson's \nopinion about how this was the legislative function. There were letters \nin the Federalist Papers from Madison talking how they precisely took \nthis power from the Executive and gave it to the legislative body.\n  We hear: Oh, we will do something in December.\n  What happens between now and December? An election.\n\n[[Page S5741]]\n\n  The people of this body are petrified, not of ISIS, but of the \nAmerican voter. They are afraid to come forward and vote on war now. We \nshould have a full-throated discussion of going to war, but we \nshouldn't put it off until December.\n  Secretary Kerry was asked: Will there be Sunni allies in this war on \nthe ground, fighting to overturn ISIS? The ones, precisely--maybe who \nmay have been funding it, which is Saudi Arabia--who should be the \nfirst troops in line, receiving the first volley, should not be U.S. \nGIs, they should be Saudi Arabians, Qataris, Kuwaitis, and Iraqis--but \nthey should not be Americans.\n  According to the Washington Free Beacon, some of the people we have \nbeen supplying and some of the people we continue to supply arms to \naren't so excited about Israel.\n  Surprise.\n  One of them remarked: Their goal is to topple Assad, but when they \nare done with Assad, their goal is to return all Syrian land occupied \nby Israel.\n  Mark my words. I said the great irony here would be that someday our \ndollars and our weapons would be used against us and Israel. They will.\n  We will be fighting--if we get over there with troops on the ground--\nagainst arms that we supplied to feckless rebels, that were immediately \nsnatched and taken by ISIS. We will be fighting our own weapons.\n  Mark my own words, if these people get a chance, they will attack \nIsrael next.\n  These are among the many problems I have in arming the Syrian \nopposition. Who are we really arming? What would be the result? Where \nwill the arms end?\n  There are too many here who believe the answers to these questions \nwhen all indicators are otherwise--or maybe even when it is \nunknowable--they continue to believe something that frankly is not \nprovable and not true.\n  I am a skeptic of this administration's policies, but this is a \nbipartisan problem. This is not a Republican or a Democratic problem, \nthis is a bipartisan problem.\n  I do share the administration's belief that the radical jihadists in \nthis region are a threat to America, but they need to think through how \nwe got here. Radical jihad has run amok in the Middle East because \nintervention has toppled secular dictators. There weren't radical \njihadists doing much of anything in Libya until Gadhafi was gone. He \nkept them in check.\n  Was Gadhafi a great humanitarian? No. He was an awful despot. But his \nterror was on his own people, not the United States.\n  The people in charge--if we can say anybody is in charge in Libya--\ntheir terror is to be exported. Some of them are fighting in Syria.\n  Where I differ with this administration is whether to arm the same \nside as the jihadists. We will be in a war on the same side as the \njihadists. They said: Oh, no. We can make it a three-way war.\n  War is very confusing, but imagine: We will be in the middle of a \nthree-way war where many analysts say when you are in the trenches with \nthe so-called moderates that our money is going to buy arms for--when \nthey are in the trenches, they are side by side with al-Nusra; they are \nside by side with Al Qaeda. Do we want our money and arms being sent to \nsupport troops that are fighting alongside Al Qaeda?\n  Here is the great irony. The use of force resolution they predicate \nthis whole thing upon from 2001 says that we can fight terrorism. They \nhave interpreted that to be Al Qaeda and associated forces. Guess what. \nThe moderate rebels are fighting with Al Qaeda. We could use the 2001 \nuse of force authorization, as Secretary Kerry understands it, to \nattack the same people we are giving the weapons to.\n  Think about the insanity of it. We are giving weapons to people \nfighting in trenches with Al Qaeda. If we interpret the use of force \nresolution as Secretary Kerry does, under that formulation we could \nattack the very people we are giving the weapons to. It is absurd. We \nshouldn't be fighting alongside jihadists.\n  This administration and its allies have really been on both sides of \nthis civil war. It is messy; it is unclear. There are bad people on \nboth sides. We need to stay the heck out of their civil war. I have \nopposed them for reasons that I think are becoming clear and I think \nthe American people will understand. It is not that I am against all \nintervention. I do see ISIS as a problem. ISIS is now a threat to us. \nBut I see our previous policy as having made it worse.\n  I supported the decision to go into Afghanistan after 9/11. There are \nvalid reasons for war, but they should be few and far between. They \nshould be very importantly debated and not shuffled into a 2,000-page \nbill and shoved under the rug.\n  When we go to war, it is the most important vote any Senator will \never take. Many on the other side have been better on this issue. When \nthere was a Republican in office, there were loud voices on the other \nside. I see an empty Chamber.\n  There will be no voices against war because this is a Democratic \nPresident's war. The hypocrisy of that should resound in this nearly \nempty Chamber. Where are the voices on the other side who were so hard \non George Bush who, by the way, actually did come to Congress? And we \nvoted on an authorization of force. Agree or disagree, but we did the \nright thing. But now we are going to fight the war for 3 or 4 months, \nsee how it is going, see how the election goes, and then we are going \nto come back and maybe we will talk about the use of authorization of \nforce, maybe we will have amendments.\n  Colin Powell wrote in his autobiography:\n\n       War should be the politics of last resort. And when we go \n     to war, we should have a purpose that our people understand \n     and support.\n\n  I think that is well thought out. I think he had it right. America \nshould only go to war to win. We shouldn't go to war sort of meandering \nour way through a spending bill. War should only occur when America is \nattacked, when it is threatened or when our American interests are \nthreatened or attacked.\n  I spent about a year--and I will probably spend a couple more years--\ntrying to explain to the American people why Secretary Clinton made \nterrible decisions in Benghazi not defending the consulate--not the \nnight of, not the day after, not the talking points--the 6 months in \nadvance when security was requested. This is one of the reasons it \npersuades me that, as reluctant as I am to be involved in Middle \nEastern wars, we have to do something about it. We either have to leave \nIraq or we have to protect our embassy and protect our consulate. I \nthink there are valid reasons for being involved, and I think we are \ndoing the right thing but just in the wrong way.\n  If we want to have less partisan sniping about war, if we want to \nunify the country, think back to December 8, 1941. FDR came before a \njoint session of Congress and he said, this day ``which will live in \ninfamy,'' and he united the country. People who had previously been \nopposed to war came forward and said: We can't stand this attack. We \nwill respond. We will be at war with Japan.\n  He didn't wait around for months. He didn't wait and say: Let's wait \nuntil the midterm elections, and then we will come back maybe in a \nlame-duck--if there is a lame-duck--and maybe we will discuss whether \nthe Japanese should be responded to.\n  War is a serious business, but we make it less serious by making it \npolitical, hiding and tucking war around. By tucking war away into a \nspending bill we make it less serious. We don't unify the public. Then, \nas ISIS grows stronger or they are not quelled by sending arms to \nfeckless allies in Syria, what happens? Then they come back again and \nagain. There is already the drumbeat. There are already those in both \nparties who insist that we must have American GIs on the ground. I am \nnot sending American soldiers--I am not sending your son, your daughter \nor mine--over to the middle of that chaos.\n\n  The people who live there need to stand up and fight. The Kurds are \nfighting. They seem to be the only people who are really capable of or \nwilling to fight for their homeland. The Iraqis need to step up and \nfight. It is their country. If they are not going to fight for it, I \ndon't think we need to be in the middle of their fight.\n  Am I willing to provide air support? Am I willing to provide \nintelligence and drones and everything we can to help them? Yes. We \nhave been helping\n\n[[Page S5742]]\n\nthem for 10 years. We have a lot invested. So I am not for giving up, \nbut it is their war and they need to fight. And I expect the Saudis to \nfight, and the Qataris and the Kuwaitis.\n  Even our own State Department says there is no military solution here \nthat is good for the Syrian people and that the best path forward is a \npolitical solution. Is someone going to ultimately surrender? Is one \nside going to wipe out the other?\n  Part of the solution here is that civilized Islam needs to crush \nradical Islam. Civilized Islam needs to say to radical Islam: This does \nnot represent our religion. The beheading of civilians, the rape and \nkilling of women does not represent Islam.\n  The voices aren't loud enough.\n  I want to see civilized Islam on the front page of the newspaper and \ninternational TV saying what they will do to wipe out radical Islam. I \nwant to see them on the frontlines fighting. I don't want to see them \nsipping tea or in the discotheque in Cairo. I want to see them on the \nfrontlines fighting a war to show the Americans and to show the world \nthat there is a form of civilized Islam that doesn't believe in this \nbarbarity.\n  The United States should not fight a war to save face. I won't vote \nto send our young men and women to sacrifice life and limb for a \nstalemate. I won't vote to send our Nation's best and brightest to \nfight for anything less than victory.\n  When American interests are at stake, it is incumbent upon those \nadvocating for military action to convince Congress and the American \npeople of that threat.\n  Too often the debate begins and ends with a conclusion. They say: \nWell, our national interest is at stake. That is the conclusion. The \ndebate is: Is the national interest at stake? Is what we are going to \ndo going to work? I would think we would debate for days and this \nChamber would be full.\n  Before I came here, I imagined that when war was discussed, everybody \nwould be at their desk and there would be a discussion for hours on end \non whether we would go to war. Now it seems to be some sort of \ngeopolitical chess game or checkers: Let's throw some money. What is \n$500 million? Which is yet another problem around here.\n  But when we go to war, the burden of proof lies with those who wish \nto engage in war. They must convince the American people and convince \nCongress. Instead of being on television, the President should have \nbeen before a joint session of Congress--and I would have voted to \nauthorize force. But it needs to be done according to the Constitution.\n  Not only is it constitutional, but there is a pragmatic or a \npractical reason why the President should have come to us. It \ngalvanizes people, it brings people together. Both sides vote for the \nwar, and it is a war of the American people--not a war of one man. \nUntil there is a vote--if there ever is one--this is one man's war.\n  Our Founding Fathers would be offended, would be appalled to know \nthat one man can create a war. We were very fearful of that. We came \nfrom Europe with constant war, where brothers fought cousins and \nfathers fought sons, where everybody was related and they fought \ncontinuously. We didn't want a king. We wanted the people, through the \nCongress, to determine when we went to war.\n  This President was largely elected on that concept. I didn't vote for \nthe President, but I did admire, when he ran first for office that he \nsaid no President should unilaterally take a country to war without the \nauthority of Congress. That is what President Obama said. He was \nrunning against the wars of the previous administration. People voted \nfor him for that very reason, but he became part of the problem. He now \ndoes everything that he criticized. It is what the American people \ndespise about politics.\n\n  When they say we have a 10-percent approval rating--Republicans or \nDemocrats--it is because of this hypocrisy, because we don't obey the \nlaw, because we don't engage in important debate, and because we stuff \nwar and shuffle war into a spending bill.\n  Bashar al-Assad is clearly not an American ally. He is an evil \ndictator. But the question is: Will his ouster encourage stability or \nwill it make the Middle East less stable? With his ouster, will that \nmean ISIS replaces him? What are the odds that the moderate rebels, who \nhave lost every battle they have ever engaged in, will be the rulers in \nDamascus? If we succeed in degrading Assad where someone can get to \nhim, we will have ISIS. We will have ISIS in charge of Syria. It will \nbe worse. We have to ask: Are these Islamic rebels our allies?\n  I am reminded of the story of Sarkis Al-Zajim. He lived in a city \ncalled Maaloula, Syria. They speak Aramaic there. It is one of the few \nremaining villages in the Middle East where they speak the language \nthat Jesus spoke.\n  As the marauding Islamic rebels came into town on the same side of \nthe war--who knows who funded them or where they got the arms--but when \nthe Islamic rebels came and marauded into town, Sarkis Al-Zajim stood \nup. He is a Christian. He lives and sides with Assad. Most of the \nChristians side with Assad. So Sarkis Al-Zajim lives in Maaloula, \nspeaks Aramaic, stands up, and says: ``I am a Christian, and if you \nmust kill me for this, I do not object to it!'' And these were his last \nwords.\n  I don't know who these rebels were, but they are fighting on the same \nside that we are arming and we don't know who they are.\n  Our former Ambassador to Iraq and Syria says we have no clue who the \nnon-ISIS rebels are. So for all we know, the rebels that killed Sarkis \nAl-Zajim could well be part of the so-called vetted opposition.\n  When they win, will they defend American interests? Will they \nrecognize Israel? If we want to have a good question, why don't we ask \nthe vetted moderate Syrians how many will recognize Israel. I am \nguessing it is going to be a big goose egg. There is not one of those \njihadists--there is not one of those so-called moderate rebels that \nwill recognize Israel. And if they win, they will attack Israel next. \nSeveral of the leaders have already said they would. Will they \nacknowledge Israel's right to exist? Will they impose Sharia law?\n  Sharia law has the death penalty for interfaith marriage, death \npenalty for conversion--apostasy--and death penalty for blasphemy.\n  In Pakistan right now--a country that billions of our dollars flow \nto, that the vast majority of the Senate loves and will send billions \nmore of our dollars to if they can get it from us--in Pakistan, Asia \nBibi sits on death row. She is a Christian. Do you know what her crime \nwas? They say blasphemy. She went to drink from a well and the well was \nowned by Muslims. As she was drawing water from the well they began \nhurling insults. Then they began hurling stones. They were stoning her \nand beating her to death with sticks. The police came, and she said, \nthank God. They arrested her and put her in jail because the Muslims \nsaid that she was saying something about their religion. Heresy is life \nin prison, death. These are the countries we are sending money to.\n  The other side up here will argue: Well, we are only sending it to \nthe moderates in Pakistan; otherwise, the radicals will take over. \nWell, the moderates are the ones with Asia Bibi on death row. I \nwouldn't send a penny to these people. Why would we send money to \npeople who hate us? Maybe we should just have a rule: No money to \ncountries that hate us.\n  Will these rebels, whom we are going to vote to give money to, \ntolerate Christians or will they pillage and destroy ancient villages \nsuch as Sarkis Al-Zajim's church and village?\n  The President and his administration haven't provided good answers \nbecause they don't exist. As the former Ambassador said: They don't \nhave a clue.\n  Shooting first and aiming later has not worked for us in the past. \nThe recent history of the Middle East has not been a good one. Our \nprevious decisions have given results that should cause us to be quite \nwary of trying to do the same again.\n  I would like President Obama to reread the speeches of Candidate \nObama. There is a great disagreement between the two, and Candidate \nObama really seemed to be someone who was going to protect the right of \nCongress to declare war, but it hasn't been so.\n  Our Founding Fathers understood that the executive branch was the \nbranch most prone to war, and so with due deliberation our Founding \nFathers took the power to declare war and they gave it to Congress \nexclusively.\n\n[[Page S5743]]\n\n  President Obama's new position as President, which differs from his \nposition as candidate, is that he is fine to get some input when it is \nconvenient for us--maybe after the election--but he is not really \ninterested enough to say that it would bind him or that he would say we \nneed attacks now and come to us tomorrow and ask for permission. He \nthinks ``maybe whenever it is convenient and you guys get around to \nit.''\n  Secretary Kerry stated explicitly that his understanding of the \nConstitution is that no congressional authorization is necessary. I \nsay, why even bother coming back in December? They kind of like it. \nThey like the show of it. They understand it might have some practical \nbenefit. But it is theater and show. If you are going to commit war \nwithout permission, it is theater and show to ask for permission. The \nPresident said basically article II grants him the power to do whatever \nhe wants. If so, why have a Congress? Why don't we just recess the \nwhole thing? Oh, that is right, that is what we are getting ready to \ndo. It is election season.\n  The President and his administration view this vote just as a \ncourtesy but not as a requirement. Even if Congress votes against it, \nhe said he would do it anyway. He already has authority; why would it \nstop him?\n  Article I, section 8, clause 11 gives Congress and Congress alone the \npower to declare war. If Congress does not approve this military \naction, the President must abide by the decision.\n  But it worries me. This President worries me, and it is not because \nof ObamaCare or Dodd-Frank or these horrific pieces of legislation. As \nI travel around the country, when people ask me ``What has the \nPresident done? What is the worst thing he has done?'' it is the \nusurpation of power, the idea that there is no separation of powers or \nthat he is above that separation. If you want to tremble and worry \nabout the future of our Republic, listen to the President when he says: \nWell, Congress won't act; therefore, I must. Think about the \nimplications of that.\n  Democracy is messy. It is hard to get everybody to agree to \nsomething. But the interesting thing is that had he asked, had he come \nforward and done the honorable thing, we would have approved--I would \nhave approved an authorization of force. It would have been \noverwhelming had he done the right thing, but he didn't come forward \nand ask. He didn't come forward and ask when he amended the Affordable \nCare Act. He didn't come forward and ask when he amended immigration \nlaw. And he is not coming forward to ask on the most important decision \nwe face in our country; that is, a decision to go to war.\n  Our Founders understood this and debated this. This is not a new \ndebate. Thomas Jefferson said the Constitution gave ``one effectual \ncheck to the dog of war by transferring the power to declare war from \nthe Executive to the Legislative body.''\n  Madison wrote even more clearly:\n\n       The power to declare war, including the power of judging \n     the causes of war, is fully and exclusively vested in the \n     legislature.\n\n  There was no debate. Our Founding Fathers were unanimous. This was \nour power. To do it when it is convenient after the election is to \nabdicate our responsibility and is to make a serious discussion a \ntravesty.\n  There is no debate more significant than this, and we are going to \nstuff it in a bill. We are going to stuff it in a 2,000-page bill and \nnot talk about it, not vote on it individually. Our leaders must be \nheld accountable. If we don't, there will be no end to the war. The \nridiculous and the absurd must be laid to rest. We have all heard it \nbefore.\n  Toppling Qadhafi led to a jihadist wonderland in Libya. Toppling \nHussein led to chaos in Iraq with which we are still involved. Toppling \nAssad will lead to more chaos and greater danger to America from the \njihadists.\n  The moss-covered, too-long-in-Washington crowd cannot help \nthemselves: War, war, what we need is more war. But they never pay \nattention to the results of the last war. Their policies and the \ncombination of feckless disinterest, fraudulent redlines, and selective \ncombativeness have led us to this point.\n  Yes, we must confront ISIS, in part for penance for the President's \nrole in their rise. But while we do so to protect our interests here \nand abroad, what we need is someone to shout: War, war, what are we \nfighting for?\n  Amidst the interventionists' disjointed and frankly incoherent \nrhetoric, amidst the gathering gloom that sees enemies behind every \nfriend and friends behind every enemy, the only consistent theme is \nwar. These barnacled enablers have never met a war they didn't like. \nThey beat their chests in rhythmic ode to failed policies. Their drums \nbeat to policies that display their outrage but fail to find a cure. \nUnintended consequences drown and smother the possibility of good \nintentions.\n  Must we act to check and destroy ISIS? Yes--and again yes--because of \nthe foolishness of the interventionists. But let's not mistake what we \nmust do. We shouldn't give a free pass to forever intervene in the \ncivil wars of the Middle East. Intervention created this chaos. \nIntervention aided and abetted the rise of radical Islam. Intervention \nhas made us less safe in Libya and in Syria and in Iraq.\n  To those who wish unlimited intervention and boots on the ground \neverywhere, remember the smiling poses of politicians pontificating \nabout so-called freedom fighters and heroes in Libya, in Syria, and in \nIraq, unaware that the so-called freedom fighters may well have been \nallied with kidnapers and killers and jihadists. Are these so-called \nmoderate Islamic rebels in Syria friends or foes? Do we know who they \nreally are?\n  As the interventionists clamor for boots on the ground, we should \nremember that they were wrong about Iraq, they were wrong about Libya, \nand they were wrong about Syria. When will we quit listening to the \nadvocates who have been wrong about every foreign policy position of \nthe last two decades? When does a track record of being consistently \nwrong stop you from being a so-called expert when the next crisis comes \nup? We should remember that they were wrong, that there were no WMDs, \nthat Hussein, Qadhafi, and Assad were not a threat to us. It doesn't \nmake them good, but they were not a threat to us. We should remember \nthat radical Islam now roams the countryside in Libya and in Syria and \nin Iraq. We should remember that those who believe war is the answer \nfor every problem are wrong. We should remember that the war against \nHussein, the war against Qadhafi, and the war against Assad have all \nled to chaos. That intervention enhanced the rise of radical Islam and \nultimately led to more danger for Americans.\n  Before we arm the so-called moderate Muslims in Syria, remember what \nI said a year ago: The ultimate irony you will not be able to overcome \nis that someday these weapons will be used to fight against Americans. \nIf we are forced onto the ground, we will be fighting against those \nsame weapons that I voted not to send a year ago.\n  We will fight ISIS, a war that I accept as necessary largely because \nour own arms and the arms of our allies--Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar--\nhave enabled our new enemy ISIS. Will we ever learn?\n  President Obama now wishes to bomb ISIS and arm the Islamic rebels' \nallies at the same time. We are on both sides of a civil war. The \nemperor has no clothes. Let's just admit it. The truth is sometimes \npainful.\n  We must protect ourselves from radical Islam, but we should never \never have armed radical Islam, and we should not continue to arm \nradical Islam. To those who will say, ``Oh, we are just giving to the \nmoderates, not to the radicals,'' it is going and stopping temporarily \nwith the moderates and then on to ISIS. That is what has been going on \nfor a year. Somehow they predict that something different will occur. \nWe have enabled the enemy we must now confront.\n  Sending arms to so-called moderate Islamic rebels in Syria is a \nfool's errand and will only make ISIS stronger. ISIS grew as the United \nStates and her allies were arming the opposition. So, as we have sent \n600 tons of weapons, ISIS has grown stronger. You are going to tell me \nthat 600 tons of more weapons will defeat ISIS?\n  The barnacled purveyors of war should admit their mistakes and not \ncompound them. ISIS is now a threat. Let's get on with destroying them. \nBut make no mistake--arming Islamic rebels in Syria will only make it \nharder to destroy ISIS.\n\n[[Page S5744]]\n\n  Thank you. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the provision in the continuing \nresolution before us authorizes the President to train and equip \nfriendly forces whose interests and objectives are aligned with ours so \nthat they can fight on their own behalf, much as we have done elsewhere \nin the world--for example, a number of African countries which we have \nhelped support their own freedom and independence, their own efforts to \ngo after the terrorists who terrorized them. We have done that pursuant \nto provisions we have included in previous Defense authorization bills.\n  This year, as our Presiding Officer knows as a very important member \nof our committee, when the Armed Services Committee marked up the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, we approved a \nsimilar Syria train-and-equip provision by a bipartisan vote of 23 to \n3.\n  While ISIS is currently focused on building an Islamic caliphate in \nthe Middle East, its poisonous ideology is hostile not only to the \nregion but to the world, and there is a real risk that the area it \ncontrols could become a launching pad for future terrorist attacks \nagainst the United States and its friends and allies. ISIS is \nterrorizing the Iraqi and the Syrian people, engaging in kidnappings, \nkillings, persecutions of religious minorities, and attacking schools, \nhospitals, and cultural sites.\n  The threat to Americans and American interests was dramatically and \ntragically brought home recently by the brutal beheading of American \njournalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David \nHaines.\n  The President has announced a four-pronged strategy to degrade and \nultimately defeat ISIS. Those four prongs are as follows: first, \nincreased support to Iraqi, Kurdish, and Syrian opposition forces on \nthe ground; second, a systemic campaign of airstrikes against ISIS; \nthird, improved intelligence and efforts to cut off ISIS's funding and \nrecruiting; and fourth, continued humanitarian assistance to ISIS's \nvictims.\n  Our senior military leaders support the President's strategy. When \nGeneral Dempsey testified before the Armed Services Committee, I asked \nwhether he personally supports the President's strategy, and of course \nI asked the question exactly that way--``Do you personally support the \nPresident's strategy?''--so that we would get his own answer and not \nsimply the answer he might feel he has to give because of his Commander \nin Chief's position.\n  When we ask military officers for their own personal position, that \nis what they must give us. When we have confirmation hearings, we ask \nthem that question: Will you give us your own personal opinion when you \ncome before us even though it might differ from the administration in \npower? That is one of the questions we ask on every confirmation, and, \nof course, if we don't get the answer that they will, there will not be \na confirmation.\n  So we asked and I asked as my first question a few days ago whether \nGeneral Dempsey as Chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff personally \nsupports the President's strategy, and his response was, ``I do.'' He \nexplained that the best way forward runs ``through a coalition of Arab \nand Muslim partners and not through ownership of this fight by the \nUnited States.'' Training and equipping the moderate Syrian opposition \nis a critical step. As General Dempsey explained, we need to build ``a \nforce of vetted, trained moderate Syrians to take on ISIL in Syria'' \nbecause ``as long as ISIL enjoys the safe haven in Syria, it will \nremain a formidable force and a threat.''\n\n  Some colleagues have expressed the concern that this new military \neffort could lead us back into a quagmire that we entered with the Iraq \ninvasion in 2003, but what we are voting on here is virtually the \nopposite of what was voted on in the 2002 Authorization for the Use of \nMilitary Force in Iraq.\n  I voted against the Iraq authorization in 2002. I am voting for this \ntrain-and-equip authority today. The differences are huge between what \nwas voted on in 2002 and what we are voting on today.\n  First, in 2003, we invaded Iraq and threw out Saddam Hussein's \ngovernment. This year, by contrast, the Iraqi Government has requested \nour assistance against ISIS. This request has been joined by leaders of \nIraq's Shiites, Sunnis, Kurds, and other religious minorities. The \nglobal community will provide support in response to this request, but \nISIS remains a problem that only Iraqis and Syrians can solve. They can \nsolve it with our help, but only they can solve it.\n  I am continuing on the differences. Indeed, the contrast between what \nwe are voting on today and what was voted on in 2002 is relative to the \nsame country, but what a difference.\n  In 2003, the United States and Britain invaded Iraq with token \nsupport from a handful of Western partners. It was a unilateral \napproach without visible participation or support from Arab or Muslim \nnations. It helped spawn Iraqi resistance, including Al Qaeda in Iraq, \nthe predecessor to ISIS. Al Qaeda in Iraq and ISIS didn't exist before \nour invasion of Iraq in 2003. They are a direct response to our \nunilateral action in Iraq. This year, by contrast--and what a \ncontrast--we are seeing the participation of key Arab and Muslim States \nin the region and their active, visible role will be critical to the \neffectiveness of any international coalition.\n  Our senior military and civilian leaders recognize, as General \nDempsey testified before our committee, that ISIS ``will only be \ndefeated when moderate Arab and Muslim populations in the region reject \nit.''\n  The recent international conferences in Jeddah and Paris were a good \nstart, with a number of Arab States declaring their shared commitment--\nand this was a public statement--to develop a strategy ``to destroy \nISIL wherever it is, including in both Iraq and Syria,'' and joining in \nan international pledge to use ``whatever means necessary'' to achieve \nthis goal.\n  The contrast to the Iraq invasion of 2003 is particularly sharp with \nregard to ground combat troops. In 2003, almost 200,000 American and \nBritish combat troops invaded Iraq. Only after years of relentless \nground combat operations were we able to get our troops out. This year, \nby contrast, the President's policy is that ground combat operations in \nIraq and Syria will not be carried out by us, but by Iraqis, Kurds, and \nSyrians. While the United States and a broad coalition of nations, \nincluding Arab and Muslim countries, will support this effort, there is \nno plan to have American combat forces on the ground.\n  As General Dempsey explained to the Armed Services Committee, U.S. \nforces ``are not participating in direct combat. There is no intention \nfor them to do so.'' You wouldn't know that if you read the press \ncoverage of his testimony, so I will repeat it in the wan hope that \nmaybe this time his statement will be covered. General Dempsey said we \n``are not participating in direct combat. There is no intention for \nthem to do so.'' General Dempsey was talking about the U.S. Armed \nForces.\n  General Dempsey added a caveat that if circumstances change, he \nmight, for instance, recommend to the President that U.S. advisers be \nauthorized to accompany Iraqi security forces into combat. He was clear \nthat these comments were focused on how our forces could best and most \nappropriately advise the Iraqis on their combat operations.\n  Senator Graham asked General Dempsey whether he thought they could \ndefeat ISIL without us being on the ground. The question he asked was: \n``If you think they can [defeat ISIL] without us being on the ground, \njust say yes,'' and General Dempsey responded, ``Yes.''\n  I saw that in all of one newspaper article across the country.\n  Our senior military leaders, of course, reserve the right to \nreconsider their recommendations based on conditions on the ground. I \nwould expect that General Dempsey would say, just as any general would \nsay, we must be free to change a recommendation to the President if \ncircumstances on the ground change. That is a very different statement \nfrom what the press put into General Dempsey's mouth when they said \nGeneral Dempsey suggested we may need U.S. combat forces. The direct \nanswer of General Dempsey was: We have no plan to do it. We believe \nthey can do it without us, and, of course, if conditions change, I must \nmake a different recommendation, or at least might make a different \nrecommendation to the Commander in Chief.\n\n[[Page S5745]]\n\n  At the end of the day, of course, the President, who is the Commander \nin Chief, and not the military, will establish policy. Even if \nconditions change and even if General Dempsey decided to recommend a \ndifferent role for U.S. ground combat troops, it would just be that, a \nrecommendation.\n  The struggle against ISIS in Iraq and in Syria will be a long and \nhard one and we should give it our support. We cannot take the place of \nIraqis and Syrians. They must purge the poison they have in their \ncountry. These extremist groups, such as ISIS and Al Qaeda, must be \npurged by the people they plague, but we can help these people get rid \nof this poison.\n  We are already working with Muslim and Arab countries that are openly \nuniting against a poisonous strain of Islam. It threatens them even \nmore than it threatens us. This has to be an Iraqi and Syrian fight--an \nArab and a Muslim fight--and not a Western fight if it is going to be \nsuccessful. It will be highly destructive to our efforts to bring about \na broad coalition if Congress and the President appear disunited.\n\n  We are asking Arab and Muslim countries to openly take on a plague, a \ncancer, a poison in their midst. That is what we are asking of them. \nThere has been too much behind-the-scenes support, too much quiet \nsupport or opposition, too much inconsistency from a number of Arab and \nMuslim countries. So what the President and Secretary Kerry are doing \nis not just helping to organize a broad coalition of Western and Muslim \ncountries to go after this stain, this threat that is in their midst, \nwhat we are asking them to do is to do it openly so their people see \nthat their governments, and indeed their people, are threatened by this \nterror poison in their midst. What is critical, and what is so hugely \ndifferent is this time it will be an international coalition going \nafter terrorists and not just a Western invasion of a Muslim country.\n  It would be, again, destructive of our efforts to get open support in \nthe Muslim and Arab world for going after these terrorists--this stain \ncalled ISIS--if Congress and the President are disunited. So we should \ngive our support to the provision authorizing the training and \nequipping of vetted, moderate Syrian opposition forces. I hope we do it \non a bipartisan basis here, making it then not only bipartisan but also \nbicameral. What an important statement that will be to the very \ncountries that are seeking to help rid themselves of this cancer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, when we head to the Senate floor, we \nmake choices. We first choose how to get here--whether to take the \nsubway or walk. We choose whether to stop and talk to a colleague or \ntwo along the way. We also choose whether to speak to the press, and \nnormally there are plenty of reporters available to speak to. I and \nmany of my colleagues are often picky about who we talk to. I like \ntalking to reporters just fine, but my staff gets a little nervous.\n  Last week, after coming out of the secure briefing on the situation \nin the Middle East, I went up to the first reporter I saw, because in \nthat briefing no one asked how much this war with ISIL would cost or \nhow we were going to pay for it. At the end of the briefing I asked \nthose questions myself. But it is telling that no one up to that point \nand time had voiced their concerns about costs, which leads me to ask: \nAre we putting another war in the Middle East on a credit card? Will it \nbe added to our debt? Will our grandchildren once again have to pay for \nour choices today?\n  I also asked what domestic programs will be cut if this war is an \nunpaid war. Will they cut improvements to our highways, Head Start, \nViolence Against Women Act funding?\n  We are not having a real debate. We will be voting on whether to \nauthorize the training of moderate Syrian rebels to fight the Islamic \nState.\n  Earlier this year the President told us this would cost about $500 \nmillion. We can say this bill contains no specific dollar amount, but \nthat is what this administration is going to spend, and that is just a \nstart. This discussion will take less than half a day. We need more \ninformation. We have had some briefings and some of the committees up \nhere have had some hearings, but the Senate needs a real debate on the \nextent of our involvement in Iraq and Syria and with ISIL. We need more \ninformation, and that is why I am speaking today and why I spoke to the \npress last week. After all, $500 million is a lot of money. That would \ngo a long way in a State such as Montana where we need to upgrade our \nroads, bridges, fund pre-kindergarten education, and take care of our \npublic lands.\n  This week the President said he will spend up to $1 billion to combat \nthe threat of Ebola in West Africa. I am not going to argue that there \nis a strong case for these requests. ISIL and Ebola are terrible in \ntheir own rights, and no one would think twice if we wiped them from \nthe face of the Earth. But I do have questions about how we pay for \nthese kinds of actions and what our long-term strategy is.\n\n  The President requested $58 billion for additional defense spending \nfor the 2015 fiscal year. That is spending on top of the $490 billion \nthat is just a part of the normal Defense Department's budget.\n  But the bill we are voting on today puts the defense budget on auto \npilot. There is no chance to find other places to cut spending. There \nare no chances to raise revenue so we don't just put this new spending \non the credit card and on the backs of our grandchildren.\n  Folks will say this bill is only for 2 months. They will say that on \nDecember 11, when this bill expires, we can pursue the defense budget \nto cut programs that aren't working to pay for this new military \naction. But we all know that is a heavy lift in a city where it is \neasier to spend than it is to save, especially when we are already \ndipping our hands into the pot to fight ISIL and Ebola.\n  Over a decade ago we sent American servicemembers to Iraq to \noverthrow Saddam Hussein. Americans lost sons and daughters, husbands \nand wives. Families made great personal sacrifices, but our government \nnever asked us to sacrifice as a whole. We didn't raise taxes. We \ndidn't cut spending. We didn't set aside money to take care of our \nveterans who returned from the battlefield with wounds both seen and \nunseen. As a result, combined with massive tax cuts, our deficit and \nour debt exploded.\n  Now $500 million is a far cry from the hundreds of billions of \ndollars we spent in Iraq over the last decade, but this is just a \nstart. We must stop putting wars on credit cards. I wonder if once we \nstart an overseas conflict, do we know when and where it will stop? Do \nwe know what our spending will achieve?\n  Over the last 5 years, we have actually had some progress on deficit \nreduction. We reduced the deficit by two-thirds. But all that is at \nrisk with the beginning of a new conflict.\n  We simply have too many unanswered questions.\n  The President says we are backed by a coalition of nations ready to \njoin our fight against ISIS, but will it be a real coalition? Violent \nextremists are threats to peace-loving societies no matter where they \nare, and I agree with the President that we need to contain and destroy \nISIL before it gets stronger. But only a real coalition, one that \nincludes strong commitments of money, equipment, and manpower from \nMiddle Eastern, Asian, South American, and European nations will lead \nto a long-term stability in that region.\n  These allies should be footing their share of the bill. As I \nmentioned, Americans--whether today's taxpayers or tomorrow's--should \nnot shoulder a disproportionate burden of the cost. After all, if \ncountries such as Saudi Arabia or Turkey feel the growth of ISIL, they \nshould make real commitments to this war-fighting effort. That is what \nhappened during the first gulf war. In that war, members of the \ncoalition contributed more than 80 percent of that war's costs. Because \nif ISIL is truly a worldwide problem, then there should be a worldwide \nresponse and commitment to addressing that problem. If ISIL is \nthreatening to upset the balance of power in the Middle East, then \nMiddle Eastern nations must step up. If terrorists and ISIL are a \nworldwide threat, then the world must step up. Anything else is \nunacceptable.\n  Some say that in order to ensure world peace, America must be a world \nleader. They say no other country is prepared to be the world's \npoliceman. World peace is important, but true peace stems from our \nability to rally\n\n[[Page S5746]]\n\nother nations to our cause. When we convince someone of the merit of \nour argument, when we form strong alliances that stand the test of \ntime, when we act in concert with other nations, our word and our acts \nbecome stronger, and the world's respect grows.\n\n  We are told today that other countries will respond, that other folks \nare joining the fight. But actions speak louder than words. I, for one, \nwould like to see more of it before I vote to commit America's \ntaxpayers' money to this fight.\n  Eleven years ago, we invaded Iraq without a real coalition, and we \nbuilt our argument on false pretenses. Moving forward, we must have a \nreal debate, a sound strategy, and an end game.\n  This body is historically the world's greatest deliberative body. It \nwas here that men such as Daniel Webster and Henry Clay deliberated. We \nare not having that kind of debate today. We are not gathering more \ninformation. There were committee hearings this week, but the die is \ncast, the wheels are in motion. As we say in Montana, the horse is out \nof the barn, the cows are out to pasture.\n  There are 1,600 American troops in Iraq right now who deserve a real \ndebate. Many of them have husbands, wives, children, families. I do not \nknow that I can say with certainty to them: Don't worry, we are \ntraining the right people to fight on the ground in Syria. If America \nis wrong about who we train and who we arm in Syria, my fear is that \nthese 1,600 servicemembers will be joined again by tens of thousands \nmore. For their sake and the sake of the American taxpayer, we need a \nfuller debate that will have a real impact on the decisionmaking \nprocess here in this Senate, and more of that debate should have \nhappened before now.\n  I serve on the Senate Appropriations Committee. I know we must fund \nthe government and prevent a shutdown. That is the responsible thing to \ndo. The cost of last year's shutdown on Montana business was \nextraordinary and unnecessary, and I do not want to repeat that fiasco. \nThat is why I will be voting for that continuing resolution later \ntoday.\n  I know some folks are opposed to this continuing resolution because \nthey think we should pass appropriations bills individually. I \nappreciate that and I agree. But the fact is, the Appropriations \nCommittee--under the chairmanship of Chairwoman Mikulski, who is on the \nfloor right now, and Senator Shelby--has worked hard and worked in a \nbipartisan way to try to make that happen. They have tried to \nreinvigorate this committee and make sure the Senate fulfills our \nconstitutional responsibility to make the hard choices about how we \nspend taxpayers' money.\n  Ironically, some of the folks who have said they don't like passing \nthe CR are the very same folks who have made it harder to pass the \nbipartisan bills that come out of that Appropriations Committee. Talk \nabout playing down to the American people's already low expectations \nfor Congress.\n  So we have no choice other than to pass the CR today. But I am tired \nof spending without a plan. I am tired of getting caught up in fighting \nwars in the Middle East, performing the same actions and expecting a \ndifferent result. I am tired of repeating history without learning its \nlessons.\n  We can do better. And for the sake of our troops, for the sake of our \ntaxpayers, for the sake of our kids, for the fate of our Nation and the \nworld, we must.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Baltimore Orioles\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, we have had some excellent debate here \ntoday on a very consequential matter of arming these so-called Syrian \nmoderates. I know the Senator from Maine, Mr. King, will be coming here \nshortly to participate in that debate, and I think this is a very good \nactivity.\n  While we wait for Senators to come to the floor, I wish to take a few \nminutes to speak about the Baltimore Orioles. This in no way minimizes \nthe debate going on now, but while we have the time for some of the \nSenators coming who want to emphasize this topic, I want to take a \nlittle bit of a breather here.\n  As my colleagues can see, I am wearing the Orioles' colors on the \nSenate floor today, and while we must address issues, we have to \nremember the kinds of things that make America great. In this \ncontinuing resolution, in addition to dealing with intense foreign \npolicy needs and intense foreign policy crises, we have to remember \nthat we are actually funding both our national security and the \nDepartment of Defense and very important domestic programs, including \npreschool, NIH to find cures for autism and Alzheimer's, and so on. We \nalso want to not only keep the government going but remember what is so \ngreat about our country.\n  Of course, baseball is one of the things that makes our country \ngreat. That is why I rise today to congratulate the Baltimore Orioles \nwho won the American East title. As I said, I wear their colors today \non the floor and I hope to wear them at Camden Yards.\n  My home team not only represents the tough, enduring spirit of \nBaltimore, but the entire State. This team never quits, and it always \nplays hard. Sure, we tip our hats to the rest of the American East, \nincluding the Yankees, the Red Sox, the Rays, the Blue Jays, but this \nis our year.\n  The Orioles are celebrating their 60th anniversary in Baltimore. The \nO's, as we affectionately call them, arrived in 1954. I was a high \nschool girl. I remember the excitement of the team coming, our first \nmajor league team. We played AAA up until then. There was a big parade \nup and down Charles Street. Charm City was charmed by this new baseball \nteam.\n  There have been many amazing events that have occurred since then, \nand, of course, fantastic and legendary players, including Brooks \nRobinson, Frank Robinson, Jim Palmer, Eddy Murray, ``Iron Man'' Cal \nRipken, Jr. We remember our coaches such as Earl Weaver, who got the \nfans excited, and, of course, we remember Cal Ripken, Sr., who taught \nus the Orioles way.\n  So this year we have a team that, once again, is energized and on its \nway to the playoffs.\n  Anyone who has watched the Orioles this season at Camden Yards knows \nthis was a true team effort. The American East title was made possible \nby clutch hits and home runs, spectacular catches and gutsy pitching. \nWhen the All-Star players weren't on the field, workhorse veterans and \npromising young rookies stepped up night after night.\n  Yes, there is Oriole magic. We have our manager, Buck Showalter, who, \nas my colleagues know, is a laugh a minute. I am joking. If my \ncolleagues have looked at Mr. Showalter, they know he doesn't crack a \nsmile, but he sure teaches his players how to crack the bat. His \nattention to the big picture and to the smallest detail is the way he \nhas taught his team to function.\n  We think we are on our way to what is called the battle of the \nbeltways. It is conceivable that we will be playing the Washington \nNationals who have just won the National League East title, and a tip \nof the hat to our friends in the District of Columbia. We are as \nexcited for them as we are about ourselves, and we can't wait to meet. \nI am hoping for this.\n  Three cheers for the Baltimore Orioles who have earned this fantastic \ntitle. We won't stop until we have a pennant flying high over our \nstadium.\n  I want to congratulate the entire Orioles organization, from the \nmanagers to the front office, and the owner of the team, Peter Angelos, \nwho rescued our team many years ago from being sold out of town. Peter \nAngelos stepped up to the plate and saved it and kept the team in \nBaltimore, and he has kept the team on the go. Now that fantastic team, \nunder great leadership, wonderful players, and the best fans in both \nleagues, is looking forward to the playoffs.\n  We are also looking forward to not only the game, but it is the \nspirit of community that is in Baltimore. Our city hall in the evening \nis lit up in orange. When we travel the city, we see people wearing the \ncolors and laughing and giving each other shoulder to\n\n[[Page S5747]]\n\nshoulder and high fives. When people come to Baltimore now to go visit \na great institution such as Johns Hopkins, whether a person is an \norderly or a facilities manager, or whether a person is a Nobel Prize \nwinner, everybody is wearing the orange. Whether people are Black, \nWhite, Hispanic, Latino, men, women, we are all there. That is because \nit is about baseball. It is about a team. It is about America. It is \nabout the land of the free and the home of the brave.\n  So let's keep our government open. Let's be on the playing field and \nin the competition for jobs and opportunity. And I will be back for the \nlameduck, gloating.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I rise today to speak about ISIS--the \nthreat, what we can do about it, and what we must do about it.\n  Why are we having this debate? Why are we conducting airstrikes? This \nis a clear and present danger to the United States of America. This \ngroup has done everything but send us an email saying we are coming for \nyou. They have made comments: We will see you in New York. They \nbrutally murdered two of our citizens.\n  If they have free rein in the area that is as big as the State of \nIndiana, I suppose, between eastern Syria and western and northern \nIraq, there, undoubtedly, will come a time when they will strike here \nand in Europe and in other parts of the world.\n  I am here today to support the provision of the continuing resolution \nthat will allow us to begin the arming, equipping, and training of the \nSyrian moderate opposition.\n  Why do we even have this discussion? Because the most fundamental \nresponsibility of any government anywhere, any time is to protect our \ncitizens. The preamble of the U.S. Constitution says that one of the \nfundamental purposes listed in the preamble is to ``provide for the \ncommon defense'' and ``insure domestic tranquility''--a basic function \nof any government. This is why we are having this debate today.\n  This arming and equipping provision is not a panacea. It is not going \nto end the war. It is not going to be easy. It is no sure thing.\n  A friend said to me this morning: It is the least worst option. It is \none that we must undertake. It has to be part of the solution because \nto root out ISIS, whose headquarters are in Syria--not Iraq--there are \ngoing to have to be troops. There are going to have be combat troops. \nThere is no such thing as a surgical war.\n  Where are those troops going to come from? Not from the United \nStates--they have to come from within the Syrian opposition itself.\n  This is also important as a gesture to the coalition we are building \nto confront this threat. Having a credible coalition--which I will \nexpand upon in a moment--is an incredibly important part of this entire \nstrategy. Without a functioning real coalition, it is impossible, it is \nan impossible task. This cannot be a U.S. war. This cannot be a war of \nthe West against this so-called Islamic State. It has to involve \nparticularly the neighbors in the region.\n  I am also supportive of the general strategy the President outlined, \nbut I think there are several points that need to be absolutely \nemphasized. One is the importance of the coalition. We cannot have a \ncoalition that just holds our coat while we do the fighting. They have \nto be engaged in an active way--not just writing checks.\n  If we try to do this ourselves, not even if we were inclined to do \nthis with our own troops, it wouldn't work. These have to be local \nfaces on the ground. There are going to be boots on the ground, but \nthey are not and should not and cannot be ours.\n  The second thing that is so important in this strategy the President \noutlined the other night is a trustworthy, inclusive government in \nBaghdad. The reason ISIS was so successful in this sweep through \nnorthern Iraq and into Mosul was that they were swimming in friendly \nwaters. They were swimming in the Sunni regions of Iraq where the local \ntribes and Sunni leaders have been alienated and systematically \nexcluded from the government in Baghdad.\n  If the government in Baghdad cannot build credibility with that \ngroup, this is a hopeless enterprise. Prime Minister al-Abadi needs to \nchannel his inner Mandela. He has to be inclusive of even the people \nwho were his enemies and the enemies of his sect at a prior time.\n  This has to be a government that can be trusted. Really what is going \non is a battle for the loyalty of the Sunni population of Iraq to see \nwhether they are going to be loyal to this brutal so-called Islamic \nState or to the government of the country in Baghdad. That is the \nchallenge that is before that government today.\n  So far the signs are positive, but we are still in the very first \nweeks of this regime. But that has to be a crucial element of our \nstrategy. So these are two pieces that are largely out of our control.\n  We can try to build a coalition. We can put pressure on the \ngovernment in Baghdad, but these folks have to do it themselves. We \ncannot be the policemen of the Middle East.\n  The third piece is building the Syrian opposition. The same goes for \nAl-Raqqa, the headquarters of ISIS in Syria. There are going to have to \nbe people on the ground, and they are not going to be Americans. They \nhave to come from the Syrian opposition, and that is why that is an \nimportant element of the strategy.\n  I think there is another discussion we have to have. Unfortunately, \nthe calendar doesn't allow us to have it today. I believe there must be \na new authorization for the use of military force. The authorization \nthat was passed right after September 11, 2001, has been stretched and \nstrained to the point where if it is allowed to become the \njustification for anything, there is nothing left of the clause of the \nConstitution that says Congress shall be the one to declare war.\n  I have gone back and looked at the history of that clause. Very \ninterestingly, the original draft of the Constitution said Congress \nshall make war. At the time, the Framers realized that Congress would \nnot be the right entity to execute the war itself, to make the \nbattlefield decisions. The Framers were adamant that the momentous \ndecision of entering this country into war had to be in the branch of \nthe government most representative of the people.\n  They went through history--in the 49th Federalist they talk about how \nthroughout history unfettered executives, princes, kings mischievously \nand often on weak grounds got their countries engaged in war. They made \na conscious decision that this responsibility was left with the \nCongress. Unfortunately, over the years, going back to the late 1940s, \nwe allowed that clause to atrophy. We allowed the Executive to take \nmore and more responsibility and power and unilateral authority. People \nare saying: Well, this President is acting unilaterally. This is \nnothing new. This goes back to Harry Truman and the Korean war. This \nisn't something that Barack Obama invented.\n  Presidents naturally want more authority. They do have the power to \ndefend our country when the threat is imminent and real, but they don't \nhave the power to commit American armed forces in any place, at any \ntime, under any circumstances.\n  I believe we have a constitutional responsibility to consider this \nmatter, to debate it, to argue about the terms of what the \nauthorization should be--how it should be limited in duration, \ngeography, target, in means of confrontation with the enemy. That is \nwhat we must do.\n  Finally, beyond this AUMF, beyond ISIS, assume for a moment we are \ntremendously and utterly successful over the next 6 months, a year, 2 \nyears, and ISIS is gone, the problem is history has taught us someone \nwill take their place.\n  The real issue is radical jihadism. We have to have a strategy to \ndeal with that in the long term that doesn't involve trying to just \nkill them as they come forward. It was characterized recently as \ngeopolitical Whac-A-Mole. We stop them in one place, and it comes up \nsomewhere else, and we all know about al-Shabaab, al-Nusra, Al Qaeda, \nAl Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and Boko Horam.\n  We have to be talking about and developing a strategy to deal with \nthis threat to our country and to the rest of the world on a more long-\nterm basis than simply having continuous--what amounts to--battles \nagainst elements of these people.\n\n[[Page S5748]]\n\n  Why are they doing this? What is attracting young people to this \ndestructive philosophy, and how can we best counteract that? I believe \nwe have to make a decision today.\n  As I said, I also think we have to make a decision before the end of \nthe year as to what the scope, limits, and authority of the President \nare in this matter. We can try to avoid it, but I don't believe we can.\n  On December 1, 1862, Abraham Lincoln sent a message to this body, and \nthe conclusion of that message was that we cannot escape history. It \nwill light us down from one generation to the next. I believe that we \nneed to stand and debate, argue, refine, and finally reach a conclusion \nso that the American people can understand what we are doing and why.\n\n  The Executive will have clear authority. The rest of the world will \nknow that this is the United States of America taking this position--\nnot a President and not a few Members of Congress. That is a \nresponsibility I believe we are ready to assume. This is a threat. It \nmust be met, and we must participate in the decision to meet it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                                Ukraine\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I come to the floor to, first of all, \nthank President Poroshenko for the speech he gave to a joint session of \nthe Congress today. It was a very moving speech. I think it was a very \ndirect speech, and it really showed how important it is that we stand \nwith the people of Ukraine during this trying time with the aggression \nthey are facing from Russia.\n  I come to the floor to say a couple of things. At the end of his \nspeech, he used the motto of my home State--the State of New Hampshire: \nLive Free or Die. In New Hampshire we are very proud of that motto. It \ncame from a statement during the American Revolution from General John \nStark, and it really does not only have meaning to my home State of New \nHampshire but also to the people of Ukraine with what they have been \nfacing--those who stood in the Maidan and gave their lives for freedom \nand democracy in Ukraine.\n  I have had the privilege of going to Ukraine twice, both in March and \nalso to oversee their presidential elections. In both instances, I was \nvery struck by the patriotism, by their love for America, and their \ngratefulness for our support.\n  As we heard President Poroshenko say to all of us today, now more \nthan ever they need American support. There is something I have been \ncalling for--for a while, in fact. When I went there in March--and also \nI had the privilege of traveling with Senator Donnelly--it was a \nbipartisan codel--and also in May, in both of those instances we had \nthe request for lethal assistance so that the Ukrainian military would \nhave the arms they need to defend themselves against this Russian \naggression.\n  So today we also heard President Poroshenko call upon us again to \nprovide the support for the Ukrainian military. They have fought and \ncontinue to fight and die for their own independence, freedom, and \nterritorial integrity. The least we can do is provide them lethal \nassistance.\n  As President Poroshenko rightly said today: Blankets and night vision \ngoggles are important, but one cannot win a war with a blanket.\n  I would hope all of us stood together today, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, to say we stand with the people of Ukraine.\n  I know this afternoon the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has come \ntogether and marked up a very important aid package to Ukraine which \ncontains lethal assistance for their military.\n  I would hope our President would see that on a bipartisan basis we \nstand with the people of Ukraine and we must provide them with this \nassistance they need.\n  Finally, I would say that the Budapest Memorandum that President \nPoroshenko mentioned today is very important.\n  We were a signatory to that memorandum, as was Russia. In that \nmemorandum, the signing of it, Ukraine gave up their nuclear weapons in \nexchange for our assurances that we would respect their sovereignty, \nsecurity assurances, and their territorial integrity. Obviously, Russia \nhas trampled all over this. But I would say the least we can do is \nprovide this lethal assistance they have asked for given that they gave \nup their nuclear weapons.\n  We signed on to that agreement. We should support them in their time \nof need so that they can defend their sovereignty. What country ever \nagain is going to give up their nuclear weapons if we will not even \ngive them basic military assistance when their country is invaded the \nway Ukraine has been invaded by Russia?\n  Now is our time and our moment. We all stood together in the House \nChamber today for the people of Ukraine. What matters is our actions, \nnot just our words and our standing ovations.\n  I hope we will stand with the people of Ukraine. I call upon our \nPresident to provide lethal assistance to the people of Ukraine and to \nprovide the support and tougher sanctions on Russia--economic \nsanctions--for their invasion and their total disrespect for the \nsovereignty of the country of Ukraine.\n  I would defer to my colleague, Senator McCain from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I always appreciate it when the Senator from New \nHampshire defers to me--a rare occasion, I might add.\n  I rise today to speak in support of the continuing resolution on \nwhich we will vote. I do not do so because I approve of the bulk of the \nCR. I certainly do not approve of the process that got us here. It is a \nbroken, dysfunctional process that deserves and has received the scorn \nand disdain of the American people. Long ago we should have been taking \nup these bills one by one. But that is not why I come to the floor \ntoday\n  I am voting for this CR for one particular reason: It would help the \nDepartment of Defense train and equip moderate, vetted Syrian \nopposition forces to fight the barbaric terrorist army that calls \nitself the Islamic State, commonly known as ISIS. I will support it. It \nis long overdue support for the brave Syrians who are fighting on the \nfrontlines against a common terrorist enemy.\n  The current plan could have been decisive 2 years ago. Two years ago \nit could have been decisive. It is not now. We are talking about 5,000 \nwhom we are going to train over a period of a year or more. They are \ngoing to be fighting against an estimated 31,500 fighters.\n  There are many seminal events that have taken place in this conflict. \nOne of the main ones was when 2 years ago the President overruled the \nmajor players in his national security team when he overruled their \nunanimous and passionate argument to arm and train the Free Syrian \nArmy.\n  The administration says that U.S. forces will not have a combat role. \nWhy does the President insist on continuing to tell the enemy what he \nwill not do? Why is it that the President of the United States keeps \ntelling the people who are slaughtering thousands: Don't worry, we \nwon't commit ground troops. Why does he have to keep saying that? \nObviously--at least one would draw the conclusion--because of political \nreasons.\n  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had this to say. I do not know of a \nman who is more respected than former Secretary of Defense Gates under \nboth Republican and Democratic Presidents. He said:\n\n       The reality is, they're not going to be able to be \n     successful against ISIS strictly from the air or strictly \n     depending on the Iraqi forces or the Peshmerga or the Sunni \n     tribes acting on their own.\n\n  Gates continued:\n\n       So there will be boots on the ground if there is going to \n     be any hope of success in the strategy. I think that by \n     continuing to repeat that--\n\n  That the United States will not put boots on the ground--\n\n     the President, in effect, traps himself.\n\n  That is the opinion not of John McCain and Lindsey Graham, it is the \nopinion of Robert Gates and every military expert I have talked to, \nranging from the architects of the surge, to former Chairmen of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff and, confidentially, leaders in uniform today.\n  The President said he will expand airstrikes in Syria, but they have \ntestified that the President will not have\n\n[[Page S5749]]\n\nforward air controllers on the ground to direct airstrikes, which makes \nthem obviously effective.\n  As we read today in the Wall Street Journal--this is remarkable, my \nfriends--President Obama will be personally signing off on every \nairstrike in Syria. I say to my colleagues: I saw that movie before--it \nwas called Vietnam--many years ago when President Lyndon Johnson used \nto select the targets in the Oval Office or the Situation Room. Now we \nhave a President of the United States who is selecting targets of which \nhe has no fundamental knowledge whatsoever. It is really remarkable.\n  We are going to train and equip these people to fight. Yet we are not \ngoing to take out the assets Bashar Assad uses to kill them--the air \nattacks, the barrel bombs; the indiscriminate killing of innocent \nwomen, men, and children; 192,000 dead in Syria; 150,000 languishing in \nhis prisons. We are not going to take out or even give these people, \nthe Free Syrian Army, the weapons with which to counter these air \nattacks which are so brutal and outrageous.\n  I would like to yield for my friend from South Carolina to make a \ncouple of comments. One, the argument I have heard made here is that \nthere are no moderates in Syria. Well, I think arguably one of the most \nimportant and impressive individuals I have run into is Ambassador \nFord, who has really been a hero in this whole exercise. He says there \nare moderates in Syria. They can fight. They have been fighting. They \nhave been doing incredible work with incredible sacrifice. I am trying \nto find his quote from when he testified before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee yesterday. He did a magnificent job in doing so, as usual, in \nmy view.\n  I cannot seem to find it, but I would point out that he says not only \ncan they fight, but they have been fighting, and they have been doing a \nheroic job in doing so. That is also the opinion of people who know. So \nthere are moderates. If we train and equip them, they can be effective. \nThe problem is that we have not done too little, it is we have done too \nmuch. We have weakened Assad and hurt his ability to fight ISIS. ISIS \nis a problem for the Middle East.\n  If ISIS is a problem for the Middle East, I wonder what the \nAustralians think today? Australian police detained 15 people Thursday \nin a major counterterrorism operation, saying the intelligence \nindicated that a random violent attack was being planned in Australia. \nWe know what their object is. It is to strike the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I say in response to these uninformed colleagues of mine who say the \nFree Syrian Army cannot fight: Syrian forces are seen stepping up \nattacks on rebels as U.S. sets site on ISIS.\n  Time after time there have been places ISIS has controlled and the \nFree Syrian Army has come in and then Bashar Assad attacks because they \nwant to defeat them.\n  The fact is I see the critics come here on the floor of the Senate \nand talk about why everything is wrong, why nobody will fight, why we \ncannot arm the right people. Well, what is their solution? Do they \nreject the premise articulated by ISIS that they want to attack the \nUnited States? Do they contradict Mr. Baghdadi, who, when he left our \nprison camp, Bucca, said: I will see you in New York. Is that what this \nis all about? Of course it is a threat to the United States of America. \nFor us to do nothing obviously will be a serious mistake.\n  I yield 5 minutes for my colleague from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Do we have time remaining?\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans currently have 67 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will be very quick.\n  I will vote for the continuing resolution because I do not want to \nshut the government down. I agree with Senator McCain that this is not \nthe right process, but we are where we are. I think the issue people \nare focusing on about the continuing resolution is the changing of the \ntraining of the Free Syrian Army from title 50, a covert program, to \ntitle 10, the Department of Defense, where it will be out in the open.\n  The reason I support the appropriation and the change in title 10--I \nthink this is a long-overdue effort on our part to build up Syrian \nforces that can confront both Assad and ISIL, enemies of the United \nStates.\n  To my colleagues who worry about the people we train and the arms we \ngive falling into the wrong hands, I would say that there is nothing we \ncan do in this area without some risk. But when you tell me there are \nno Syrians that you believe exist who would fight against Assad and \nISIL, I do not believe you quite understand what is going on in Syria. \nI would say that the vast majority of Syrians have two things in \ncommon: They want to overthrow Assad and they want to get ISIL out of \ntheir country.\n  ISIL is mostly non-Syrians. They came from the vacuum created by a \nlack of security. When Hezbollah and Russia doubled down to protect \nAssad, who was just about knocked out several years ago, the Free \nSyrian Army was abandoned by us and the rest of the world and ISIL was \nable to fill in that vacuum. These are foreign fighters.\n  So to my colleagues who talk about how they worry, I worry too. I \nworry about doing nothing. I worry about finding an excuse not to do \nanything. It bothered me when Republicans embraced the position of \nPresident Obama just a few weeks ago that it was a fantasy to train the \nSyrians to fight for Syria. I do not think it is a fantasy to train \nSyrians to fight for Syria because they want to. This whole revolution \nagainst Assad was not to overthrow him and replace Assad with ISIL.\n  The people who think the average Syrian wants to be dominated by ISIL \ninstead of Assad, really, I do not think they appreciate what is going \non in Syria. That is selling the Syrian people short.\n  Having said that, the limitations of what the Free Syrian Army can do \nat this point are real, but training as many as possible makes sense to \nme. My goal is to keep the war over there so it does not come here. \nFrom an American point of view, I think it would be a huge mistake not \nto provide training and resources to those people in the region--in \nSyria--to do the fighting because we have common enemies.\n  Those who say this is too risky, what is your alternative? If we do \nnothing, ISIL will continue to grow and the threat to our homeland will \ncontinue to increase.\n  It is long past time to blunt the momentum of this vicious terrorist \norganization. A Free Syrian Army component makes perfect sense to me. \nWhatever risk is associated with that concept is well worth it at this \npoint.\n  When we talk about Iraq, I hope the Iraqi Government can reconstitute \nitself. Their military is in shambles. The Kurds are hanging on in the \nnorth with our help. But to dislodge ISIL from Iraq and take back \nFallujah and Mosul and other cities, as General Dempsey indicated, \nwould be a very difficult military endeavor. From my point of view, the \nlast thing America wants to do is take ISIL on in Iraq and Syria and \nfail.\n  If you do believe that it is about our homeland and that it is not \njust about the Mideast, allowing ISIL to defeat any force we throw at \nit makes them larger and more lethal over time. So the worst possible \noutcome is to form a coalition in Syria of Arab countries and they are \ndefeated by ISIL because we do not provide them the capabilities they \nlack.\n  President Obama's insistence of no boots on the ground is the \nAchilles' heel to his strategy. This is a military strategy, I believe, \ndesigned around political promises. This is not the military strategy \nyou would create to destroy or devastate ISIL. President Bush made many \nmistakes in Iraq, but to his credit he changed the strategy in a \nfashion that allowed us to succeed.\n\n  One thing I have learned over the past 13 years, you can have a lot \nof troops doing the wrong thing and it will not matter. When you leave \nno troops behind, that is a mistake. And if you have too few troops \ndoing the right thing, it will not matter.\n  The President is right about this. We don't need to reinvade Iraq or \nSyria. We don't need the 82nd Airborne to go in with 100,000 troops \nbehind it, but we do need to provide capacity to the Iraqis and any \nfuture coalition to deal with Syria that is lacking in that part of the \nworld.\n\n[[Page S5750]]\n\n  Like it or not the American military is second to none. The special \nforces capability we have can really be decisive in this fight. To \nevery American, this is not only about them over there, this is about \nus here.\n  The better and the sooner that ISIL is defeated, the more decisive \nISIL is defeated, and the sooner that day comes about, the safer we are \nat home.\n  I urge the President to not take options off the table.\n  I am voting for this change in strategy regarding the Free Syrian \nArmy because I think it is long overdue. When the President does the \nright thing, I want to be his partner. Mr. President, if you will come \nup with a strategy to destroy and defeat ISIL that makes sense, I will \nbe your best ally and try to help you on this side of the aisle. This \nis a first step in the right direction, but when you play out this \nstrategy, which you are trying to do, I think it will not work unless \nyou embrace American assistance in a greater level to the Iraqi \nmilitary and to any coalition you could create in Syria.\n  The last thing I want this body to understand, this is the last best \nchance we will have to put ISIL back in a box so they can't wreak havoc \nin the Mideast and grow in strength. The stronger they are over there, \nthe more endangered we are over here.\n  It is in our interests to help our Arab allies and our Iraqi allies \ndestroy ISIL. It is not just about those people over there. Lines of \ndefenses in the war on terror make perfect sense to me.\n  The best way to keep this fight off our shores is to engage the \npeople who will help us carry the fight to the common enemy. ISIL is \nnot only an enemy of Islam, it is an enemy of mankind, and failing to \ndefeat these people will resonate here very quickly.\n  We have a chance. Let's take advantage of it. There is nothing we can \ndo in a war on terror without risk, but now we are fighting an Army, \nnot an organization. If we defeat ISIS, the war is not over. This is a \ngenerational struggle. But if you do defeat ISIL, as a turning point in \nour favor--if they survive our best attempt to defeat them--God help us \nall.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I wish to add, again I found a quote from the testimony \nof Robert Ford, an unusual man, our Ambassador to Syria and a man who \nliterally risked his own life. In his report he said: Many Americans \nquestioned whether there are any moderates left in the Syrian armed \nopposition. There are. They are fighting the Islamic State and the \nAssad regime both. They are, not surprisingly, hard pressed, and they \ncould very much use our help.\n  I assure my colleagues, from my many visits there and knowing these \npeople, there are moderates in Syria today who will fight and are \nfighting. Unfortunately, they are being attacked both from ISIS and \nfrom Bashar Assad. This brings me to we need to negate Bashar Assad's \nair attacks and capabilities. Otherwise, we are going to train and \nequip these young people and send them into death, which would be \nneedless.\n  There are several articles, one in the New Republic entitled ``We \nCan't Destroy ISIS Without Destroying Bashar al Assad First;'' another \none, ``Assad Policies Aided Rise of Islamic State Militant Group;'' \nanother one, ``Blame Assad First for ISIS' Rise.''\n  What was most disturbing yesterday about the Secretary of State's \nstatements was when he said: Well, ISIL first. You cannot sequence \nthem. They are too closely tied, and we cannot defeat ISIL in Syria if \nwe leave Bashar Assad with his air capabilities.\n  There are no good options. A series of decisions have been made which \nled us to the point we are today, all based on the fundamental belief \nthat the United States could leave the area and everything would take \ncare of itself. What happened was that we left a vacuum that was filled \nby bad people. Now there is a threat to the United States of America.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, but I also believe \nit is an act of cowardice that we didn't take up the bill separately, \ndebate, amend, and vote on an issue of this utmost seriousness where, \nin one way or another--whether the President wants to admit it--we are \nagain sending Americans into harm's way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I wasn't planning to speak on the floor. I will speak for \na couple of minutes, but I appreciate my colleagues who have just \nspoken and their conversation, as well as many others who have spoken \non the floor.\n  Let me make it very clear. This conversation I am having right now is \nnot about the CR. It is going to pass. It is going to move forward. We \nhave to keep operating. The artificial threat that it might be shut \ndown if we don't vote in a certain way with regard to the government is \nnot factual.\n  The CR is going to pass. The House passed it. People don't want to \nsee a problem as they had a year and a half ago, so I feel very \nconfident with where we are going with the CR. But I agree with the \ncomment that this issue, regarding what is going on with Syria, should \nbe a separate issue, should be debated separately. It shouldn't just be \nshoved into a continuing resolution for the purpose of getting all of \nthis done because we all think we have to leave by Thursday night or \nFriday morning. It is a very significant issue, one I have already made \nmy statement very clear after the President spoke that despite my \ncolleagues on the other side--two of them who were just on the floor--I \nwant to make sure I correct what they said--we just have differences of \nopinion and views.\n  We hear statements that people aren't informed or they don't want to \ndo anything, that is not the factual basis here. We have different \nviews when it comes to the issues of conflict in this world, where \nAmerica should sit, what we should be doing, how we should be acting, \nwho our partners should be and what they should be doing. It has \nnothing to do with the government being shut down, the CR or being \nuninformed. I think this body is well informed. We have had many \nbriefings, many discussions.\n  The question is just our view of where we stand on the issue of do we \narm the rebels in Syria to do something we hope they will do. That is \nthe question, and that is the debate we are in right now. I appreciate \nat least the limited time we have on it.\n  Let me make my position very clear. I have made it clear before, but \nI want to say it again. I do not support the arming of rebels in Syria.\n  In the Appropriations Committee we had an amendment on this, which I \nvoted for--not to make sure the funding didn't pass, but I think it was \na statement that was important. This is not a newfound belief. I \nsupport the airstrikes. This is an institutional effort, strategy, and \nthings are moving in the right direction.\n  As a matter of fact, yesterday or the day before Baghdad was being \nmoved on by ISIL. Let me make it clear, ISIL, ISIS, whatever you want \nto call them, they are a terrorist group.\n  To say they are called the Islamic State, they are not a state. They \nare a bunch of terrorist thugs. Let's be honest about it. When they \nmade a move on Baghdad, we came in at the request of the Government of \nIraq to give air support. We did and then we pushed them back and \ncontinued to follow up. That seemed to work in that situation.\n  Here we are in a situation of do we arm the rebels, do we believe in \ncombat troops, humanitarian aid? What is our role in this endeavor?\n  Again, I disagree with my President, and when I say that, the \nPresident of the Democratic Party. It doesn't mean I agree with him \nthat often. There are times when we disagree quite a bit on many \nissues, but on this one I disagree. Arming the rebels and who they are \ntoday and who they might be 12 months from now--I don't know.\n  The bigger issue to me is also the Arab countries. I understand we \nhave seen in the past few days they are starting to have conversations \nand wanting to participate, but this is their country, their region. \nWhat do they do? Where are they stepping up to the plate more?\n  Here we are, once again, going to have to solve some civil war issues \nin the Middle East. Instead, the countries in the region are saying, \nwell, maybe we will help a little here, help a little there. They need \nto put troops on the ground. They need to step up to the plate, as well \nas the faith and religious leaders in that region because these\n\n[[Page S5751]]\n\nterrorists are a threat to the region and to our country.\n\n  The photos we have seen of the beheadings are horrific, outlandish, \nand outrageous. Don't get me wrong. This is a bad organization and \nshould be dealt with in such a way, but we need the countries there to \nassist us in a much more aggressive way.\n  Today we heard from the President of Ukraine. He came to a joint \nsession of Congress. Why did he come? Because he believes in his \ncountry. He is fighting for his country. He needs our help and he is \nasking for our help. He is not hiding behind closed-door meetings and \ntrying to negotiate ways that they can't be seen asking us for help. He \nis asking because he wants to believe in democracy, what is right for \nhis country. He is fighting for his homeland. His line--and I remember \nin his speech that he gave today, this morning--was you don't have to \ncreate the democracy, you just have to defend it.\n  But here we are in the Middle East with unusual allies because it is \na convoluted situation. In some ways, we participated, but we also have \nto have the Iraqi Government be more sustainable. That means inclusion, \nwhich they haven't done. They are trying, but we have had to put \npressure on them because now ISIL has moved into their country. As we \nknow, some of those Arab countries, through some of those well-funded \npeople, funded ISIL. But now the beast has grown so big it is out of \ncontrol, and now they say: Whoops. We might have made a mistake. Now we \nneed the United States to come in again.\n  What is the long-term plan for sustainability in the Middle East, to \nget rid of these terrorist organizations that every single one of those \ncountries knows is bad for them? They know it.\n  But they don't step up to the plate enough. Every time we have to \nstep up, and America--my wife and I have been to I don't know how many \nfunerals, how many hospitals.\n  Are we asking--I heard some of my colleagues here now talking about \ncombat troops. Absolutely not--absolutely not.\n  It is time for the Arab countries to step up, get over their regional \ndifferences, and know this is one organization, this terrorist \norganization, ISIS, ISIL--whatever you want to call them today--it is \nbad for them, bad for this world, and they need to stand and be more \naggressive. That means combat troops on the ground for them, for them \nto do it, for them to step up to the plate.\n  ISIS is this terrorist organization, and they are making money off of \noil, oil wells they have captured, shipping it out through one of our \n``allies.'' Why don't we just dismantle these oil wells through \nairstrikes--stop their cash flow like that.\n  Probably we are not going to do it because I am sure we are hearing \nfrom people: Well, that is not really their oil. We will take them out, \nand then we will get our oil back. They own the oil right now because \nthey are using it to fund their $3 million-a-day operation. Take out \ntheir oil wells, take out their cash flow. Then get the Arab countries \nto step up and do not arm with U.S. dollars and weapons the rebels of \ntoday who may not be the rebels of tomorrow.\n  Thank you for the opportunity to let me come to the floor and say my \npiece. It is going to be an interesting vote. I know the CR will pass. \nI will be in the minority, but I think it is important we put on the \nrecord where we stand on this issue.\n  Don't get me wrong. I believe they are a threat to the United States, \nand when they threaten our assets, our people, we will be on it and we \nwill deal with them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I know the distinguished Senator from Illinois is \nscheduled to speak.\n  I just want to make clear that the threat of a shutdown is not an \nidle threat. I respect the views of the Senator from Alaska, a member \nof my own committee, who now says he is going to vote against the CR \nbecause he is saying: Oh, it will pass. It is an artificial threat.\n  The Senator is entitled to his views and certainly his vote on what \nhe thinks is in the best interests of the Nation, but we have to pass \nthe CR, and I would note it is not an artificial threat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. There are moments when Members of the Senate have to \nreflect on the responsibility we are given--extraordinary moments, \nunlike other votes that we cast--because at least part of this \nimportant spending bill relates to U.S. military involvement in the \nMiddle East. Reality tells us people will die if there is conflict. Of \ncourse we hope it will be the enemy, but we know better. Even some of \nour people are at risk to die in any military undertaking. So every \nMember of the Senate should take this vote seriously, and I am sure \nthey do.\n  I remember October 11, 2002, as if it were yesterday. I was here in \nthe Senate, weeks away from an election, and we were asked to vote on \nthe invasion of Iraq. The buildup to this vote was overwhelming. The \nPresident and others--the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, \nthe head of the CIA, and a long list--had made the case to the American \npeople that there were weapons of mass destruction in the hands of \nSaddam Hussein; and that if we didn't move in, strike, and stop him, \nthey could threaten our allies, friends, and even the United States. We \ndebated that and voted on it. It was late at night on October 11, 2002.\n  I remember that vote as if it were yesterday. At the end of that \nvote, 23 of us had voted no against the invasion of Iraq--one \nRepublican, Senator Chafee of Rhode Island, and 22 Democrats.\n  I went down to the well of this Chamber and there were two of my \ncolleagues there, Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Kent Conrad of North \nDakota. I said to Paul Wellstone, who was up for reelection: I hope \nthis doesn't cost you your seat--because he had voted no as well.\n  He said: It is all right if it does. This is what I believe, and this \nis how I am going to vote. I thought to myself: He may not return to \nthe Senate. Tragically, he did not. He was involved in a plane crash \njust days later that took his life and the life of his wife and a \nstaffer. But it is an indication of the gravity and the importance of \nthis job, of this Chamber, and of this vote.\n  What we are being asked to do by the President is much different than \nwhat we were asked to do in 2002, when it came to the invasion of Iraq. \nThe President has identified a threat to the United States. It is \ncalled the Islamic State, ISIL. It is an emerging group that has broken \nout of extremist groups in the Middle East, and it is on a rampage. It \nis marching through Syria and Iraq in a way we have not seen extremist \ngroups act. It is capturing territory which extremist groups seldom do, \nand in capturing territory it is doing several other things. It is \ntaking all of the tangible assets of cities such as Mosul, raiding \ntheir banks, breaking into the vaults, taking their money, taking over \noil fields and gas fields--producing a small economy and budget which \nis growing by the day. This is not the typical terrorist group which we \nhave seen in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, and, in the \nprocess, in their wake, they are killing people right and left.\n  The butchery, the savagery of this group is really unheard of in \nmodern times. It hearkens back to the barbarism of centuries ago. To \nbehead two innocent Americans--can we imagine to do it with a camera \nrunning? It is just unthinkable what those poor families are going \nthrough even today as they think about this. That is part of their \ntactics, to intimidate the United States. Now they have done it to a \nBritish captive, and they promise to do even more. They are serious. \nThey want to take over Syria and Iraq. Should we care? Of course we \nshould.\n  But what did we learn from the invasion of Iraq? What did we learn \nafter spending 8 years there that would bring us back in any way? Well, \nhere is what we learned.\n  We learned that putting American military on the ground--the best \nmilitary in the world--is no guarantee of victory. We lost 4,476 \nAmerican lives in Iraq; over 30,000 came home with serious injuries \nthat still need to be cared for to this day. We added $1 trillion to \nour national debt because under the previous administration wars \nweren't paid for, they were just added to the debt. And we have chaos \nin Iraq today.\n  Here is what the President is suggesting, and I think he is on the \nright\n\n[[Page S5752]]\n\ntrack. We are not going to put in ground forces and combat troops. \nInstead, we will rely on the Iraqi Army to fight for the future of \nIraq. We will help them, we will support them with logistics, \nequipment, direction, air support, but they have to be on the frontline \nrisking their lives.\n\n  Secondly, he said we are going to put together a coalition.\n  The United States ought to think twice in this century about how many \nmore Muslim countries we want to be involved in invading, and what the \nPresident has said that is my starting point; we will be part of a \ncoalition that includes Arab and Muslim countries that believe, as we \ndo, that ISIL is reprehensible and needs to be fought back.\n  I think the President's premise is sound. Not putting in combat \ntroops is essential. Putting the burden on the Iraqis is absolutely \ncritical, and I support him in those three efforts.\n  Then comes our vote today. It is not about Iraq; it is about Syria. \nWhat are we going to do in Syria? Syria has just been a free-for-all of \nviolence, terrorism, deceit, and carnage for 3 years. Three million \npeople have been displaced, 300,000 have been killed, and the fighting \nis so intense it is hard to tell who is on what side. Oh, we know Assad \nthe leader has his army, and he is fighting off all the resistance to \nhis government. We have no use for him, but he has some military power, \nobviously. He is still there. We also know that, in addition to ISIL, \nthis terrorist group, there are up to 1,500 other militia groups. They \nhave neighborhood militias protecting families and neighborhoods.\n  What the President has called for is a challenge: Find moderate \nopposition forces who do not align with Assad that are willing to fight \nISIL and stop them in Syria. That is our vote. That is what the title \n10 authorization does. It allows the United States to train and equip \nmoderate opposition in Syria to fight these forces. We have some pretty \nstrict language in here--I just took a look at it again and I have read \nthrough it a couple of times now--about reporting back to committees: \nLet us know your progress.\n  So this is where we are. This continuing resolution will be the law \nof the land, if it passes, until December 11, if I am not mistaken--the \nAppropriations Committee chair, Senator Mikulski, nods in the \naffirmative--until December 11.\n  So what we are doing now is setting up a course of action in Syria to \nwork with the moderate opposition to train and equip them to fight off \nthis ISIL group. We will be back. After the elections we will back. We \nwill be able to measure the progress that has been made.\n  Then, come December 11, we have a much larger question to ask: What \ndo we do from that point forward? Will we continue the strategy? \nAssuming we do, I believe--and many of my colleagues share the belief--\nwe have a special responsibility given to us by the Constitution that \nsays the American people declare war--not the President--and the \nAmerican people do it through Members of Congress.\n  So we will come back and start the debate on what is known as an \nauthorization for the use of military force--a modern version, a new \nversion applying to this situation--and it will be through the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee and the Armed Services Committee.\n  It is a debate that is long overdue. The President has invited us to \ndo this. He believes he has the authority to go forward, but he said to \nCongress: If you want to be part of this, I welcome your participation.\n  Well, let's accept that challenge. So I will be supporting this \ncontinuing resolution. I will be supporting the title 10 authorization \nuntil December 11 to start seeing if we can form a force of moderate \nopposition groups in Syria to fight back on ISIL while we are working \nin Iraq to do the same. I think we have no choice but to do this--but \nto do it thoughtfully, without combat troops, with clear accountability \nand reports, and behind a coalition that has many Arab and Muslim \nnations that agree with us that ISIL is reprehensible.\n  Secretary of State John Kerry told us yesterday they have had \nmeetings with the Russians, with the Chinese, and with the Iranians who \nhave spoken up and said: We have to stop this group. They are going to \ndestroy the Middle East. I think we have to take that seriously, and \nthat is why I will be supporting this effort.\n  I know some of my colleagues disagree. I remember my thinking on that \nOctober night in 2002, that we should hold back and not get involved in \nIraq, and I think I was right. I think history proved me right. That is \nwhy I have looked at this with a critical eye and with the \nunderstanding that this is not the end of the debate, this is not the \nend of the conversation. This is our step forward in ridding the world \nof this savage group that is killing so many innocent people, and we \nare going to do it as part of a coalition and alliance. That to me \nis the thoughtful and sensible way to address this.\n\n  We will have time to review our decision on a regular basis, as we \nshould, to hold this President and any President accountable as we move \nforward. But this is something we absolutely must do as a Nation at \nthis moment in time.\n  So I will be supporting this resolution, H.J. Res. 124, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I also wish to say a word about Secretary Kerry, who has \nbeen working night and day since he left the Senate, as Secretary of \nState, and he testified yesterday. I know what he is trying to achieve. \nI salute him for that and of course the President as well.\n  Let me hope that one thing emerges from this. I remember serving in \nthe House of Representatives, and we voted on the invasion of Kuwait \nunder President George H.W. Bush. I had my questions about that. I \nvoted no. The House voted yes to go forward with that foreign policy. \nThe Speaker of the House, Tom Foley, if I am not mistaken, followed \nthat vote, where we decided to go forward with the invasion of Kuwait, \nwith a resolution saying that now the foreign policy had been decided \nby this country, we should stand together in a bipartisan fashion to \nsupport our men and women in uniform who were engaged in this conflict. \nThat happened, and we all voted for it--even those of us who disagreed \nwith the policy.\n  Even after this vote on Iraq where 23 of us had voted no, virtually \nall of us voted for the resources that our military needed. My thinking \nwas: Durbin, even if you disagree with the Iraqi invasion, what if that \nwere your son over there? Wouldn't you want him to have everything he \nneeds to come home safe? You bet.\n  What I hope will emerge, even after the heat of debate over this \nwhole question of ISIL and how we deal with them, is this coming \ntogether--a bipartisan coming together behind our troops, behind our \npilots, behind those advisers on the ground. Let us show them \nsolidarity behind their effort if we decide to vote to go forward. \nThere is too much partisan division, and it certainly ought to stop at \nthe water's edge when it involves support for our men and women in \nuniform.\n  So at the end of this vote today, I hope we will see emerging a \nbipartisan consensus that we are going to work as a Nation to \naccomplish our goal to end this terrorism as best we can or slow it \ndown in this part of the world and stand behind the men and women of \nour Nation who are willing to risk their lives in service to that \ncause.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           Executive Amnesty\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, in a few moments Senators in this \nChamber will cast one of the most important votes they will ever cast \nin the Senate.\n  With this vote, Senators will make a simple but vital decision. It is \na decision that will steer the future course of our country and our \nCongress--and particularly the Senate.\n  With this vote, Senators will decide whether their allegiance is to \nPresident Obama and his agenda, Majority Leader Reid and the open \nborders lobby, or whether their allegiance is to the American worker, \nthe constitutional order, the American people, and this Nation's \nsovereign laws.\n  The choice could not be more clear. Do we as a Nation have the right \nto control our borders? Do we? That is the question every Senator will \nbe answering today.\n\n[[Page S5753]]\n\n  President Obama has announced to the entire world that he will \nimplement a sweeping unilateral Executive amnesty--only after the \nmidterm elections, not before, as he promised, because there is concern \namong his Members that it wouldn't be politically popular. This amnesty \nby Executive order will give work permits--contrary to law--and Social \nSecurity numbers--contrary to law--to as many as 5 to 6 million people, \nthe White House tells us, to people who are here illegally, illegally \nentered the United States, illegally overstayed their visas or \ndefrauded U.S. immigration authorities.\n\n  With a casual stroke of a pen, the President is preparing to nullify \nthe immigration laws of the United States. He is preparing to wipe away \nthe lawful protections which every American worker in this country is \nentitled to. He is preparing to assume for himself--himself alone--the \nabsolute power to decide who can enter our country, who can work in our \ncountry, who can live in our country by the millions, regardless of \nwhat the law says, what the citizenry says, and what the Constitution \nsays. These immigration rules--who can come, work, and live in the \ncountry--are the bedrock of any Nation's immigration laws and \nsovereignty. The President has already erased much of these rules--\nerased them. And his planned Executive action would remove much of what \nremains of them. It would establish for people all over the world the \nprinciple that if you can get into America, you can stay in America, \nand work in America.\n  Let's consider the current state of immigration enforcement. \nImmigration officers already tell us--people who do this every day--\nthat they have been barred from fulfilling their oaths to follow the \nlaw. They filed a lawsuit claiming they were required to violate their \noath. The president of the ICE officers' council warned: ``ICE \nagents''--Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers--``are now \nprohibited from arresting illegal aliens solely on the charges of \nillegal entry or visa overstay--the two most frequently violated \nsections of immigration law.''\n  The policies of this administration represent an open invitation to \nmillions who enter the United States on visas each year. People come \nlawfully on visas for certain periods of time. It encourages them to \nunlawfully overstay. And why not? If no one is going to deport you, why \nwould you return if you choose not to return to your home country?\n  And what about the border? We know from the substantial influx of \nillegal immigrants from Central America that all you have to do is show \nup at the border, demand entry, and you will likely be released into \nthe United States. You may be asked to return for some sort of hearing \nin the future. But people are not tracked as to where they will go and \nnot one of those people will be looked for if they fail to show up. \nThat is not happening anywhere in the system.\n  Consider this recent report from the Associated Press: ``As of early \nSeptember, only 319 of the more than 59,000 immigrants who were caught \ntraveling with their families have been returned to Central America.'' \nThat means that more than 99 percent of those apprehended with their \nfamilies have so far been allowed to stay. That is in addition to the \ntens of thousands who have entered without their families and who have \nbeen promptly released also into the United States on some sort of bond \nor promise to show up for court, and many adults from Central America \nwho have been released as well.\n  As President Obama's former ICE Director, John Sandweg, explained: \n``If you are a run-of-the-mill immigrant here illegally, your odds of \ngetting deported are near zero.''\n  And who picks up the tab? Local school districts, local police \ndepartments, local taxpayers.\n  No nation can have a policy where people can simply show up at the \nborder and demand to be released into the country, especially since the \npolicy is never to seek to apprehend persons who don't show up so they \ncan be deported. But that is what is happening right now under the \npolicies of this administration. It simply is. The American people need \nto understand that. They need to know more fully how serious this \nsituation is.\n  The American people are beginning to understand that these policies \nrepresent in truth a collapse of immigration enforcement.\n  What about our asylum system? Here is what the House Judiciary \nCommittee reports on asylum, which is when we accept people from around \nthe globe who are subjected to serious oppression.\n\n       Asylum approval rates overall have increased dramatically \n     in recent years. The vast majority of aliens who \n     affirmatively seek asylum are now successful in their claims. \n     At the same time, an internal Department of Homeland Security \n     report shows that at least 70 percent of asylum cases contain \n     proven or possible fraud.\n\n  Seventy percent contain proven or possible fraud. Still they are \nbeing approved overwhelmingly for entry, and once approved for asylum, \nthey are entitled to all social welfare benefits.\n  What about our visa screening process, the people who come on visas? \nHere is what Kenneth Palinkas had to say on that. Mr. Palinkas is the \npresident of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, \nrepresenting 12,000 immigration caseworkers and adjudications officers \nat the USCIS. Here is just a fraction of his dramatic report \ndelineating and detailing the problems they are facing today.\n\n       USCIS adjudications officers are pressured to rubber stamp \n     applications instead of conducting diligent case reviews and \n     investigations. The culture at USCIS encourages all \n     applications to be approved, discouraging proper \n     investigation into red flags and discouraging the denial of \n     any application. USCIS has been turned into an ``approval \n     machine.''\n\n  This is the man who represents the officers doing this everyday, and \nwhat he says is true.\n  He goes on to say in this letter: ``The attitude of USCIS management \nis not that the Agency serves the American public or the laws of the \nUnited States, or public safety and national security, but instead that \nthe Agency serves the illegal aliens and the attorneys which represent \nthem.''\n  Surely this cannot be what is happening in our legal system.\n  He goes on to say this:\n\n       Large swaths of the Immigration and Nationality Act are not \n     effectively enforced for illegal immigrants and visa holders, \n     including laws regarding public charges as well as many other \n     provisions, as USCIS lacks the resources to adequately screen \n     and scrutinize legal immigrants and non-immigrants seeking \n     status adjustment. There is also insufficient screening and \n     monitoring of student visas.\n\n  So the contention that this administration is deporting record \nnumbers of illegal aliens is plainly false. Removals have dropped \ndramatically.\n  Now consider what will happen to our system if the President goes \nthrough with his plan that he has announced after the election to \nprovide unilateral Executive amnesty by Executive order to illegal \nworkers and visa violators here today. What immigration law will be \nleft after that?\n  The government is not enforcing the law with respect to visa \noverstays, illegal entry, illegal work, asylum fraud, document fraud, \nworkplace fraud, and on and on and on. We ignore immigration law for \nyoung people, for older people who came with younger people, for the \nparents of older people who came as younger people, for people with \nrelatives, for people traveling alone, for people traveling with \nfamilies, for people who entered before a certain date, for people who \nentered after a certain date, people who entered through an airport or \nseaport, for people who do show up in court, for people who don't show \nup in court. We have made a million excuses for not enforcing the law.\n  And when millions more enter illegally asking for their amnesty in \nthe future, asking for their amnesty now that others got before them, \nwill the President print work permits for them, too? What moral basis \nwill remain to deny future unlawful immigrants work authorizations, \njobs, and amnesty in the future?\n  I am sure this will make the activists, the politicians and certain \nbillionaire executives who enjoy dinner parties at the White House, \nvery happy that the President is doing these things. But what about \nwhat is good for America? What about what is in the interest of the \nAmerican people? America is not an oligarchy. The masters of the \nuniverse don't get to meet at the White House and decide how to run \nthis country.\n\n[[Page S5754]]\n\n  When the American people learned what was in the Senate amnesty and \nguest worker bill that doubled the number of guest workers for which \nevery single Senate Democrat voted, the people said no, no, no, and the \nHouse stopped the plan. But now the same groups that wrote this bill \nare working with the White House to extract the same benefits by \nExecutive fiat, by Executive order. They had at least 20 secret \nmeetings in July and August alone with the White House to plan this \nstrategy. These measures, we are informed, would include a massive \nexpansion in the admission of new foreign workers, including more \nworkers for information technology giants who are laying off Americans, \nin fact, more than they are hiring. We learned from Rutgers Professor \nHal Salzman that two-thirds of all new IT jobs are now already being \nfilled by foreign guest workers. Can you imagine that? We are turning \nout thousands of IT graduates, but two-thirds of the jobs are being \nfilled by foreign workers, and wages are falling.\n  Americans wish to see record immigration levels--these high lawful \nlevels of immigration that we have--reduced, not increased, by actually \na 3-to-1 margin. But the proposal they are pushing and advocating would \ndouble the number of lawful workers while not dealing effectively with \nthe unlawful flow.\n  Yet Senate Democrats are colluding with the White House to support \nthe surge of these numbers. Studies show wage declines among all wage \nearners since 2009. There is a wage decline among all American workers. \nWages have fallen since 2009, but the declines on a percentage basis \nare the greatest for our lower income workers. The people having the \nhardest time getting by have received the biggest percentage drop. Does \nthis not concern our leaders? Has no one paid any attention to this \nfact?\n  So far our Senate Democratic Caucus has enabled the administration's \nlawless scheme every step of the way. Not one Senate Democrat has \nsupported the House plan that would stop this Executive amnesty.\n  The House-passed legislation would stop it. It is waiting on the \nfloor of the Senate to be called up for a vote. Not one Member of the \nDemocratic leadership has even demanded that Mr. Reid bring it up for a \nvote. Not one has pledged to stay here in Washington every day until \nthis Executive amnesty is stopped.\n  But it is not too late. We are going to have a vote soon.\n  Where is the courage? Where is the independence that Senators should \nshow? Where is the willingness to stand up to the political class, the \nlobbyists, the party bosses, the elite set in the Nation's Capital, and \nto stand by the side of the American people--indeed, to defend the \ninstitutional powers of Congress which alone has the power to make law, \nnot the President. He cannot make law. He cannot give someone the right \nto work in America when the law says they are not able to work if they \nentered the country unlawfully. Until that happens, I have to say that \nevery Senate Democrat is the President's partner in this scheme as \nsurely as if they wrote the Executive orders themselves and as surely \nas if they were sitting right next to the interest groups huddling with \nWhite House aides to craft these orders.\n\n  So I have a message today for all the special interests, the \nglobalist elites, the activists, and the cynical, vote-counting \npolitical plotters who are meeting in secret at the White House, and \nthe message is this: You don't get to sit in a room and rewrite the \nlaws of the United States of America. No, sir. Congress writes the \nlaws. You may not be used to people telling you no, but I am telling \nyou no today.\n  It is critical that our Senate Democrats be willing to say no today \nwhen we vote.\n  I also have a message for the American people: You have been right \nfrom the beginning. You have justly demanded that our borders be \ncontrolled, our laws enforced, and that at long last immigration policy \nserve the needs of our own people first. For this virtuous and \nlegitimate demand, you have been demeaned, even scorned by the \ngoverning class, the cosmopolitan elites. They know so much. They want \nyou to believe that your concerns are somehow illegitimate, that you \nare wrong for being worried about your jobs or your schools or your \nhospitals or your communities or your national security.\n  These elite citizens of the world speak often of their concern about \npeople living in poverty overseas. Yet they turn a blind eye to the \npoverty and suffering in their own country. They don't want you to \nspeak up either. They don't want you to be heard. They don't want you \nto feel you have a voice. But you do have a voice, American people, and \nyour message is being heard. I am delivering that message to the Senate \ntoday.\n  This is a moment of choosing for every Senator. Where will history \nrecord that you stood in the face of the President's promise to \nunlawfully nullify immigration law in America?\n  There will be a motion made soon that will allow the Senate to block \nthe President's planned Executive amnesty. This is simply to pass the \nlegislation the House has already passed. This is a commonsense Senate \naction.\n  If you believe we are a sovereign nation with a right to control our \nborders--and don't we have that right?--then you must vote yes. Let's \nbring it up before this unlawful Executive order for amnesty occurs.\n  If you go along with the idea that America is an oligarchy run by a \ngroup of special interests meeting at the White House to rewrite the \nimmigration laws of America, then vote no.\n  The Nation is watching today. This is an issue of extreme importance \nfor the American people and for the rule of law. Will you at long last \nbreak from your majority leader, Democratic colleagues, or will you \nonce again surrender your vote to Mr. Reid and the groups meeting in \nsecret at the White House to thereby enable their lawless actions?\n  In its almost 2 years of existence--this Congress that has been in \nexistence here going on 2 years now has failed to pass a single \nappropriations bill on time, and now we are facing another CR. Pass \neverything--one vote to fund the entire government and not a single \namendment is being allowed.\n  This Senate has violated the laws that limited spending that we voted \nfor and spent more than allowed. It has blocked amendments to such a \ndegree that the entire heritage of free debate and free rights to amend \nlaws has been violated and damaged substantially in this Senate.\n  If we leave town without having passed a bill to block this Executive \namnesty, then it will be a permanent stain on the Senate, the \nconstitutional order, and this entire Democratic caucus.\n  I know the pressure is to stay hitched and stay in line, but Senate \nDemocrats do have the power to vote differently. Senator Manchin voted \ndifferently last time, and others can also. It is time to stand up and \nbe counted for the working people in this country and enact legislation \nin their interest.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Does the Senator from Texas wish to speak?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I intend to, yes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator from Alabama finished his speech and didn't \nsuggest the absence of a quorum, so I was going to speak. But since the \nSenator from Texas has been waiting, please go ahead and proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, we have a crisis in this country. We have a \ncrisis at our southern border that is producing some 90,000 \nunaccompanied children coming into this country. These kids are being \nvictimized. These kids are being physically and sexually abused by \nviolent coyotes and drug cartels.\n  The American people understand we have a crisis, and the American \npeople want action. The House of Representatives understands we have a \ncrisis. The House of Representatives has acted. Yet I am sorry to say \nthe majority leader and the Democrats in this body refuse to allow any \naction to address this crisis.\n  The crisis at the border is the direct consequence of President \nObama's lawlessness. Just 3 years ago, in 2011, there were roughly \n6,000 unaccompanied kids coming into this country, and then in 2012, a \nfew months before the election, President Obama unilaterally granted \namnesty to some 800,000 people who entered the country illegally as \nchildren. The predicted consequence is that if\n\n[[Page S5755]]\n\nyou grant amnesty to those who enter illegally as children, it creates \nan enormous incentive for more and more children to enter illegally. As \na result, we have seen the numbers go from 6,000 unaccompanied kids 3 \nyears ago to approximately 90,000 this year, and next year, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security predicts, there will be 145,000 little \nboys and little girls illegally smuggled, victimized, and brutalized.\n  This needs to stop. We need leadership in Washington. We need \nleadership in both Houses of Congress. We need leadership from both \nRepublicans and Democrats. Yet not only do President Obama and the \nSenate Democrats refuse to do anything to solve this problem, but, I am \nsorry to say, it is even worse.\n  In recent weeks President Obama told the American people he intends \nto grant even more amnesty. The first illegal amnesty of some 800,000 \npeople was not enough, so in his view we need more. He intends to \nillegally grant amnesty to 5 or 6 million more people. Mark my words: \nThe President of the United States intends to illegally grant amnesty. \nAmnesty is coming. Yet we heard in recent days that the President has \ndecided to delay that action until just after the election.\n  There are a lot of cynical policies in Washington, DC. Yet this has \nto rank very near the top. For the President of the United States to \nsay he understands the American people don't want amnesty, but since \nthere is an election coming up, he intends to pass the policy which \nthey don't want, don't believe in, and which subverts the rule of law \njust after the election so that the Senate Democrats can campaign and \nsay they had nothing to do with it--what does that say about what the \nPresident thinks about the American people? That he thinks they are not \npaying close enough attention to understand that this election is a \nreferendum on amnesty? That he thinks they won't remember by the time \nthe next election happens?\n  Well, here is the bottom line: Amnesty is the wrong approach that \ncreated the crisis. The only way to solve this crisis and protect and \nprevent those little boys and little girls from being physically and \nsexually abused is to end President Obama's amnesty and prospectively \nstop the promise of amnesty that is causing these kids to come here \nillegally.\n  I introduced legislation in the Senate to do exactly that, and the \nHouse of Representatives, to their credit, stood up and led. They \nstayed in session an extra day before the August recess to come \ntogether and pass the legislation I had introduced in the Senate. They \npassed it by a vote of 216 to 192, with 4 Democrats joining the \nRepublicans to stop President Obama's amnesty in order to actually \nsolve the crisis at the border. Yet what happened in the Senate? In the \nSenate the majority leader refused to allow a vote on the provision and \nsent the Senators home for August while doing nothing to address the \nproblem.\n  The reason is simple: Although President Obama and Senate Democrats \nare afraid of the voters holding them accountable for amnesty, it \nshould be lost on nobody watching that what is happening in the Senate \nis that the 55 Senate Democrats serving in this body affirmatively want \namnesty.\n  If only this body would just do its job. If we would simply pass the \nlegislation the House has already passed, prospectively taking amnesty \noff the table--and by the way, this bill does nothing, zero, to the so-\ncalled DREAMers who are already here. It doesn't address that issue. \nThis issue addresses the promise of amnesty in the future. As long as \nthese children believe they will get amnesty, they will keep coming \nhere illegally. They will keep being victimized and abused.\n  Unfortunately, the majority leader has employed a procedural trick \ncalled filling the tree. It is a trick this body is now quite familiar \nwith because it is what the majority leader has done over and over to \nshut down every single amendment from every Member of this body.\n  To be fair, majority leaders in both parties have used this trick in \nthe past. The previous six majority leaders used the procedural trick \nof filling the tree a total of 40 times. The current Democratic \nmajority leader has used it almost 90 times since 2006. The current \nmajority leader has used it more than double what his six previous \npredecessors did. Roughly two-thirds of the time this procedural trick \nhas been employed, it has been by the majority leader of this body.\n  What does that do? What that does is it says legislation in this body \nwill shut down the right of amendments for every Senator. What it says \nto the 26 million Texans is that their views don't matter because \nneither Senator Cornyn nor I will be allowed to offer any amendments. \nIt says to the citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the State \nof Maryland, the States of New York and California: Your views don't \nmatter. Why? Because the majority leader has stripped your Senators of \nthe right to offer any amendment on any topic whatsoever.\n  The majority leader has done that nearly 90 times--including on this \ncontinuing resolution, including on the basic bill that funds the \ngovernment because the Senate has failed to appropriate the funds that \nwe should be doing otherwise.\n  This is wrong. It is fundamentally wrong. The American people deserve \na vote. If Senate Democrats want to embrace amnesty, let them do so \nopenly and in daylight. Stop hiding. People are frustrated with \nWashington because they recognize politicians say one thing here and \none thing at home. How many Senate Democrats, particularly in red \nStates, go home to their States and say amnesty is a terrible thing and \nthen come back here and facilitate the President illegally granting \namnesty. How about we have some honesty. How about we have elected \nMembers of this body say and do the same in Washington that they say \nand do back home. Don't hide. How about we all tell the truth. And the \ntruth is the 55 Senate Democrats want amnesty, but they don't want the \nvoters to know. They are celebrating that President Obama has said: \nFear not, the amnesty is coming, but we will wait until after the \nelection. That cynicism is fundamentally inconsistent with the \nobligation every Member of this body owes to our constituents.\n\n  So I am pleased we will get a vote--despite the majority leader's \nbest efforts--on amnesty, because momentarily this body is going to \nhave the opportunity to vote, and I predict most, if not all, Senate \nDemocrats will vote in favor of President Obama's amnesty.\n  I have a lot higher opinion of the American people, of the voters, \nthan it seems the President does. I think the American people \nunderstand what is going on and I don't think they are going to be \nfooled by the President delaying his illegal amnesty until after the \nelection. So we are going to get a vote on this matter.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3852\n\n  For that reason, I move to table Reid amendment No. 3852 for the \npurposes of offering the Cruz-Sessions amendment No. 3859, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Executive Amnesty\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the solution to this immediate crisis along \nour Nation's border and our longer term immigration needs necessarily \nneed to begin with the President finally enforcing the law--that set of \nlaws already on the books. There is no amount of money Congress can \nspend, there is no new law that could solve this crisis, if the \nPresident and the leadership of his party continue down their lawless \npath.\n  There are several steps the President can take--and he can take those \nsteps immediately--that do not require any action by Congress or \nanother dime from the American people. The most important action he \ncould take would be to stop abusing his ``prosecutorial discretion'' \nand end the DACA Program which provides administrative amnesty and work \npermits to those who have\n\n[[Page S5756]]\n\nentered the United States illegally as minors. He also needs to resist \nthe temptation to further expand DACA to millions of additional adults \nand send a strong message to respond quickly by returning those who \nenter the United States illegally back to their home countries.\n  By announcing to the world that he will not enforce our Nation's laws \nby requiring the Department of Homeland Security to process and return \nthose who have already come here unlawfully, the President of the \nUnited States is encouraging hundreds of thousands of children and \nadults to make a very dangerous journey to the United States illegally. \nHe is encouraging families to pay coyotes controlled by drug cartels \nthousands of dollars to smuggle their children into this country. That \nis truly the humanitarian crisis we now face.\n  This continuing resolution--the continuing resolution now before the \nSenate--provides funds for the DACA Program and any other Executive \namnesty the President may choose to implement illegally.\n  I, along with my friends and colleagues from Alabama and from Texas, \nwish to offer an amendment prohibiting funding to process prospective \napplications, but the majority has objected, so we will attempt to \ntable the Reid amendment in order to allow that vote.\n  The President's threat to widen the scope of DACA is only going to \nmake matters worse--matters in this pronounced humanitarian crisis we \nare facing along our border--which is why I agree with my friends, \nSenators Sessions and Cruz, that, at the very least, we must take steps \nto prevent the President from providing any more executive amnesty.\n\n\n                                  ISIS\n\n  Now I wish to speak about some other issues related to the continuing \nresolution and, in so doing, I wish to point out that one of the most \nimportant and solemn duties we have as Members of the Senate is to \nauthorize the use of military force and ask the brave men and women in \nour armed services to put their lives in harm's way. It is, I believe, \na gross dereliction of that duty, and an insult to those same men and \nwomen, to tack on a military authorization to this must-pass spending \nbill just so Members of Congress can hurry back to their home States. \nIf the United States is going to escalate our involvement in a brutal \nconflict overseas, if we are going to send American troops to harm and \ntrain Syrian rebels for their fight against ISIS, we need to debate \nthat decision on its own merits and not take this up simply as a \ncondition of providing ongoing funding for the Federal Government as a \nwhole. That is the only way for this issue to receive the kind of \ncareful attention and robust debate it truly deserves. We owe it to our \nmen and women in uniform to separate any military authorization from \nthis must-pass spending bill to keep the government funded. If that \nmeans we do not get home early, so be it. The lives of our troops, the \nlives of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, and those who \nsupport them, and the security of the United States are simply far too \nimportant.\n  I believe, as does the President of the United States, that ISIS is a \nthreat to the Middle East and will take any opportunity it gets to kill \nAmericans. Many of its fighters carry European and even American \npassports which will offer them easier access to the United States. \nTracking and stopping these foreign fighters must be a high priority \nfor the President and for the Congress, and our allies must work to \nstop the flow of these fighters into and out of the conflict zone half \na world away. We must attack their finances, their abilities to \ncommunicate and coordinate and access weapons and supplies. The United \nStates can and should act to protect ourselves from this threat.\n  There is a clearly defined constitutional process for doing that--a \nprocess which involves the participation of the President as the \nCommander in Chief and Members of Congress as representatives of the \nAmerican people invested with the power to declare war. But are we \nfollowing that clearly defined process? Are we adhering to this prudent \nset of procedures we are supposed to follow under our now 227-year-old \ngoverning document? No. Instead, we are openly flouting it. Instead, we \nare considering an authorization of military force almost as an \nafterthought. We are doing so by attaching it to a continuing \nresolution which itself reduces, in a very shameless and disgraceful \nway, Congress's spending authority to another afterthought. Why? Well, \nbecause, as far as I can tell, some in Congress want to go home early. \nThey are so anxious to get to their next recess, to get back to their \nhome State, that they are willing to give inadequate attention to this \nvery serious problem that affects every American, that has implications \nnot only for national security but for the security of 300 million \nAmericans. It has especially grave implications for the brave men and \nwomen who wear our uniforms, whose lives would be on the line as a \nresult of decisions made in connection with this effort.\n  This is shameful and it is unconscionable. It is an insult to the men \nand women we serve, and it is an insult to the men and women who wear \nuniforms and serve us well.\n  We should strike this section to arm and train Syrian rebels from the \ncontinuing resolution and instead have full debate and a separate vote \non authorizing the President's strategy to address the ISIS threat. \nForcing an authorization for our military to act in any manner through \na continuing resolution up against a government shutdown does not meet \nthe standards for this process and it does not afford the American \npeople, many of whom are servicemembers, a voice regarding our Nation's \nmost important affairs. We have ample reason to take the needed time to \nconsider this decision on its own merits and not on the merits of a \ncontinuing resolution to keep the government funded.\n  The idea of arming Syrian rebels has drawn serious concern from \nMembers of the Senate on both sides of the aisle but, so far, only \nMembers from certain key committees have been able to debate and \ndiscuss openly and in an official Senate forum the specifics of the \nPresident's plan. And even those of us who sit on those committees are \nstill in need of much more information. I have had concerns for the \npast year as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee with the \nproposed tactic of arming the Syrian rebels after hearing testimony \nfrom our own intelligence and defense leaders that what we refer to as \nthe ``moderate rebels'' are, in fact, fragmented and decentralized. \nTheir memberships are fluid and often lacking in common goals, \nleadership, and levels of moderation.\n\n  This is borne out in press reports from the region almost weekly. In \nfact, a few months ago I asked General Austin, the commander of \nCENTCOM, if the United States would guarantee that the assistance we \nare supplying to moderates in Syria--the then-nonlethal aid--is not \nbeing used by or to the benefit of extremist groups that want to attack \nthe United States.\n  His answer was:\n\n       No, we cannot guarantee the assistance we provide doesn't \n     fall into the wrong hands. Undoubtedly, some weapons and \n     funds flowing into Syria wind up in the hands of extremists . \n     . . . The extremists work closely with all factions of the \n     opposition and is often aware of the logistics and \n     humanitarian shipments into Syria. At times, they even \n     acquire and disseminate these shipments to the local \n     populace. This, in turn, benefits in the propaganda war.\n\n  That is probably why hardly a month ago--just a little over a month \nago--President Obama called the idea of arming Syrian rebels a \n``fantasy''--a fantasy that was, as he put it, ``never in the cards.'' \nNow he is seeking authorization for it. In less than a month, what was \nonce a fantasy is now apparently the strategy. What was never in the \ncards is now not only in the cards but is a card that he is actually \nplaying--and doing so as an afterthought, thrown on to a must-pass bill \nwith an entirely different purpose and function.\n  On Tuesday in the Armed Services Committee hearing, when I asked \nSecretary Hagel why the President changed his mind on arming and \ntraining Syrian rebels, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel could not provide \nan explanation. This is troubling, to say the least. If there has been \nsome change over the last month in national security threats or the \ncapabilities and composition of a Syrian opposition group, why has the \nPresident not shared this with our Secretary of Defense? Or if there \nhasn't been a change,\n\n[[Page S5757]]\n\nthen is there some reason other than American national security that \nmay have caused the President to reverse course. The American people \ndeserve answers to these and other related questions.\n  Another important issue that deserves full and open debate is that \nthis is about more than just arming rebels to fight terrorists. It \nbecame clear through answers from administration officials in our \nSenate Armed Services hearing Tuesday that the Administration believes \nthat a new government and political structure in Syria is needed for \nthese rebel groups to be successful.\n  No one doubts that President Assad is a tyrant, one who has exacted \nterrible measures on his very own citizens, but our constituents need \nto understand--I want to be very clear here--that the idea of arming \nSyrian rebels to fight ISIS and Assad, while also standing up and \nsupporting a new government in Syria, is more like a long-term nation-\nbuilding mission than a counterterrorism mission.\n  The administration has not been clear on this point. If we are indeed \ntaking steps towards a nation-building exercise in Syria, we must also \ndebate both the financial and the tremendous human costs of such an \nendeavor.\n  The ISIS threat to the United States is serious. Our response should \nbe given equally serious consideration here in the Senate. When my \ncolleague on the Armed Services Committee, Senator Fischer from \nNebraska, mentioned how important she thought it was that this \nauthorization be separate from the CR, Secretary Hagel stated that he \nagreed that it should have a ``more thorough airing with the American \npeople,'' but that it couldn't receive such an airing because Congress \nwas rushing home for a recess. This is not good enough for the Senate.\n  This is not good enough for the United States or for the American \npeople. It is shameful. Our constituents expect us to do our jobs. If \nthat means staying here a few more weeks, so be it. If that means \nstaying here for a month or two months--however long it takes--then so \nbe it.\n  If this plan is the right one, fine; if we need to adjust it or \nreject it, fine; but there is no such thing as a must-pass vote of \nconscience--not here, not on this topic. The American people deserve to \nhave a debate about how and why we are sending their sons and daughters \ninto danger. We should not set this precedent of sending Americans into \nharm's way as an afterthought, on our way out of town, like some kind \nof political out-of-office reply email. Congress used to be better than \nthis, and I submit the American people still are.\n  I respectfully and strongly urge my colleagues to pull this section \nfrom the CR and have a full debate to give authorization for the \nPresident's actions in the Middle East. To this end, I am proposing we \nremove this language from the continuing resolution so that it may be \nconsidered separately and adequately.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Accordingly, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder for me to offer my amendment No. 3845.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI: I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I have heard a good part of the afternoon: Why can't we \nstay and debate this, and so on? I don't minimize the seriousness of \nthe issues, whether they are about arming Syrian rebels, the potential \nfor new kinds of military action, certainly the ongoing saga in Ukraine \nor also what is going on in our own country. Students are not being \nable to afford college, families are not being able to afford to buy a \nhome, and work is not worth it because wages are frozen. We are pushing \npeople to a standard of living less than what they had.\n  The people of the middle class are fighting hand-to-hand to stay \nmiddle class. Those who might want to get there are seeing the \nopportunity ladder sawed down. When we wanted to bring bills to the \nfloor in a regular order and bring up regular appropriations that had \nboth money and policy where people could have debated them in an \norderly way, we had cluster bombs of parliamentary procedure thrown on \nwhere people hid behind votes on motions to proceed.\n  Some of the biggest critics today saying, why don't we stay here and \ndebate, have been some of the biggest obstacles in insisting on \nbringing bills up in regular order. So here we are today in the closing \nhours of the CR. We have had much enlightened conversation that was \nactually to hear leaders talk about this and differences of opinions in \nthe most civil way, with intellectual rigor and firmness of conviction.\n  That is what we should be doing. I would like to do more of it. This \nis why we need to reform ourselves. We like to talk a lot about \nreforming the country, changing Barack Obama, but we need to reform \nourselves. We need to stop hiding behind cloture votes and motions to \nproceed, where you need 60 votes to just barely come up and salute the \nflag. So I am not going to go into this today, but I think we need to \ngo into this. We need to take a look at ourselves and examine \nourselves--how we can keep the traditions the same, protect the rights \nof the minority. But when all is said and done, the American people are \nfed up that more gets said than done and more gets said about saying \nthings, and so on.\n  I am telling you, as I travel in Maryland, my constituents feel \nWashington means less and less relevance to them. They are also \nwondering: What is it that you do to get things done? They are asking \nthese questions. You know what, they ought to ask these questions.\n  I am not going to take up the time. I know that other colleagues are \ncoming to speak on the floor.\n  This whole thing about we have to stay and we have to do it--we have \nto do our business during the whole year. We can't do it in the last 3 \nhours, coming up on the crunch of the end of the fiscal year. All year \nlong we have an opportunity to debate. All year long we have the \nopportunity to debate issues in our committee process and on the floor. \nI feel pretty strongly about this.\n  I hope that others who feel strongly, too, join a reform effort so we \ncan honor the traditions of the Senate and protect the rights of the \nminority. But, hey, let's get back to the majority rules, regular \norder, and a debate that occurs all year long on issues and not just in \na crisis environment.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Executive Calendar \nconsent agreed to Wednesday, September 17, 2014, be modified to include \nExecutive Calendar No. 925 following 1031, with all other provisions of \nthe previous order remaining in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nomination considered and confirmed is as follows:\n\n\n           UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT\n\n       Alfonso E. Lenhardt, of New York, to be Deputy \n     Administrator of the United States Agency for International \n     Development.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI: Mr. President, what that means is that we have now \nconfirmed Alfonso E. Lenhardt to be the Deputy Administrator of USAID.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I come first to support the \ndistinguished chair of the Appropriations Committee in her endeavor to \npass a continuing resolution. I, specifically, want to speak to support \nthe President's request for authorization to stand up a title 10 overt, \ntrain and equip mission for vetted moderate Syrian opposition. The \nhearing I held yesterday in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee laid \nout specifics of how the President is moving forward in building the \nanti-ISIL coalition.\n  We will undertake targeted airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq and Syria. \nWe will train and equip a Syrian opposition force committed to a \npluralistic, free Syria.\n  This is a multifaceted plan, and we heard both from Secretary Kerry \nand a second panel of regional experts that coalition partners are \nready to contribute in real terms and not just empty words.\n  The ISIL threat is grave and it is urgent. We must stand with our \npartners in the region to confront this barbarism in the interests of \nall of the individuals being brutalized by ISIL but also because \nregional stability and U.S. Security demand it.\n\n[[Page S5758]]\n\n  Training and equipping a fighting Syrian force is one urgent element \nin the broader plan.\n  We in the Senate must provide this authority, as our colleagues in \nthe House did yesterday. In Iraq we have the Iraqi security forces and \nKurdish Peshmerga forces committed to combating ISIL and partnering \nwith us to do so. At this point in time we do not have such a force to \npartner with inside of Syria.\n  Let's be clear-eyed about what this challenge is. It is messy and \ncomplicated and not at all easy. There is no silver bullet. But without \na trained, equipped, and capable moderate opposition force to fill the \nvoid, as we conduct airstrikes against ISIL, we would essentially be \nopening the door to Assad and his Russian- and Iranian-backed regime \nforces to regain lost territory.\n  Imagine how our adversaries will celebrate if we fail to build a \nforce that is equipped, trained, and committed to defeating the \nbarbarism of ISIL and Assad.\n  The administration was posed with the question yesterday: Why now? \nWhy train these forces now, 4 years into this civil war?\n  There are several answers:\n  First, we have been working with these moderate armed groups for over \n2 years now. We know them.\n  Second, there is no real alternative to building a local opposition \nforce to take the fight on in Syria unless you are talking about \nAmerican boots on the ground. That is not in play here.\n  Third, the region is standing with us in training and creating the \nability to assist these Syrian rebels. It is truly a remarkable \ndevelopment that Saudi Arabia, for example, is willing to publicly \ndiscuss its support and publicly disclose that it will host and \ncontribute to our train-and-equip mission. Other gulf countries are \nwilling to fund this mission and help with recruiting efforts. No \nlonger are our partners willing to quietly support from the shadows. \nThey view the threat coming from Iraq and Syria with ISIL with such \nurgency that they are going public loudly and assertively.\n  I am clear-eyed about the enormity of the challenge. There is risk. \nBut at this point, given the rapidity of ISIL's advance and the \nsavagery of its actions, we must be willing to take some risk to \ndegrade this brutal, barbaric organization. The fact is that Sunni \nneighbors across the region are lining up to join this mission.\n  The moderate Syrian forces we will train can pressure ISIL in Syria, \nthe Iraqis from Iraq, and we pressure ISIL from the air. The question \nis, Why now? The response to the question is this: Yesterday I held--as \nthe Presiding Officer knows, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \npassed legislation last year to increase lethal assistance to the \nmoderate rebels battling Assad in a bipartisan way. We do not get do-\novers, so we cannot change what was not done. We cannot change what has \nalready happened. But we can change what exists on the ground in Syria \ntoday. We can influence what happens going forward and work together to \nset conditions for how it ends.\n  Yesterday Robert Ford--our exceptional former U.S. Ambassador to \nSyria, probably our greatest expert on Syria and the rebels \nparticularly, and until recently our senior State Department official \nworking with the moderate opposition--could not have had more \ncompelling testimony. In response to questions I posed to him about \nwhether a moderate armed opposition still exists for us to train and \narm, he said: Yes, they exist. Yes, they are already fighting ISIL. \nYes, they share our view that a radical, extremist Islamic State should \nnot be imposed on Syria. That conflict will only end with a political \ndeal or negotiated settlement.\n  In response to questions about whether there is recruitment \npotential, whether we can find enough fighters who are moderate who \nwill pass our vetting standards to receive our training, he said: Yes. \nWe know them. We have provided them with nonlethal assistance, which \nthey have used responsibly.\n  By the way, he described them as being pretty resilient in the face \nof being outgunned, that they are still engaged and fighting for their \nown future.\n  He also said: We have talked politics with them, meaning \nunderstanding where their mindset is as it relates to the future.\n  In fact, Mr. Ford said that the problem has always been that there \nwere more willing fighters than there were guns and ammunition.\n  In response to whether the moderate armed Syrian opposition shares \nour goal of degrading ISIL, the answer was also affirmatively yes.\n  The force we train and arm will fight ISIL because ISIL is \nthreatening their supply lines and has butchered hundreds of members of \nthe moderate Syrian opposition. In Syria, the moderate opposition has \nbeen mired in a two-front war--one against ISIL and the other against \nAssad and his regime backers--for years. The language in the amendment \nto the CR reflects this reality. We are training and arming a force \nthat will defend the Syrian people from ISIL attacks and also promote \nconditions for a negotiated settlement to end the conflict in Syria--in \nother words, going after Assad's security forces.\n  Finally, Ambassador Ford lamented that if we do not go forward with \nthis proposal to train and equip the moderate armed opposition, Assad \nwill likely become even more convinced that his strategy all along has \nworked. His strategy is to convince the world that he is the only \nviable alternative to ISIL and radical extremists and that we will \neventually resolve ourselves to working with him.\n  Let me conclude by saying that the only course of action at this \npoint in time is for us to commit to the grinding work of building a \nviable alternative, which is the moderate armed Syrian opposition.\n\n  Again, this is not going to happen overnight, but it certainly will \nnot happen if there is not a moderate, capable alternative to Assad, a \ngroup that is neither radical nor has the barbarism of ISIL, nor the \nnihilistic, barrel bomb-dropping of Assad.\n  We must be realistic if we are going to degrade and destroy ISIL. \nFrankly, I still have many questions about the way forward beyond this \nissue. I intend to work with the administration to ensure that the plan \nis sound and the strategy is effective. We will continue to vet that \nthrough a series of both hearings and intelligence briefings. But I \nhave no question that this particular action is needed now.\n  I fully intend for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to explore, \nvet, and ultimately craft what a possible authorization for use of \nmilitary force should look like. In that regard, we need to get it \nright, not just do it fast. I do not want an AUMF that ultimately--as \nof September 2001--finds us 13 years later in a host of different \ncountries that were never envisioned as being the authorization for it, \nto send the sons and daughters of America without the authorization of \nthe Congress.\n  We will work on all of that in a determined, studious, and detailed \nway to make sure that we understand the strategy and all of its \ndimensions, that we can provide for that, and at the end of the day \nthat we can defeat ISIL, but without an open-ended check.\n  With that, I urge support for the CR.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to express my disappointment about a \nmatter of great importance to Wyoming and many other Western States. \nThe continuing resolution before us does not include critical funding \nthat nearly 1,900 counties in 49 States rely on.\n  Local governments are responsible for providing fire protection, law \nenforcement, sanitation, public health, and education, to our \nconstituents. They provide these services largely by raising local \nrevenue, including property taxes. In States where there is little \nfederally owned land, local communities have a large number of private \nhomeowners to help provide these services. But in States such as my \nhome State of Wyoming, the Federal Government owns much of the land. \nThe problem is that these Federal lands cannot be taxed. The Payment in \nLieu of Taxes program, or PILT, has been in place for decades and is, \nessentially, the Federal Government's property taxes.\n  Last year's omnibus appropriations package did not fund PILT. \nInstead, the Farm bill provided 1 year of PILT funding. And since \nCongress has not\n\n[[Page S5759]]\n\npassed appropriations bills through regular order this year but is \nleaving fiscal year 2014 funding on autopilot, PILT isn't addressed in \nthe legislation we are considering today. Yet local governments must \nstill provide critical fire, law enforcement, and health services in \nthese areas and for the people who work on them. What are we supposed \nto tell our communities that rely on this money for 40 to 80 percent of \ntheir budgets?\n  This body cannot fail to address this issue this year. To do so would \nbreak a promise we have made and would force communities to reduce or \neven eliminate the vital resources upon which their citizens rely. But \nwe should not just address the issue for this year. We need to stop \nplaying games with PILT and find a way to ensure it is adequately and \nfairly funded for years to come in a way that does not rob Peter to pay \nPaul.\n  Yes, the Federal Government is out of money. We are going to have to \nprioritize. But I would submit that PILT needs to be one of those \npriorities. PILT represents a promise the Federal Government made to \ncounties and local governments all across the Nation, and they are \nlooking to us to see how we will keep that promise. If we fail to do \nso, it will have an impact on almost every one of our States.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express \nsupport for the continuing resolution which funds the government \nthrough December 11.\n  One provision in the bill I would like to focus on relates to our \nfight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL.\n  I believe there is an urgent need to confront this terrorist group, \nand Congress can help this effort by supporting President Obama's plan \nand voting for the continuing resolution.\n  The CR includes a provision to provide the Defense Department with \nthe authority for the U.S. Armed Forces to train and equip an \nopposition force capable of confronting ISIL.\n  I believe we must come together in large numbers--Democrats and \nRepublicans--to pass this provision as quickly as possible. A strong \nbipartisan majority would give the Obama administration and the \nAmerican people a strong sense of unity and purpose as we all grapple \nwith the threat of ISIL. We must give the President the tools he needs \nto succeed. Providing the Defense Department with this authority is \njust one part of the comprehensive strategy, but it is an important \none.\n  The President has said he has the legal authority to conduct \nairstrikes in Iraq and Syria and has laid out his strategy. After the \nelection there will be ample time to debate the strategy further and \npotentially vote on a new authorization of military force, but in the \nshort-term we must pass this authorization--at this time the only \nauthority the administration has asked Congress to approve. If ever \nthere were a time to unite behind President Obama, that time is now.\n  ISIL is like no other terrorist organization we have seen. It has \nbecome a ruthless terrorist army that occupies territory and controls \ncivilian populations through fear, intimidation, and brutality.\n  It controls large swaths of land in two nations. In Syria it controls \nnearly one-third of the country, and in Iraq it effectively controls as \nmany as 14 cities.\n  According to a recent CIA estimate, ISIL may have as many as 30,000 \nfighters--and separately there may be up to 25,000 Sunni tribesmen who \nhave associated themselves with ISIL forces.\n  ISIL has looted heavy weaponry--including artillery, tanks and \narmored vehicles--from the battlefield. Much of that equipment is now \nbeing used against innocent civilians and our partners on the ground. \nISIL has killed tens of thousands of people. They kill with abandon, \nincluding the brutal massacre of hundreds of Iraqi and Syrian soldiers, \nstripped, bound and buried in shallow graves. ISIL is also well-funded \nthrough criminality, ransom payments, extortion and the sale of oil. \nIts control of territory and resources is topped only by its level of \nbrutality.\n  Over the past few weeks, I have personally reviewed photos, videos \nand personal stories of ISIL's countless victims. I have seen the \nbeheading of American and British hostages and pictures of the \ncrucifixion of many innocent civilians, including a girl as young as 6 \nyears of age. I have seen photos of heads staked on fence posts and \nfilms of the mass-execution of Iraqi and Syrian army units. In one gory \nreport, after ISIL took control of two oilfields in eastern Syria from \nthe al-Sheitaat tribe, they summarily executed 700 tribesmen. I have \nread stories of women bound to trees and forced to be sexual prizes for \nISIL fighters who performed well in battle. There are reports that \nthousands of Yazidi women have been taken as slaves and I have read the \ntestimonials of the few who were lucky enough to escape. They describe \nbeing confined, eating only once a day, being given away as wives, \nraped and abused at the hands of ISIL fighters. I have seen devastating \nfootage of Yazidis and Christians literally running for their lives \nfrom approaching ISIL forces, faced with the choice of converting to \nIslam or death. When one Yazidi girl was surrounded by ISIL fighters, \nshe said, ``I've never felt so helpless in my 14 years. They had \nblocked our path to safety, and there was nothing we could do.''\n  The lack of humanity is shocking and despicable. It is pure evil and \nit should haunt the world. And while ISIL is now limited to Syria and \nIraq, it has made clear its intentions are to bring the fight to the \nUnited States and our allies.\n  In Iraq, a major concern of mine is that their next attack will be \nour Embassy in Baghdad. I have no doubt that ISIL leaders also intend \nto hit us here in our homeland.\n  In July 2012, ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi said: ``The mujahidin \nhave also sworn they will make you suffer more pain than that caused by \nUsama [bin Laden]. You will see them in your own country, God \nwilling.''\n  In January of this year, during his radio address, Baghdadi added: \n``Our last message is to the Americans. Soon we'll be in direct \nconfrontation, and the sons of Islam have prepared for such a day. So \nwatch out for us, for we are with you, watching.''\n  Finally, in a video posted on August 19, 2014, the executioner of \nJames Foley stated: ``So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the Muslims \ntheir rights of living in safety under the Islamic Caliphate will \nresult in the bloodshed of your people.''\n  We have no specific information that ISIL is planning an attack \nagainst the United States, but we also had no clear understanding of \nal-Qaeda's specific plotting in the days before 9/11 an attack that \nwould claim nearly 3,000 American lives.\n  ISIL's territorial control, resources, brutality and intention to \nbroaden their attacks make it clear that we must act. I support the \nPresident's actions to confront and ultimately destroy ISIL.\n  As he has said, we will expand airstrikes against ISIL targets, \nincluding in Syria; maintain a united international coalition--with \nArab countries--that will contribute to the fight in meaningful ways; \nencourage continued political reconciliation in Baghdad to diminish \nISIL's support from Sunni tribes; halt the flow of foreign fighters and \nresources to ISIL; and provide weapons to the Kurdish peshmerga, Iraqi \nsecurity forces and moderate forces inside Syria.\n  Action is currently underway in many of those areas. Air strikes have \nhelped defend key infrastructure such as the Mosul Dam and protected \ncivilians in Amirli and Mt. Sinjar. More recently, the President has \nexpanded the air campaign by going on the offensive and attacking ISIL \non the outskirts of Baghdad.\n  Secretaries Kerry and Hagel have been building a coalition with \ninternational partners, including much of Europe and at least 10 Arab \nnations. New Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is in the process of \nfinalizing the Cabinet and has made sincere efforts to bridge the \nsectarian divide. These are all steps in the right direction. Today, \nthe necessary action before us is to pass this CR, which provides \nlimited authority to train and equip a military force to fight ISIL on \nthe ground. The President has ruled out putting U.S. ground forces in \ncombat roles for now, so we must have partners that can take the fight \nto ISIL. Without such a force, ISIL will continue to enjoy a safe haven \nin eastern Syria and once ISIL is pushed out of territory, the Assad \nregime or other extremists could fill the vacuum.\n\n[[Page S5760]]\n\n  Bolstering this fighting force is critical to our goal of degrading \nand destroying ISIL. While it is just one part of the President's plan, \nit will work in conjunction with our ongoing diplomatic, intelligence, \nmilitary and economic efforts.\n  The continuing resolution includes the authority the Defense \nDepartment needs to begin training such a force. The provision also \nrequires the administration to produce a plan to explain how arming the \nmoderate opposition fits within the President's larger regional \nstrategy to defeat ISIL. It also requires regular reports to Congress \nto keep us informed of the training activities.\n  We already know Saudi Arabia is prepared to host a training program, \nand I suspect other Arab states will help fund it. But without this \nauthority in this CR, U.S. troops and trainers will not be able to \nparticipate in this essential program.\n  Regardless of whether we waited too long to confront ISIL, we now \nhave a strategy that we need to support to turn the tide. U.S. \nairstrikes in Iraq have protected our people and prevented a \nhumanitarian catastrophe. As we now take the fight directly to ISIL, \nCongress needs to give the President the tools he needs to ramp up the \nbattle.\n  This is a matter of national security and I hope members of both \nparties will come together to support the President's request.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is about to vote on a continuing \nresolution to fund the Federal Government from October 1 to December \n11. This vote should not be necessary. There is no good reason why we \nare not voting on fiscal year 2015 appropriations bills to fund the \ngovernment the way we used to rather than a continuing resolution that \nkeeps the government on autopilot despite many new and compelling \nneeds.\n  Chairwoman Mikulski of the Appropriations Committee and her \ncounterpart in the House, Chairman Rogers, have made this argument as \nwell as any two people could. It is unacceptable that the Congress, \nwhich has the power of the purse, fails to use that power in a \nresponsible manner. Passing annual appropriations bills should be a \npriority for both parties, and I hope that between now and when this \nshort-term CR expires, we can do our job and finish work on those bills \nwhich were reported by the Appropriations Committee months ago--and \nsend them to the President.\n  Nine months ago, when the fiscal year 2014 omnibus was enacted, no \none anticipated the Ebola epidemic which has infected thousands of \npeople and today threatens all of Africa, thus, there is little funding \navailable to combat it. The Defense Department, USAID, CDC, and others \nare scrambling to reprogram funds from other important programs.\n  Nine months ago, no one envisioned the surge in young migrants from \nCentral America, and so the Departments of State, Homeland Security, \nJustice, Health and Human Services, and the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development are reprogramming funds. But it is not nearly \nenough to address the horrific gang violence and endemic poverty in \nthose countries that are contributing to the flood of refugees across \nour border.\n  Nine months ago, did anyone here predict that ISIS would be routing \nunits of the Iraqi army, beheading Americans, and seizing control of \nterritory? Did anyone foresee Russia's intervention in Ukraine? Did \nanyone foresee that we would be sending U.S. military advisors to \nNigeria to help track down hundreds of school girls kidnapped by Boko \nHaram? There is no money in the budget for any of this, so we are \nrobbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  Fiscal Year 2015 appropriations bills have been reported out of \ncommittee with strong bipartisan support. Let's debate them. Senators \ncan offer amendments. We can vote. That is what we should be doing \ninstead of kicking the ball down the road for another 2\\1/2\\ months.\n  Obviously, we all recognize the need to keep the Federal Government \noperating. As much as I disagree with this approach, I would vote for \nthe continuing resolution to avoid a government shutdown. But this vote \ndoes far more than that. It authorizes the President under title 10 of \nthe U.S. Code to provide training and weapons to Syrian rebel forces. \nIn other words, we are authorizing U.S. military intervention in \nSyria's civil war which for the past 2 years the administration has \nstrongly advised against and doing so by tacking that authority onto a \nshort-term spending bill to keep the government operating.\n  As much as I believe the United States should support the fight \nagainst ISIS and as much as I commend the President and Secretary Kerry \nfor their efforts to build a coalition to that end, I am not convinced \nthat the President's plan to intervene in Syria can succeed. There are \ntoo many unanswered questions about the composition, intentions, \nallegiances, and capabilities of the so-called ``moderate'' Syrian \nrebels who, like the Iraqi militias that openly admit to atrocities, \nare accountable to no one.\n  There is too little clarity about the White House's intentions, \nparticularly when there is talk of unilateral air attacks against ISIS \nby U.S. forces inside Syrian territory. There has been too little \ndiscussion of the potential consequences of this strategy for the \nbrutal Assad regime which also opposes ISIS, for the anti-ISIS \ncoalition, or for Iran's or Russia's ability to expand their influence \nin that region.\n  We have been assured that recipients of U.S. military equipment are \nvetted and that the use of the equipment is monitored. Yet we have seen \nU.S. military vehicles and weapons worth millions of dollars in the \nhands of ISIS and other anti-American groups in Iraq and Libya. Who can \nsay who else has gotten their hands on them, or that the weapons we \nprovide the Syrian rebels will not be used against innocent civilians \nor end up in the hands of our enemies?\n  The House resolution we are voting on addresses this issue narrowly, \nrequiring vetting only as it relates to association with terrorists or \nIran. It says nothing about vetting for gross violations of human \nrights, as would be required for assistance for foreign security forces \nunder the Leahy Amendment.\n  The administration says we need to defeat ISIS. I don't disagree. \nISIS is a barbaric enterprise that has no respect for human life and \nposes a grave threat to anyone it encounters, including Americans. Yet \nthat is what the previous White House said about Al Qaeda. A dozen \nyears and hundreds of billions of dollars and many American lives \nlater, Al Qaeda is a shadow of what it once was but is far from \ndefeated.\n  Since 9/11, numerous offshoots of Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups \nhave proliferated not only in South Asia but throughout the Middle East \nand into east and north Africa. And one of those groups, formerly \naffiliated with Al Qaeda, is ISIS. Some say ISIS is worse than Al \nQaeda. If ISIS is defeated, who comes next?\n  Not long ago the President said the sweeping 2001 authorization for \nthe use of military force against those responsible for the 9/11 \nattacks should be repealed. Yet the White House recently cited it as a \nbasis for attacking ISIS. Alternatively, the White House says the \nPresident has the authority he needs under the 2002 authorization for \nthe use of military force to defeat Saddam Hussein. No objective \nreading of those resolutions supports that conclusion. Yet here we are \nabout to embark on another open ended war against terrorism, albeit, \nthankfully, without U.S. ground troops.\n  We can help combat ISIS, and we must, but the Governments of Iraq, \nSaudi Arabia, and others in that region--some of which have vast \nwealth--need to show they share that goal at least as much as we do, \nnot just by their statements but by their actions.\n  They should take the lead. We can support them, although Saudi \nArabia, besides being a major oil supplier, has one of the world's most \nrepressive governments and Saudi charities have been a steady source of \nrevenue for extremist groups. One has to wonder whether such alliances \nhelp or hurt us in the long run.\n  I have thought hard about this. It is far from black and white. I \ndeeply respect the President. In the end, he may be right. But I worry \nabout the slippery slope we may be starting down in the thick of a \nsectarian civil war. I am not prepared--on a stop-gap, short-term \nspending bill containing authority drafted by the House of \nRepresentatives, in the waning hours of the day of\n\n[[Page S5761]]\n\nadjournment, and with no opportunity for amendments--to endorse a \npolicy that will involve spending hundreds of millions and almost \ncertainly billions of dollars over multiple years to train and arm \nSyrian fighters who may or may not share our goals or values, not in a \npart of the world where past U.S. military interventions with similarly \nvague goals involving similarly questionable allies have consistently \nturned out very differently from the Pollyannaish predictions of former \nPentagon and White House officials. Time and again we have been assured \nof relatively quick and easy success, only to pay dearly over the \ncourse of protracted, costly wars that fell far short of their lofty \ngoals and unleashed forces of hatred that no one predicted.\n  Year after year, the administration asked Congress for billions of \ndollars to support former Iraqi President Malaki's government. Yet the \nWhite House now concedes that his sectarian policies and the widely \nreported abuses of the Iraqi army that the U.S. trained and equipped \nwere a cause of the resentment and divisions that contributed to the \nrise of ISIS and threaten to break Iraq apart.\n  The Iraq war was a disaster for this country. The families of \nAmericans who gave their lives or were grievously injured will suffer \nthe consequences for many years to come. It caused lasting damage to \nour national reputation and to the image and readiness of our armed \nforces. Yet I worry that other than trying to avoid another costly \ndeployment of U.S. ground troops, we have learned little from that \nfiasco. The Middle East is no place to intervene militarily without a \nthorough understanding of the history and the centuries-old tribal, \nreligious, and ethnic rivalries that have far more relevance than \nanything we might think we can achieve.\n  Does that mean there is no role for the United States in that part of \nthe world? Of course not. But rather than set goals that may or may not \nbe realistic but will almost certainly have profound and potentially \ndangerous unintended and unanticipated consequences, let's have a real \ndebate that thoroughly considers all the options, all the costs, all \nthe pros and cons. This is far too important a decision to be dealt \nwith in such a cursory manner.\n  So I will vote no, with the hope that in November or December we will \nrevisit this issue and have the real debate we are avoiding today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I know that the hour is late and that my \ncolleague from Oklahoma wishes to speak as well. I know Senators are \neager to vote. I will not be long, but I will try to be concise in what \nI am about to say.\n  I came to the Senate primarily motivated by many different things, \nbut one of the things that truly motivated me was the fiscal state of \nour country, the fear that our current spending patterns are not just \nunsustainable but threaten our future and impede our ability to achieve \nwhat I believe is our destiny--another American century.\n  That is why each time I have been here and I have had an opportunity \nplaced before me to vote on a short-term spending matter, I have voted \nagainst it--because I felt they ignored our long-term problems of \nspending in this country and did not deal with them in a responsible \nway.\n  Once again, today we are confronted with a short-term spending bill \nthat we are asked to approve; otherwise, the government will shut down \nand the world will stop spinning. But today's question is a little \ndifferent from the ones that have been posed to us in the past. The one \nbefore us today has deeply imbedded in it an issue of national \nsecurity.\n  For the better part of 3 years, I have argued that what is happening \nin Syria is in our national interest. Many, quite frankly, in my own \nparty but also in the White House disagreed with my view. They felt \nthat it was a regional conflict or one that could be handled by leading \nfrom behind. So from that time until today we have largely watched as \nevents have unfolded in Syria without carefully explaining to the \nAmerican people why we should care.\n  But I believed then--and I think I have been proven right by recent \nevents--that what happened in Syria and what was happening in Syria was \nin our national interests because if we failed to influence the \ndirection of that situation, it would leave open a space for radical \njihadists from all over the world to establish an operation space from \nwhich they could carry out their plots not just against us but all free \nand freedom-loving people and peace-loving people in the world.\n  Sadly, that is what has happened in Syria. A protracted conflict has \nleft open spaces, and foreign radical jihadists from everywhere on this \nplanet have flowed to the deserts of Syria, where they set up \norganizations not just designed to topple Assad but to establish an \nIslamic caliphate that oversees multiple countries in the Middle East \nand ultimately will target us. I say ``target us'' because that \ncaliphate cannot exist unless they drive America from the region. The \nway they intend to drive us from that region is by terrorizing us. \nThose efforts began recently when we saw the brutal murder of two brave \nyoung Americans--including one from my home State--for doing nothing \nother than being present and being from America.\n  Now we find ourselves in this situation. I feel the President and, as \nI said, people in both parties have taken too long to realize what a \nthreat this is. I recognize that the options before us now are not as \ngood as they would have been had we dealt with this 2 years ago, 3 \nyears ago, or even 6 or 9 months ago. We have plenty of time in the \nweeks and months and years to come to debate what should have been \ndone. I anticipate I will be involved in that debate because there are \nlessons to be learned from that. But today, as leaders of this country, \nwe are called on to decide what we do now. What do we do now when \nconfronted with a very real threat that, left unconfronted, will become \na very real danger for the people we represent here in this country?\n  The President has come forward with a plan--a plan that I wish he had \ncome forward with 6 months ago, that I called for 3 months ago. But I \nsuppose, as in most things, better late than never. Even if late means \nour chances of success have been minimized, even if it will cost more \nmoney, and even if it will now take longer, better late than never.\n  That is the question before us now. I wish we had a separate debate \non this issue. I wish we had a separate debate on this issue with \nregard to arming moderate rebel elements in Syria because there are \nreal reasons to be concerned not just about whom we are arming but \nwhether it will work.\n  I wish we had more time to debate the broader plan and come before \nthis body and ask for an authorization for the use of force, although I \nthink there is a compelling argument to be made that for immediate \naction, the President, as the Commander in Chief, does not need that \nauthorization. We were not given that opportunity. What they are \ncheating is not just the political process, for in that debate we would \nhave been able to inform the American people so they too would have \nlearned more about this, but as a nation we could have come to a \nconsensus about what the right thing to do is. But in the end, that is \nnot the opportunity before us now. We are asked to decide things in \nthis Chamber that are in the best interests of our country even if they \ndid not work out the way we wanted them to or did not develop the way \nwe wanted them to. That is what is before us here today.\n  I say this to you without a shadow of a doubt, as I said weeks ago: \nIf we do not confront and defeat ISIL now, we will have to do so later. \nIt will take a lot longer. It will be much costlier and even more \npainful. We will confront ISIL one way or the other--I believe the \nsooner, the better.\n  What we are asked to do now is approve funding to arm moderate rebel \nelements in Syria. There is no guarantee of success. There is none. But \nthere is a guarantee of failure if we do not even try. Try we must for \none fundamental reason: If we fail to approve this, the nations of that \nregion will say that America is not truly engaged, that Americans are \nwilling to talk about this but are not willing to do anything about it.\n  So despite my concerns about the underlying bill and the budgeting it \nentails, I will support this resolution because I think it is in the \nbest interests of our national security.\n\n[[Page S5762]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for the minority has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. I have an inquiry of the Chair. It was my understanding \nthat I had 4 minutes remaining on our side and that Senator Rubio had \ntime granted to him by the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Is \nthat not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is unaware of that arrangement.\n  Mr. COBURN. What I would simply do is ask unanimous consent that I \nhave 7 minutes to make a statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If the Senator can stick to 7 minutes, we have no \nobjection.\n  Mr. COBURN. I can stick to 7 minutes. I will hear the gavel come down \nand I will quit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the motion of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma is accepted and the Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. First, I give praise to the chair and the ranking member \nof the Appropriations Committee for the cooperative nature of the \ncommittee this year in terms of inserting good government amendments \ninto appropriations bills. It was a real pleasure to be able to work \nwith them and to put some of the oversight results that we have done \nover the past few years into appropriations bills.\n  The bill we have on the floor, even though the chair is supporting \nthe bill, is not her bill. It is a bill that came to her from House \nRepublicans. So any criticism I might have of the bill is certainly not \ndirected toward the chair of the Appropriations Committee. But it is \nimportant to be reminded of what the Congress told the American people \nless than 2 years ago, that we were going to go on a diet, and then 1 \nyear ago when we had the Ryan-Murray agreement.\n  I will outline where we are with what we are getting ready to vote \non, because we are about $47 billion above what we agreed to in the \nRyan-Murray budget, and that doesn't include emergency funding.\n  Appropriators didn't write this bill. This bill came out of the \nHouse. We understand the timing of it, we understand the process. But \nthis bill doesn't keep our word to the American public that we said we \nwere going to keep. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2 is the chair of the Appropriations Committee attempted to put \nbills on the floor, and she was open to an amendment process. One bill \nwas pulled because there was no agreement to allow any amendments to \n$3.6 trillion worth of spending--none, zero. That wasn't her desire. \nShe is a fair broker in this body for what needs to be done when it \ncomes to spending.\n  So I would make the point on the fiscal aspect of this bill.\n  When criminals in this country hurt other people, judges throughout \nthe country--and Federal judges--impose a penalty, and criminals who \nare convicted end up paying into a Crime Victims Fund. The Crime \nVictims Fund isn't Federal tax dollars, it is individual payments by \nfelons to make amens for damage and injury to people upon whom their \ncrime was cast.\n  In this bill is $20 billion worth of false savings, but the way we \ncalculate it is since we are not going to spend the money that is due \nto the crime victims, we are going to say that is going to save us \nmoney and, so, therefore, we can spend that money somewhere else.\n  If you did that on your income taxes or if you were a corporation and \nfiled that with the SEC, it wouldn't take long for you to be in jail. \nBut that is what the appropriators in the House did and we just got \nthrough doing this last December, the same amount of money on the same \nfund.\n  What I want the American people to see is regardless of whether you \nthink we ought to pass this bill, shouldn't there be some clarity about \nthe integrity of our numbers? Shouldn't we, if we can't meet the \nguidelines, just admit it and say we can't meet it rather than saying \nwe are meeting it and create a false set of numbers? Shouldn't we at \nleast do that? Aren't the American people worth that?\n  But instead, we have $11.8 billion from the Crime Victims Fund and \n$6.3 billion from the Children's Health Fund, which are false savings. \nThey are not real savings.\n  So we are not going to be honest.\n  Well, I am going to be honest. The American public, the Senate, and \nthe authors of this bill in the House will be lying to you if you \nbelieve the numbers in this bill. They are not true.\n  That is not the chair of the Appropriations Committee who made that \ndecision, it was the House appropriators who made that decision to use \nfalse numbers to create a false set of achievements.\n  Finally, and I think I am about out of time, I would say there is one \nother aspect that disturbs me about this bill.\n  We have a mess in the Middle East today. Sitting on the Intelligence \nCommittee and sitting on Homeland Security, I don't disagree we ought \nto be involved in terms of going after ISIS, but I think we ought to \nrecognize that we created the problem in the first place. We created \nthe vacuum that allowed that to flourish.\n  I will state my assessment of where we are. We now have recognized \nthis threat and we have a political plan but no real policy plan to \nconfront ISIS.\n  Having just heard from both the head of the CIA and also the Defense \nDepartment in response to the President's plan, what I can tell you is \nwe know that something needs to be done, but your government doesn't \nyet know what to do.\n  I know there is authorization for monies in here. We need it. We are \ngoing to have to fight it. But let's be very clear, as Members of this \nbody, to ask the important questions so that we don't go down a road \nthat is made even worse. We have the brain power in the Senate, the \nexperience, and the gray hair to do that.\n  I ask my colleagues to be very careful--not with this; this is going \nto happen. This CR is going to happen. It is a terrible way to run the \ngovernment. The appropriations chair doesn't want to run it this way, \nbut let's be very careful on the questions we ask in the future.\n  I thank the chair of the Appropriations Committee for her kindness in \nyielding me the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I hope to say a few words to the Senator from Oklahoma \nbefore he leaves the floor. We are in the closing hours of not only \nthis debate but of this session of Congress. I say to the Senator from \nOklahoma on the brink of his retirement from the Senate how much I have \nenjoyed serving with him. Although we have different views from time to \ntime, he has played a very important role in this institution relating \nin terms of focusing on so many aspects of folly, fraud, stupidity, and \nduplication. I could go on.\n  I thank you. I know how we joined shoulder to shoulder on no more \nlavish spending at some of those conferences where it was $4 for a \nSwedish meatball. But seriously, as we worked on this year's \nappropriations, he and I actually met on how we could improve \ngovernment and keep a careful eye, with some of us saying just get rid \nof some of the things that cost money and add no value to the \ngovernment or its compelling needs.\n  I thank the Senator for his service in the Senate.\n  Also, hopefully, when we return, we can work on an omnibus to \nincorporate the very reforms around waste, duplication, and folly that \nwe worked together on on a bipartisan basis.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank my colleague.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, we are in the closing hours of debate. \nThere are two other Senators who will be coming to speak. I hope they \nwill be here sooner. There is a lot going on, and I want to encourage \ncolleagues, as we get ready, to urge a vote on passage of the \ncontinuing resolution.\n  This measure will keep government going through December 11. But make \nno mistake, this is government on auto pilot.\n  I hope to be back in December, shoulder to shoulder with Senator \nShelby, where we will work on a comprehensive funding legislation--in \nother words, an omnibus.\n  This is Washington speak. I mean, really, we use words nobody \nunderstands: continuing resolutions, omnibus, motions to proceed. But \nin plain English, it would mean taking all 12 subcommittees that are in \ncharge of funding the government through due\n\n[[Page S5763]]\n\ndiligence and putting together a comprehensive funding bill that can be \ndebated, scrutinized, debated, and voted on.\n  We have done our work over the year. I am very proud of my \nsubcommittee chairmen, the ranking members who have worked on a \nbipartisan basis, and their staffs. We can do an omnibus when we come \nback that will enable us to make the choices we need to do, meet our \nnational security needs, the compelling human needs of the country, and \nmake sure we have an opportunity ladder for our people who are middle \nclass to stay there or those who want to work hard to do better to be \nable to get there, and to also make those investments in innovation, \nresearch, and development that create the new ideas for the new jobs \nthat keep us as an exceptional Nation.\n  I do hope we get final passage. I do hope also when we return after \nthe election, we can do this comprehensive funding bill.\n  Again, I thank Senator Shelby of Alabama and all of the other members \nof the Appropriations Committee who worked so hard with the ranking \nmembers. We had a series of debates and votes. We worked very hard. Yet \nI wish people would come to our committees, as they were categorized by \ncivility, intellectual rigor, and scrutiny of IG and GAO reports. We \nworked very hard to accomplish the mission of these agencies to keep \nour government strong and to get value for the taxpayer.\n  Again, thanks to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, led by \nSenator Shelby of Alabama.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5763-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEBBIE SMITH REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2014\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I see my good friend, the senior Senator from Texas, on \nthe floor, and I am about to ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4323.\n  Before I do, Senator Cornyn has been very interested in this. This is \nthe Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act. I have been working with Debbie \nSmith since her bill was first introduced in 2001. He is probably one \nof the few Senators who was here with me at that time when I first \nsupported it. It is to improve access to rape kits, testing, and \nservices for survivors of sexual assault.\n  Senator Cornyn has been a strong supporter. I know he also supports \nthe Justice for All Act as well, something he cosponsored, and the \ndistinguished Republican leader has.\n  I would like to get them all passed. I realize one Republican--not \nthe Senator from Texas--is objecting to passing the Justice for All \nAct, and I don't want to pit one against the other.\n  Because at least this one expires this month, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4323, \nwhich was received from the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4323) to reauthorize programs authorized under \n     the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2004, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements related to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Simply reserving the right to object, and obviously I \nam not going to object, I am very happy we could reauthorize this \nimportant piece of legislation. I have had an opportunity to get to \nknow Debbie Smith pretty well, as Senator Cornyn and Senator Leahy \nhave. We have met on several occasions.\n  The bill passed the House of Representatives a few months ago on a \nvoice vote. We tried to clear it when it came over here. Unfortunately, \nthere was an objection on the other side of the aisle. But I am glad we \nare where we are and that the bill will be reauthorized.\n  It is certainly fitting for Congress to pass this bill that is named \nfor such a tireless advocate for those who suffered this terrible \nabuse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwon't object, let me use this occasion to say to the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee how much I appreciate his leadership and \ncooperation.\n  Obviously, Senator McConnell, Senator Leahy, and I are all cosponsors \nof the bigger piece of legislation, the Justice for All Act. I share \nSenator Leahy's desire--I am sure shared by the Republican leader--that \nwe pass that today. But since we can't do that, and since we are \nengaged in the art of the possible, this is a good outcome--not just \nfor Debbie Smith, who, as we have all heard, has been a tireless \nadvocate for testing this backlog of rape kits, which holds \nextraordinary power to both identify the perpetrators in sexual \nassaults and exonerate people who are not implicated by a DNA test, but \nas we know, we have had a huge backlog, and the Debbie Smith \nReauthorization Act renewal is bipartisan legislation that will provide \nfunds for law enforcement officials to deal with the national scandal, \nwhich the rape kit backlog is.\n  Amidst the frustration we all experience in the Senate from time to \ntime, this is good news and this represents progress.\n  So I will agree with the unanimous consent request.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Reserving the right to object--and obviously I too \nwon't--on behalf of all the women of the Senate, I thank Senator Leahy \nfor his consistent, persistent leadership on this issue, and Senator \nCornyn.\n  This is how the Senate ought to work--on a bipartisanship basis, \nmeeting a compelling need, and then being able to move it in an \nexpeditious way.\n  But for rape victims everywhere to know that we can deal with this \nbacklog and because good men stood up for women who have been wronged \nreally is one of the edifying moments of today.\n  I thank the Senators for it and withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection, the request is agreed \nto.\n  The bill (H.R. 4323) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I will continue to work with the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Texas on the Justice for All Act. \nNinety-nine Senators agree to pass it and only 1 is objecting. It \nrequires a rollcall vote when we come back in November. I hope we can \nhave that rollcall vote perhaps in a timely rotation. And with 99 \nSenators who say they support it, the 1 Senator who has been blocking \nit can vote against it. But those of us who have been in law \nenforcement know how important it is.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The President \nwill be notified of the action of the Senate.\n\n\n                   NOMINATION OF LIZ SHERWOOD-RANDALL\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Dr. Elizabeth \nSherwood-Randall, whose nomination to be Deputy Secretary at the \nDepartment of Energy was confirmed today.\n  Throughout her career, Dr. Sherwood-Randall has been an exemplary \npublic servant and academic. She has mastered the domain of nuclear \nissues, arms control, European affairs and has served her country at \nthe highest of levels. I am confident she will continue her impressive \nrecord of service and will be an excellent Deputy Secretary of Energy.\n  At the outset of her career she was a foreign policy advisor to then-\nSenator Joe Biden.\n  In the Clinton administration she served as Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia.\n  In the Obama administration she was Special Assistant to the \nPresident and Senior Director for European Affairs at the National \nSecurity Council and later White House Coordinator for Defense Policy, \nCountering Weapons of Mass Destruction and Arms Control.\n  When not serving in government, she held a variety of academic roles \naffiliated with Harvard and Stanford Universities and the Council on \nForeign Relations.\n  The mission of the Energy Department is ``to ensure America's \nsecurity and prosperity by addressing its energy, environmental and \nnuclear challenges through transformative science and technology \nsolutions.''\n  As the chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee for Energy and Water \nDevelopment, I know the complexities of the issues facing the new \nDeputy Secretary. I also know that it will be invaluable to the Energy \nDepartment to have a well-rounded leadership team.\n  The current Secretary of Energy is well-steeped in energy issues. Dr. \nSherwood-Randall brings expertise in the national security realm, which \nis becoming more and more important and related to energy issues. This \nleadership model has been proven to work and I trust this combination \nof skills will result in smart energy policy and strong management.\n  For example, a key part of the Department's mission--and one which is \na high priority for me--is the responsibility to secure and dispose of \nnuclear and radiological material. For this, I am encouraged by Dr. \nSherwood-Randall's long history of experience working on non-\nproliferation issues.\n  It remains a priority of mine to enact a national policy to store our \nnuclear waste. Nuclear waste is piling up all around the country and we \nare losing millions of dollars every year in the absence of a coherent \npolicy. This is why I have introduced, and will continue to push, \nlegislation which establishes an interim national policy to safely \nstore our nuclear waste.\n  It should be obvious that this is precisely the type of issue that \nDr. Sherwood-Randall will be adept at navigating, and I look forward to \nworking with her on this and many other issues.\n  In sum, the nominee before us today is a skilled policy advisor, an \naccomplished academic and a dedicated American public servant.\n\n[[Page S5766]]\n\n  It is with great pleasure that I support her nomination today and I \nthank my colleagues for their vote to confirm her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5766-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Tribute to Martha Scott Poindexter\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. It is with great pride and a touch of sadness that I \nstand here today to pay a special tribute to Martha Scott Poindexter, \nmy dear friend and trusted confidant. Martha Scott is leaving the staff \nof the Senate after a long and distinguished career in public service.\n  Martha Scott has dedicated most of her professional life to the \nCongress, serving over 20 years in both the House of Representatives as \nwell as the Senate. She was with me in my first agricultural hearing in \nthe House, and as I prepare to retire from the Senate this year, she \nwas with me today in one of my last hearings as the vice chairman of \nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  I owe much of my success as a legislator to Martha Scott. She has \nserved as my legislative assistant in the House, legislative director \nwhen I first entered the Senate, and later as my staff director for \nboth the agriculture and intelligence committees.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that Martha Scott is one of the \nbrightest, most talented, and well-connected individuals on Capitol \nHill. She is a natural leader and manager who exemplifies a tremendous \ncharacter and dedication that traditionally defines the term a public \nservant.\n  Martha Scott is an enthusiastic team player with a special talent for \nfinding solutions to complex problems and rallying support behind her. \nThose are enormously helpful traits on the Hill, especially in recent \nyears when it seems as though finding solutions has taken a back seat \nto partisanship.\n  But those are not the characteristics that define Martha Scott. \nRather, those who work with her and who have known her professionally \nand personally are most often struck by her tremendous heart and \nkindness. Her infectious laugh always brings a smile to the faces of \nfriends nearby. This place just won't be the same without it.\n  Above all, she is a good person, loyal to the core, and committed to \nalways doing what is right. All she asks in return is that people say \nher first name correctly, Martha Scott. It is not Martha. We \nSoutherners can be very particular that way, and we like double names.\n  What began in the junior position in the office of Senator Cochran \nnearly 24 years ago blossomed into a distinguished public service \ncareer that is nearly unmatched by our peers. Martha Scott has seen and \nbeen involved in so many historic events and helped author legislation \nthat has touched and impacted the lives of all our citizens, but don't \nexpect Martha Scott to tell anybody that. That is just not her style.\n  Whether it is her work on the Committee on Appropriations, the \nCommittee on Agriculture, the Select Committee on Intelligence, or as a \nmember of my personal legislative staff, Martha Scott has selflessly \ncommitted herself to the people we represent, whether it is the cotton \nfarmer from the Mississippi Delta, the soldier in Afghanistan, or the \nthousands of intelligence professionals who serve our country every \nday.\n  Martha Scott has always kept our Nation's best interests at heart.\n  Finding a natural love of politics and policy drove Martha Scott to \nbe a key player in the legislative process that touched every farm bill \nfor the last 25 years, as well as the recent controversial debates on \ncyber security and intelligence collection.\n  My colleagues and I trust Martha Scott's judgment impeccably. Her \nexceptional performance has earned our respect and admiration, and it \nhas inspired a generation of staff members who have had the privilege \nto work with her and learn from her. Her legacy will remain a part of \nthe Senate for many years to come.\n  Martha Scott has a profound commitment to family and her roots in the \ndelta define her. Growing up on the family farm provided a strong \nfoundation and work ethic that one only gets in rural Mississippi.\n  Guided by her loving parents and the constant support of her sisters, \nMartha Scott has not only won the admiration of those for whom she has \nworked, but for those who have worked for her.\n  To her husband, Robert, we thank you for allowing us to take up so \nmuch of her time, especially in this very special year. My colleagues \nand I owe a deep debt of gratitude to each and every member of Martha \nScott's family.\n  Martha Scott has been a part of my staff for 20 years, which means \nshe has been a part of my family for 20 years. She has watched my \nchildren mature and my grandchildren grow up, and they have all come to \nknow and love her. She has been an inspiration to so many people, but \nmost importantly she has been an inspiration to me. While everybody is \ngoing to miss her, I am the one who is going to miss her the most.\n  So Martha Scott, to you we say: Congratulations on a life after the \nSenate. Just know how much, No. 1, we are going to miss you, but \nsecondly and most importantly, your country is going to miss you. We \nappreciate your tremendous commitment and service to our country.\n  God bless you and God bless your family.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                    The United States Postal Service\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, as we finished the last series of votes we \nwere talking about the range of difficult issues we face in this \nCongress and also in our country--a series of issues including what to \ndo about ISIS and how to confront this latest threat, whether or not to \nprovide aid to the moderate rebels in Syria and what form should that \naid take, continued concerns that flow from Ukraine, and the areas \nthere along the border with Russia, cyber attacks, data breaches, Ebola \noutbreaks, folks trying to get into our country from all different \ndirections, especially from Central America. These are hard issues to \ndeal with. Try though we may, it is hard to fix them.\n  As my colleague who serves with us on homeland security knows, it is \na busy neighborhood where we have jurisdiction. It is not that the \nproblems are intractable. They are just hard issues, and some of them \nmay take years to fully resolve.\n  But I might say as well, the economic recovery has continued now for \n5 years and it has been stop and go. Every now and then we have some \ngreat encouraging news, and sometimes it is less so. But today we have \nencouraging news.\n  I wish to talk a little bit about this as we talk about the economy \nand lead into a discussion of where the postal system of our country \nactually has played a role in strengthening our economic recovery.\n  Every Thursday, as my colleague knows, the Department of Labor puts \nout information. Among the things they promulgate on Thursdays is how \nmany people filed for unemployment insurance in the last week. They do \nthis every Thursday, except maybe on Thanksgiving or maybe on a \nChristmas.\n  On the Thursday of the week that Barack Obama and Joe Biden were \nsworn in as President and Vice President, they put out a number that \nsaid 628,000 people filed for unemployment insurance. Any time that \nnumber is above 400,000 people, we are losing jobs in this country, and \nany time it is under 400,000 people, we are adding jobs in this \ncountry. It was 628,000 that week 5\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  Slowly but surely, that number has dropped and has continued to drop. \nIt bounces up and down a little bit. Since it may go up and down from \nweek to week, we do a 4-week running average and that kind of balances \nout the blips.\n  Well, the number has dropped from 628,000 people 5\\1/2\\ ago to \n400,000 people and to 300,000 people. We got the new report today from \nthe Department of\n\n[[Page S5767]]\n\nLabor, and 280,000 people filed last week for unemployment insurance.\n  Why should we feel so good about that? Because that number is the \nlowest we have been below 400,000 since the year the recession actually \nbegan--certainly in the last 5\\1/2\\ years. That would suggest as kind \nof a forerunner what will come in for the job numbers for the month of \nSeptember, which we will get at the beginning of October. I am \nencouraged by that.\n\n  There are a number of things we can do and ought to do to continue to \nstrengthen the economic recovery. I won't go into all those, but one I \nwant to mention deals with the U.S. Postal Service. Not everybody says \nthe Postal Service has much to do with the economy, but it does. There \nare about 7 million or 8 million jobs in the United States that depend \nto one extent or the other on having an efficient, vibrant Postal \nService.\n  For a number of years, the Postal Service has been struggling in some \ncases to survive. The Postal Service has cut, cut, cut in order to try \nto right-size their enterprise. In the last 10 or so years they have \nreduced their headcount from almost 900,000 to about 500,000--so almost \nin half. They have reduced the number of processing centers across the \ncountry from about 600 or 700 mail processing centers to actually less \nthan half that, a little over 300. We have close to 35,000 to 40,000 \npost offices across the country, and over 10,000 of those today--they \nhaven't really closed post offices, but what they did is a bunch of \noffices that didn't do much business, those post offices are still open \nin many cases, but they are open 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours a day rather \nthan 8 hours a day with a fully paid postmaster. So they have found a \nway to not close a lot of post offices but to reduce their costs there, \nand they are still struggling. Every 3 months they put out their \nfinancial reports, and the financial reports indicate they are either \nlosing money or may be close to breaking even.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, this is an issue I think about a \nwhole lot. He does, too. The Senator from Alaska cares a lot about the \nneeds of the Postal Service. The need for a strong and vibrant Postal \nService in Alaska is probably greater than in any State in the country. \nHe has done a great job, along with his colleague from Alaska, to try \nto make sure that we are mindful in the Senate of the importance of the \nPostal Service to Alaska.\n  I have a glass of water here which one of our pages was good enough \nto bring to me. Look at this glass of water. It is not really clear. Is \nthis glass half full or half empty? Most people thinking about the \nPostal Service in the last several years would say this glass of water \nis half empty. As time goes by, I am starting to think maybe that is \nthe wrong approach, that is the wrong opinion. I think this glass of \nwater might actually be half full. The more I learn about the Postal \nService's operations and the opportunities they face, I am even more \nconvinced the opportunity here is a glass-half-full situation.\n  We have had over the years probably a dozen or more hearings in the \nSenate on the Postal Service. The real challenge is: How do we take a \n200-plus-year-old legacy organization, legacy distribution network that \ntakes the Postal Service to every mailbox in the country 5 or 6 days a \nweek? How do we take that legacy distribution network and enable the \nPostal Service, empower the Postal Service to make money and be \nprofitable in the 21st century?\n  As we know, we don't communicate like we used to in this country. We \nhave the Internet, we have Skype, we have Twitter, we have cell phones. \nThere are a lot of different ways to communicate that we didn't have \neven 12 or 15 years ago. Folks used to send birthday cards, Christmas \ncards, that sort of thing. Now they send email cards, if they send \nanything at all. People used to write letters and notes. My parents \nduring World War II wrote to each other almost every day. Folks in \nAfghanistan have email, they have Skype, and they have cell phones. \nThey still send some mail, but it is not like it used to be. A lot of \nbusinesses that used the mail to do billings for people to send in \nremittances don't do that anymore.\n  First-class mail in this country is where the Postal Service has made \ntheir money for many years. That is where the most profitable source of \nincome is--first-class mail. Since the great recession started in 2007, \nwe have seen first-class mail drop by almost half, and that has caused \nhuge problems for the Postal Service going forward.\n  While the Internet and the digital age has taken away a lot of the \nPostal Service's business, as it has turned out, it has also given them \nsome pretty good opportunities. As we know, not everybody goes to a \ndepartment store these days to buy things, to a hardware store or to a \nbookstore. Not every day, but a lot of times we will buy things over \nthe Internet. Those items, whether gifts or things we might want for \nourselves, they have somehow to get from the manufacturer's or \nretailer's distribution center to the customer. Somebody has to deliver \nit. As it turns out, that somebody could be FedEx, it could be UPS or \nin many cases it could be the Postal Service.\n  So I wish to take a few minutes and speak this evening about how I \nreally do think the Postal Service could be a glass-half-full \nsituation. Part of our responsibility here in the Senate is to make \nsure they are able to seize this opportunity and not let it pass by.\n  The Postal Service has been calling for us to do a number of things \nto help them--not to give them money but to do a number of things to \nhelp them. I will mention a few of them.\n  The Postal Service has overpaid by $2.5 billion what they owe into \nthe Federal Employee Retirement System. Given the formula used, which \nis not taking into account that postal employees are older and die \nsooner than other Federal employees, the Postal Service is going to \ncontinue to overpay monies. So they are owed a $2.5 billion refund, and \nif we don't do something, they are going to continue to overpay. We \nshould first get them the $2.5 billion refund. The second thing we \nshould do is change the formula so it reflects the demographics of the \nPostal Service versus the rest of the Federal workforce.\n\n  Among the other things we ought to do is to integrate, if you will, \nMedicare--better integrate Medicare with the cost of health care for \npostal employees.\n  My wife turned 65 early this summer. When she did, the company where \nshe worked for 27 years, DuPont, mailed her something and said: We \nstill love you. You are retired, you are 65, and we want you to sign up \nfor Medicare Part A, Medicare Part B, and Medicare Part D. We will in \nturn provide wrap-around or fill-the-gap health care coverage for you. \nThey do that for all the retirees when they reach 65. And it is not \njust DuPont. It is thousands of companies all over the country. When \ntheir retirees reach the age of 65, for the most part they say to the \nretirees: You are eligible for Medicare Part A, Part B, Part D. We want \nyou to sign up, and we will provide wrap-around coverage for you.\n  FedEx, I believe, does that. UPS, I believe, does that. The Postal \nService--which competes in the same business as both FedEx, UPS, and \nsome of these other companies--doesn't do that. As it turns out, the \nPostal Service pays more money into Medicare than any employer in the \ncountry. They do not get the full value for the dollars they have \ninvested.\n  One of the things the Postal Service has asked us to do as simply a \nmatter of equity is to allow them to do what so many other companies \ndo, including some of the companies they compete directly with--FedEx \nand UPS. We ought to do that. That is one of the things they are asking \nus to do.\n  Another thing, under the current law, from time to time, if there is \nsomething that happens in the economy or there is a disaster and the \nPostal Service needs to raise rates on kind of an emergency basis, \ncalled an exigent basis, they can apply to the Postal Regulatory \nCommission and ask to do that. The Postal Regulatory Commission can say \nyes or they can say no.\n  Last year, the Postal Service went to the Postal Regulatory \nCommission and said: We suffered terribly because of the loss of first-\nclass mail that flowed from the worst recession since the Great \nDepression. We would like to have something above and beyond a CPI \nincrease, a cost of living increase, for our rates. What did the Postal \nRegulatory Commission do? They agreed to raise the rates and let the \npost office raise the rates.\n\n[[Page S5768]]\n\n  So what did the Postal Regulatory Commission do? They agreed to let \nthe Postal Service raise the rates, which works out to a 4.3-percent \nincrease. It is not permanent, but it is for a period of maybe a year. \nThe Postal Service is asking us to make that 4.3-percent increase their \nnew permanent revenue baseline.\n  What does that mean for mailers if we make it permanent? For folks \nwho are nonprofit--we always get mail from nonprofit organizations. \nThat is part of the way they provide services to all kinds of folks. \nBut the cost of a nonprofit letter under this action--the 4.3-percent \nincrease--has gone up from 10 cents a letter to 11 cents. It has gone \nup by one penny. I believe the cost of mailing a magazine has also gone \nup by one or two pennies, from approximately 25 to 27 cents. The cost \nof mailing a catalog has gone up by one or two cents, from \napproximately 45 cents to 47 cents, and that is with the 4.3-percent \nincrease.\n  The Postal Service has said to the Congress: Allow that temporary \n4.3-percent increase to remain and to become part of our revenue \nbaseline.\n  I think we should do that. I know a number of my colleagues do as \nwell.\n  That is one of the things they are asking us to do. Among the other \nthings they are asking us to do is they want to actually deliver items \nthey haven't been able to deliver before, including wine, beer, and \nspirits. FedEx and UPS can do that, and postal services in many other \ncountries can do that. Our Postal Service cannot do that. It is not to \nbalance their budget for them, but it would make a big difference. I \nbelieve it could be worth a couple million dollars a year in \nprofitability. That is something they would like to be able to do.\n  FedEx is not interested in being Google or Apple or any company like \nthat--part of the digital economy--but there are a couple things they \ncan do and would like to do that would work into the digital economy. \nThey are not big deals, but they make sense with respect to the Postal \nService and their capabilities and would actually enable them over time \nto make some revenues as well.\n  The Postal Service delivers ballots, initially in Oregon, later in \nWashington State, and this year in Colorado. People can file their \nvote--get absentee ballots and vote by mail in Oregon. They do it in \nWashington State. This year they are starting to do it in Colorado.\n  What we have learned from experience is that folks who vote by mail \nvote more often, more frequently, and what we hear from States that do \nthis is that it is actually a cost-effective way to run elections. The \nPostal Service would like to do more of that, and we should encourage \nthat as well.\n  Another area where the Postal Service might have some opportunities \nis they would like to collocate more operations with State and local \ngovernments in small communities where they have space at the post \noffice and get State and local folks to locate some activities there.\n  One great idea they had in some of the bigger, more densely populated \nplaces around the country is that the Postal Service has opened up \nlarge facilities--not like a regular post office--where people can go \nget passports. There is a facility on the outskirts of L.A. where over \nthe course of the day hundreds--maybe even 1,000 people or more--can \ncome and get their passports. It is a service that is provided. The \nPostal Service makes some revenue from doing that.\n  If we ever pass comprehensive immigration reform and we have 10 \nmillion or so people in this country who are here undocumented--and \nimmigration reform doesn't give them the right to citizenship, it \ndoesn't make them a citizen, but I think if the Senate passed an \nimmigration reform bill, it would offer an opportunity for people to \nhave some kind of legal status. How are they going to get that? Where \nare they going to get that?\n  If we passed immigration reform, there would be an opportunity for \nthe Postal Service, which is in every community in our Nation and which \nalready does a passport business for a lot of people, to help meet that \nneed, and my hope is they will have that opportunity.\n  Those are some things they are asking us to do. In short, what they \nare asking us to do is to give them the ability to generate revenues \nand to be able to meet their capital needs.\n  The Postal Service needs to be capitalized. They need new vehicles. \nThey have 190,000 vehicles.\n  We have this chart. This is 2014, and down here is about 10 years \ndown the road. What we are looking for is to provide money over this \n10-year period of time. The Postal Service is saying they need about \n$30 billion to recapitalize the Postal Service to make them \ncompetitive. One of the ways to make them competitive is with respect \nto vehicles. They have 190,000 vehicles. The average age is 22 years.\n  I have a 13-year-old Chrysler Town and Country minivan. Yesterday I \ndrove it down here from Wilmington, DE. I usually take the train. The \ntrain was down 2 days ago. I drove home last night, and it just went \nover 377,000 miles. Most Postal Service vehicles are not 13 years old \nlike my minivan; they are almost twice as old and easily have twice as \nmuch mileage as my minivan. My wife thinks I ought to trade in my \nminivan, and some day I will.\n\n  We should give the Postal Service the wherewithal to trade up--not \njust to get new, more energy-efficient vehicles that may have twice the \nfuel economy and reduce emissions but also vehicles that are sized for \nthe products the Postal Service is delivering. In this digital economy, \nit is an opportunity for the Postal Service to deliver a lot more \npackages and parcels of all kinds. They are delivering groceries in a \nnumber of places around the country, and they need vehicles that are \nsized differently and that are more ergonomically appropriate for the \nfolks who are driving the vehicles.\n  There is new technology. Anybody buying a new car lately knows the \ntechnologies that are in vehicles. It is amazing what we can do. I \nwouldn't know that, given the age of my vehicle, but my friends tell me \nabout the amazing things they can do with theirs. When you have a \nvehicle that is 22 years old, there are not many gee-whiz technology \nitems on those vehicles, but there could be. As an example, let's say \nmy desk here defines a rural area for delivery for a letter carrier \nsomeplace around the country. It could be Alaska; it could be Delaware. \nAs the rural letter carrier covers this area, the technology is \navailable so that the residents somewhere along there could pick up a \npackage here or leave a package at the general store. They could \ncommunicate with their customers in any number of ways and provide \nbetter customer service.\n  Additionally, when you walk into a post office these days, for the \nmost part they look similar today to what they did 5, 10, 15, 20 years \nago almost without exception. There are so many things we can do in \nterms of technology to provide better services at post offices that we \nare not doing.\n  We can provide better, more efficient services and friendlier \nservices as well. We have 25 mail-processing centers in the country. I \nvisited one of them with Senator Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota about 3 \nor 4 months ago. We visited this small mail-processing center in her \nbeautiful State. We went into the back operating area of the mail-\nprocessing center, and there was a fellow there who was about 50 years \nold. He was lugging around these big boxes that somebody was mailing. \nHe was carrying them around and trying to get them over to a barcode \nreader, and he was putting them in a huge pouch so they could be \nmailed.\n  There is equipment that could readily process big boxes like that, \nsmaller packages, and parcels. We don't have equipment like that in \nmost of our mail-processing centers. If we did, we could offer better, \nfaster, timelier, more cost-effective service.\n  So if we were to capitalize the Postal Service, among the things the \nPostal Service could do if they had $30 billion over the next 10 years \nis replace their fleet of 190,000 vehicles with more energy-efficient \nvehicles that are appropriately sized for the kinds of packages they \ndeliver. The approximately 300 mail-processing centers could be \nretooled with mail-processing equipment that actually reflects what the \nmail service delivers in the 21st century. The post offices themselves \ncould have the kinds of upgrades and technology investments that would \nenable better service as well. That is what the Postal Service could do \nif they had the money.\n\n[[Page S5769]]\n\n  Sometimes when people think of the Postal Service they think the \nPostal Service is not really innovative; they don't come up with a \nbunch of ideas. It turns out that they are even more innovative than I \nand a lot of other people thought they were.\n  I want to mention a couple of things they have begun doing that I \nthink are noteworthy. They ought to be able to do more. If they could, \nthey actually could make money and have the money to make capital \ninvestments and not be a burden to taxpayers of this country.\n  This morning in San Francisco, CA, at around 3 a.m., in 32 ZIP Codes, \nthe U.S. Postal Service delivered groceries to people. They delivered \nthem to homes, in some cases to businesses, to apartments, to high-\nrises. They delivered groceries. They also delivered the mail later in \nthe day, but from 3 a.m. to 7 a.m. the Postal Service in 32 ZIP Codes \ndelivered groceries. They have been doing it for over a month, and I \nunderstand they are doing it for Amazon. I understand Amazon is pleased \nand the Postal Service is pleased with it. Amazon customers like it, \nand the Postal Service can do this and make money. They are not doing \nanything else with the trucks from 3 a.m. to 7 a.m., and it just works. \nIt just works.\n  The Postal Service is doing this for Amazon, but they are reaching \nout to 100 grocery chains across the country and saying: This is what \nwe do for Amazon in San Francisco. How would you like us to do this for \nyou?\n  My guess is this will turn into a good piece of business, but they \nneed the vehicles to enable them to do this, and they need money for \ncapital investment.\n  Some people think the only thing the Postal Service has done \ncreatively in years is flat-rate boxes. You know, if it fits, it ships. \nIt is a great product. It is still growing. It has grown by around 4 or \n5 percent a year. But there are a bunch of other things they can do and \nwant to do. They need money for capital investment.\n  About a year ago they started delivering for Amazon--not everywhere \nbut in a couple hundred ZIP Codes--on Sundays. It worked pretty well. \nAnd this past Sunday they delivered packages and parcels through \nAmazon--not to 200 ZIP Codes but I think to over 5,000 across the \ncountry. It enables them to do next-day delivery that includes Sunday. \nIt is a nice piece of business and it is growing, but in order to \ncontinue to grow it, the Postal Service needs vehicles that are right-\nsized for that sort of business and a lot of them--potentially a lot of \nthem.\n  Another thing the Postal Service is doing--and this is a product \nwhich I have used and a product which I think is going to have growing \nutilization across the country. It is called Priority Mail Express.\n  I went to a post office in Delaware not long ago. I wanted to send my \nsister a Mother's Day gift.\n  I said: I want this to get there in 2 days.\n  They asked: Do you want it insured?\n  I said: Not really.\n  They said: Well, if you send it by Priority Mail Express, we can \nguarantee delivery in 2 days, we can guarantee delivery in 1 day, or we \ncan guarantee delivery in 3 days. We can track it for you for free.\n  And I think they said the first $100 of insurance is free.\n  I said: This is great. I will take 2 days. The insurance is fine.\n  As it turns out, I am not the only person who is using Priority Mail \nExpress. It is available not just 2 or 3 days a week, it is available \nfor delivery 7 days a week. If somebody has something they want to mail \nthis Saturday and have it delivered on Sunday, they can do so with \nPriority Mail Express. They can do it and get next-day delivery. They \ncan do it and get free tracking. They can do it and get insurance up to \n$50 or $100 on whatever is being mailed. That is going to be a great \nproduct. I think it is going to make flat-rate boxes--well, not look \nlike a second-class citizen, but it is going to make flat-rate boxes \nlook modest by comparison.\n  These are the sorts of things our folks at the Postal Service would \nlike to do--to deliver not only mail but to deliver groceries, to be \nable to deliver tomorrow, deliver on Sunday. And it is ironic that in a \nday and age that we worry about postal service going from 6 days a week \nto 5, that right now they are a 7-day-a-week operation. I think there \nis reason to believe they will grow even more.\n  There are some who say that rather than passing the sort of \nlegislation the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \nreported out on a bipartisan vote earlier this year, there is some \nalternative legislation. We should simply say to the Postal Service: \nYou cannot close any more mail-processing centers for another year.\n  As it turns out, that is not going to give the Postal Service the \nmoney to do this, or, frankly, the money to invest in any other number \nof new products that have the great potential of generating revenues \nand enabling them not just to be open or remain alive but to actually \nbecome vibrant and to be part of our growing economy in this country.\n  I wish to close by saying that I am more hopeful about the Postal \nService than I have been in all the years I have worked on this as an \nissue. As I talked to my colleagues, I am encouraged to hear from \nDemocrats and Republicans that they want to be part of the solution, \nand they realize the idea of just leaving the Postal Service twisting \nin the wind for another year is not a good thing.\n  If the Postal Service has a choice to say don't close these 60 or 70 \nor 80 mail processing centers, that is not what they need. They need to \nnot necessarily unleash them--better ensure that they have the \nresources they need to not just right-size the organization but to \nmodernize and recapitalize the organization and enable them to do \nthings in the 21st century that will actually build off their age-old \ndelivery network and find new ways to make money doing so.\n  As we close here today--a lot of people are scattering to head back \nto their home States in anticipation of elections and that sort of \nthing, and to do other things--I wanted to mention on a more hopeful \nnote, and I say to the members of our committee, and especially to the \nPresiding Officer, thanks for trying to make sure the Postal Service \ncontinues to be a linchpin within our economy, whether it happens to be \nAlaska, Delaware, or even South Dakota.\n  Senator Thune is waiting for me to stop talking.\n  They have the opportunity to be a big, important part of our economy \ngoing forward, and my hope and prayer is that is exactly what we will \nenable them to do.\n  With that, I will yield the floor. I don't know if the Senator from \nSouth Dakota would like to take the floor, but if he wants to, it is \nhis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5769-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5769-S5770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CELEBRATING THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague from \nSouth Dakota, Senator Johnson, to commemorate South Dakota's 125th \nanniversary of Statehood. One hundred twenty-five years ago, on \nNovember 2, 1889, President Benjamin Harrison shuffled the Act of \nAdmission Papers for North and South Dakota to ensure that no one knew \nwhich State entered the Union first. To this day, we still don't know \nwhich act President Harrison signed first.\n  South Dakota is perhaps best known as the home of the Shrine of \nDemocracy at Mount Rushmore, which opened to the public just 50 years \nafter South Dakota attained statehood. This monument captures the way \nof life and governance structure that we have in South Dakota. Our \nelected officials take the concerns of their constituents to Pierre and \nensure that our State is bettering the lives of its citizens in a \nfiscally responsible manner.\n  We believe in limited government which provides room for individuals \nand businesses to grow and thrive. Our model of free enterprise has \nallowed businesses to flourish in South Dakota, and as a result, is one \nof the best States in the country to start a business.\n  We consistently have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the \ncountry, which is currently at 3.7 percent. Our labor force and our \neconomy are driven by our State's top industries of tourism and \nagriculture. The 28,000\n\n[[Page S5770]]\n\nSouth Dakotans who work in our tourism industry ensure that people from \nall over the world enjoy our great places. Tourists enjoy visiting \nMount Rushmore, of course, but also seeing the sights throughout the \nBlack Hills and the Badlands, the Corn Palace in Mitchell, the Crazy \nHorse Memorial, and the falls in Sioux Falls.\n  In addition to welcoming Americans from coast to coast, South Dakota \nis feeding our Nation and our world. Each year, one South Dakota farmer \nproduces enough food to feed 155 people. South Dakota ranks in the top \n10 States for wheat, corn, soybeans, alfalfa, and sunflowers. We are \nalso in the top 10 States of bison, honey, sheep, and beef. In all, \nSouth Dakota's agriculture industry contributes $26 billion annually to \nour economy.\n  While the productivity of our farmers and ranchers is unmatched, all \nhard-working South Dakota families contribute to our State's success. \nWhether they are educating our children, serving in our growing health \ncare and financial services sectors, conducting research in our college \nlaboratories, hard work is what binds South Dakotans together and has \nmade our State's experiment in democracy one of the most successful in \nour Nation's history.\n  I am proud to call the great State of South Dakota home, and I am \nhonored to have the privilege of serving all South Dakotans here in the \nSenate.\n  Today I wish to honor the spirit that has endured in our State for \nthe last 125 years by celebrating this special anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5770-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CELEBRATING SOUTH DAKOTA'S 125TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today, I join with my \ncolleague, the junior Senator from South Dakota, in celebrating the \nbirth of our home State, which entered the union 125 years ago on \nNovember 2. I'm a fourth generation South Dakotan, and my great-\ngrandfather was a homesteader in what was then known as the Dakota \nTerritory. As I have learned growing up in Canton and from the \ngenerations of my family that came before me, being a South Dakotan \ninstills in oneself a unique kind of work ethic and a drive to do good \nunto others.\n  South Dakotans know how to deal with adversity and they know how to \nhelp each other when disaster strikes. Last year, a devastating \nblizzard hit much of western South Dakota, causing millions of dollars \nin damage and killing tens of thousands of head of livestock. Without \nblinking an eye, neighbors were out helping neighbors who lost power. \nThey donated their time and money to help ranchers who lost their \nlivelihoods. Recovery would not have been possible without the inherent \nattitude that South Dakotans have to help one another.\n  South Dakotans also have a lot to celebrate this year. The ag \nindustry has driven our economy, creating jobs and spurring economic \ndevelopment in rural communities. Our State also boasts some of the \nNation's most popular tourist destinations including the Badlands, the \nBlack Hills National Forest, the world's only Corn Palace, and some of \nthe best pheasant hunting in the country. Mount Rushmore in the Black \nHills also symbolizes democracy and enables all Americans to remember \nand celebrate our history. The Crazy Horse monument, which is still a \nwork in progress, honors the legendary Lakota warrior. South Dakota is \nalso home to nine Native American tribes, each having its own distinct \ncultures and traditions.\n  There is an awful lot to be proud of in our State, from the attitude \nwe have as individuals to what we have built during our 125 year \nhistory. Throughout this past year, South Dakotans have taken part in a \nnumber of activities to celebrate our State's history, heritage, and \nculture, and those celebrations will continue in the weeks ahead. I am \nhonored to play just a small role in this celebration by joining with \nmy colleague in offering this resolution, and I urge all of our \ncolleagues to join us in celebrating the birth of our State.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 566, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. Res. 566) celebrating the 125th anniversary of \n     the State of South Dakota.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I also wish to speak in support of S. 1507, \nthe Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act of 2013. I am a cosponsor of \nthis bipartisan legislation which passed the House of Representatives \nearlier this week.\n  This bill would codify that general welfare benefits provided to \ntribal members by Indian tribes--often in areas with high levels of \npoverty and unemployment where these benefits are much needed--are \nexempt from Federal taxation.\n  The bill would ensure parity between the tax treatment of benefits \nprovided by Indian tribes and those provided by State and local \ngovernments.\n  While the Internal Revenue Service has issued guidance on this issue, \nfurther action is needed to ensure that our tribal citizens are treated \nfairly with regard to taxation of certain tribal welfare benefits.\n  This bill establishes a tribal advisory committee to advise the \nSecretary of the Treasury on the taxation of tribal members.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment with support from the National \nCongress of American Indians and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  Tribes and tribal organizations across the country, including the \nGreat Plains Tribal Chairman Association and the Coalition of Large \nTribes representing the nine tribes in my home State of South Dakota, \nare urging us to move forward with this legislation.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that this legislation \nwould have a negligible impact on Federal revenue.\n  I hope before we adjourn that the Senate can pass by unanimous \nconsent this legislation that was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives earlier this week under suspension and that we will \nreaffirm our commitment to Indian Country.\n  I hope we move this legislation and move it quickly and clarify once \nand for all this important issue.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Domestic Violence Awareness Month\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, October--next month--is Domestic Violence \nAwareness Month. It is not expected that the Senate will be in session \nnext month and I would like to use this opportunity to visit just a \nmoment about domestic violence in an effort to create a greater \nawareness and to work to eliminate this plight among many families and \nmany individuals across the country.\n  Domestic violence is an issue that impacts way too many Americans. In \nfact, it affects so many homes, and yet it is something that is rarely \nspoken about publicly. Right now, because of actions of professional \nathletes, domestic violence is in the news and it is on our minds. But \nthis attention needs to continue when the sports writers quit writing \nand when the news reporters and camera crews quit covering and they \nmove on to the next story.\n\n[[Page S5771]]\n\n  Many Americans assume domestic violence doesn't occur in their \nneighborhood, it doesn't occur among their friends, but unfortunately \nthat is not the case. Domestic violence does not discriminate by race, \ngender, age group, education or social status. We can't stereotype, the \nway we often do, about domestic violence. In fact, it is not just a \nproblem for women; it is also a problem for children and men who are \noften victims.\n  In large communities, in small communities across the country and \nacross, unfortunately, my State of Kansas, too many Americans, too many \nKansans find themselves placed in danger by the very people who are \nsupposed to love and care for and protect them. Each year, more than 2 \nmillion women are victims of domestic violence across the country. In \nKansas alone, it is estimated that 1 in 10 adult women will suffer from \ndomestic abuse this year. These are damning statistics that make clear, \nwhether we realize it, someone we know is enduring physical and \npsychological abuse today, tomorrow, this week. We have a \nresponsibility to help the hopeless--those who are often too afraid to \nspeak out for themselves. I rise tonight to try to give voice to those \nwho are victims and to acknowledge professionals and volunteers who \nprovide care and the services those victims need.\n  On a single day last year, shelters and organizations in Kansas \nserved more than 720 victims, and similar organizations around the \ncountry served more than 66,000 victims each day.\n  I visited one of those organizations last year, the Kansas SAFEHOME. \nIt is a tremendous organization that serves the greater Kansas City \narea. SAFEHOME provides more than just a shelter for those needing a \nplace to live or to escape from abuse. They provide no-cost advocacy, \ncounseling, an inhouse attorney, and assistance in finding employment. \nThe agency also provides education in the community to prevent abuse.\n  Each year SAFEHOME helps thousands of women and children reestablish \ntheir lives without violence. The employees and volunteers there are \nmaking huge differences in the lives of many. I have often said on the \nSenate floor that what happens in Washington, DC, matters, but I know \nwe change the world one person, one soul at a time, and in this setting \nand in settings similar to it across Kansas and around the country, \nlives are being changed and improved.\n  Despite the important and the honorable and noble work that \norganizations such as SAFEHOME are performing, they are often faced \nwith uncertainty regarding the Federal support they will receive. The \ngood news is that last year Congress was able to move past politics and \npass legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.\n  I sponsored and voted for that legislation and in my view it provides \ncrucial, critical resources for victims of domestic violence and \nempowers our justice system to act on their behalf. Just as crucial, it \nworks to prevent abuse from occurring in the first place.\n  This legislation is having a real impact on the lives of Kansans \nbecause survivors now have access, for example, to legal services, \nthrough the Legal Assistance to Victims grant project, established in \n2012 by the Kansas Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence.\n  One survivor expressed how grateful she was for the program because, \nas she said, ``I didn't know what I would have done without it.'' \nWithout the assistance of this program, she may have had to go to court \nwithout legal representation, knowing that her perpetrator already had \nan attorney representing him. With that legal representation, her \nperpetrator was held accountable for his actions.\n  Throughout our country, more than one in three women still suffer \nfrom abuse during their lifetime, and domestic violence brings fear and \nhopelessness and depression into the lives of every victim. We should \nwork not only to end this violent crime, but we must also care for \nthose who are victims. By volunteering at a local shelter, speaking out \nwhen we become aware of domestic violence or making a donation to an \norganization that helps in those circumstances, every citizen--as I \nsaid, we could change the world one person at a time, and every citizen \ncan find a way to get involved and make a difference.\n  Now and throughout the year--not just now, not just next month, \nOctober is Domestic Violence Month--let us be mindful of the victims of \ndomestic violence and each of us do our part to break the cycle and \nbring hope to those who suffer and are in despair. Let us also use the \nconversations taking place now in the print in the papers and on the \nview of the television as an opportunity to speak out against any and \nall types of domestic abuse. Let's raise the awareness of this silent \nand devastating crime and bring about an end to all domestic violence.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide \nfor the preparation of career and technical education teachers; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, school districts across the nation are \nfacing serious shortages in high-quality career and technical \neducation, CTE, teachers. When CTE teachers have real-world experience \nin a related industry before entering the classroom, students not only \nbenefit from their hands-on knowledge, but also look to them as career \nrole models. Through grant in the Higher Education and Opportunity Act \nof 2008, many teacher residency partnerships already exist between \npostsecondary institutions and local schools to train prospective \neducators, but none are CTE focused.\n  This is why I am pleased to introduce with my colleagues, Senator \nBaldwin and Senator Portman, the Creating Quality Technical Educators \nAct, which would create a CTE teacher-training grant partnership to \ngive aspiring CTE teachers the preparation necessary to mirror their \nsuccess in the business world with that in the classroom. The Creating \nTechnical Education Act will foster CTE teacher training partnerships \nbetween high-needs secondary schools and postsecondary institutions to \ncreate a 1-year residency initiative for prospective teachers and \nincludes teacher mentorship for a minimum of 2 years.\n  This bipartisan bill amends the Higher Education Act and would give \naspiring CTE teachers the experience necessary to succeed in the \nclassroom,\n\n[[Page S5788]]\n\nwhere students can benefit from their work experience and credibility. \nThe Creating Quality Technical Educators Act would take a robust \nproactive approach to recruit and train high-quality CTE teachers. In \naddition to midcareer professionals in related technical fields, CTE \nteacher residencies would target candidates who are recent college \ngraduates or veterans or currently licensed teachers with a desire to \ntransition to a CTE focus.\n  I am pleased we are beginning to see a renaissance of interest in \ncareer and technical education, but we have to recruit and train \ntalented teachers to meet this rising demand for CTE. The Creating \nQuality Technical Educators Act will take an important step to ensure \nstudents in communities of all sizes have access to high-quality CTE \nteachers and career-training programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Markey, Mrs. Shaheen, \n        and Ms. Warren):\n  S. 2868. A bill to establish a statute of limitations for certain \nactions of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nextends the time period the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, \nwould have to seek civil monetary penalties for securities law \nviolations.\n  This legislation is necessary in light of the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Gabelli v. SEC in which the Court held that the 5 year \nclock to take action aginst wrongdoing starts when the fraud occurs, \nnot when it is discovered. In effect, Gabelli has made the SEC's job of \nprotecting investors even tougher by shortening the amount of time that \nthe SEC has to investigate and pursue securities law violations.\n  Financial fraud has evolved significantly over the years and now \ninvolves multiple parties, complex financial products, and elaborate \ntransactions that are executed in a variety of securities markets, both \ndomestic and foreign. As a result, many of the critical facts necessary \nto initiate an action may go undetected for years. Securities law \nviolators may simply run out the clock, now with greater ease in the \naftermath of Gabelli.\n  Couple this with the fact that while we have given the SEC even \ngreater responsibilities, Congress, despite my ongoing efforts to urge \notherwise, has not provided the agency with all the resources necessary \nto carry out its duties. SEC Chair White recently testified before the \nBanking Committee that ``if the SEC does not receive sufficient \nadditional resources, the agency will be unable to fully build out its \ntechnology and hire the industry experts and other staff needed to \noversee and police our areas of responsibility, especially in light of \nthe expanding size and complexity of our overall regulatory space.''\n  To give just one example of the impact of this resource shortfall, \nChair White also testified that ``in 2004, the SEC had 19 examiners per \ntrillion dollars in investment adviser assets under management. Today, \nwe have only 8.''\n  This legislation would address these challenges by giving the SEC the \nbreathing room it needs to better police our markets and protect \ninvestors. Specifically, this bill extends the time period the SEC has \nto seek civil monetary penalties from five years to ten years, thereby \nstrengthening the integrity of our markets, better protecting public \ninvestors, and empowering the SEC to investigate and pursue more \nsecurities law violators, particularly those most sophisticated at \nevading detection.\n  In so doing, the bill would align the SEC's statute of limitations \nwith the limitations period applicable to complex civil financial fraud \nactions initiated pursuant to the Financial Institutions Reform, \nRecovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, FIRREA. For over 2 decades, the \nDepartment of Justice has benefited from FIRREA, which allows the DOJ \nto seek civil penalties within a 10-year time period against persons \nwho have committed fraud against financial institutions. The SEC, which \npursues similarly complex financial fraud cases, should have the same \ntime necessary to bring wrongdoers that violate the securities laws to \njustice.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2880. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax incentive to individuals teaching in elementary and secondary \nschools located in rural or high unemployment areas and to individuals \nwho achieve certification from the National Board for Professional \nTeaching Standards, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, I rise to reintroduce the \nIncentives to Educate American Children, or I TEACH, Act of 2014. With \nteacher retention rates on a steady decline nationwide, it is my hope \nthat this legislation will encourage our best and brightest teachers to \nremain in the classroom.\n  In the past two decades, the number of years of experience for the \naverage teacher has decreased from 15 years to 5 years. Almost half of \nour education workforce today has less than ten years of experience. \nThis is partly because teachers continue to be paid less than those \nemployed in other fields, earning approximately 79 percent of the \naverage wage of other workers with a bachelor's degree. In addition, \ntheir salaries have remained static since 2009, with the average \nstarting salary for a new teacher estimated at just $36,141. At the \nsame time, college debt levels continue to increase. The average \nstudent graduating in 2014 had $33,000 worth of student debt, making it \ndifficult for young, eager graduates to pursue a career in teaching \nwhile paying down student loans and other living expenses.\n  No dedicated young person should have to decide that they simply \ncannot ``afford'' to be a teacher, but this happens. If passed, the I \nTEACH Act would invest in our most critical educators by providing a \n$1,000 refundable tax credit to teachers serving in rural or high \npoverty schools. It would also provide every teacher, regardless of \nschool or district, the chance to earn a $1,000 refundable tax credit \nif they receive accreditation from the National Board for Professional \nTeaching Standards. This means that a National Board Teacher in a rural \nor high poverty school would be eligible to receive $2,000 in \nrefundable tax credits.\n  In doing so, the I TEACH Act will provide meaningful incentives to \nteachers willing to serve in rural or high poverty schools, as well as \nrewarding quality teachers for staying in the classroom and continuing \ntheir professional development by earning National Board certification. \nToday, the majority of States see the value in this effort, providing \nsome type of financial incentive to National Board certified teachers, \nand this refundable tax credit will work in tandem with those efforts. \nMy home State of West Virginia, for example, offers a $3,500 bonus for \nNational Board teachers. If I TEACH is enacted, a National Board \nteacher in my State would receive a nearly 12 percent bonus. That is a \nclear sign of appreciation for their hard work and a meaningful \nincentive to continue teaching.\n  Our teachers are among the most important members of our society. \nThey inspire and educate our children, preparing the next generation \nfor success. They deserve our respect and full support, and that is why \nI urge my colleagues to work with me to enact I TEACH and invest in our \nchildren's education.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 2882. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ncertain individuals a credit against income tax for contributions to \n529 plans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I am proud to offer legislation \nthat will make it easier for American families to pay for their child's \nhigher education. This legislation is the Enhanced 529-Setting Aside \nfor a Valuable Education, or Enhanced 529-SAVE, Act. This measure will \nmake the 529 college savings plans more accessible to lower and middle-\nincome families.\n  A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings plan that is designed to \nencourage Americans to save for future college costs. 529 plans can be \nsponsored by states, state agencies, or educational institutions and \nthey are authorized by Section 529 of the Internal Revenue\n\n[[Page S5789]]\n\nCode. I championed efforts to ensure that 529 plans would be 100 \npercent tax-free at the Federal level. In 2001, I authored the Setting \nAside for Valuable Education, or SAVE, Act, which was included in a tax \npackage that became law. In 2006, I helped make the tax benefits under \nthese accounts permanent.\n  The Enhanced 529-SAVE Act will make 529 plans more accessible by \nencouraging employers to contribute to an employee's 529 plan. My bill \nwould exclude up to $600 of an employer's contribution from an \nemployee's gross income. This will help families and individuals save \nmore for higher education expenses.\n  The Enhanced 529-SAVE Act will also create an incentive for lower-\nincome families and individuals to save money for college by allowing \nthe individual that contributes to the 529 plan to qualify for the \nSaver's Credit, which is an income-based, non-refundable tax credit up \nto $4,000.\n  The Enhanced 529-SAVE Act is similar to H.R. 529, introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives by Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins of Kansas. I \nwant to commend her for her leadership on this important issue.

A bill to expand access to transportation services for \nindividuals with disabilities; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, 24 years ago, Congress passed the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. I will never forget the day, July 26, \n1990, the ADA was signed into law. It was one of the proudest days of \nmy legislative career.\n  The ADA set forth four great goals for individuals with \ndisabilities--equality of opportunity, full participation, independent \nliving, and economic self-sufficiency. In many ways, we have been \nsuccessful in making progress toward these goals. We have increased the \naccessibility of our buildings, our streets, even our parks, beaches \nand recreation areas. We have made our books and TVs, phones, \ncomputers, and other technology more accessible. And for many Americans \nwith disabilities, our workplaces have become increasingly more open \nand accessible.\n  America is far more inclusive, today, for individuals with \ndisabilities. But our work is still far from complete.\n  According to new data released this week, almost 30 percent of people \nwith disabilities are living in poverty, and fewer than one in three \nindividuals with a disability participate in the workforce. This is \nfurther evidence that we are far from realizing the ADA's goal of \neconomic self-sufficiency for all people with disabilities.\n  Today, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which I \nchair, released a report titled ``Fulfilling the Promise: Overcoming \nPersistent Barriers to Economic Self-Sufficiency for People with \nDisabilities.'' In our report, we detail many of the barriers that \nadversely impact the economic well-being of individuals with \ndisabilities--including the lack of accessible transportation and the \nlack of accessible housing. These barriers don't only affect \nindividuals with disabilities who are living in poverty; they also \nimpact individuals with disabilities who are striving to reach the \nAmerican dream as members of the middle class.\n  That is why, today, I am introducing three bills that I believe will \nbegin to address these barriers to individuals with disabilities, S. \n2887, S. 2888, and S. 2889. The first bill, the Universal Home Design \nAct, will increase the availability of accessible housing for \nindividuals with disabilities. The second, the Accessible \nTransportation for All Act, will increase the availability of \naccessible passenger cars and taxis. The third, the Exercise and \nFitness for All Act, will increase the availability of exercise and \nfitness equipment that is accessible to individuals with disabilities, \nwhich will help individuals with disabilities maintain and improve \ntheir health through appropriate physical activity.\n  I am confident that these three bills, along with the Community \nIntegration Act, and the recently passed Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act, will help provide the framework for a future of \ncontinued opportunities, inclusion and advancement for individuals with \ndisabilities in America. I urge my Senate colleagues to support these \nimportant bills.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2887\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to direct the \nSecretary of Transportation to establish an innovation in surface \ntransportation program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with Senate \ncolleagues the Innovation in Surface Transportation Act, which will \nspur economic development and include more local stakeholders in \ntransportation projects. I am proud to join with Senators Wicker, \nBegich, Cochran, and Casey to sponsor this important bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  As a former Mayor, I understand local leaders are often in the best \nposition to make sound, cost-effective investment decisions to boost \nthe local economy. Today, our cities, towns and suburbs are not getting \nthe transportation investments they need to remain competitive and \nattract the kind of investment needed to create jobs and put more \npeople to work.\n  This legislation establishes a statewide program of competitive \ngrants to local communities overseen by a diverse selection panel, \nincluding state Departments of Transportation, local jurisdictions, \nport authorities, and representatives from air quality and safety \norganizations. This innovative proposal would encourage communities to \ncompete against their peers, and stretch to make the most of every \nproject and every dollar. Recognizing each state and region has \ndifferent transportation needs, the panel would create criteria \nspecific to their State's needs, such as improving the movement of \nfreight, or connecting low-income communities to jobs. The bill would \nalso require a metric-based, objective, fully transparent process based \noff critical criteria, such as return on investment, job creation, and \nreducing environmental impacts.\n  The most cost-effective and economically important projects will rise \nto the top, which will help communities across the country meet the \ngreat challenge of maintaining aging infrastructure and preparing for \nfuture growth with constrained funding.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to build further support \nfor this legislation and continue working to provide long-term \ntransportation investment that strengthens communities across the \nnation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Nelson):\n\n[[Page S5795]]\n\n  S. 2896. A bill to amend title 31, United States Code, to adjust for \ninflation the amount that is exempt from administrative offsets by the \nDepartment of Education for defaulted student loans; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today Senator Nelson and I are \nintroducing legislation to limit the amount the Federal Government can \ngarnish from Social Security benefits for unpaid student loan debt. Our \nbill would adjust the current $750 garnishment floor for inflation and \nindex it going forward, to make sure that garnishments do not force \nseniors into poverty.\n  According to a recent study by the Government Accountability Office, \nGAO, the number of borrowers who have experienced garnishments to \nSocial Security retirement, survivor, or disability benefits to repay \nstudent loans has increased over time. In 2001, about 31,000 Social \nSecurity beneficiaries had part of their benefits garnished to pay \ndefaulted student loans. In 2013, this number had grown to \napproximately 155,000 beneficiaries, an increase of 400 percent.\n  The Debt Collection Improvement Act limits the amount the federal \ngovernment can garnish from monthly Federal benefits. In 1998, this \namount was set at $750 per month, and since then, it has not been \nraised or adjusted for inflation. This means that the federal \ngovernment can garnish Social Security benefits so long as the \nbeneficiary is not left with less than $750 per month. Fifteen years \nago, this was above the poverty line, but as a result of inflation, the \n$750 limit now represents just 81 percent of the poverty threshold for \na single adult 65 or older.\n  GAO found that if the garnishment limit had been indexed to match the \nrate of increase in the poverty threshold, in 2013, 68 percent of all \nborrowers whose Social Security benefits were garnished for Federal \nstudent loan debt would have kept their entire benefit. This means that \nin more than 2/3 of all cases involving the garnishment of Social \nSecurity benefits for unpaid student loan debt, the senior was forced \ninto poverty. Indexing the floor to keep up with cost of living would \nkeep this from happening.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to protect the \nfinancial security of seniors facing garnishment for unpaid student \nloan debt.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, today I announce my support of the Social \nSecurity Garnishment Modernization Act. I once again want to thank and \ncommend Senator Collins, my co-sponsor on this legislation and co-\nleader on the Senate Special Committee on Aging. This is the fifth bill \nI have cosponsored with Senator Collins as a direct result of a hearing \nwe have held in the Aging Committee.\n  Earlier this month, our Committee examined the growing problem of \nseniors facing student loan debt in retirement. A senior with student \nloan debt who reaches the age of 65 has a one in four chance of being \nin default on that loan. If a senior still has student loan debt by the \ntime he reaches 75, there's a better chance than not that the senior is \nin default on those loans.\n  The consequences for being in default on those loans in retirement \ncan be devastating. The Department of Education can direct the Treasury \nDepartment to garnish a substantial portion of a senior's monthly \nSocial Security payment. Seniors can be left with just $750 a month, \nwell below the official monthly poverty threshold of $931. This figure \nhas not been updated since the late 1990s. This bill would update the \namount of money protected from garnishment and index it for inflation \ngoing forward so that a senior today would get to keep $1,072 a month \neven if he was in default on his student loans.\n  This bill could help people like 72-year-old Janet Lee Dupree of \nCitra, FL, whose Social Security check was garnished for a $3,000 loan \nshe took out in the early 1970s. With interest and fees, that loan \nballooned to $15,000, which means that she will likely be in debt the \nrest of her life. If this bill passed, she would get to keep more of \nher hard-earned Social Security benefits that she needs to get by and \npay for health care costs associated with two chronic and debilitating \ndiseases.\n  We need to fix this problem soon because the next wave of retirees is \ncoming, and a substantial number of them are still carrying student \nloan debt. Nearly 18 million people ages 50 to 64 owe on their student \nloans, and one in five of those people are already in default, meaning \nthey could face garnishment once they start taking Social Security \nbenefits. We need to protect today's retirees and tomorrow's retirees \nso that they have enough money to live with dignity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 2906. A bill to provide for the treatment and extension of \ntemporary financing of short-time compensation programs; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators Harkin and \nWhitehouse in introducing the Layoff Prevention Extension Act of 2014. \nThis bill would extend the financing and grant provisions for the work \nsharing initiative I authored and worked to include as part of the \nMiddle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. Since becoming \nlaw, work sharing has helped save over 110,000 jobs, including 1,200 \njobs in my State of Rhode Island, according to the Department of Labor. \nIt has saved States $225 million by reimbursing them for work sharing \nbenefits they paid out to workers--benefits that helped keep people on \nthe job as employees and employers elected to reduce hours across the \nboard instead of laying workers off.\n  Before my bill became law only a handful of States had work sharing \nprograms. By tilting the incentives away from layoffs and toward work \nsharing a majority of states now have laws on their books. However, the \n100 percent Federal financing of these work sharing benefits will \nexpire in the summer of 2015 and the $100 million in implementation \ngrants by the end of this year. My bill would extend both of these \ndeadlines by one year so States with existing work sharing programs and \nthose that are looking to enact a program can qualify for Federal \nsupport.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this bill to keep American \nworkers on the job and encourage more States to enact work sharing \nprograms that enjoy broad support in States that have adopted them and \neconomists on both sides of the spectrum.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2908. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \neligibility for the refundable credit for coverage under a qualified \nhealth plan, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Affordable Care Act made great \nstrides in improving access to health insurance for millions of \nAmericans. Unfortunately, especially in high-cost geographic areas, \nsome in the middle class are facing high insurance premiums.\n  If you make a penny over $45,960 you lose all Federal assistance for \npurchasing health insurance through the new exchanges. This is \nespecially hard for individuals between the ages of 50 and 64, who are \nfacing higher premiums but do not yet qualify for Medicare.\n  I have received thousands of calls and emails about access to health \ninsurance. The high costs are a real problem. For example, Dave, one of \nmy constituents from Livermore, CA, wrote to me to share how this \npolicy has affected him. Dave is 60 and self-employed, making $65,000 \nper year. He signed up for a plan through the new health insurance \nexchange to cover both himself and his wife. If they made just $3,000 \nless per year they would have qualified for a subsidy and paid $491 for \nthe second lowest cost silver plan. Since they are just over the \nthreshold, the full cost of this plan is $1552. They decided to go with \nless robust coverage and still pay $1147 for a bronze plan. Under this \nlegislation, Dave and his wife could get a better plan for less than \nhalf of what they pay now.\n  Another constituent, Dan, lives in Riverside, CA, and is 62 years \nold. He wrote to me and explained that his pension is just barely too \nhigh to receive help with his health insurance premiums and that he \njust can't afford it. Currently, the second lowest cost silver plan for \nDan and his wife would be $1141 per month. Under this legislation, they \nwould be able to afford health insurance.\n  The way the law is currently designed, there is a steep subsidy \ncliff.\n\n[[Page S5796]]\n\nThis should gradually reduce, in a way that provides some help for more \nmiddle-income Americans so they pay no more than 9.5 percent their \nincome in health insurance premiums.\n  The Affordable Health Insurance for the Middle Class Act would do \njust that. This legislation extends the current subsidy up to 600 \npercent of the Federal poverty level, which is $68,940 for an \nindividual. As an individual makes more, their subsidy goes down.\n  I am particularly concerned about older individuals who need medical \ncare but face premiums they simply cannot afford. In California, it is \nestimated that approximately 360,600 individuals between the ages of \n50-64 who do not qualify for Medicaid or have employer-based coverage \nwould see premiums greater than 9.5 percent of their income. Nearly \n98,000 of these are expected to remain uninsured due to the cost. This \nis a simple fix to improve the law that will further increase access to \ncoverage.\n  The bill is paid for by a nominal increase in the federal cigarette \ntax, which amounts to five cents per pack.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Affordable Health \nInsurance for the Middle Class Act. It is commonsense to have a gradual \ndecline in the federal assistance for health insurance and help those \nwho are just out of reach of affording it on their own.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5796-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 561--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT RECENTLY \n      PROPOSED MEASURES THAT WILL REDUCE TRANSPARENCY AND PUBLIC \nPARTICIPATION AT THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE SUPERVISORS \n (IAIS) SHOULD BE DISAPPROVED BY UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVES TO THE \n                                  IAIS\n\n  Mr. HELLER (for himself and Mr. Tester) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today, I wish to bring awareness to the \ngrowing problem of falls amongst our seniors, the fastest-growing \npopulation in the United States. Each year, one out of every three \nolder Americans over age 65 falls, resulting in more than 2,400,000 \nolder hospital emergency department visits and more than 22,900 deaths \nresulting from injuries sustained in unintentional falls. The costs \nassociated with these falls are equally alarming: in 2010, the direct \nmedical cost of fall-related injuries for older adults was \n$30,000,000,000. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nestimate that if the rate of falls does not decrease, the annual cost \nof injuries resulting from falls will reach an estimated \n$67,700,000,000 by 2020.\n  These staggering numbers are alarming, and we must work to reduce the \nincidence of falls among older adults by utilizing cost-effective \nstrategies to improve balance and strength through exercise programs, \nimprove comprehensive clinical assessments, and reduce hazards in \nseniors' homes. That is why today I have put forth this Resolution to \ndesignate September 23, 2014, as National Falls Prevention Awareness \nDay. I thank my colleagues, Senator Collins, my partner on the Senate \nSpecial Committee on Aging, and Senators Mikulski and Sanders for \njoining with me in support of National Falls Prevention Awareness Day. \nNational Falls Prevention Awareness Day seeks to raise awareness and \nencourage the prevention of falls among older adults. The 72 member \norganizations of the Falls Free Coalition and the falls prevention \ncoalitions in 42 States and the District of Columbia have worked \ntirelessly to increase education and awareness about preventing falls \namong older Americans. We will continue to foster and encourage these \ncoalitions and ensure the safety and independence of our older adults \nas they age in their homes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5798-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5798-S5799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 570--DESIGNATING OCTOBER 17, 2014, AS ``NATIONAL \n                     ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLE DAY''\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN (for himself, Mr. Burr, Mr. Rockefeller, Ms. Mikulski,\n\n[[Page S5799]]\n\nand Mr. Brown) submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, as Members of Congress prepare to head back \nto their home States, it is important to note that the 113th Congress \ndoes not end this week, or for that matter, on November 4. We still \nhave a significant amount of unfinished business that must be resolved \nbefore the year's end, and the American people expect and deserve our \ncommitment to getting that work done. I strongly support Majority \nLeader Reid's decision to reconvene the Senate shortly after the \nelections so that we can complete work on a number of bipartisan bills \nthat can and should be enacted this year. We were sent to the Senate by \nour constituents to do the work of the American people, and those \nresponsibilities will not diminish after the election--no matter what \nthe results.\n  When the Senate returns in November, I will continue to urge swift \nconsideration and passage of the USA FREEDOM Act of 2014, S.2685. This \nis a bipartisan bill that makes important reforms to the government's \nsurveillance authorities, while providing the intelligence community \nthe operational flexibility it needs to keep our country safe. That is \nwhy the bill is supported not only by the Director of National \nIntelligence and the Attorney General but also by a broad coalition of \nprivacy and civil liberties groups, the technology industry, and \nMembers of Congress from across the political spectrum. There is no \nexcuse for not considering it in November. If Senators want to vote \nagainst the bill, they have every right to do so, but the American \npublic deserves to know where we stand on the issue of the bulk \ncollection of innocent Americans' phone records, and the intelligence \ncommunity deserves some measure of predictability and certainty.\n  I also hope that the Senate will, without further delay, take up and \npass the Justice for All Reauthorization Act, S.822, and the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program Reauthorization Act of 2013, \nS. 933. Both of these bills are noncontroversial and were reported with \noverwhelming support by the Judiciary Committee. The Justice for All \nReauthorization Act strengthens the rights of crime victims and \nimproves access to postconviction DNA testing to protect the innocent \nand improve safety in our communities. It is a common sense bill that \nimproves the justice system for everyone involved. That is why Senator \nCornyn and Senator McConnell are both cosponsors of the bill and why it \nhas the support of the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Grassley. Despite this support from the key Republican \nleadership in the Senate, legislation to reauthorize the Justice for \nAll Act--originally signed into law by President George W. Bush--is \nbeing blocked on the Republican side. Such obstructionism is \nunwarranted, and the Senate should at least be allowed to bring this \nbill up for a vote.\n  Republican obstruction of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant \nProgram Reauthorization Act is similarly unwarranted and must stop. \nJust this week, we remembered and mourned the senseless killing of 12 \npeople 1 year ago at the Navy Yard, just a few blocks from the Capitol. \nSuch horrifying acts of violence have become far too common, and each \nserves as a painful reminder of the perils faced by law enforcement \nevery day. During the brutal firefight at the Navy Yard, a Metropolitan \nPolice Department officer was struck in the chest. His bulletproof vest \nstopped the bullet. The officer was then able to return fire and take \ndown the gunman, finally bringing an end to the violence.\n  Members of Congress often speak passionately about the need to stand \nwith law enforcement. It would seem beyond dispute, then, that no \nofficer should have to serve without protective vests. This is why \nCongress has historically acted in unison to support the Bulletproof \nVest Partnership Grant program, which has enabled over 13,000 law \nenforcement agencies to purchase over 1 million vests. Protective vests \nare credited with saving the lives of more than 3,000 law enforcement \nofficers since 1987. Today, every Democratic Senator stands ready to \nreauthorize this lifesaving program. Yet a few Senate Republicans are \nblocking it. It is past time for our actions to match our rhetoric. If \nRepublicans claim to stand with law enforcement, then surely they \nshould stand with them when it matters most. I urge all Senators to \nhelp pass this bill as soon as we return.\n  There are several additional priorities of law enforcement that have \nbipartisan support and should receive consideration in the remaining \nweeks of the year. This morning, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nfavorably reported the Second Chance Reauthorization Act. I thank the \nbroad bipartisan list of cosponsors for working with me to reduce \nrecidivism and make our communities safer with this legislation. \nCommunities of faith are calling on the Senate to move forward and pass \nthis important bill and I hope we will hear their call.\n  This Congress we also have an opportunity to reduce dangerous prison \novercrowding while actually improving\n\n[[Page S5846]]\n\npublic safety. The relentless growth of our Federal prison population \nthreatens not only the safety of prison staff and inmates but also the \nbudgets of the very law enforcement programs that keep us safe. This \ngrowth is driven by inflexible and unfair drug mandatory minimums--a \nproblem that we in Congress created, and only we can fix. The \nbipartisan Smarter Sentencing Act would modestly reduce some nonviolent \ndrug mandatory minimums and help to preserve essential funding for law \nenforcement agencies and victim services. This bill would save the \ngovernment money, a fact confirmed by the Congressional Budget Office \njust this week, and it deserves the Senate's full attention.\n  By the end of the year, the Senate must consider and pass S. 2454, \nthe Satellite Television Access Reauthorization Act, STELA. This law \nprovides satellite television carriers with the necessary rights to \nretransmit distant television programming to consumers. If Congress \ndoes not act by the end of the year to reauthorize the distant signal \nlicense, approximately 1.5 million consumers will lose access to the \nbroadcast television programming that they currently receive. This is \nparticularly important in rural areas like Vermont, where many \nAmericans rely on satellite for their television providers. Congress \nshould act responsibly and prevent serious disruption to these \nconsumers.\n  Congress also should pass reforms to the Electronic Communications \nPrivacy Act, ECPA, to bring our privacy laws into the 21st century. The \nLeahy-Lee ECPA Reform Act updates our digital privacy laws to keep pace \nwith new technologies, protect civil liberties, and provide guidance to \nlaw enforcement. Congress should act swiftly to pass this bill.\n  Finally, the Senate is not the only Chamber that needs to get right \nback to work after the election. I have spoken at length before about \nthe need for the House to allow a vote on the Senate-passed immigration \nbill. I hope that once they return to Washington, the House Republican \nleadership will finally put election year politicking and pandering \naside and simply allow a vote on S. 744, the Border Security, Economic \nOpportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act. That bill passed the \nSenate more than a year ago on a strong bipartisan vote, and the urgent \nneed to pass this practical legislative fix for our broken immigration \nsystem increases with every passing day. It would immediately spur our \neconomy and take away the pressing need for the President to act \nthrough Executive order.\n  The House should also consider and pass S. 42, the Criminal Antitrust \nAnti-Retaliation Act of 2013, which passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent almost a year ago. Senator Grassley and I came together to \ndraft the bipartisan Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act to improve \nthe enforcement of our Nation's antitrust laws and extend whistleblower \nprotections to employees who report criminal violations of the \nantitrust laws. These include violations that are particularly harmful \nto consumers, such a price fixing. Again, this is a noncontroversial, \nbipartisan bill that can and should be passed overwhelmingly. There is \nno reason--political or otherwise--for the House of Representatives to \ndelay its enactment.\n  After the upcoming elections, I plan to return to Washington to get \nback to the work of the people. That is why the voters of Vermont \nelected me, and that is what I swore an oath to do. As chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, I intend to continue our work on nominations and \noversight, as well as the legislative business pending before the \nCommittee. I hope that the full Senate and the House will similarly \npress forward without delay to complete work on the array of bipartisan \nbills that are ripe for consideration and passage. There is simply no \nreason to delay or obstruct action on these bills, and no reason to \nfurther exacerbate the perception held by many Americans that Congress \ncannot work together to accomplish anything. I know that we can work \ntogether to pass these bills, but it will require the cooperation and \ncommitment of all Senators. I know that Vermonters--and all Americans--\nare counting on us to get the work done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5846-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5846-S5847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the Senate prepares to go into recess, \nSenate Republicans are refusing to allow confirmation votes on the more \nthan 20 judicial nominees who will now be stuck in limbo for months. \nThere is no good reason why the Senate cannot confirm these nominees \nbefore the recess other than wholesale obstruction of a co-equal branch \nof government's nominees.\n  The Senate Republicans' baseless obstruction includes blocking from \nconsideration nominations made to their home States. Right now, there \nare five nominations pending to fill judicial emergency vacancies in \nKentucky and Georgia, which have gone unfilled for years. The \nRepublican Senators from these States have come out in strong support \nfor the nominees from their respective States. Yet the Republican \nleadership refuses to agree to schedule votes on these or any other \nnominations. This is simply delay for delay's sake.\n  Currently on the Senate Executive Calendar are qualified nominees to \nfill Federal trial court vacancies in Kentucky, Georgia, the District \nof Columbia, Wisconsin, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, \nConnecticut, and Missouri. All but two of the nominees were reported by \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support. I wonder what \nthe constituents of these States think is causing this delay? I can \nassure you it is not Senate Democrats.\n  This Republican pattern of refusing to confirm noncontroversial, \nconsensus nominees has gone on for the duration of this Presidency. I \nhave sought to remind my fellow Senators that their refusal to confirm \nthese nominations prior to an extended recess is an unfortunate \ndeparture from Senate tradition. Time and again I have urged Senate \nRepublicans to stop their obstructive practices and delay tactics. And \nonce again, I am disappointed to see partisanship and senseless \nobstruction continue to keep the Senate from fulfilling its \nconstitutional duty of advice and consent.\n  It is true that since the beginning of this year we have reduced the \nvacancies on our Federal courts from 92 to 59, but no Senator should \nbelieve that our work is done. Even if we were to confirm the more than \n20 judicial nominees currently pending on the Senate floor, the Federal \njudiciary remains significantly understaffed. The Judicial Conference \nhas identified the need for 91 new judgeships in some of America's \njudicial districts and circuits with the highest caseloads. Last year, \nSenator Coons and I introduced the Federal Judgeship Act of 2013 to \nenact these recommendations into law. The timely administration of \njustice should not be a partisan issue. It is an issue that affects all \nAmericans, and the Senate should take it seriously by passing this \nbill.\n  The recommendations of the Judicial Conference underscore the need \nfor the Senate to fulfill its obligations to the Federal judiciary and \nthe American people. I have heard some Republican Senators claim the \nopposite by citing the total number of judicial confirmation under this \nPresident. It is true that the Senate has now confirmed 278 of \nPresident Obama's circuit, district, and U.S. Court of International \nTrade nominees, compared to 254 confirmations at the same point in the \nlast administration. Yet these numbers are meaningless without \nproviding their proper context. These confirmations were sorely needed. \nThere remain 59 vacancies on the Federal bench--far more than the 45 \nvacancies at this point during the Bush administration. There are an \nadditional 25 announced future judicial vacancies on our Federal courts \nthat will also need to be filled in the coming months. If you care \nabout providing our co-equal branch of government with the resources it \nneeds to serve its constitutional role, then it is important to look at \nthe number of vacancies that still exist and how long some of them have \nremained empty.\n  Vacancies remain high not because of a failure of Senate Democrats or \nPresident Obama to make judicial confirmations a priority. These \nvacancies persist because of the endless obstruction of partisan \nRepublicans who take every opportunity they can to shut down the \nimportant work of the Senate. Last year, no longer content to block \nindividual judges, Senate Republicans attempted a wholesale filibuster \nof three\n\n[[Page S5847]]\n\nnominees to the D.C. Circuit, without even considering their \nqualifications. Then, instead of confirming the consensus judicial \nnominees pending on the Executive Calendar prior to the end of the \ncongressional session, Republicans forced the President to renominate \neach nominee and for the Senate Judiciary Committee to report them \nagain this year.\n  In 2014, Senate Republicans have proceeded to filibuster each and \nevery judicial nominee. The Senate has taken 62 cloture votes on \njudicial nominations so far this year, amounting to well over 400 \nwasted hours that the Senate should have been spending considering \nlegislation to help the American people. Never before has the Senate \nseen the systematic filibuster of every judicial nominee or such unfair \ntreatment of qualified, consensus nominees.\n  The Senate should act quickly to confirm the judicial nominees \npending on the Senate floor. Because Republican obstruction will \nprevent us from finishing our work before the elections, we must return \nto session as soon as possible after the elections in November to \ncomplete our important work. The American people deserve courts capable \nof providing access to swift justice, not empty courtrooms and delays.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5847-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO JEANNE TESSIERI AND DEBBIE HALVERSON\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to recognize two long-serving members \nof the Senate Sergeant at Arms Office, Jeanne Tessieri and Debbie \nHalverson, who are retiring in October of this year.\n  Since 1980, Jeanne has served as the Sergeant at Arms' State Office \nLiaison. She runs a small--but highly effective--office that impacts \nevery Senator in this body. As Senators, we are privileged to represent \nthe constituents of our home States, and it is imperative that the \nindividuals we represent have a place to bring their thoughts and \nconcerns. Under the law, each Senator is authorized to maintain office \nspace in our respective States, but it is subject to strict \nregulations. Jeanne, in her role as the State Office Liaison, became a \nvital resource for all Senators. She worked to ensure that every \nState--big or small--had constituent service space that not only \nfulfilled the needs of the public, but also adhered to regulation.\n  Jeanne has guided us in selecting and arranging for the lease \nagreements for each one of our State offices, and there are currently \nmore than 450 such offices throughout the 50 States. She literally \nwrote the book detailing the ins and outs of obtaining and maintaining \na State office that meets the strict requirements for office spaces and \nexpenses for furnishings.\n  We are grateful for Jeanne's steady, confident assistance through the \nyears. Should a problem arise, Jeanne has always been the first person \nto call and offer assistance to our State offices. She knows how to \nmarshal resources to help the offices address any issue that comes up.\n  Debbie Halverson has been Jeanne's very capable assistant for the \npast 31 years. Many of us that know her also knew her father, Senate \nChaplain Richard Halverson. Her departure in October will mark the end \nof a wonderful era of service to the Senate for the Halverson family. I \ncommend Debbie's years of dedication to her work and this body.\n  I appreciate the combined 65 years of faithful service Jeanne and \nDebbie provided the United States Senate. I wish them the best in their \nfuture endeavors and congratulate them both on their well-deserved \nretirements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5847-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATING MAYOR ROBERT A. CASHELL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and thank my friend, \nMayor Robert A. Cashell, Sr., of Reno, for his more than three decades \nof public service in Nevada. After serving as the mayor of Reno for 12 \nyears, Mayor Cashell will be retiring on November 12, 2014. I am \ngrateful for his dedication and commitment to the people of Reno and to \nthe State of Nevada.\n  Over the past 35 years, Mayor Cashell has worked at nearly every \nlevel of State and local government. Beginning with his election to the \nUniversity of Nevada Board of Regents in 1979, Bob proved himself to be \na strong leader with a keen ability to listen and understand the needs \nof those he served. Renoites and Nevadans quickly came to rely on Bob's \nleadership and ultimately elected him as Lieutenant Governor of the \nState. A skilled businessman, Bob understood the need for a coordinated \nState effort to spur economic development. As Lieutenant Governor, Bob \nCashell helped create the Nevada Commission on Economic Development and \nthe Commission on Tourism. He later went on to chair both of these \nvitally important State commissions.\n  First elected as Mayor of Reno in 2002, Mayor Cashell was \nsubsequently re-elected in 2006 and 2010. During his tenure, Mayor \nCashell once again displayed his business acumen, helping transform \nReno into a hub of innovation, spurring investment from some of \nAmerica's most prestigious corporations. Mayor Cashell also spearheaded \nthe continued revitalization of downtown Reno, making it a destination \nfor special events, and creating a pedestrian and family-friendly \natmosphere.\n  As mayor, Bob Cashell met some of Reno's most difficult social issues \nhead on. He refused to shy away from the issue of poverty, instead \ndeveloping programs to help those hardest hit by the Great Recession. \nMayor Cashell was the driving force behind the creation of the \nCommunity Assistance Center, which houses multiple services, including \nfree food and social services, for the city's homeless and needy.\n  In every role he has assumed, Mayor Cashell has made Nevada a better \nplace to live. His work as mayor of the City of Reno will be dearly \nmissed, but I have no doubt that Mayor Cashell will find some way to \ncontinue serving the people of Nevada. Although he is retiring from \noffice, Mayor Cashell will never retire from helping others.\n  I wish Bob and his wife Nancy Parker Cashell all the best as they \nbegin this new chapter of their lives. I thank Nancy, their 4 children \nand 9 grandchildren for sharing Bob with Nevada. Our State is a better \nplace because of Mayor Bob Cashell's many years of exemplary service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5847-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5847-S5848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MAYOR NAN GORMAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an exemplary \npublic servant from my home State of Kentucky. Nan Gorman who is \ncurrently serving as the mayor of the City of Hazard will retire this \nyear upon completing her term of office.\n  Mayor Gorman was born in Memphis, TN, but moved to Hazard shortly \nafter. She grew up in hard times, with the Nation reeling from the \neffects of a worldwide depression. Though the odds may have been \nstacked against her, she graduated from the University of Cincinnati \nand the Parson School of Design in New York and subsequently traveled \nthe world on a tour of self-education.\n  Nan experienced so much of the world in her travels, but she saw \nnothing that would prevent her from returning to her ``Old Kentucky \nHome.'' Back in Hazard, she married her high-school sweetheart, Bill, \nwho was elected mayor of Hazard in 1978 and served in that capacity \nuntil his death 35 years later.\n  Bill Gorman was a beloved member of the Hazard community. When he \ndied in October of 2010, however, Nan was appointed to serve as interim \nmayor and the town did not skip a beat. Nan performed so well in her \ninterim role that she was voted into office by a 3-1 margin in the next \nelection.\n  Although Mayor Gorman will step down at the end of her term, her love \nfor the City of Hazard has not decreased in the slightest degree, and \nshe is planning on running for one of the city's four commissioner \nseats.\n  Nan Gorman's dedication to public service and her community set a \nshining example for us all, and I ask that my Senate colleagues join me \nin recognizing her illustrious career.\n  Mr. President, though I admittedly possess a strong bias towards the \nauthor, who happens to be my wife, Secretary Elaine Chao, Politico \npublished what I found to be an exceptional article on Mayor Gorman \nlast year. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5848]]\n\n                     [From Politico, Nov. 17, 2013]\n\n                    Embracing Her Old Kentucky Home\n\n                            (By Elaine Chao)\n\n       Deep in the heart of Kentucky's rugged Eastern Mountain \n     region there lives a woman who has fascinated and inspired me \n     for two decades. She is known locally these days as ``Mayor \n     Nan''--the octogenarian chief executive of Hazard and \n     advocate for its 5,467 residents.\n       Nan Gorman was born in Memphis, Tenn., on St. Patrick's \n     Day. She moved to Hazard in 1929 when her father, James \n     Hagan, a recent medical school graduate and aspiring surgeon, \n     went to work there. The stock market was about to crash and \n     soon the Great Depression would be under way and take a \n     brutal toll on the rural mountain economy. In the early days, \n     her father was often paid for his services with chickens and \n     eggs. Later, her father became chief surgeon for the region \n     at the Hazard Hospital.\n       Hazard was not just small but remote because of the lack of \n     roads in the region so the Hagan family, with little Nan in \n     tow, traveled there from Tennessee via Virginia mountain \n     passes. Nan's parents, who she says still inspire and guide \n     her today, ensured that she had a good education and gave her \n     the opportunity to attend college but, as was prevalent then, \n     expected that she would soon settle down as a young woman, \n     marry and have children.\n       She eventually did all that, but not until after she had \n     experienced some of the world far from Hazard and her beloved \n     eastern Kentucky mountains that she says ``are like the arms \n     of a mother around us.'' So enraptured was she with the \n     natural beauty around Hazard that she became an artist to \n     record scenes in pencil, ink, watercolors and oil paints.\n       After World War II, Nan graduated from the University of \n     Cincinnati and attended the prestigious Parsons School of \n     Design in New York City. With an adventurous spirit, Nan flew \n     to Egypt by herself to study ancient history and then \n     traveled on for solo explorations of Greece, Rome, Paris and \n     London. Having been exposed to such exotic, vibrant cities so \n     full of opportunity, one could hardly have begrudged a choice \n     to make her life elsewhere. But instead, she chose to come \n     home to Kentucky. She got an apartment in Lexington and \n     worked as a freelance artist drawing advertisements for \n     clothing stores, doing architectural renderings and sketching \n     historical landmarks. One day she saw a classified \n     advertisement in which the state was looking for a full-time \n     artist, and she subsequently became the first one ever \n     employed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Among her tasks was \n     designing the state seal--United We Stand, Divided We Fall--\n     which is still in use today.\n       At age 50, Nan settled again in Hazard, remarried--to her \n     high school sweetheart, Bill, and together they formed a \n     partnership that would have a lasting impact on virtually \n     every sphere of the community. Bill was elected mayor in \n     1978, served for 35 years and never accepted a salary. When \n     he returned home to the Lord three years ago, Nan asked that \n     donations go to a fund to benefit local public schools. \n     Wishing to continue Bill's legacy of service to the \n     community, Nan was subsequently elected mayor as a write-in \n     candidate, winning by a 3-to-1 margin.\n       Nan's governing personal ethic is to constantly strive to \n     do better for Hazard's residents for as long as she can. When \n     last I spoke with her, Nan was alternately expressing pride \n     over a young local girl's success overcoming disadvantages, \n     helping with the Appalachian Regional Hospital's fundraising \n     campaign and her efforts to obtain refrigerators for families \n     in need.\n       An octogenarian well-deserving of retirement, Mayor Nan \n     instead toils from sunrise to late in the evening on behalf \n     of her town. She takes pleasure in the people and the \n     mountain scenery and loves nothing more than to watch \n     wildlife in her yard or to hear that some good fortune is \n     improving someone's life. My takeaway from every visit with \n     Nan is appreciation for the big difference that one woman in \n     a little town can make.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5848-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING THE UNIVERSITY OF PIKEVILLE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a venerable \ninstitution of higher learning from my home State of Kentucky the \nUniversity of Pikeville. UPike, as it is more commonly known, is \ncelebrating 125 years of educating young minds on its campus in eastern \nKentucky.\n  September 16 marked 125 years since the first classes were held at \nwhat was then called Pikeville Collegiate Institute. The college was \nfounded by a group of Presbyterians, and has maintained its religious \nfoundation ever since.\n  In addition to its religious background, UPike has also always \nmaintained a strong commitment to its community. The university invests \ndeeply in the Appalachian region through community service projects, \nhumanitarian efforts, and its educational offerings. As former \nPresident Hal Smith remarked at the anniversary ceremony, UPike's \nmission has always been ``to provide educational opportunity for the \nyouth and adults of this region.''\n  Three other former presidents, as well as the current President Dr. \nJames Hurley, were in attendance Tuesday for the ceremony. During the \nceremony, Dr. Hurley announced a campaign to raise $75 million for the \nuniversity. It is a fitting endeavor to ensure many more years of \nexcellence in education at the University of Pikeville.\n  I now ask that my Senate colleagues join me in paying tribute to the \nUniversity of Pikeville's 125 years of excellence in education.\n  WYMT Mountain News recently published an article detailing the \nUniversity of Pikeville's 125th anniversary ceremonies. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n University of Pikeville Kicks Off 125th Anniversary by Honoring Four \n                           Former Presidents\n\n                         (By Hillary Thornton)\n\n       Pikeville, KY.

Mr. President, of the 21 million veterans in our country, \nabout 750,000 live in Illinois. I hear from many of them as I travel \naround the State meeting with different groups. Like veterans \nthroughout the United States, Illinois veterans are concerned about \ntheir health care. They are frustrated by lengthy wait times to get an \nappointment and, like all of us, they are furious about the wait list \nscandal uncovered this year. One factor that has contributed to the \nlong wait times is a shortage of medical personnel at VA hospitals and \nclinics. In many cases there are not enough doctors and nurses to meet \ndemand. Many of the doctors and nurses we do have are overwhelmed.\n  One way we can address this is to give VA doctors and nurses a raise. \nI am happy that VA Secretary Bob McDonald announced this morning the \nagency is going to lift a salary freeze on medical personnel and plans \nto increase compensation for the health care providers who work with \nour veterans. This is a positive step in improving the ailing Veterans \nHealth Administration.\n  Salaries for VA doctors and nurses often are lower on average than \nthose of their private sector counterparts, and those salaries have \nbeen frozen for 3 years. Primary care doctors and internists at VA \nfacilities earned about 33 percent less than private sector primary \ncare physicians in 2012, according to the Medical Group Management \nAssociation. A similar disparity can be found in nurses' pay.\n  Last week Secretary McDonald testified at a Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee hearing that the VA needs about 28,000 new medical staffers--\ndoctors, nurses, other care providers, and\n\n[[Page S5849]]\n\nadministrative staff--to improve the timeliness of care to the 8 \nmillion veterans enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration. We can \nhelp meet that demand if we make those jobs more competitive by \nadjusting the pay scale.\n  In the bill we passed this summer--which is now law--Congress gave \nSecretary McDonald the authority to fire underperformers. The other \nside of that coin is competitive pay for those who are performing. \nThese doctors and nurses are caring for the men and women who put their \nlives at risk through military service. Let's lift the pay freeze on \ntheir salaries. The VA should have the best and the brightest medical \nstaff out there. That means hiring the best and firing those who do not \npass muster.\n  The shortage of health care providers is not a new issue--\nparticularly in rural areas of the country. We have struggled with this \nin Illinois. The Danville and Marion VA medical centers--both in small \ntowns far from an urban center--struggle to fill health care positions. \nIn 2009 I offered an amendment to the fiscal year 2010 funding bill \nthat set aside $3 million for incentive pay to help with recruitment \nand retention for medical personnel to serve in rural VA facilities. \nRaising salaries would help facilities such as these attract and keep \ntopflight doctors and nurses.\n  The Veterans Health Administration is an important training ground \nfor many medical students. At Hines VA medical center in Chicago, \nmedical students from Loyola get much of their training in a clinical \nsetting. The veterans benefit from the addition of these young doctors. \nAnd hopefully that experience leads to more doctors looking to the VA \nas a career choice. But no matter how appealing the VA is, medical \nschool debt is a factor. The VA offers a loan repayment program that \ncan help offset those worries, but offering pay that is more comparable \nto the private sector would make working for the VA health care system \neven more attractive to new graduates and would help retain current \nstaff.\n  The VA cares for America's heroes, the men and women who have worked \nto keep our country safe and defend American ideals abroad. As recent \ninvestigations have brought to light, VA must improve recruitment and \nretention of medical personnel to keep pace with growing demand. I am \nhappy Secretary McDonald is lifting the salary freeze on medical \npersonnel and plans to increase compensation for the health care \nproviders who work with our veterans. They deserve the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5849-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HUNGER ACTION MONTH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in honor of Hunger Action Month, I want to \nsay a few words about the real and lingering problem of hunger and food \ninsecurity. Hunger has no boundaries. In a Nation that prides itself as \nthe land of plenty, more than 47 million people--including more than 1 \nin 5 children--do not know how they will put food on their table.\n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, formerly known \nas food stamps, is one of our most important antihunger programs. More \nthan 80 percent of SNAP households have incomes below the poverty line, \nwhich is less than $500 a week for a family of four. Seventy percent of \nSNAP participants are in families with children, and more than 25 \npercent are in households with seniors or people with disabilities. \nBasic sustenance ought to be a guarantee in a civilized society, not a \ngamble. If children or adults are hungry in America, that is a problem \nfor all of us, and it is a problem we can do something about.\n  I have traveled across my State and met families and parents that \nrely on food assistance and heard their stories. They are our \nneighbors, they are hardworking people who lost their job or got sick. \nThey are seniors living on a limited income.\n  They are people like Maureen, who works cleaning houses. Her husband \nfell ill and had to stop working due to a disability. Maureen struggles \nto put food on the table for her two daughters in high school. Her \nhusband's doctor says he needs to eat more vegetables, but Maureen says \nthey are just too expensive. The $126 a month in SNAP benefits Maureen \nreceives help, but she still struggles and relies on a food pantry to \nfeed her family. Unfortunately, Maureen is just one of the more than \n1.8 million Illinoisans who do not know where their next meal will come \nfrom.\n  The millions of Americans, like Maureen, who rely on safety net \nantihunger programs, may not have the loudest voice in the debate or \nbig public relations firms, but we must protect these programs and work \nto improve the lives of vulnerable families, children, and seniors at \ntheir time of need.\n  Hunger in America is not something we can ignore. No family should \nhave to wonder where their next meal will come from. As a co-chair of \nthe Senate Hunger Caucus, I look forward to continuing to work with my \ncolleagues and those in the antihunger community to shine a light on \nthis important issue and eliminate domestic hunger.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5849-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5849-S5850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOSUE ROBLES\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to a \ngreat American veteran, businessman, and leader, MG Josue Robles, \nRetired, or, as he prefers to be called, Joe. Joe is stepping down at \nthe end of this year as the CEO and president of USAA, a great American \ninstitution based in San Antonio. His retirement marks a milestone in \nan inspirational and remarkable American story and the conclusion of an \nimpressive career. He will be sorely missed not only by the employees \nat USAA but by the greater San Antonio community and beyond.\n  The eldest of nine children, Joe was born in Rio Piedras, Puerto \nRico, in 1946. His father was working as a waiter when he was \napproached by a group of Americans who were recruiting for steel mills \nin the United States. His dad went to work for U.S. Steel in Lorain, \nOH. Eighteen months later, when Joe was 3, his dad had saved enough \nmoney to send for the family. Their house in Ohio was six blocks from \nthe steel mill, where his father worked for the next 35 years, in \naddition to part-time work as a carpenter and plumber to supplement his \nincome.\n  Starting at age 11 and throughout high school, Joe worked a variety \nof jobs at a local grocery store and in the neighborhood doing yard \nwork. He worked in the steel mill one summer and learned very quickly \nwhat a hot, dirty, dangerous place it was. One summer there was enough, \nand it motivated Joe to go to school and get a good education so he \nwould never have to shovel slag again.\n  While in high school, Joe was awarded a medical school scholarship \nsponsored by the local medical society. They would pay for his \neducation if he agreed to come back and practice medicine in his \nhometown. But first he had to earn an undergraduate degree. Joe \ngraduated from high school in 1964 and worked that summer painting a \nhouse. The job paid enough to cover his first year of tuition at Lorain \nCounty Community College. Joe married that year and went to work full \ntime at a nuclear plant, where he monitored radiation levels. Within 2 \nyears, his long hours forced him to drop a few classes and switch his \nstudent status to part time. Then, in 1966, his country came calling, \nand Joe was drafted into the U.S. Army.\n  By any measure, Joe's military career was stellar. His awards and \nmission-critical positions and assignments are too numerous to fully \nrecount, but let me share a few highlights. Joe completed his basic \ntraining at Fort Jackson, SC. While there, he earned a recommendation \nfor the Artillery Officer Candidate School at Fort Sill, OK. Once \ncommissioned as a second lieutenant, he was sent to Korea in 1967 and \n1968, followed by assignment as an executive officer at Fort Knox, KY, \nand then 12 months as a battery commander in Vietnam.\n  In the latter part of his career, Joe served as the chief of the \nProgram and Budget Office at the U.S. Army Headquarters, the division \nartillery commander of the 1st Infantry Division, Mechanized, at Fort \nRiley, KS; and the Army planner and director for operations and support \nat Department of the Army Headquarters. As assistant division commander \nof the 1st Cavalry Division in Fort Hood, TX, he prepared and deployed \nthe division for Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm. He then served \nas the director of the Army budget and as commanding general of the 1st \nInfantry Division, Mechanized, out of Fort Riley, KS--the legendary \n``Big Red One.''\n\n[[Page S5850]]\n\n  As is the case in any military career, Joe had to move his family \nmany times. He has a son who is autistic, and each move meant \nadjustments to new schools, teachers, and therapists. In 1994, Joe \ndecided it was time to retire from the Army so that his family would \nhave a more stable life. After a stint as a USAA board member from 1990 \nto 1994, Joe joined USAA full time in 1994. He assumed the position of \npresident and CEO in 2007 after serving as the CFO for a number of \nyears.\n  Under his leadership as CEO, not only has USAA seen exponential \ngrowth, it was ranked No. 1 for customer service, satisfaction, or \nadvocacy by Bloomberg Businessweek, MSN Money, the American Association \nof Individual Investors, Forrester Research, and J.D. Power. Committed \nto advocating for military families, Joe has guided USAA to become a \nnational leader in hiring veterans and military spouses and offering \nthem careers in the private sector. Joe was invited to the White House \nand the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to be recognized for USAA's efforts in \nthis area and demonstrating its commitment by ensuring that veterans \nand military spouses comprised 30 percent of USAA's new hires in 2013.\n  Beyond those astounding achievements, Joe has also been a dedicated \nand active member of his community throughout his career. In 2011, Joe \nwas inducted into the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished \nAmericans. Horatio Alger Award recipients are dedicated community \nleaders who demonstrate individual initiative, a commitment to \nexcellence, and remarkable achievements through honesty, hard work, \nself-reliance, and perseverance over adversity.\n  Joe has left some big shoes for future leaders of the military, USAA, \nand the San Antonio community. His is the quintessential American \nstory--one of perseverance, work ethic, and fortitude. But if you ask \nmost people who know Joe well, they will tell you what stands out most \nabout him is that he is simply a great human being. He views himself as \nnot just a leader but part of a greater community--a community of \npeople to which he is dedicated and about which he cares deeply. That \nis really what sets Joe apart from many other hard-charging leaders, \nand it is why he will be profoundly missed. I offer my congratulations \nto Joe Robles on a commendable career, a lifetime of achievements and \nhis ability to maintain humility and compassion through it all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5850-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMEMORATING NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to honor all of those brave \nAmerican men and women who have suffered as prisoners of war, are \nmissing in action, or remain unaccounted for with respect to their \nservice to our Nation. Since 1998, we take the third Friday of every \nSeptember--this year, the 19th--as a day to acknowledge and remember \nwith these extraordinary men and women. Our servicemembers provide the \nblanket of security that allows us to sleep safely at night. We cannot \nthank them enough. But what we can do is pledge to all of the soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines never to forget them and their sacrifice.\n  During the course of the Vietnam war, over 2,500 military personnel \nwere declared either a prisoner of war or missing in action. In 1971, \nMary Hoff, the wife of Lt. Cmdr Michael Hoff, a missing-in-action \nmilitary officer, saw the need for a flag to honor all of those \nclassified as missing in action, MIA, or prisoner of war, POW. Newt \nHeisley, a World War II pilot, designed the flag. It is a haunting \nblack flag containing a white silhouette of a servicemember. Behind \nthis servicemember is a single barbed wire and a watchtower in the \nbackground, and underneath this image are the words ``You are not \nforgotten.'' Just as those words are written on the flag, so they are \nin my heart. As moving and poignant as this flag is, it was still not \nenough. On 1979, Congress and the President declared the first POW/MIA \nRecognition Day. On this day, all Americans shall remember those who \ngallantly sacrificed their freedom so we can remain free. Just 3 years \nlater, this emblem became the only other flag to fly next to Old Glory \nover the White House. On 1989, it was installed in the Capitol rotunda \nas a representation of this Nation's vow to take account for all those \nwho remain missing. As I walk past the rotunda and I see that flag, I \nalways take a moment to remember those who have been declared POW or \nMIA in my thoughts and prayers. And to those who are still missing, I \nvoice our commitment of never-ending support in finding you and \nbringing you home. No matter what it takes, we will never stop looking.\n  This day calls for remembrance of those in the past who have endured \nthese awful fates, but it also reminds us to continue our efforts to \nbring every American home. From World War II to the 1991 gulf war, more \nthan 83,000 Americans have been pronounced missing. That is a hard \nnumber to hear. I commend the actions of the Department of Defense, \nDOD, and of the personnel--military and civilian--who have \nwholeheartedly devoted themselves to the cause of finding and returning \nour courageous servicemembers. I honor and thank all of the Marylanders \nwho have dedicated themselves to this cause. That quest is what our \nservicemembers and their families deserve, servicemembers such as John \nCall III of Potomac, MD, who served in Vietnam under the Air Force; POW \nsurvivor, Dr. Louis Haberer Tankin of Baltimore, MD, who served in \nWorld War II under the Army Medical Corps; Paul Carty of Frederick, MD, \ndeclared MIA serving in the Korean war under the Army; and Adnan al-\nHilawi, DOD contractor, who went missing on March 3, 2007, while \nworking in Baghdad, Iraq, and still remains missing today.\n  I have had the honor to work beside Senator John McCain, a survivor \nof a POW camp--the infamous ``Hanoi Hilton''--in North Vietnam for over \n5 years. His experience and courage and triumph and service continue to \ninspire me. I thank my colleague for his service and sacrifice on our \nNation's behalf.\n  It pains me to think about the fate of these men and women, but no \nmatter the pain, we all must stay true to our pledge never to forget \nthem. And we shall never forget the hardships endured by their family \nand friends who cannot receive the closure of their beloved \nservicemember's fate. The U.S. Government owes a great deal of \ncompassion, appreciation, and gratitude to these families and friends.\n  Joseph Campbell once said, ``A hero is someone who has given his or \nher life to something bigger than oneself.'' Every single soldier, \nairman, marine, and sailor is a hero in my eyes. I pledge to never \nforget those heroes who have been held prisoner of war or have been \ndeclared MIA, and I pledge to all of our service men and women that if \nyou do go missing or are held captive, we will do everything in our \npower to bring you home and keep you in our memories. Today, this \nNation reminds our servicemembers, our citizens, and the world that \nAmerica ``leaves no man behind.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5850-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5850-S5851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CELEBRATING THE AIR FORCE'S 67TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate another year of \noutstanding service from the U.S. Air Force. Through signing the \nNational Security Act of 1947, President Harry Truman awarded our Air \nForce the respect and recognition it so rightly deserved, highlighting \nits strategic importance in the U.S. defense system. Sixty-seven years \nlater, the Air Force continues to uphold the freedom and safety of our \ngreat Nation, protecting the bastion of democracy that is the United \nStates of America. Today, we express our unwavering admiration and \nsupport for an Air Force that fulfills its duties with integrity and \nexcellence. Accomplishing the mission ``to fly, fight and win,'' the \nAir Force is a source of national pride, and I have no doubt it will \ncontinue in this tradition.\n  In 1907, the world's first airplane flight soared over the sands of \nKitty Hawk, NC, as a soaring, swooping symbol of innovation and \ntechnological prowess. The success of this first mission would not have \nbeen possible without the pioneering minds of the Wright Brothers, and \nthe same stands today. I commend the skilled airmen of our Air Force: \nthey are the warriors behind our aviation triumphs and their sacrifices \nand achievements are just as inspiring as those of their 20th-century \npredecessors. Our airmen are masters of innovation, ensuring the Air \nForce can\n\n[[Page S5851]]\n\nfly, fight, and win with efficiency, speed, and through world-class \ntechnology. They have come a long way since 1907 and will no doubt \ncontinue along this prominent trajectory.\n  At present, the capabilities of the U.S. Air Force dwarf comparable \nforces across the globe. Ours is the largest and most technologically \nadvanced force in the world. Our airmen continuously strive to fulfill \nthe five core missions of the Air Force: No. 1, air and space \nsuperiority; No. 2, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; No. \n3, rapid global mobility; No. 4, global strike; and No. 5, command and \ncontrol--all the while remaining committed to these central duties, the \nAir Force has recognized that strategic agility is the future. With the \nnew Air Force 30-year strategy, triumphed by Secretary of the Air Force \nDeborah Lee James and Chief of Staff General Mark A. Welsh III, our \noutstanding airmen are able to adapt and prepare for a world with ever-\nevolving global threats. Faced with new challenges, such as the danger \nposed by ISIL, the Air Force ensures we are one step ahead, placing our \nfreedom and safety out of harm's reach. For the past 67 years our Air \nForce has proven to be responsive and brave in the face of change. It \nis a force we can all be proud of and, above all, a force we can trust.\n  The U.S. Air Force remains one of our most crucial tools for tackling \nglobal conflict. Its wide-ranging scope ensures it provides global \nvigilance, global reach, and global power while helping to manage \ncrises around the world to safeguard our freedom. Using technology in \nair, space and cyber space, the Air Force has become integral to all \nfronts of U.S. defense. The Air Force is deployed in war zones, natural \ndisaster relief, and intelligence gathering, demonstrating there are no \nbounds to its significance. By confronting conflicts around the globe, \nthe Air Force protects U.S. citizens and plays a vital role in \nspreading peace and freedom to the worldwide population.\n  The Maryland Air National Guard is a wonderful example of dedicated \ncitizen airmen who serve the Nation, the State of Maryland, and their \nlocal communities. An integral part of the Maryland community, our Air \nNational Guard works to ensure the safety of the citizens of Maryland, \ncoordinating responses to any State crises. Yet these same airmen have \nbeen called upon to serve in Afghanistan and Iraq, and their experience \nand talents are an invaluable asset to the Department of Defense. Most \nrecently, the 104th Fighter Squadron of the Maryland Air National Guard \ndeployed four A-10C fighters and 100 personnel to participate in \nExercise Saber Strike, supporting strategic training and foreign \npartnerships in Estonia. This is just one illustration of the good work \nof the Maryland Air National Guard. Our 175th wing is continually \ndeployed worldwide to assist with training, humanitarian relief, \ninternational cyber defense, and combat operations, all of which \ndemonstrate the wide-ranging significance of our Maryland Air National \nGuard.\n  When remembering 67 years of stalwart service, we must never forget \nthat we owe these years of triumph to the men and women behind the \nmachines, the airmen. I thank them personally for their dedication and \nbravery to the United States of America. I am fortunate to have one--\nMaj. David James Wilson--currently serving on my staff as a defense \nlegislative fellow. We ask a lot of these courageous men and women, and \nthey continue to exceed our expectations with integrity and excellence. \nThey are dedicated to service before self. They sacrifice their \npersonal safety to ensure the U.S. flag continues to stand tall and fly \nfree. They are the warriors who have answered our Nation's call. They \nare team members who leave no airman behind. They will not falter nor \nwill they fail. For this, we owe them our enduring gratitude, support, \nand admiration.\n  Today, on the 67th birthday of our Air Force, we congratulate the men \nand women who have taken to the skies in defense of our freedom. Their \nvalor and sacrifice humbles me. Let us remember this feeling of awe and \npride not just today but every day as we applaud the accomplishments of \nour Nation's airmen, past and present, and wish the U.S. Air Force a \nhappy 67th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5851-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5851-S5852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JERRY LINNELL\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, on more than once occasion, I have talked \nabout the hardworking men and women who toil mostly in anonymity here \nin the Senate. We have people who work on our staffs and on the \ncommittees. We have floor and cloakroom staff. We have parliamentarians \nand legislative counsel and enrolling clerks. We have carpenters and \nplumbers and electricians. To me, all of these people are part of the \nSenate family. And I am always grateful for the dedication, skill, and \npride each brings to his or her job. Many of these individuals live in \nMaryland and I am proud to have them as constituents. While we Senators \nmay have our partisan differences, the Senate functions well at an \ninstitutional level because of the professionalism and devotion to \npublic service of its staff people who typically log long hours; endure \ngovernment shutdowns, security threats, and other perturbations; and \nwork in facilities we try to make as accessible as possible to the \nAmerican people and anyone else who wishes to visit.\n  Today, I thank one such individual, Jerry Linnell, for 32 years of \nexemplary service to the Senate and the American people. Jerry is \nretiring at the end of the month. Jerry joined the staff of the U.S. \nSenate's Official Reporters of Debates in 1982 and became the Chief \nReporter of Debates in 1999. For those people who may be unfamiliar \nwith the Reporters' office, it is charged with producing a verbatim \naccount of everything that happens here on the floor of the Senate. \nEven with modern technology employed, that is a daunting task requiring \na team of eight skilled reporters who take turns transcribing every \nword that we Senators utter on the floor. They have to be able to \ndecipher our accents and occasional creative use of the English \nlanguage, and they have to withstand filibusters. It is a mentally and \nphysically challenging job. The Reporters the Senate employs are highly \nexperienced professionals who take pride in their work. The Office has \n15 people overall and a designee from the Government Printing Office, \nGPO; collectively, they are responsible for producing the Senate's \nportion of the Congressional Record. The Congressional Record is one of \nthe crucial documents of our government.\n  Jerry is a Minnesota native, born in Duluth and raised in Grand \nMarais. He played on the high school football team and was captain of \nthe basketball team. He attended the Minnesota School of Business in \nMinneapolis and graduated from its court reporting program. Jerry's \nfirst court reporting job was with Ward & Paul in Washington, DC, \nbefore moving to New Carrollton, MD and joining the Baltimore court \nreporting firm of Salomon Brothers. After several years in Baltimore \nand at one point passing in one test session 8 of the 9 highest testing \nrequirements set by the National Court Reporters Association, Jerry \njoined the staff of the U.S. Senate's Official Reporters of Debates.\n  Jerry and his wife Jane first met on a dance floor; they were members \nof the DC Swing dance team and danced competitively. They enjoy \ntraveling back to Grand Marais, where Jerry claims to have shoveled \nmore snow than anyone else in the Linnell family, for various music \nevents where he can play his accordion with local musicians and family \nmembers. He's also a country music fan.\n  Jerry is the proud father of Laurie, Jerry Jr., Heather and Katie, \nand the very proud grandfather of Colleen, Rachel, Leanne, Monica, and \nJerry III. He currently serves as the President of the Linnell Family \nAssociation, a group composed of the thousands of descendants of Robert \nLinnell, who first came to the United States in the early 1600s to \nScituate, Massachusetts. Jerry has spent many an hour refurbishing his \nCapitol Hill home, and plans on retiring between that home and a newly \npurchased and renovated home in North Carolina where he can play golf \nall year round.\n  Even though Jerry is a former Maryland resident, he is a diehard \nWashington Nationals fan. He and his wife Jane love to attend games \ntogether. In light of his more than three decades of public service, I \nwon't hold that against him. But with the real prospect\n\n[[Page S5852]]\n\nthis fall of a Beltway World Series between the Nats and the Baltimore \nOrioles, he should prepare himself to be disappointed!\n  Mr. President, in all seriousness, we are fortunate to have men and \nwomen of Jerry's caliber devote their time and talent to the U.S. \nSenate. Jerry is an outstanding public servant. While we will miss \nhim--and his trademark suspenders--he certainly has earned a well-\ndeserved retirement and on behalf of the Senate, I thank him for his \nservice and wish him and his family all the best for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5852-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING JERRY L. HEDRICK\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I rise today to pay tribute to Jerry L. Hedrick, a \nlifelong North Carolinian, distinguished public servant, a United \nStates Army veteran, and a leader of distinction at many levels in the \nAmerican Legion, who died on August 25, 2014, concluding a life of \nsuperb and selfless service to the veterans of North Carolina and \nAmerica. Jerry passed away on the eve of the American Legion's National \nConvention in Charlotte, NC, an event he had been actively planning for \nalmost until the moment his life ended. There is no doubt in anyone's \nmind that Jerry put his heart and soul into the Legion's mission \nthroughout his life.\n  Jerry was born in Lexington, NC a year after the end of World War II \nand spent his younger, formative years in Davidson County, where he was \ngraduated from Lexington Senior High in 1965, just as the war in \nVietnam was escalating. Jerry joined the United States Army in 1966 and \nwas trained as an armor crewman. He was subsequently assigned to Alpha \nTroop, First Squadron, of the Fourteenth Armored Cavalry Regiment, \nbased in Fulda, Germany. This was in the early years of the Cold War \nthat pitted North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces, commanded by the \nUnited States, at outposts and in forward bases along the border that \ndivided a free and democratic West Germany from a repressive communist \nregime in Soviet supported East Germany. The open lowlands around \nJerry's base were known then and for the next 25 years as the Fulda \nGap, where NATO expected a Soviet invasion of Western Europe would come \nthrough. At that time America's attention was turning toward Southeast \nAsia and the hot war there, but Jerry and his fellow soldiers had a \nvital mission, one that would continue until the demise of the Soviet \nUnion.\n  Jerry received an honorable discharge from the Army in 1968 and \nreturned home to North Carolina. Soon after, he joined American Legion \nPost 8 in Lexington and found work as a mail carrier with the U.S. \nPostal Service, where he worked faithfully from 1969 until 2001. In the \nearly post-Army years, Jerry somehow found the time amidst all his \nactivities to study and obtain a business degree from Rowan Technical \nCommunity College. Years later, when Jerry was asked what spurred his \ndecision to join the Legion, he simply stated, ``I was asked by fellow \nworkers and I wanted to help veterans.''\n  Throughout his over four decades of service to the Legion and to \nNorth Carolina's veterans, Jerry Hedrick held almost every leadership \nposition from Post Financial Officer, to Post Adjutant, to Post \nCommander, and went on to serve as both a Department and District Vice \nCommander and Commander, as well as rising to National level committees \nthat addressed Americanism, Military Affairs, and International \nAffairs. Jerry was also the North Carolina Department's representative \nto the dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington DC and \nwould say in later years that some of his fondest memories were from \nhis time on the National Executive Committee, which is responsible for \ndrafting the annual budget and signing off on the American Legion's \nspending.\n  While he devoted much of his life's work to the Legion and to \nveterans' issues, Jerry Hedrick was also devoted to his wife Marie and \nto his family, and a prominent figure in his community, through \nvolunteerism for the Moose, Masonic, and Elks Lodges.\n  When I reflect on the sum total of Jerry's life, I see a man who knew \nthat the calling of service and the value of fellowship were essential \nelements of the American experience and what truly bind us together. As \nan advocate for veterans, his legacy is typified in the old saying that \nthe measure of a man is not what he does but what he gives. Jerry lived \nthose words until his last day with us.\n  I offer his wife Marie and his entire family my deepest condolences. \nThey, all of North Carolina, and this Nation, have lost a lifelong \nfriend, a true gentleman, a stalwart leader for veterans, and a role \nmodel for those committed to community and national service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5852-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5852-S5853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. STORY LANDIS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I want to recognize a truly \nexceptional public servant, Dr. Story Landis, who is retiring in a few \nweeks from the directorship of the National Institute of Neurological \nDisorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health. I have been \nfortunate to get to know Dr. Landis during her 11 years as Institute \nDirector. She has testified several times before the committees I \nchair, the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations \nSubcommittee and the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, always with the poise of a leader at a prestigious national \ninstitution, the rigor of a renowned scientist, and the insight of a \ntruly extraordinary pioneer working on the frontiers of our knowledge \nof the human brain.\n  Certainly, Dr. Landis has an exemplary pedigree. A graduate of \nWellesley College and Harvard University, Dr. Landis came to NIH in \n1995 as NINDS Scientific Director, following a distinguished career as \na neuroscience researcher and chair of the Neuroscience Department at \nCase Western Reserve University School of Medicine. As scientific \ndirector, she had the bold vision to stimulate collaborations in brain \nresearch across labs from different institutes on the NIH campus and \nled the planning for a unique national neuroscience research center at \nNIH. From the time Dr. Landis became NINDS Director in 2003, she worked \nwith me, with the late Senator Spector, and with other NIH Institute \nDirectors to make this center a reality. This spring I was fortunate to \nbe at the NIH campus to help officially dedicate the John Edward Porter \nNeuroscience Research Center.\n  I will remember Dr. Landis best for her courage, her ability to \nbridge gaps, and her passion.\n  First, her courage. Not many people remember this, but in 2007, Dr. \nLandis was the first NIH Director to speak publicly in opposition to \nPresident Bush's ban on Federal funding of stem cell research. That may \nnot sound like much to us now, but at the time it was a remarkable act \nof professional integrity and personal courage. The American public was \nvery divided, the scientific community was not unified, and most \nimportantly, she worked for the administration whose policies she was \npublicly criticizing. She risked her job and her reputation to alert \nthis Senate to the reality that research was being stifled--research \nwith enormous potential to reduce human suffering. Just last week, I \nread a press report about stem cells being used to decode schizophrenic \nbrains. This Nation is indebted to Dr. Landis for having the courage to \nspeak a hard truth at a critical juncture in our Nation's scientific \npolicy debate.\n  Second, let me talk about Dr. Landis's ability to bridge gaps. In \ntruth, she has bridged so many divides throughout her career: She \nreached across institutes in 2005 to establish and develop one of the \nmost effective trans-NIH initiatives in producing the NIH Blueprint for \nNeuroscience Research and more recently launching the NIH BRAIN \nInitiative, which will bring together engineers, aging experts, and \nneuroscientists to transform our understanding of the human brain. She \nreached across scientific gaps in chairing the NIH Stem Cell Task Force \nand helping to coordinate and lead pain research efforts across NIH, \nand she bridged generation gaps in her enthusiastic mentorship, her \nwork on career development, and her support for early-stage \ninvestigators.\n  But the gap I remember best is the divide between scientists and \npolicymakers. I might be telling tales out of school here, but it was \nStory Landis and Jim Battey who sat with me for\n\n[[Page S5853]]\n\nnearly an hour in Dirksen 116 and patiently walked me through the \nscience and the potential for stem cell research. Concepts that are \nfamiliar to many of us now--ideas such as pluripotency and somatic cell \ntransfer--were entirely new. Scientists and the public would all have \nto learn how to engage with one another about the legal, technical, and \nethical issues raised by stem cell research, and Dr. Landis was there \nto bridge that divide with me.\n  Finally, let me speak about her passion. Dr. Landis and I have worked \ntogether for many years on many topics, but none is closer to her heart \nthan spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA. When she and I began \ncollaborating to address SMA, there was very little to offer families \nwho had a child afflicted by this debilitating disease. Between 2003 \nand 2012, the NINDS piloted the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Project to \nexpedite therapeutics development. If you listen to Dr. Collins talk \nabout the Advanced Medicine Partnership today, you hear echoes of Dr. \nLandis's work on SMA. The project was designed to accelerate the \nresearch process by creating a virtual pharmaceutical company to \nidentify drugs that could be used as potential leads for clinical \ntesting. This was groundbreaking work well before ``translational \nresearch'' was commonly discussed. And it worked not just for the \ncompounds it discovered but also by getting companies interested in \ncreating more and better treatments. As a consequence, today when we \ntalk about the SMA treatments in development, we talk about treatments \nin the plural. This would not be happening if Story Landis had not \nfocused her passion on SMA.\n  Dr. Landis's career has stimulated tremendous progress in the field \nof neuroscience and inspired legions of young scientists to follow in \nher path. She has been a true public servant. Indeed, I am always \namazed at America's good fortune in attracting public servants of the \nworld-class caliber of Dr. Landis. It has been my privilege to work \nwith her and to learn from her over the years. Dr. Landis has many \nother admirers in the U.S. Senate. We honor Dr. Story Landis today for \nher invaluable leadership of NINDS and for her great service to the \npeople of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5853-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO COMBINED JOINT INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE 435\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing the contributions of Combined Joint Interagency Task Force, \nCJIATF, 435. On October 1, 2014, CJIATF 435 will conclude a 5-year \nmission in Afghanistan to conduct U.S. law of armed conflict detainee \noperations while successfully training, advising, and assisting the \nAfghan National Army and Afghan justice sector to develop and improve \nthe investigation, prosecution, and detention of insurgent and terror-\nrelated threats.\n  CJIATF 435's team included Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force \nservicemembers, Department of Defense civilians, contractors, and \ncoalition members. The team developed a strong collaborative \nrelationship with highly capable partners in the Afghan National Army \nMilitary Police Guard Command, the National Directorate of Security, \nthe Attorney General's Office, and the Supreme Court. They also \npartnered with U.S. Department of State and U.S. Department of Justice.\n  On September 18, 2009, CJIATF 435 was established originally as Joint \nTask Force 435, JTF 435, to assume command, control, oversight and \nresponsibility for all U.S. detainee operations in Afghanistan and \ncoordinate with other partners to promote the rule of law and use of \nbiometrics in Afghanistan. Through its subordinate command, the Rule of \nLaw Field Force-Afghanistan, CJIATF 435 partnered with the Office of \nthe U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan for Rule of Law and Law Enforcement. \nWith the addition of combined and interagency partners, JTF 435 \nofficially became CJIATF 435 on September 1, 2010.\n  CJIATF 435 justice advisors from the Rule of Law Field Force-\nAfghanistan and the Joint Legal Center, trained, advised, and assisted \nAfghan prosecutors, judges, and investigators, which enabled the \njustice system to try over 7,000 cases with a 75 percent conviction \nrate, resulting in more than 3,000 insurgents held accountable for \ntheir crimes. The Joint Legal Center also responded to over 12,000 \nrequests for information from Afghan courts. The National Directorate \nof Security Agents provided information for investigations to assist in \nconvictions.\n  CJIATF 435 instituted the first of its kind Afghan Training Team \nprogram that provided opportunities for expert Afghan criminal \ninvestigators, forensic experts, and prosecutors to share their \nprofessional expertise with provincial investigators and prosecutors. \nThe program trained more than 400 students in a multitude of Evidence \nBased Operations procedures.\n  The CJIATF 435 Intelligence Directorate, the Theater Intelligence \nGroup, conducted more than 30,000 interviews and produced thousands of \nreports in support of Afghan investigation, prosecution, and detention \noperations. Outstanding intelligence collection consisting of over \n30,000 interrogations generating more than 5,500 intelligence \ninformation reports, resulting in over 2,000 source directed \nrequirements, made legal victories possible and contributed valuable \ninformation to the war fighting effort. The Theater Intelligence Group \nexpertly partnered with Afghan law enforcement investigators to train \nand assist them in conducting interviews and investigations of complex \nterror organizations.\n  CJIATF 435 managed the theater biometrics database which enrolled \nthousands of individuals associated with the insurgency into the \ndatabase and prevented them from entering coalition bases. The \nbiometrics enabled watchlist was critical to force protection and led \nto the capture, targeting, and tactical questioning of hundreds of \npossible threats. These biometric enrollments also linked many \ninsurgents to a host of crimes against the coalition and the Afghan \npeople.\n  During the transition of detention operations to Afghan custody and \ncontrol, CJIATF 435 ensured the Afghan Military Police Guard Command \nprovided secure and humane care, custody, and control of over 3,500 \ndetainees. CJIATF 435 provided hands-on training, mentorship, and \noversight to facilitate the complete transfer of detainee operations to \nthe Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, GIRoA. Their \ntireless efforts set the conditions of GIRoA's largest detention \nfacility to conduct independent operations in full compliance with \ninternational standards of humane care and detainee treatment.\n  As CJIATF 435 approached the end of mission, it established a rule of \nlaw development team to continue mentoring the Afghan prosecutors, \njudges, investigators and military police in the investigation, \nprosecution, and detention of national security threats. Through the \ntireless efforts of the men and women of CJIATF 435, the Afghans are \nwell poised to effectively operate the National Security Justice Center \nat Parwan which will protect the Afghan people and coalition forces \nwhile strengthening the rule of law in Afghanistan.\n  Commending the combined Joint Interagency Task Force 435 on a job \nwell-done for supporting the Government of Afghanistan as it built \nself-sustaining detention capacity and rule of law institutions \ncompliant with Afghan and international law, I ask that the Senate join \nme in acknowledging the hard work, dedication, and sacrifice of CJIATF \n435 for promoting the values of democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5853-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5853-S5855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 INDIA\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, next week, Indian Prime Minister \nNarendra Modi will travel to the United States for the first time since \nhis historic election victory. The U.S. and India are natural partners \nwith shared values and common interests, yet we are far from realizing \nthe full potential of our relationship to the mutual benefit of both of \nour countries. On behalf of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and \nthousands of Indian-American constituents across New Jersey, I welcome \nthe Prime Minister to the United States and am confident that his visit \nwill re-invigorate and refocus our partnership so that concrete \nprogress can be made in a host of sectors.\n  India's new government has won a historic mandate to deliver change \nand reform, and we should be ready to support India's efforts to meet \nchallenges--through concrete measures to\n\n[[Page S5854]]\n\nbolster trade and investment, strengthen defense cooperation, and \ndeepen our security partnership.\n  The U.S. and India are engaged in a comprehensive set of diplomatic \ndialogue and working groups--currently there are dozens such groups \ncovering a wide range of issues in the areas of economics, security, \nclimate change, and education. This is a relationship that does not \nsuffer from a lack of dialogue. It has, however, unfortunately suffered \nfrom a lack of results, especially since the civilian nuclear framework \nwas agreed to in 2005. With a strong push from the Prime Minister, \nPresident Obama and the U.S. Congress, the time is right for these \ndialogues to translate into action.\n  There is broad support in the U.S. for a more robust economic and \ntrade relationship with India. Investment should be at the top of this \nagenda. I welcome India's move to raise foreign investment ceilings in \nseveral sectors of the Indian economy, including defense, railways, e-\ncommerce and insurance. These are important steps that have helped to \nease some of the concerns American companies have had about barriers to \nentering the Indian market. However more must be done and I hope that \nthe U.S. and India will work together to address these remaining \nbarriers.\n  Vice President Biden laid out an ambitious trade target last summer \nin India, calling for a five-fold increase from $100 billion to $500 \nbillion a year in annual bilateral trade. Prime Minister Modi and \nPresident Obama should reconvene the Trade Policy Forum this year, \nwhich will provide a platform to identify steps to improve our economic \nand trade relationship. The Prime Minister's visit will also present an \nopportunity to reengage on World Trade Organization negotiations, where \nIndia's concerns are the last remaining barrier to the important Trade \nFacilitation Agreement. I also hope we can smooth the way forward for \ncontinued discussions to complete a Bilateral Investment Treaty.\n  U.S. companies seek to invest in India, but need transparent \ngovernance, a fair regulatory environment, and strong legal mechanisms \nto protect those investments. If the Indian government can deliver on \nits plans for greater openness for capital flows and stronger \nintellectual property rights, I am confident our companies are ready to \ninvest. We want to work together with India to help foster the best \nconditions for this kind of economic growth and partnership.\n  I welcome recent reports that India plans to develop a new \ncomprehensive intellectual property rights, IPR, policy. We need to see \nreal reforms on this key issue, which significantly impacts the ability \nof U.S. companies to do business in an important market. In particular, \nthe life sciences industry faces continuing challenges on IPR \nprotections. I appreciate that this is a complex issue. Policymakers in \nboth the United States and India want to ensure access to medications \nfor those who need them, especially for low-income and other vulnerable \npopulations. International life sciences companies in my State and from \nother nations are concerned that India's lack of protection of IPR will \nthreaten innovation and affect access for those very people. I look \nforward to the renewed dialogue with the Indian government on this \nissue.\n  India has a central role in contributing to prosperity in South Asia, \na central foreign policy interest of the U.S. As the U.S. seeks to \nbolster Afghanistan's economic links in the region, within the \nframework of the New Silk Road initiative, we look to India to play a \ncritical role in promoting trade with Afghanistan and the other \ncountries of Central Asia. Regional economic connectivity should also \nextend to India's trade relationship with Pakistan. I urge both India \nand Pakistan to continue to work toward strengthening their bilateral \nrelationship. Improved trade relations between India and Pakistan have \nthe potential to unlock opportunities for over 1.5 billion people. The \nU.S. stands ready and willing to support efforts that enhance the \ncross-border trade relationship.\n  India is a strong partner in U.S. counterterrorism efforts in the \nregion, and we have a shared national interest to confront terrorism, \nprevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and maintain \nregional stability. In Afghanistan, India has been a key provider of \ndevelopment assistance and supporter of the Afghan National Security \nForces. As the international community draws down forces in \nAfghanistan, the U.S. and India should be prepared to increase \ncounterterrorism and intelligence cooperation and coordination, and \nboth sides should commit to a robust set of military exercises. Last \nyear India significantly increased its purchases of American arms and \nnow conducts more exercises and personnel exchanges with the U.S. than \nany other country--I welcome and encourage expanding this important \ncollaboration.\n  Defense cooperation remains the most promising area of U.S.-India \ncooperation, and I am pleased that Secretary Hagel's recent visit to \nIndia further deepened our defense ties. We should expand initiatives \nto strengthen our defense cooperation, including military exercises, as \nwell as co-production and co-development of defense products. The \nDefense Technology and Trade Initiative should continue to advance \nefforts to reform India's defense procurement and management systems, \nand encourage both sides to explore the possibility of a revamped and \nexpanded formal framework for a bilateral defense agreement.\n  I believe we should be expanding educational ties in all sectors--the \nbest and the brightest from both sides should be exchanging ideas and \nbuilding on the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit that exists in \nboth countries. I encourage the U.S.-India Education Dialogue to \ncontinue to explore areas of collaboration, including student and \nfaculty exchange, research cooperation, and implementation of \ntechnology-enabled education strategies, such as e-learning, and \ncooperation between community colleges.\n  Rutgers University has formed strong relationships with Indian \neducational and research institutions, and has increased the profile of \nIndia with businesses, communities, and nonprofit organizations in New \nJersey. Rutgers was one of five recipients of the 21st Century \nKnowledge Initiative, which unifies many of the university's efforts \nwith Indian institutions through faculty exchanges, and research and \ninnovation collaboration in the priority areas of food security, \nclimate change, sustainable health and public health. I strongly \nsupport these collaborations, and encourage the expansion of efforts to \nstrengthen exchanges in technical and vocational education.\n  India has a long and rich history of religious, ethnic, and \nlinguistic pluralism with a vibrant civil society. We should also \ncontinue to work together to ensure greater respect for human rights, \nand encourage a legal framework that protects the civil rights and \nliberties of the most vulnerable Indian populations, particularly women \nand children.\n  India is critical to international efforts to address climate change. \nThere are huge opportunities for India to act on climate change while \nboosting development at the same time, and I urge the Indian government \nto continue to explore ways to make clean power more accessible and \nmore affordable. We should also expand our partnership with India on \nenergy, which would help them reduce dependence on unstable energy \nsuppliers. Finally, we must continue to work toward cutting emissions \nfrom hydrofluorocarbons and coal--both of which contribute to climate \nchange. I applaud Secretary Kerry and Minister Swaraj's efforts to \nestablish a new joint working group on climate change, and am hopeful \nthat we can continue to explore ways to expand R collaboration to \nbolster renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, to meet India's \ngrowing energy demands, while ensuring there are environmental \nprotections.\n  Our agenda is extensive and the potential to accomplish our mutually \nbeneficial goals is limitless. There is so much room for growth. With \nsustained attention and leadership, as well as active engagement by the \nIndian-American diaspora, I am confident in our ability to achieve \nresults and work toward a more prosperous and secure future. I am proud \nto welcome Prime Minister Modi to the United States and I wish him a \nsuccessful visit.\n\n[[Page S5855]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5855-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            COMMEMORATING HANFORD B's SEVENTIETH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nCantwell to commemorate the Hanford B Reactor in our home State of \nWashington as we approach the 70th anniversary of the world's first \nfull-scale self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. An essential part of \nthe Manhattan Project, on September 26, 1944, the B Reactor was \nsuccessfully energized to convert uranium into plutonium, an event \nknown as going critical. The entire facility was built in only 13 \nmonths, and only a handful of the 50,000 workers at the site knew what \nwas being assembled. The speed and precision of the construction of the \nfacility remain an engineering marvel today. It was not until later \nthat the majority of these workers learned they had played a key role \nin the history of nuclear materials production in the United States and \nhelped the U.S. win World War II and the Cold War.\n  The B Reactor went on to operate for more than 20 years until 1968, \nmaking its mark on the 20th century. After ceasing operations, the B \nReactor was to be encased in concrete like all the other reactors as \npart of the Hanford Reservation cleanup efforts. Given the B Reactor's \nhistoric role, I worked for many years with Senator Cantwell and the \nentire Washington delegation to ensure this piece of our nation's \nhistory is preserved for generations to come. After years of hard work, \nI was pleased when the U.S. Department of the Interior designated the B \nReactor as a national historic landmark in 2008, and the B Reactor now \nreceives more than 10,000 visitors a year from around the Nation and \nthe world to see and experience this important part of world history. \nToday, the B Reactor remains a symbol for the Hanford Reservation, the \nentire Tri-Cities community, Washington State, and our Nation as a \nwhole.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I join my colleague Senator Murray in \ncommemorating this important day in American history. Seventy years \nago, when the B Reactor went critical, it forever changed history and \nthrust society into the Atomic Age. On September 26, 1944 the Manhattan \nProject overcame a major obstacle when the B Reactor--the first full-\nscale nuclear reactor--proved that it was possible to develop plutonium \nin large quantities, and the world was forever transformed. Our \nconstituents in Washington State are reminded of that change daily, as \nthe workers at the Hanford Reservation continue their efforts to clean \nup the legacy of the B Reactor and the eight other reactors built and \noperated at Hanford. The history of this fateful day and the entire \nManhattan Project must be remembered so that our Nation has the \nopportunity to reflect on and learn from the important lessons this \nfacility has to offer.\n  Our collective work to designate the B Reactor as a national historic \nlandmark is a great start, but the Manhattan Project story cannot be \ntold at the B Reactor alone. This is why I am working with Senator \nMurray and our colleagues in Tennessee and New Mexico to establish the \nManhattan Project National Historical Park. The Manhattan Project \nNational Historical Park Act would commemorate the historic \nachievements made by the workers at the Hanford Reservation and at \nother Manhattan Project sites across the country. The men and women who \nworked on the B Reactor played an unforgettable role in our Nation's \nhistory, and it is important that we remember their lasting impact.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I commend Senator Cantwell for her work on the Manhattan \nProject National Historical Park Act and will continue to push this \nlegislation forward with our colleagues in Congress. The 70th \nanniversary of the world's first full-scale nuclear reactor going \ncritical is a fitting tribute and reminder that this landmark moment in \nhistory should be preserved for future generations through the creation \nof the Manhattan Project National Historical Park.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5855-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5855-S5856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. JAMES MEZA, JR.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and honor Dr. James \nMeza, Jr., who has devoted much of his life to ensuring that all of \nLouisiana's students receive an excellent education. He currently \nserves as Superintendent of the Jefferson Parish Public School System \nand while he will soon retire from this role, he will be leaving behind \nan indelible mark of impressive leadership and results. On behalf of \nthe U.S. Senate and the State of Louisiana, I applaud Dr. Meza as a \nchampion of high quality education and for his devotion to Louisiana's \npublic education system.\n  Dr. Meza's experience in education spans more than 40 years and \ncrosses teaching and leadership positions both at the K-12 and higher \neducation levels. As a champion of education reform, Dr. Meza developed \nmany of the pioneering ideas in Louisiana that led to revolutionary \nreform movements across the Nation. In the devastating aftermath of \nHurricanes Katrina and Gustav, Dr. Meza was instrumental in one of the \nmost transformational endeavors of modern public education helping to \nestablish the Recovery School District in New Orleans, LA, which is now \n100 percent public charter schools and has experienced extraordinary \nprogress in closing the achievement gap.\n  Dr. Meza served most recently as the Superintendent of Jefferson \nParish Public School System, Louisiana's largest and most diverse \nschool district, serving 46,000 students. Since becoming the head of \nJefferson Parish Public School System in 2011, Dr. Meza has led a \nreform agenda that has transformed the school system from one in a \ndownward spiral for achievement to one of Louisiana's most improved \nschool systems. In 2 years, Jefferson Parish Public School System has \nimproved its State performance rating from a letter grade ``D'' to \n``B.'' In that same period, the number of ``A'' and ``B'' schools has \nincreased dramatically, from 13 to 32. Jefferson Parish is home to 4 \nschools that are ranked in the top 10 in Louisiana.\n  Prior to becoming Superintendent of Jefferson Parish Public School \nSystem, Dr. Meza served as Professor and Dean at the University of New \nOrleans, UNO, for more than 21 years where he published more than 40 \njournal articles to study education reform, specifically focused on \nserving children of low-income families in Louisiana and nationwide. \nDr. Meza is recognized nationally for redefining the role of colleges \nof education and their work with low performing schools. As Dean, he \nlaunched the UNO Charter School Network of four charter schools, as \nwell as Louisiana's first Type 5--turnaround--charter school. His \nefforts were recognized by New Orleans City Business, which presented \nhim with the ``Innovator of the Year'' award. He received the honor and \ntitle of Professor and Dean Emeritus from the LSU system, recognizing \nhis years of scholarship at UNO.\n  Dr. Meza has served as the Executive Director of the Louisiana State \nBoard of Elementary and Secondary Education, BESE, and the Interim \nState Superintendent of Education for Louisiana. During this time, he \nwas a pioneer in school accountability, launching Louisiana's \neducational quality and trust fund, 8G, and restructuring the \nDepartment of Education as Louisiana transformed the State \nSuperintendent's position from an elected position to one appointed by \nBESE. Dr. Meza also has served as a faculty member at Nicholls State \nUniversity, principal of Cabrini High School, and teacher at E.D. White \nand Isidore Newman High School.\n  Dr. Meza has received numerous awards and deserved recognitions for \nhis transformational work in the education sphere. He is the recipient \nof The Weiss Award by the New Orleans Council for Community and \nJustice, which honors members of the Greater New Orleans community for \ncivic and humanitarian contributions. He has also been recognized as a \n``Super Hero'' by the national organization Stand for Children for his \nwork in improving quality educational opportunities for children of \npoverty.\n  Dr. Meza currently serves on the Board of Directors of Holy Cross \nSchool and was a member of the Louisiana Serve Commission and the \nSouthern University System Board of Supervisors. He is also a founding \nboard member of Ben Franklin High School and Edward Hynes charter \nschools. Dr. Meza served 32 years in the Louisiana Army National Guard \nand retired at the rank of Colonel.\n  I am proud that Louisiana's students and teachers have had the strong \nleadership and guidance of Dr. Meza over\n\n[[Page S5856]]\n\nthe years. Dr. Meza's leadership as the Superintendent of the Jefferson \nParish Public School System will be missed; however, I have full faith \nand trust that he will continue to lead in improving the educational \nprospects and outcomes for Louisiana's students in whatever role he \npursues next. Once again, I am privileged and honored to formally \nrecognize Dr. James Meza, Jr. for his commitment and efforts to \nstrengthen public education in Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5856-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    140TH ANNIVERSARY OF A.O. SMITH\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate A.O. Smith \nCorporation, a ``Made in Wisconsin'' company on the occasion of their \n140th anniversary.\n  A.O. Smith was founded in 1874 in Milwaukee, WI, and over the past \ncentury has grown rapidly from a small family business specializing in \nthe fabrication of metal hardware specialties to a global water \ntechnology manufacturer producing residential and commercial water \nheaters, boilers, and water purification equipment. Today they employ \nmore than 10,000 people across the United States and the world.\n  The company was instrumental in helping to usher in the automobile \nrevolution, developing a new, lightweight steel car frame a development \nthat caught the interest of major car companies including Peerless, \nCadillac, Packard, Oldsmobile, and Ford. Ford's initial order of 10,000 \nframes led A.O Smith to develop the world's first mass production \nprocess for assembling frames, later introducing the world's first \nautomated frame production line. This first fully automated frame \nassembly plant came to be known as the ``mechanical marvel'' due to the \nline's ability to make a frame every eight seconds--10,000 frames a \nday.\n  Their engineers discovered an improved method for welding, allowing \nfor the production of a wide range of steel products. This included the \npressure vessel for oil refining and large diameter steel pipe, \nimportant components in the oil and natural gas industries.\n  One of the company's most important and enduring innovations was the \nprocess of fusing glass to steel. By perfecting this process, the \ncompany developed a range of new products, including glass-lined beer \nkegs, glass-lined brewery tanks, and glass-lined residential water \nheaters. Glass-lined water heaters rapidly became an industry standard \nthat endures today and led to A.O Smith's growth as a global company \nand as an important economic driver for Southeastern Wisconsin.\n  In recent years, A.O. Smith has emerged as a vital player in global \nwater technologies, developing solutions to our water challenges. A \ncofounding member of The Water Council, A.O Smith has helped ensure \nMilwaukee's place as a world water leader, while supporting economic \ndevelopment in Wisconsin.

Mr. President, today I wish to say a few kind \nwords about my longtime communications director and friend, Jeff \nGrappone--a native of Concord, NH.\n  Jeff has served as my chief spokesman since I ran for the Senate in \n2010. He's traveled with me from Nashua all the way up to Colebrook, \nand from Keene to Portsmouth. He was by my side at the Statehouse when \nI filed my paperwork to become a candidate, and he was there when I won \nthe primary and general elections. Jeff was present for my ceremonial \nswearing-in that took place in the Old Senate Chamber, and he then \nimmediately got to work establishing my Senate press office.\n  Jeff helped me hit the ground running as a first-time candidate and \nas a new Senator. He has provided me with outstanding communications \ncounsel, and I've drawn on his considerable experience here on Capitol \nHill as well as back home in New Hampshire. He's been an invaluable \nadviser as I've gone about my work in the Senate--helping me \neffectively communicate my legislative priorities in Washington and in \nthe Granite State.\n  Jeff has worked tirelessly in my office. It wasn't unusual for him to \nwork into the night until the last vote was called in the Senate, and \nthen head up to New Hampshire for a press conference the next morning. \nHe has brought energy and enthusiasm to my staff, and he shares my \nstrong commitment to serving the people of the Granite State.\n  After nearly a decade in politics and on Capitol Hill--on the \nlegislative staff of Congressman Charles F. Bass, as Press Secretary to \nSenator John E. Sununu, and as a spokesman for Senator John McCain's \npresidential campaign, Jeff is about to embark on a new chapter in his \ncareer outside of government. As he makes this transition, I will miss \nhis intellect, his expertise, his good humor, and his inherent decency.\n  Jeff lives by our State's motto, ``Live Free or Die,'' and he has New \nHampshire in his blood. He has been a talented and diligent member of \nmy staff, and he's a loyal friend. I wish Jeff the very best \nalways.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5856-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO BOB NASH\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor one of New \nHampshire's most respected, accomplished, and beloved citizens--Bob \nNash--as he enters into his retirement. I am proud to recognize his \nillustrious professional career, and his continued service to our \ncountry and many communities across the Granite State.\n  Bob attended the Georgia Military Academy before transferring to the \nUniversity of Florida, where he graduated with a degree in journalism. \nAfter college, Bob joined the Army and bravely served our Nation as a \nhelicopter platoon commander in Vietnam. Bob flew 325 missions and was \nawarded both the Bronze Star and United States Military Air Medal. He \neventually earned the rank of Captain.\n  Following his dedicated service to our country, Bob began a 38-year \ncareer in association management, and obtained his Master's in Business \nAdministration and Certified Executive Association certification. In \n2001, he became president of the New Hampshire Association of Insurance \nAgents, NHAIA. Under his leadership, the association received several \naccolades, including the Bronze Excellence in Education Award, Gold \nExcellence in Education Awards, the Diamond Excellence in Education \nAward, and the InsurPAC Eagle Award. The association was also honored \nwith the Innovations in Education, Non-Seminar Education Services, and \nL.P. McCord Education Award for Excellence. Most noteworthy, in 2011, \nthe NHAIA was awarded the Maurice G. Herndon National Legislative \nAward--the highest honor that can be bestowed upon a State association.\n  Bob Nash is an extraordinary Granite Stater whose commitment to \nothers extends beyond his military and professional career. For many \nyears he has been actively involved with the Chamber of Commerce, \nRotary International, the Kawanis, and the United Way.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor Lancaster, \nNH, which is celebrating the 250th anniversary of its founding this \nyear. I am proud to join citizens across the Granite State in \nrecognizing this special milestone.\n  Located along the Connecticut River in New Hampshire's North Country,\n\n[[Page S5857]]\n\nLancaster is a gateway to the Great North Woods, Weeks State Park and \nthe White Mountain National Forest.\n  As Coos County's county seat, Lancaster is home to over 3,500 \nresidents. The town welcomes hundreds of visitors from across the \nregion who come each year to enjoy its scenic beauty and vibrant \nrecreational opportunities, including snowmobiling, hiking, and \nfishing. Shops line the town's bustling Main Street, and every year the \nannual Lancaster Fair, which is the premier agricultural fair in the \nregion, attracts citizens from across the Granite State and beyond.\n  New Hampshire's covered bridges are a unique part of our State's \nbeauty, history and charm, and the town of Lancaster is home to two of \nthese classic bridges. The historic Mt. Orne and Mechanic Street \nbridges span the Connecticut and Israel rivers, respectively.\n  Throughout its history, Lancaster has also been home to several \nnotable public servants. John Weeks represented New Hampshire in the \nU.S. Senate, where he sponsored legislation that established the White \nMountain National Forest. He also served in President Calvin Coolidge's \ncabinet as the 48th Secretary of War. Jared W. Williams served in the \nU.S. House and Senate, and was New Hampshire's 21st governor. Chester \nBradley Jordan was elected the 48th Governor of New Hampshire, Irving \nW. Drew served in the U.S. Senate, and Jacob Benton and Ossain Ray both \nserved in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  Lancaster's citizens have contributed much to the life and spirit of \nthe State of New Hampshire. I am delighted to congratulate all \nLancaster residents--past and present--as they celebrate this historic \noccasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5857-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               MENTORING\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I would like to express \nappreciation to those who volunteer their time to serve as mentors.\n  A recent New York Times column by Thomas L. Friedman titled, ``It \nTakes a Mentor,'' discussed the importance of mentors to students and \nthose starting careers. This article highlighted research conducted by \nthe Gallup organization that underscored the significant role mentors \ncan play in helping individuals achieve post-secondary education and \ncareer success.\n  The Gallup research focused on the benefits of mentorships for young \nadults, but those advantages can also be applied to the academic and \nathletic mentor programs available to children in grades K-12.\n  While policymakers and educational experts address concerns about \nwhether American children will learn the skills needed to succeed in an \nincreasingly competitive global economy, we should not overlook the \nrole that mentors play on an individual basis to inspire K-12 students \nto set higher goals and achieve more.\n  Volunteer mentors serve as positive role models who can help build \nself-esteem and confidence in youth, particularly in at-risk children. \nThe best mentors endeavor to challenge students, enhance their self-\nconfidence, and make them excited about learning.\n  I appreciate the efforts of organizations such as the Community \nFoundation of Northwest Mississippi, Tougaloo College and others \nthroughout Mississippi that sponsor a variety of mentorship programs \nwith missions to improve the education and wellness of children in my \nState. The individuals, college students and professionals who give of \ntheir time to be part of mentor programs also have my respect.\n  Mr. President, as a new school year gets underway in earnest across \nthe Nation, I think it is worthwhile to consider and encourage the \nbenefits and rewards that come with volunteering to serve as a mentor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Mr. Friedman's column be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Sept. 9, 2014]\n\n                           It Takes a Mentor\n\n                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)\n\n       With millions of students returning to school--both K-12 \n     and college--this is a good time to review the intriguing \n     results of some research that Gallup did over the past year, \n     exploring the linkages between education and long-term \n     success in the workplace. That is: What are the things that \n     happen at a college or technical school that, more than \n     anything else, produce ``engaged'' employees on a fulfilling \n     career track? According to Brandon Busteed, the executive \n     director of Gallup's education division, two things stand \n     out. Successful students had one or more teachers who were \n     mentors and took a real interest in their aspirations, and \n     they had an internship related to what they were learning in \n     school.\n       ``We think it's a big deal'' where we go to college, \n     Busteed explained to me. ``But we found no difference in \n     terms of type of institution you went to--public, private, \n     selective or not in long-term outcomes. How you got your \n     college education mattered most.''\n       Graduates who told Gallup that they had a professor or \n     professors ``who cared about them as a person--or had a \n     mentor who encouraged their goals and dreams and/or had an \n     internship where they applied what they were learning--were \n     twice as likely to be engaged with their work and thriving in \n     their overall well-being,'' Busteed said.\n       Alas, though, only 22 percent of college grads surveyed \n     said they had such a mentor and 29 percent had an internship \n     where they applied what they were learning. So less than a \n     third were exposed to the things that mattered most.\n       Gallup's data were compiled from polls of parents of 5th \n     through 12th graders, business leaders and interviews with \n     teachers, superintendents, college presidents, principals, \n     college graduates, Americans ages 18 to 34, and students in \n     grades 5 through 12. All told, ``we collected the voices of \n     close to one million Americans in the past year alone,'' said \n     Busteed, who added that he found the results ``alarming''--\n     not only because too few students are getting exposed to the \n     most important drivers of workplace engagement, but because \n     there is also a huge disconnect in perceptions of the \n     problem.\n       Busteed said that 96 percent of the college provosts Gallup \n     surveyed believed their schools were successfully preparing \n     young people for the workplace. ``When you ask recent college \n     grads in the work force whether they felt prepared, only 14 \n     percent say `yes,' '' he added. And then when you ask \n     business leaders whether they're getting enough college grads \n     with the skills they need, ``only 11 percent strongly \n     agree.'' Concluded Busteed: ``This is not just a skills gap. \n     It is an understanding gap.''\n       This comes at a time when our country faces creative \n     destruction on steroids thanks to the dynamism of technology \n     and growing evidence that climbing the ladder of job success \n     requires constant learning and relearning. Therefore, the \n     need for schools to have a good grasp of what employers are \n     looking for and for employers to be communicating with \n     schools about those skills is greater than ever.\n       Some help may be on the way from Washington. Last year, \n     President Obama quietly asked Vice President Joe Biden to \n     oversee an overhaul of the government's education-to-work \n     programs after hearing from one too many employers across the \n     country that, as one White House official put it, ``they were \n     having trouble hiring workers for some of their fastest-\n     growing jobs,'' such as operating sophisticated machine tools \n     or software testing and debugging.\n       As they dove into the problem, said Byron Auguste, a White \n     House deputy national economic adviser, they found that the \n     success stories shared a lot of the same attributes that \n     Gallup found to be differentiating. In successful programs, \n     said Auguste, ``students got as much applied, hands-on \n     experience as possible, whether in a classroom or on a job \n     site. Schools, colleges and training centers had close \n     partnerships with regional employers, industry groups and \n     skilled trade unions to stay up to date on job-relevant \n     skills. And students or working learners got a lot of \n     coaching and guidance to understand how to trace a direct \n     path between their training today and careers tomorrow.''\n       The key now is to scale those insights. The Labor \n     Department has awarded $1.5 billion in the last three years \n     to more than 700 community colleges to develop employer-\n     validated training programs for new careers like natural gas \n     field work and cybersecurity. Later this month, another $500 \n     million is set to be awarded as part of a kind of race-to-\n     the-top for whoever can build the best community college-\n     industry group partnership anywhere in the country where new \n     industries are finding gaps in the kind of workers they need.\n       Employers used to take generalists and train them into \n     specialists for their industry. But fewer employers want to \n     do that today or can afford to in a globally competitive \n     economy, especially when they fear they'll train someone who \n     will then leave for a competitor. So everyone wants employees \n     out of college or technical schools who are as ready to plug \n     and play as possible. That's why government has a role in \n     fostering more and more employer-educator partnerships--this \n     is the new, new thing--which businesses, small and large, can \n     benefit from, as well as all would-be employees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5857-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5857-S5858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IDAHO HOMETOWN HERO MEDAL\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

Mr. President, today I rise to recognize and \nhonor the extraordinary service and ultimate sacrifice of Merrillville, \nIN police pfficer Nickolaus (Nick) Schultz. Dedicated, loyal, and above \nall compassionate to those in need, Officer Schultz was sworn into the \nMerrillville Police Department in 2013.\n  On Friday, September 5, 2014, Officer Schultz responded to an \nunwanted party call at Tempe Lake Condominiums in Merrillville. Upon \narriving at the condominium where the suspect was believed to be \nhiding, Officer Schultz led a group of four Merrillville police \nofficers into the unit. Moments after entering, the officers were \nambushed. Two shots were fired at Officer Schultz, with one striking \nhim in the head. Despite the best efforts of his fellow officers, EMTs, \nand medical personnel, Officer Schultz, 24, succumbed to his wounds on \nSeptember 7, 2014.\n  ``He led by example . . . It was no surprise to everyone that he was \nthe first officer to approach the door on that night,'' said Reverend \nPeter Muha.\n  An Indiana native, Officer Schultz grew up in Lowell, where he \nattended Lowell High School. Known for his outgoing, gregarious \npersonality, athleticism, and concern for others, Nick was a varsity \nmember of the championship Lowell football team. Nick went on to play \nfootball at Franklin College, where he became co-captain of the team. \nIn 2013, he graduated with a bachelor's degree in sociology and \ncriminal justice.\n  ``He always wanted the best for people, and he always watched out for \npeople,'' said Kristen Mikesell, a friend since childhood. According to \nmany of his peers and Merrillville family members, Officer Schultz \nalways wanted to help other people. ``He was a teddy bear, but a strong \nman who wanted to make a difference,'' said Merrillville Police Chief \nJoseph Petruch. It was with this in mind that Officer Schultz's family \nallowed him to be of service one last time by choosing to donate his \norgans.\n  Officer Schultz is survived and deeply missed by his parents Dale and \nColeen Schultz; sister Heather Schultz; paternal grandmother Charlotte \nHerring; maternal grandparents Rich and Pat Shields; girlfriend Emilee \nMcInnis; numerous aunts, uncles, and cousins; the Merrillville Police \nDepartment family; and Hoosiers throughout the State.\n  Officer Schultz loved his work, and he gave his life to serve and \nprotect the citizens of Merrillville. Although he would have never \nconsidered himself a hero, Officer Schultz demonstrated his character \ndaily by conducting himself with courage, bravery, compassion, honor, \nand integrity. Thus, he was a true American hero--in his everyday life \nas a police officer, son, brother, and friend--and in his final call to \nduty. Let us always remember and emulate the shining example this \nstalwart, brave man set for us and honor him for his selfless \ncommitment to serving his fellow citizens. May God welcome him home and \ngive comfort to his family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5858-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5858-S5859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING REVEREND LEONARD F.

He went on to attend Saints Cyril and \nMethodious Seminary in Orchard Lake, MI, and was ordained to the \npriesthood in 1964. In subsequent years, Father Chrobot earned a \nMaster's Degree in American Literature from Purdue University and a \nDoctorate from Wayne State University.\n  Father Chrobot served in various academic and pastoral positions \nduring his life, including Academic Dean and President of St. Mary's \nCollege and Adjunct Professor and Coordinator of the\n\n[[Page S5859]]\n\nAmerican Polish Research Fellowship Program at the University of Notre \nDame. He also served as Pastor of Our Lady of the Lake Parish in \nCulver, IN, and St. Adalbert Parish and St. Hedwig Parishes in South \nBend. Father Chrobot was known for his ability to bring people \ntogether, regardless of their religious and ethnic backgrounds or their \npolitical views. ``He was a kind, soft-spoken man who didn't like to \nsee arguments, rather encouraging people to `pray about it,' '' \nrecounted Rosanne Benassi, office manager for St. Hedwig's Parish.\n  Father Chrobot passed away on Tuesday, September 9, 2014. He is \nsurvived and deeply missed by his sister Joan Webber and brother-in-law \nCharles, brother Hank Chrobot, several nieces and nephews, the St. \nMary's College family, the University of Notre Dame family, the Diocese \nof Fort Wayne-South Bend, his parishioners, and Hoosiers across the \nState.\n  Father Len, as he was affectionately known, loved his work and \ndedicated his life to the service of his fellow citizens.

Next Monday, September 22 marks the \nbeginning of National GEAR UP Week.\n  GEAR UP is a national program that provides grants for States to help \nlow-income students with college preparation, enrollment, and \ncompletion.\n  In 2011, the U.S. Department of Education awarded the University of \nHawaii a 7-year GEAR-UP grant to improve college access and completion \nfor low-income students. The P-20 Partnerships for Education manages \nthis grant with its partners, the State Department of Education, the UH \nten-campus system, and other public, nonprofit, and private entities.\n  Hawaii GEAR UP is helping reach the goal of having 55 percent of \nworking age adults hold a 2- or 4-year degree by 2025. In shorthand, \n``55 by `25.'' To reach this goal, GEAR UP Hawaii runs many programs to \nhelp low-income middle school and high school students focus on \nacademic preparation, explore Early College options, learn more \ninformation about college access and financial aid, and improve college \nenrollment and completion.\n  In January of 2014, I had the chance to meet GEAR UP Hawaii students \nat Waipahu High School. The school's Early College High School program \nhelps students earn college credit while still in high school.\n  One of the students I met was Juanito Moises, National GEAR UP Youth \nof the Year. He came to Hawaii from the Philipines at age 9, not \nspeaking English. He took rigorous courses and eventually earned a 3.98 \nhigh school GPA. He will be the first in his family to attend a 4-year \ncollege, and thanks to GEAR UP he will already have English 100 out of \nthe way.\n  Juanito is just one of the thousands of low-income students in Hawaii \nand nationwide who GEAR UP is working to serve. The program's results \nshow that GEAR UP students are more likely to complete rigorous \ncoursework, apply and enroll in college, and earn college degrees, when \ncompared with other low-income students who do not have the opportunity \nto participate.\n  Since I first came to the House in 2007, I have supported Federal \nfunding for GEAR UP program, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to \ndo the same.\n  During National GEAR UP Week, let's celebrate GEAR UP's success and \ncontinue our efforts to help Hawaii students enter and complete \ncollege.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5859-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5859-S5860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING ZIONS BANK\n\n Mr. LEE. Mr. President, next week, the Department of Defense \nwill honor 15 companies with the prestigious Secretary of Defense \nEmployer Support Freedom Award. This award is the highest honor given \nby the Department of Defense to employers in recognition of exceptional \nsupport of National Guard and Reserve employees. One of the 15 \ncompanies to be honored at this event is Utah's own Zions Bank. I would \nlike to take this opportunity to recognize this company for its \ncontribution to my home State and our Nation.\n  Zions Bank was founded 22 years before Utah gained her statehood. On \nJuly 10, 1873, under the direction of Brigham Young, Zion's Savings \nBank and Trust Company was incorporated. It was the first chartered \nsavings bank and trust company in the Utah Territory. Soon after its \nhighly successful opening day, Brigham Young wrote to a fellow Mormon \nin England: Zion's Savings Bank and Trust Company opened for business \non Thursday last. This institution is a cooperative one, and we think \nit is likely to meet with favor.\n  President Young and the other bank founders were right. Even though \nthe bank opened just months before America's Long Depression, 1873-\n1879, was underway, the bank thrived.\n  Such economic tenacity was woven into the character of Zions Bank. \nDuring the Great Depression, the bank's livelihood was threatened when \nin February of 1932, depositors withdrew $1.5 million in 2\\1/2\\ days. \nIn order to quell the panic and reassure depositors that the bank was \nsound, bank President Heber J. Grant ordered signs to be posted at \nbranch locations. The signs noted that the bank was ``in a very strong, \nclean, liquid condition,'' and that it could ``pay off every depositor \nin full.'' The note ended, ``There is no safer bank in the state or the \nnation.'' Because of the trust that the bank developed with customers \nover previous decades, the panic was subdued and deposits quickly \nexceeded withdrawals. The bank stood firm in the midst of an extended \nnational economic struggle. During every significant economic downturn \nsince 1873, Zions Bank has weathered the storm and come out stronger \nfor it. This success speaks to the impeccable leadership and business \nacumen of bank leaders and the hard work of Zions Bank employees.\n  While it is always important to look to foundational virtues, an \norganization cannot long survive without emulating those virtues in the \npresent and perpetuating them into the future. Zions Bank continues to \nbe a steadfast partner, not only with businesses and individuals but \nalso with community and charitable organizations in Utah and throughout \nthe Western United States. A large part of Utah's success--what we \nchampion as the ``Utah model''-- are the Utah businesses that conduct \ntheir affairs with integrity and purpose. Zions Bank's famous motto, \n``We haven't forgotten who keeps us in business,'' speaks both to its \nintegrity as a corporation and its purpose of creating lasting value \nfor the customer and the community.\n  One excellent example of this community spirit is Zions' annual \nPaint-a-Thon. Starting in 1991, Zions Bank employees volunteered for 1 \nweek each year to paint the homes of those in need, including the \nelderly, disabled citizens, and veterans. This year, 59 homes in Utah \nand Idaho will be painted, pushing the program past the milestone of \n1,000 homes painted since its inception. In addition to the many hours \nvolunteered by its employees, Zions Bank pays for all the paint and \nmaterials needed for the projects.\n  The Zions Bank example of service, which mirrors the spirit of \nservice that one finds throughout Utah, is rooted in a love for fellow \nman, for country, and for goodness. Such love is the essence of the \ncivil society and the key to real progress in our Nation. I believe \nthat a crucial element of this love is showing appreciation for the men \nand women who willingly fight to secure our natural rights; for if our \nrights are taken from us, the civil society and rule of law are not \npossible.\n  Zions Bank shows their appreciation by making a special effort to see \nthat their servicemembers' families are properly cared for when \ndeployed. The bank provides internships and training for servicemembers \nand veterans through its innovative professional development program. \nFor these reasons\n\n[[Page S5860]]\n\nand others, the bank was nominated for the Secretary of Defense \nEmployer Support Freedom Award by Army National Guard 1LT Helaman \nHurtado. Over 2,800 nominations were submitted for the award.\n  It is with heartfelt gratitude that I congratulate Zions Bank on \nbeing honored as one of the 15 recipients of this award. I thank the \nbank's president, Scott Anderson, and his predecessors, and I thank the \nmany hard-working employees who have served their fellow Utahns and \nothers for over 140 years. Zions Bank and the extraordinary people who \nwork and serve there strengthen my faith in the American dream and hope \nfor a strong civil society. I urge my colleagues to come together in \nreducing the size, scope and burden of our government and regulations \non free markets and civil society so that more companies are able to \nemulate the success and positive impact of principled and caring \ncompanies like Zions Bank.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5860-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING GRACE MEDICAL HOME\n\n Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the outstanding \nwork of Grace Medical Home, a comprehensive medical clinic in my \nhometown of Orlando that provides a broad range of health services to \nlow-income, uninsured residents in Central Florida.\n  Grace Medical Home provides 8,500 patient visits annually allowing \n2,300 Floridians access to high quality medical services at little or \nno cost to the patient.\n  Both nationwide and in Florida, free and charitable clinics are a \ncritical component of America's medical safety net.\n  Our country has a strong tradition of neighbors caring for neighbors, \nand nowhere is that more apparent than in our free and charitable \nclinics. There are approximately 1,200 of these clinics throughout the \nNation that since the 1960s have been filling in the gap for those who \n``fall through the cracks'' in our current health care system. These \nclinics believe in giving people a hand-up not a handout, and they \nactivate at the grassroots level, utilizing a volunteer and staff model \nto provide a range of health care services to economically \ndisadvantaged individuals.\n  Free and charitable clinics do not receive dedicated Federal funding. \nInstead, these clinics rely heavily on private donations from \nindividual donors, foundations, grants, and volunteers, which allow \nthem to keep their doors open and to deliver health care to those who \nneed it the most.\n  Currently, the Affordable Care Act is making great strides to help \nmillions of people gain insurance and access to health care. However, \neven with the most optimistic projections of health insurance \nenrollment or Medicaid expansion, roughly 30 million people will still \nbe without health coverage. Therefore, free and charitable clinics are \nand will continue to be an important part of our country's safety net.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in Congress \nto better address the needs of the underserved with respect to \naffordability, accessibility, and portability of primary, specialty, \ndental care, and medication access. And I am thankful that free and \ncharitable clinics across the country like Grace Medical Home are \ncontinuing to build a healthy America--one patient at a time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5860-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MAJOR PATRICK W. MILLER\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to recognize and \nhonor MAJ Patrick W. Miller, U.S. Army, for his incredible courage and \nbravery on April 2, 2014, during the tragic Fort Hood shooting.\n  Major Miller was born and raised in Allegany, NY and was commissioned \nin the U.S. Army in 2003 after graduating from St. Bonaventure \nUniversity. He has been deployed to Iraq for two tours, first as a \ncommander of a platoon of medics and second as an adviser to the Iraqi \nArmy. In August of 2013, he and his wife Ashley were assigned to Fort \nHood, TX.\n  It was there, on the afternoon of April 2nd that a gunman opened fire \nin a shooting rampage. During that time, the shooter entered Major \nMiller's building and opened fire, immediately hitting Patrick in the \nabdomen, just 2 inches below his heart. Despite being critically \nwounded and at great risk to his own life, he rushed to get his fellow \nsoldiers to safety in a closed office as quickly as possible. Then, \nwhile attempting to put pressure on his wound, still thinking of his \nfellow soldiers, he was able to make a call to 911 to report the \nshooting. In addition to wounding Major Miller, the shooter ended up \nkilling 3 soldiers and wounding 15 others before taking his own life.\n  The heroic and distinguished acts by Major Miller, beyond a doubt, \nsaved countless lives.\n  On behalf of the Nation and my fellow New Yorkers, it is my honor to \nrecognize the exemplary service and overwhelming bravery of Major \nMiller during such a tragic event. I wish him the best as he continues \nto serve our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5860-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DONNA KUETHE\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the \nachievements of Donna Kuethe Recreation Director for the town of \nMoultonborough, NH, who was recently named New England Woman of the \nYear by Every Child is Ours, ECIO, an organization dedicated to \npromoting universal educational opportunity. For 40 years Donna has \nbeen a tireless advocate for children's education, environmental \nstewardship and community recreation.\n  On the national and international stages, Donna has volunteered in \nNew Orleans and South Africa delivering emergency supplies to areas \nhard-hit by natural disasters. She has worked with Operation Recreation \nRelief, a group designed to help provide recreation services to areas \nimpacted by disasters, in addition to focusing on assisting children in \nthose areas through her work with the Save the Children foundation.\n  Back home in New Hampshire, Donna has been active throughout the \nState through her work with the Children in Nature initiative, the New \nHampshire State Parks Great Park Pursuit and other programs focused on \nencouraging active and healthy lifestyles. She has also advocated for \noutdoor initiatives through her service on the House/Senate Committee \non Child Care Licensing and as Chair of the Legislative Committee for \nNew Hampshire Parks and Recreation.\n  Donna has also been a key leader at the Moultonborough Parks and \nRecreation Department, in addition to coaching New Hampshire high \nschool students and establishing after-school programs, youth sports \nand summer day camps, and programs for seniors.\n  Donna's lifelong devotion to her community and the many organizations \nshe has served is truly admirable, and her recognition as ECIO's New \nEngland Woman of the Year is well deserved.

Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize the 35th anniversary of the Latino Chamber of Commerce of \nPueblo and its history of serving Latino-owned businesses in Pueblo \nCounty, CO. Created in 1979 by an influential group of Pueblo \nbusinessmen, the Latino chamber was organized to harness the Pueblo \nLatino community's significant economic force.\n  Demonstrating vast community representation, the Latino chamber's 35 \ninaugural members included influential local leaders such as Judge Joe \nUlibarri, Dr. Tom Autobee, Dr. Thomas Duran, Dr. Joe Roybal and Victor \nTony Navarro. This diverse and respected initial membership consisted \nof architects, attorneys, business owners, medical professionals and \nothers.\n  Since 1979, the Latino chamber has expanded in big ways. With nearly \n1,000 members today, the Latino chamber is a respected, dynamic \nbusiness organization in the area. Its resources and expertise help the \norganization serve as a launching pad for Latino leaders. Willing and \neager to respond to its community's challenges, the Latino chamber \nplayed instrumental roles in the development of the Pueblo Hispanic \nEducation Foundation, the El Pueblo Inter-development Corporation, the \nSouthern Colorado International Trade Center and the Human Relations \nCommission.\n\n[[Page S5861]]\n\n  Moreover, the Latino chamber has developed longstanding and \nsuccessful collaborative relationships with state and federal entities, \nas well as with the Greater Pueblo chamber and the Pueblo Economic \nDevelopment Corporation. In addition, it established the Latino Chamber \nDevelopment Corporation Foundation in 1997 to advocate and promote \nleadership development in Pueblo with an emphasis on the Latino \ncommunity.\n  The Latino Chamber of Commerce of Pueblo has spent 35 years \nadvocating for small businesses, networking its partnerships, \ndeveloping members professionally and growing alongside its community. \nPueblo--and the State of Colorado--are truly fortunate to have such a \nworld-class organization to assist businesses and build our economy. On \nbehalf of Pueblo and all of Colorado congratulations, and thank you to \nthe Latino Chamber of Commerce of Pueblo and its board members. You \nhave left a lasting legacy that will continue to help the community for \ngenerations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5861-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO PATRICE WALKER POWELL\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Ms. Patrice \nWalker Powell, a remarkable Virginian who is retiring after 23 years at \nthe National Endowment for the Arts, NEA. During her more than two \ndecades of service, Ms. Powell has worked to broaden and deepen the \nengagement of diverse communities with the NEA and with arts \nstakeholders in urban and rural venues across America.\n  Ms. Powell's contributions to the NEA are too many to enumerate, but \nher leadership reflects a commitment to fiscally responsible \nmanagement, sound stewardship through challenging times, and prolonged \noutreach to underrepresented communities. In response to leaner \noperational budgets, Ms. Powell was elevated to lead a department of \nseveral consolidated program areas, and was responsible for developing \ninnovative approaches to advancing the agency's mission. Ms. Powell \nembraced public-private partnerships, innovative grant programs, and \narts support programs to strengthen a diverse cultural infrastructure \nfor the Nation.\n  As the agency began to acclimate to a reduced funding environment, \nNEA research showed that there were 20 States receiving 5 or fewer \ndirect grants per year. Ms. Powell devised a comprehensive pilot \nstrategy that collaborated with State arts agencies to hold staff-led \nseminars on NEA funding opportunities and identify potential \napplicants. Over the course of the 3-year commitment to this pilot \nprogram, the number of NEA-supported projects in these States increased \nby 350 percent.\n  Under her leadership, the NEA undertook a massive modernization \nproject focused on access and outreach. As a result, every publication \nproduced by the NEA has been digitized and is now available \nelectronically to students and to the general public. This achievement \nhas been praised as a significant contribution toward ensuring that the \nrecord of the agency's history is maintained for the future.\n  Ms. Powell's dedication to the NEA would ultimately result in her \nbeing called upon to serve as Acting Chair. She has proudly represented \nher country in the international arts arena, including on delegations \nto South Africa, Germany, Senegal, and Austria. Although these \naccomplishments are but some of the highlights of Ms. Powell's career, \nthey exemplify her proven record of public service and advocacy for the \narts and our Nation. I thank her for her service and wish her a long \nand happy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5861-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CONSTITUTION DAY\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, September 17 was Constitution Day--a \nday when folks are encouraged to teach and learn about the \nConstitution. I would like to recognize the middle and high school \nstudents from across the Nation who traveled to the U.S. Capitol \nyesterday in honor of Constitution and Citizenship Day.\n  I would also like to recognize the students unable to travel to \nWashington, DC, who are no less engaged in their studies of the \nConstitution and citizenship, specifically the many students in my home \nState of Oregon who have shown a strong commitment to civic engagement. \nThese young Oregonians have demonstrated a willingness to get involved \nin their communities and work for positive change and are an example of \nthe important role community involvement plays in developing a strong \nsociety.\n  Of the students able to be in Washington, DC, on Constitution Day, I \nwould particularly like to recognize several middle school students \nfrom Oregon who visited my office yesterday.\n  Alyssa Etheridge and several of her classmates from South Middle \nSchool located in Grants Pass, OR, dedicated every day of the last \nschool year to honor the 142 Oregon soldiers who made the ultimate \nsacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan. These young women created the Bayard \nWilkeson Project--named for a Civil War officer killed at the battle of \nGettysburg--a Web site designed to educate Oregonians about the lives \nof those servicemembers from our State who have given their lives for \nour country.\n  Coming from Portland, OR, William Britton and his seventh grade class \nfrom Southwest Charter School studied and considered the problem of \noutdoor secondhand smoke, and its impact on the health of their \ncommunity. They conducted surveys, interviews, and lobbied some of \ntheir local elected officials to control secondhand smoke exposure.\n  It is wonderful to see these students participate so actively in the \ndemocratic process, and it is truly heartening to see so many young \npeople taking the time to get involved and express their opinions. I am \npleased to be able to recognize the commitment and dedication these \nyoung Oregonians have shown to better their communities and urge them \nto keep up their good works.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/18/senate-section/article/S5861-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5861-S5862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADDRESSING THE ENERGY NEEDS OF U.S. INSULAR AREAS\n\n  Mr. PRYOR.

from the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, with an amendment to the preamble, as follows:\n  (Strike the preamble and insert the part printed in italic.)\n\n       Whereas Ebola hemorrhagic fever is an extremely infectious \n     virus that causes severe illness with a fatality rate that \n     can well exceed 50 percent;\n       Whereas Ebola is spread through contact with blood, \n     secretions, or other bodily fluids of infected humans and \n     animals and can have an incubation period of up to 21 days;\n       Whereas the Ebola virus first appeared in the Democratic \n     Republic of the Congo in 1976 and has afflicted communities \n     in Africa at least 20 times since then;\n       Whereas the current Ebola outbreak first occurred in \n     February 2014 in forested areas of southeastern Guinea and \n     subsequently spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and \n     Senegal, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo recently \n     discovered the outbreak of a separate strain of the virus;\n       Whereas this is the first outbreak of Ebola in West Africa \n     and the biggest and most complex to date, due to its \n     emergence in populated, transient border areas, making \n     containment a significant challenge;\n\n[[Page S5879]]\n\n       Whereas, to date, according to the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention, Ebola had infected more than 4,400 \n     people in West Africa and caused nearly 2,300 confirmed \n     deaths;\n       Whereas the current Ebola outbreak has occurred in \n     countries with some of the weakest health systems in the \n     world facing severe shortages of healthcare workers, \n     laboratories essential for testing and diagnosis, clinics and \n     hospitals required for treatment, and medical supplies and \n     protective gear, such as latex gloves and face masks required \n     to prevent contamination of health facilities;\n       Whereas these weak and inadequate healthcare facilities, a \n     lack of health staff trained in Ebola response, and \n     misconceptions about the virus have resulted in numerous \n     infections of health workers and patients unable to receive \n     appropriate response and care;\n       Whereas effective countermeasures for stemming the spread \n     of Ebola, such as isolation, meticulous infection control \n     practices, case investigation, and contact tracing require \n     more trained personnel and resources than are currently \n     available in West Africa;\n       Whereas, although Ebola can be contained with good public \n     health and burial practices, it continues to spread due to a \n     lack of accurate public information, insufficient treatment \n     facilities, limited local language capacities required for \n     health education, and an unwillingness to allow those \n     infected to be isolated from family members;\n       Whereas governments are collaborating closely with \n     international donors and taking strong measures to contain \n     the virus, including announcing states of emergency and \n     establishing emergency response centers;\n       Whereas the limitations on transportation and travel and \n     closing of businesses have had a devastating economic impact \n     throughout the region and may cause social instability and \n     exacerbate the humanitarian crisis if not properly managed \n     and offset;\n       Whereas the international community has committed to \n     support solutions to the current limitations on air traffic \n     and establish a common operational platform to address acute \n     problems associated with food security, protection, water, \n     sanitation and hygiene, primary and secondary health care, \n     and education, as well as the longer-term recovery effort \n     that will be needed in the face of the complex social \n     consequences of this emergency;\n       Whereas the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the \n     Congo and Uganda have sent experts familiar with such \n     outbreaks to Liberia to assist with the outbreak response, \n     and the Governments of Senegal and Ghana have agreed to serve \n     as logistics and coordination centers for the international \n     assistance effort, providing vital corridors for supplies and \n     personnel;\n       Whereas, after visiting affected communities in West \n     Africa, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director \n     Tom Frieden said on September 2, 2014, ``There is a window of \n     opportunity to tamp this down, but that window is closing . . \n     . we need action now to scale up the response.'';\n       Whereas the United States Government has provided more than \n     $175,000,000 in support through the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention, the United States Agency for \n     International Development, the World Health Organization, and \n     the United States Armed Forces since February 2014 and \n     intends to mobilize additional resources and support as \n     announced by President Obama on September 16, 2014;\n       Whereas the United States Government helped to fund the \n     development of the Zmapp biopharmaceutical experimental drug \n     that was given to United States health workers afflicted with \n     the virus and was recently donated to Liberian doctors with \n     encouraging effect and has prompted calls for further \n     research and development of such vaccines;\n       Whereas, on August 5, 2014, the United States Government \n     deployed a multi-agency Disaster Assistance Response Team \n     composed of staff from Federal agencies, including the United \n     States Agency for International Development, the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Defense, \n     the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Forest \n     Service to coordinate the United States Government's response \n     efforts;\n       Whereas the World Health Organization published on August \n     28, 2014, a roadmap for scaled-up response that aims to stop \n     the virus in 6 to 9 months and calls for 750 international \n     and 12,000 local health workers to contribute to the halt of \n     the Ebola outbreak; and\n       Whereas, earlier this year, the United States Government \n     joined with partner governments, the World Health \n     Organization, other multilateral organizations, and \n     nongovernmental actors to launch the Global Health Security \n     Agenda, a 5-year commitment to prevent, detect, and \n     effectively respond to infectious disease threats such as \n     Ebola: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the committee-reported amendment to the preamble be \nagreed to, the preamble, as amended, be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 541) was agreed to.\n  The committee-reported amendment to the preamble in the nature of a \nsubstitute was agreed to.\n  The preamble, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, as amended, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 541\n\n       Whereas Ebola hemorrhagic fever is an extremely infectious \n     virus that causes severe illness with a fatality rate that \n     can well exceed 50 percent;\n       Whereas Ebola

Ebola outbreaks, is not contained;\n       (3) expresses support for those affected by this epidemic \n     and affirms its sympathy for victims of Ebola and their \n     families;\n       (4) supports the Governments of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra \n     Leone, Nigeria, Senegal, and the Democratic Republic of the \n     Congo for their ongoing efforts to combat the Ebola virus in \n     their countries and regionally;\n       (5) urges citizens of affected countries to respect \n     preventative guidelines provided by their governments and \n     medical professionals from Africa and around the world in \n     order to stem the outbreak;\n       (6) supports the work of the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention, the United States Agency for International \n     Development, the Department of Defense, the Department of \n     Health and Human Services, the Department of State, the \n     Forest Service, and other United States Government agencies \n     providing technical, logistical, and material support to \n     address the Ebola crisis in West Africa;\n       (7) encourages deepened United States and international \n     commitments to the global Ebola response;\n       (8) welcomes the delivery of assistance and increased \n     engagement from donors such as the Economic Community of West \n     African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union, the World \n     Bank, the European Union, and the Government of Canada;\n       (9) expresses support for the promotion of investments in \n     global health in order to ensure that governments can better \n     prevent and detect, contain, and eventually eliminate \n     outbreaks of disease while also providing other essential \n     health services;\n       (10) supports the World Health Organization's Ebola \n     Response Roadmap and a common operational platform in \n     response to the crisis;\n       (11) encourages the Governments of Guinea, Liberia, \n     Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone to work together and with \n     other nations and regional and subregional organizations to \n     establish institutional emergency response systems to more \n     effectively respond to this and future outbreaks of Ebola and \n     other highly infectious diseases;\n       (12) welcomes proactive measures taken by governments in \n     West Africa to formulate national plans of action in response \n     to the crisis; and\n       (13) recognizes the work of thousands of African, United \n     States, and international officials and volunteers on the \n     ground in West Africa, particularly healthcare workers, who \n     are working diligently and at great risk to help address this \n     multidimensional crisis, and encourages other healthcare \n     workers and logisticians to volunteer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url":
