Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the leadership time \nis reserved.\n\n\n                           Budget Resolution\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, it is my understanding that at 10 a.m. the \nSenate will proceed to a cloture vote on the proposed budget. It has \nalready been passed by the House of Representatives. The cloture vote \nwill take 60 Senators. If those 60 votes are in favor, we would then \nmove to a period of debate--pro forma debate, actually, because the \nquestion would already have been decided. If Members do not favor this \nbudget, the time to register that opposition is this morning. At 10 \na.m. is the last chance to say no to this proposal and simply send it \nback to the negotiators and ask them to do a better job.\n  I rise this morning to reiterate my strong opposition to the House-\npassed budget, to the Murray-Ryan budget. I do so for one specific \nreason. I would first interject that there are many aspects of the \nbudget that Members do not like, that we are not overly delighted with. \nWe realized from the outset that there would be compromises and \nunpleasant decisions that had to be made because when you find \nadditional revenues, when you cut programs that are popular, it hurts \nand it is uncomfortable. So I appreciate the fact that Senator Murray \nand Representative Ryan have made tough decisions. Apparently, the \nHouse of Representatives on a bipartisan basis has agreed to go along. \nBut my objection that moves me from ``undecided'' to a ``no'' is what \nthe budget does to current and military retirees and the fact that it \nbreaks a promise that has been made to military retirees for years and \nyears. It does so retroactively, unlike what it does to Federal \nemployees, unlike what this Congress directed on an earlier occasion \nwhen establishing a commission to look into retirement. What it does to \nmilitary retirees under the age of 62, instead of receiving the same \ncost-of-living adjustment everyone else would be receiving, it cuts \ntheir COLA back to COLA less 1 percent.\n  Why do we have a cost-of-living adjustment in the first place? The \ncost-of-living adjustment is designed to protect the purchasing power \nof a pension. So when a young man or young woman joined the military, \nsay, 20 years ago at age 22, for example, they served for 20 years at \nleast and they were entitled to a pension under the law. That was the \ndeal. We agreed also that once that pension was received and was in \nplace, we would protect that pension against inflation each year by a \ncost-of-living adjustment. It is simply fair. It protects the \npurchasing power and the real ability of that pension to protect and \nsupport the retired military person and that person's family.\n  What this budget does is it goes back on that promise. It says to \npeople who have completed their service, who have completed the full 20 \nyears of their bargain: You may have done what we asked you to do, but \nnow the government is not going to do what we told you we would do. We \nare not going to protect the purchasing power of your pension. In the \nfirst year, we are going to cut that cost-of-living back 1 percent. The \nnext year, whatever cost-of-living there is out there, you get that \nless 1 percent.\n  It adds up over time. I think Members have been astonished to learn \nthat an E-7 retiring at age 40 today; that is, an enlisted person, \nwould experience a loss of $83,000 in purchasing power over the course \nof the 22 years that pensioner would experience between ages 40 and \n62--$83,000 in broken promises to our military retirees. An O-5 would \nlose some $124,000 lifetime with this budget agreement.\n  It is on the verge of being adopted. The only thing that stands in \nthe way between our military retirees and this broken promise amounting \nto $83,000 for the typical enlisted person and $124,000 for the typical \nretiree officer--the only thing standing in the way is this vote at 10 \na.m. on cloture.\n  Forty-one of us could say to the Senate: Hold on a minute. We know we \nhave a problem. We know we have an $80 billion package. But there is $6 \nbillion of it here that is unfair to military retirees. We can do \nbetter than that.\n  There are amendments we would like to offer. There are amendments \nSenator Graham would like to offer. There is an amendment by Senator \nAyotte, the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, that would \neliminate this broken promise to our military retirees and pay for it \nwith other savings elsewhere, savings that have already been endorsed \nas good government and are simply a matter of tightening up the \nenforcement of laws that are already there.\n  We can find, my colleagues, $6 billion elsewhere without breaking a \npromise to people who during the time of a global war on terror have \nstood forward, donned the uniform of the United States of America, and \nvolunteered time and time again to re-up, to go overseas, place \nthemselves in harm's way, and embark on a career in the U.S. military. \nWe can pass a budget that accomplishes the goals of Murray-Ryan without \nbreaking this promise. I so hope we will. But this is the time. Forty-\nseven minutes from now is the opportunity we will have. After that, it \nis a simple majority. The deal will be done. The news accounts say that \nthe debate is over, that the votes are already in.\n  I would hope that somewhere someone within the sound of my voice is \nrealizing this is just another example of the government breaking its \nword. When we do this, when we tell falsehoods and change our minds and \nchange our positions to the American people over and over again, what \ndoes that do to the confidence the American people should have in their \ngovernment and the confidence in their elected officials to do what we \npromised to do and to fulfil our side of the agreement?\n  I implore my colleagues even at this late hour to take a pause, \nperhaps ask the committee, the conference committee which I was a \nmember of and which was not consulted, to take another look, find the \n$6 billion in savings elsewhere, and fulfill our promise to the \nAmerican people.\n  One other point before I yield back. I wish to point out that a \ncommission was established last year by Congress entitled the Military \nCompensation and Retirement Modernization Commission. The purpose of \nthis commission is to provide us with a comprehensive list of ways to \nmake meaningful reforms to military pay and benefits.\n  Members should remember that we specifically told this commission it \ncould recommend any option as long as it grandfathered in those who \ncurrently serve and those who are currently retired. That was the sense \nof the Senate, and that was the sense of the Congress last year.\n\n[[Page S8871]]\n\n  This is one reason why military retirees are so surprised by this \nreversal--so surprised that we would be on the brink of changing the \nrules in the middle of the game--because we specifically said, only \nlast year, that we would not do such a thing. I hope we will honor that \npromise, and there is yet time for the Senate to do so.\n  For this reason, I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on the cloture vote \nwhich will begin shortly.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, before the Senator speaks--I have the \nlast 10 minutes before the vote--so I ask unanimous consent the Senator \nget 2 minutes and then I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the budget conference didn't meet. We \ndidn't produce a budget in conference. Our conferees did not vote. The \ntwo leaders of the conference, Senator Murray and Congressman Ryan, \nprepared the legislation now before us which has a number of problems, \nin my opinion. To skip the conference and create this legislation \ninstead is not the right way to have conducted this process.\n  But the question is, Should we advance with this legislation or does \nit need to be improved? I believe it can be improved, I believe it \nshould be improved, and I believe legislation of this size and scope \nshould be carefully considered. Since this bill actually amends the \nBudget Control Act of the United States, which has successfully \ncontained the growth and spending for a couple of years the Budget \nControl Act ought not to be altered without more care and thought.\n  I suggest the right vote today would be to vote against cloture and \nsay to the leadership and Senator Reid that we want to have amendments \non this legislation.\n  If this legislation goes forward, we are about to have a significant \nreduction in the retirement benefits of disabled military personnel, \npeople who have served 20 years in the U.S. military. The pay is going \nto be cut as much as $70,000 for a staff sergeant over their lifetime. \nWe need to think about that.\n  This legislation, amazingly and disappointingly, has altered the \nability of this Senate to block increases in spending. We have a budget \npoint of order today which allows an objection to be raised to require \n60 votes in order to spend more than we agreed to spend. This \nlegislation takes that away. Perhaps the House didn't understand the \nsignificance of it, but it is very significant. We have used it three \nseparate times successfully to block tax-and-spend legislation within \nthe last year or so and help us stay with the commitment we made to the \nAmerican people to keep spending at an agreed-upon level.\n  So, colleagues, there are a lot of problems with this bill. But the \nonly way to fix it would be to say to Senator Reid and the Democratic \nleadership in the Senate: Let's slow down, let's give Senators a chance \nto have actual amendments, and let's fix some of the problems. There is \nplenty of time to fix those problems, send the bill back to the House, \nand be able to pass it before the deadline of January 15.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, through the past few years in Congress we \nhave lurched from one budget crisis to another, from one fiscal cliff \nto the next. When one countdown clock stopped, it wasn't too long \nbefore the next one got started.\n  The uncertainty was devastating to our very fragile economic \nrecovery. The constant crisis cost us billions of dollars in lost \ngrowth and jobs, and the continued across-the-board cuts from \nsequestration were hurting our families and our communities and cutting \noff critical investments in economic growth and national security \nprograms.\n  After the completely unnecessary government shutdown and debt limit \ncrisis just 2 months ago, the American people were more disgusted than \never at the gridlock and the dysfunction. They were sick of \npartisanship, sick of showboating and saber rattling. They were tired \nof turning on their televisions at night and seeing elected officials \nsaying: It is my way or the highway, and they had no more patience for \npoliticians holding the economy and the Federal Government hostage to \nextract concessions or score political points.\n  So when the government was finally reopened and the debt limit crisis \naverted, people across the country were hoping Democrats and \nRepublicans could finally get in a room, make some compromises, and \ntake a step away from the constant crises. That is why I was so glad \nthat part of that crisis-ending deal was creating the budget conference \nthat many of us on both sides of the aisle had been trying to start \nsince the Senate and House passed our budgets 7 months earlier.\n  The budget conference began at a time when distress between Democrats \nand Republicans could not have been higher. We had just 2 months to get \na deal to avoid lurching toward another crisis, and most people assumed \nthere was no way the divide could be bridged. But Chairman Ryan and I \ngot together and we started talking and we decided that instead of \ntrying to solve everything at once, the most important thing we could \ndo for the families we represented was to end the uncertainty and start \nrebuilding some trust. We weren't going to spend the next 8 weeks \nsniping at each other from our partisan corners, we were not going to \nuse what was said in the room to launch political attacks on the other, \nand we weren't going to try to tackle the larger challenges we both \nknow are critical but aren't going to be solved right now. So we \nfocused on what was attainable. We worked together to find common \nground, and we looked for ways we could compromise and take some steps \ntoward the other. We both thought the least we should be able to do is \nto find a way to replace some of the across-the-board cuts from \nsequestration and agree on a spending level for the short term so we \ncould avoid another crisis.\n  I know some of our colleagues want to keep the sequester caps. But \nDemocrats and many Republicans believe it makes sense to replace these \nmeat-ax cuts with smarter and more balanced savings.\n  We spent 7 weeks working on this. I worked very closely with the \nHouse Budget Committee's ranking member Chris Van Hollen as well as my \ncolleagues in the Senate on and off the Budget Committee, and I am very \nproud that last week Chairman Ryan and I reached an agreement on the \nbipartisan Budget Act of 2013.\n  This bill passed the House of Representatives Thursday on a vote of \n332 to 94, with overwhelming support from Democrats and Republicans. I \ncome to the floor to urge my colleagues to support this bill in the \nSenate and send it to the President so it can be signed into law.\n  The bipartisan Budget Act puts jobs and economic growth first by \nrolling back sequestration's harmful cuts to education, medical \nresearch, infrastructure investments, and defense jobs for the next 2 \nyears. If we didn't get a deal, we would have faced another continuing \nresolution that would have locked in the automatic cuts or, worse, a \npotential government shutdown in just a few short weeks.\n  Over the past year, I have heard from so many people across my home \nState of Washington who have told me sequestration has hurt their \nfamilies, businesses, and communities--from the parents of children \nwhose Head Start Programs were shut down and seniors wondering whether \nMeals On Wheels would continue, the scientists and doctors whose \ninvestments in cutting-edge research and medical cures were cut off or \nthreatened, the construction workers who lost their jobs when projects \nwere put on hold, small business owners whose revenues were declining \ndue to the cuts and uncertainty, and so many more. For them, the cuts \nfrom sequestration were senseless. They were real, they were hurting, \nand they were only going to get worse. So I am very proud that our bill \nreplaces almost two-thirds of this year's sequester cuts to domestic \ndiscretionary investments.\n\n[[Page S8872]]\n\n  This will not solve every problem sequestration has caused, but it is \na step in the right direction and a dramatic improvement over the \nstatus quo.\n  Over the past year I have talked to workers at Joint Base Lewis-\nMcChord and Fairchild Air Force Base and elsewhere who have been very \nmuch impacted by the sequestration and very worried about how another \nround of cuts would affect their jobs and families. I have heard from \nmilitary leaders who told me sequestration would impact our national \nsecurity if it continued and from companies that do business with the \nDefense Department that the uncertainty and the cuts were hurting their \nability to hire workers and invest in future growth. So I am very glad \nthis bill will prevent the upcoming round of defense sequestration and \nprovide some certainty to the Pentagon for the upcoming years.\n  Secretary of Defense Hagel and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nDempsey have both expressed support for this bill, as have a number of \ncolleagues in Congress who have spent the last few years highlighting \nthe impact of continued sequestration on national security and defense \nworkers.\n  The increased investments we get from rolling back sequestration over \nthe next 2 years are fully replaced with a smarter, balanced mix of new \nrevenue and more responsible spending cuts. Experts and economists have \nsaid the responsible thing to do is increase investments now while our \neconomic recovery remains fragile and workers are still fighting to get \nback on the job, while tackling our deficit and debt over the long run. \nThis bill moves us in the direction of exactly that.\n  We have cut our deficit in half over the past few years, and this \nbill adds to the $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction done since 2011 \nwith an additional $23 billion in savings over the next 10 years.\n  This bill is not exactly what I would have written on my own. I am \npretty sure it is not what Chairman Ryan would have written on his own.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. This bill is a compromise, and that means neither side \ngot everything they wanted and both of us had to give a bit.\n  I was very disappointed we were not able to close a single wasteful \ntax loophole that benefits the wealthiest Americans and biggest \ncorporations. I had hoped to extend critical support for workers who \nare fighting to get back on the job. I was very disappointed that \nRepublicans refused to allow that to be part of this deal. I certainly \nwould have liked to have replaced more of sequestration. I know it was \ndifficult for many Republicans to accept any increases in the BCA caps \nat all.\n  I know many Republicans had hoped this would be an opportunity to \nmake the kind of Medicare and Social Security benefit cuts they have \nadvocated in the past, but I fought hard to keep them out.\n  This deal is a compromise. It doesn't tackle every one of the \nchallenges we face as a nation, but that was never our goal. This \nbipartisan bill takes the first steps toward rebuilding our broken \nbudget process and hopefully toward rebuilding our broken Congress.\n  We have spent far too long here scrambling to fix artificial crises \ninstead of working together to solve the big problems we all know we \nneed to address. We have budget deficits that have improved but have \nnot disappeared, and we have deficits in education, innovation, and \ninfrastructure that continue to widen. There is so much more we need to \ndo to create jobs, boost our economy, replace the remaining years of \nsequestration, and tackle our long-term fiscal challenges fairly and \nresponsibly.\n  I am hopeful that this deal can be just the first of many bipartisan \ndeals, that it can rebuild some of the trust, bring Democrats and \nRepublicans together, and demonstrate that government can work for the \npeople we all represent.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan Budget Act of 2013.\n  I thank Chairman Ryan for his work with me over the last several \nmonths. I thank a number of Members who have worked very closely with \nus, including Ranking Member Van Hollen and every Member of our Budget \nCommittee here in the Senate who worked hard to pass a budget, start a \nconference, and get a bipartisan deal.\n  When we come back next year, I will be ready to get to work with \nChairman Ryan or anyone else from either side of this aisle who wants \nto build on this bipartisan foundation to continue addressing our \nNation's challenges fairly and responsibly. It is not going to be easy, \nbut the American people are expecting nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/17/senate-section/article/S8872-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Cloture having been invoked on the motion to \nconcur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment, the motion to \nrefer falls as it is inconsistent with cloture.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, am I correct we are in postcloture time \nnow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to talk about the budget \nagreement that was negotiated by Senator Murray and Congressman Ryan \nand the work they did, but I first wish to relate to my colleagues \nconversations I had with numerous Marylanders over this past weekend--\npeople I didn't know who came up to me and said how pleased they were \nthat Congress was on the verge of getting something done--something \nthat will make a difference in our budget over the next 2 years. They \nwere pleased that Democrats and Republicans were actually able to reach \na compromise and that we were actually able to get our business done in \nsome regular order. They were hopeful that it would not only make a \ndifference in the budget of our Nation this year and next, but that it \nwas a sign that Democrats and Republicans were prepared to work \ntogether to do the people's business. They were pleased this was truly \nbipartisan--a real compromise--something we haven't seen enough of in \nthis Congress.\n  The American people understand that the Congress is controlled--the \nHouse by Republicans and the Senate by Democrats. They understand that. \nWhat they do not understand is how we have not been able to get \ntogether and compromise on our differences in order to move forward on \nthe important issues of our time. They are very encouraged by this \naction.\n  So I intend to support the final vote on the budget agreement, and I \nhope my colleagues will support this agreement. It provides the \nframework for appropriations bills for the next 2 years without \nsequestration. That is regular order. The appropriations committees can \nnow meet and decide the policy of our country through the \nappropriations bills as to where we believe priorities should be on \nFederal resources.\n  It allows us to operate, hopefully, without a continuing resolution. \nThe number of continuing resolutions that we have passed indicate a \nfailure because when we pass a continuing resolution, we do not adopt \nthe priorities for the current time. Instead, we just freeze in prior \nyears' priorities. We now have the opportunity to enact priorities that \nare important today, recognizing that some of the past spending is not \nnecessary and there are other areas that we need now to adopt, \nconsidering the changes in our own communities and considering the \ninternational changes.\n  It allows us to operate without the fear of a government shutdown. \nBefore I said a fear of a government shutdown because we thought we \nwould not see a government shutdown, but as we know, in October we saw \na government shutdown, and we saw people who were hurt, and we saw our \neconomy that was hurt as a result of that shutdown. Now this budget \nagreement gives us the opportunity to use regular order so we can pass \nappropriations bills or an omnibus bill that sets current priorities. \nIt allows us to do that without the fear of closing government, which \nis inefficient, costly, and harms our economy and people.\n  The framework that was adopted in this budget agreement allows us to \nprotect our Nation's seniors, disabled children, and the disadvantaged. \nThe resources can be made available to deal with our most vulnerable to \nallow us to move forward as a nation, and it shows we can work \ntogether.\n  So I strongly support this budget agreement. I do so but I want to \nexpress my disappointments. I am sure that every Member of the Senate \nwill have disappointments. But I am concerned about what is included in \nthis budget agreement and what is not included, and I want to spend a \nfew minutes talking about it.\n  I am disappointed that this is a 2-year agreement, that it does not \ncompletely remove sequestration. I think all of us would acknowledge \nthat sequestration is something we do not want to see in effect because \nit is mindless across-the-board cuts. It does not set priorities. We \nare responsible to set priorities. If you ran into a problem with your \nown home budget in your family, if you lost some income, you would not \ncut every expenditure item identically. You would make decisions. You \nwould make sure your family had a roof over them. You would make sure \nthey had food on the table. Maybe you would postpone a weekend trip. \nYou do not treat every expenditure the same. Sequestration treats every \nexpenditure the same.\n  The good news in this budget agreement--the good news--we do not \nworry about that for the next 2 years. The bad news: It returns after 2 \nyears. I know Senator Murray has worked very hard to get rid of \nsequestration. I know she is going to continue to work on that as the \nchair of the Budget Committee and, as I said earlier, I applaud her \ngreatly for being able to reach an agreement with the Republicans, \nparticularly in the House. But I would hope we could get rid of \nsequestration once and for all. Unfortunately, this budget agreement \ndoes not do it. It is for only 2 years. I would have liked to see a \nlong-term budget agreement.\n  On that, I would like to see us enact a long-term budget agreement. \nWe talk frequently about the fact that one of the most damaging parts \nto our inaction is uncertainty. When businesses have to make decisions \nand individuals have to make decisions, the uncertainty of our Federal \nbudget causes them harm, extra costs, anxiety. We need a long-term \nbudget agreement, the so-called grand bargain. Yes, we will get an \nagreement for these 2 years, but it does not take us beyond that. We \nall understand we need a responsible budget, one that deals with the \ninvestments that are important for job growth, but also reduces the \nbudget deficit.\n  I know Chairman Murray has mentioned this frequently, but let me just \nrepeat this. During the past 2 years, we have reduced the deficit by \n$2.8 trillion. We have done a good job in reining in the Federal \ndeficit. That is over the period of fiscal years 2014 to 2023, and that \nis before sequestration.\n  So when you go back to Simpson-Bowles and the amount of deficit \nreduction we were trying to get, we are about three-fourths of the way \nthere in reducing the deficit. Yes, we have to do more. We have to \ncontinue to reduce the deficit. But let us acknowledge that we have \ndone a pretty good job in reining in the Federal deficit, and I applaud \nthe Chair of the Budget Committee for her leadership in that regard.\n  We also must allow for critical investment for job growth. We are in \na global economy today. We have to invest in modernization. We need new \ninvestments in energy in this country. We need transportation \ninvestments, not just in roads and bridges, but in transit systems. We \nneed to invest in education. Education is the great equalizer in \nAmerica. We are in a global competition. We know we are behind in the \nSTEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and math. We have \npassed legislation to try to catch up. We have to fund those \ninitiatives. The Federal Government has to be an active partner in \neducation.\n  I can mention many agencies, but I always like to mention the \nNational Institutes of Health, which happens to be headquartered in my \nState of Maryland. It is very important to New Jersey, the Presiding \nOfficer's State, and very important to every part of our country. Why? \nBecause they do the basic research which is the building block for the \ntype of technology growth which is critically important in America.\n  We have the best trained people here in America. We need to invest in \nthe basic research so we can continue to lead the world. Yes, the \nbudget for NIH has not been as strong as it needs to be. We have to \ninvest more money in that.\n\n  There are many reasons we need a long-term budget agreement. We need \nit for predictability, so we do not govern from one manufactured crisis \nto another manufactured crisis. But we\n\n[[Page S8874]]\n\nalso need it so we can invest in critical investments for job growth in \nAmerica. That is another reason why I hope we are able to build on this \n2-year agreement for a longer-term budget agreement.\n  We also need to protect the safety nets as we do that. We need a \nbalance here, and those who are most vulnerable need to be assured \ntheir government is on their side to help them, whether they are our \nseniors, whether they are people with disabilities, whether it is young \npeople who need an opportunity to be able to take advantage of the \nopportunities in America.\n  We need to enhance the protection of our environment for future \ngenerations and have an energy policy that makes sense not only for \nAmerica's security and environment but also for our economy.\n  So a balanced agreement for a long-term budget, which is not in this \nagreement, would give us that predictability, would give us that \nability to move forward. To do that we need to deal with mandatory \nspending. This budget agreement deals with discretionary spending. It \ndoes not deal with mandatory spending.\n  We have taken steps to move in this direction. The passage of the \nAffordable Care Act puts in place a manner in which we can deal with \nhealth care costs, by reducing the growth rate of health care \nexpenditures, by dealing with the readmissions to hospitals, by \nmanaging complicated illnesses, duplicative tests, getting people out \nof the emergency room into our clinics and into preventive care, having \nseniors take advantage of preventive health care because they do not \nhave to pay a copayment that they could not afford.\n  These are ways we improve what we call the delivery system of health \ncare in America, where you bring down the costs of health care. That is \nthe best way to bring down the mandatory spending accounts in Medicare \nand Medicaid--reduce health care costs. We need to do more of that. We \nneed to reduce the cost of our mandatory spending in this country. We \ncould have done more, and this budget agreement did not deal with that.\n  Then there is the issue of revenue. I am going to talk about revenue \nbecause I was proud to be part of the Congress that balanced the \nFederal budget when Bill Clinton was President of the United States. Do \nyou know what we did back then? We brought in more revenue, we reduced \nspending, and we balanced the budget. What happened? Our economy took \noff. We were not only growing jobs, we were growing good-paying jobs, \nand the standard of living for all Americans went up. We have to get \nback to that.\n  We are spending too much today, and we do not have enough revenue. \nYes, this agreement takes care of reducing some spending, but not all, \nand does virtually nothing about revenues. We have to get back to that. \nWe can bring in the revenue necessary to balance the Federal budget by \nreforming our Tax Code. There has been some great work done in the \nSenate Finance Committee I am privileged to serve on--Democrats and \nRepublicans taking a look at our Code to see ways we can make more \nsense out of our Tax Code. We can do things about it.\n  Let me just remind my colleagues that we spend more money in the Tax \nCode than we do through all the appropriations bills. We spend more in \nour Tax Code. Over $1 trillion a year is spent in our Tax Code. These \nare tax breaks that go to some but not all taxpayers.\n  So there is no need to raise rates. All we need to do is close \nloopholes and be more critical of how we spend our money in the Tax \nCode, as we do on the appropriations side. Every dollar we spend on the \nappropriations side is scrutinized all the time. We need to do the same \non the tax side. Quite frankly, Senator Baucus and Senator Hatch have \nworked out a way that the members of the Finance Committee can take a \nlook at some of those. I think we can reach some agreements on areas of \nthe Tax Code that are not high priorities that can reduce the revenue \nhemorrhaging we have. Put another way, if we eliminated all the tax \nbreaks that are in the Tax Code, our rates could be one-half of what \nthey are today--one-half of what they are today.\n  So we not only can bring in the revenue necessary to balance our \nFederal budget and allow for the types of investments that are \nimportant for job growth, we can actually reduce the rates for a large \nnumber of Americans. Unfortunately, that is not in this budget \nagreement. To me, that is a disappointment, that we are not dealing \nwith the balance that is necessary for a long-term budget agreement.\n  Then there is one other area I want to talk about, and it is not \ngoing to be a surprise to my colleagues--a couple of areas I want to \ntalk about, one of which is the Federal workforce.\n  This agreement provides for a 1.3-percent increase in retirement \ncontributions for new hires under Federal service. That is on top of an \nincrease that was just done a year ago on the extension of the payroll \ntax, where we increased the retirement contributions for new hires. We \nalso, in this budget agreement, have a reduction in the COLA increases \nfor military retirees.\n  I think that is regrettable. I do not believe that should have been \nin this budget agreement. Our civilian workforce has already \ncontributed. When you add up what will be done by retirement \ncontributions, that is going to be over $20 billion. We have had 3 \nyears of a pay freeze. We have a way in our law where we make \nadjustments to our civilian workforce pay each year that reflects not \nthe cost of living, something less than the cost of living. Our Federal \nworkforce has seen a freeze. They have not gotten that for the last 3 \nyears. That is close to $100 billion in contribution to the deficit. \nThey have already done that. So they have contributed already about \n$120 billion-plus, and that does not include--does not include--the \nfact that many of our Federal workforce have had to endure furloughs as \na result of sequestration and government shutdowns.\n  So our Federal workforce has contributed. These are predominantly \nmiddle class families, a large number of veterans, a large number of \nwomen, a large number of minorities. They have contributed more than \nany other group of working Americans already in dealing with this \ndeficit reduction, and I find it very regrettable that this retirement \ncontribution provision was included in the budget agreement.\n  Let me just quote, if I might, from the nonprofit Partnership for \nPublic Service that commented to Senator Murray and Representative Ryan \nduring the budget negotiations. I quote this for what they say because \nI think it expresses my view and I hope the view of all the Members of \nthe Senate:\n\n       As you work to put our federal government on a sustainable \n     fiscal path, we encourage you in the strongest possible terms \n     to treat the federal workforce as the considerable asset that \n     it is, and ensure it is appropriately trained, compensated \n     and resourced to serve the American people with excellence \n     for the long term.\n       The federal civilian service is smaller today on a per \n     capita basis than at almost any time since the Kennedy \n     Administration--yet its responsibilities are greater than \n     ever. Rather than asking how to make the federal workforce \n     smaller or less expensive, Congress should be asking what we \n     need the Federal Government to do, and what it will take to \n     ensure that we have a workforce with the necessary skills in \n     appropriate quantities to execute those responsibilities with \n     maximum effect at a reasonable expense.\n       Proposals to freeze federal pay, change retirement \n     contributions or reduce the workforce through attrition do \n     nothing to improve the capacity and performance of the \n     federal government and those who serve in its civilian \n     workforce. These proposals are easy and expedient, but they \n     miss the opportunity to make real and sustained improvements \n     in how the Federal Government manages its people.\n\n  I could not agree more with those comments. We have a smaller \nworkforce today, asked to do more extremely important work. These are \npeople who are protecting our food supply. These are the great \nscientists who are doing the research to give us what we need, new \ntechnologies in health care. These are people making sure our seniors \nget the services they so richly need and deserve. These are people who \nare on the frontline in so many different ways.\n  Our responsibility is to make sure they have the resources to carry \nout their mission. Yes, we make value judgments as to what are the \npriorities, but to put our class of Federal workers through additional \ncuts, to me, is wrong. I regret that was included in the budget \nagreement.\n  I also wish to mention I was disappointed that we were not able to \nuse\n\n[[Page S8875]]\n\nthis last train that will reach the finish line before we recess to \nextend unemployment insurance. Some 1.3 million workers are in danger \nof losing benefits come January 1. In 2014, as many as 4.7 million \nworkers will not be getting the extended benefit, 83,000 of whom are \nlocated in my State of Maryland.\n  Let my point out, I know the unemployment rates are getting lower. We \nare all working to make sure to get them as low as we can. But they are \nstill substantially higher than they were when we first recognized that \nwe needed to have extended Federal unemployment benefits because of the \nsoftness in our economy. Particularly for those who are long-term \nunemployed, it is extremely difficult to find a job. If you are \nunemployed and you are looking for work, it is tough out there.\n  So the right thing for us to do is to continue these benefits for \npeople who are actively looking for work and cannot find jobs. This is \nan insurance program. The moneys have been collected during good times \nso that we pay during these times. The money is there. We need to make \nsure those benefits are continued. I was disappointed it was not \nincluded in the legislation. It will help our economy grow.\n  There are more and more economic studies that show every dollar we \nmake available in unemployment compensation returns much more to our \neconomy in job growth. So this is hurting ourselves by not extending \nit, plus we are hurting millions of Americans who are going to be more \nvulnerable in trying to keep their families together during these very \nchallenging times.\n  Let me conclude by saying that as I said in the beginning, this is an \nimportant budget agreement to get approved. I strongly support it. I \napplaud the leadership of Senator Murray and Congressman Ryan in \nbringing us to this moment. My constituents believe this is a very \nimportant step forward, showing that we can compromise and work \ntogether and get our work done.\n  In a few days we will bring the first session of the 113th Congress \nto a close and leave Washington to spend the holidays with our families \nand friends. I hope each one of us will use that time to reflect on the \nextraordinary privilege of being a Member of Congress. I hope each one \nof us will reflect on the extraordinary challenges our Nation faces. I \nhope each one of us will come to the conclusion that we can do \nextraordinary things if we work together. The American people demand \nand deserve no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to express my disappointment that the \nbudget deal we will soon be voting on reflects just that, a deal--not \nlegislation, a deal. It raises spending above the cap. That is the \nspending limit we put in place just 2 years ago.\n  It raises revenue from hard-working Americans to pay for this new \nspending and promises to cut some spending in the future. We have seen \nbefore how that story ends. We have already read that book. We will \nspend more now, we will grow the government more now, and ultimately \nthe spending cuts will never materialize.\n  I have a favorite retired truckdriver in Pinedale, WY, who has \nsuggested that we need to quit putting people in the wagon and get more \npeople pulling the wagon. What he, of course, is referring to is the \nway we are growing government. Every time we grow government we put \nsome more people in this wagon that the private sector has to pull. \nYes, everybody in government pays taxes. But not one person in the \ngovernment pays as much in taxes as they earn, so they become a part of \nthe burden in the wagon.\n  Yes, even Senators are part of that burden in the wagon. But we are \ngetting less and less people pulling the wagon. They are getting a \nlittle tired of pulling the wagon. I am going to show some things that \nare happening in this budget that are making it even tougher for them \nto pull the wagon.\n  So this is not the right path forward. My constituents back home in \nWyoming and Americans across this country deserve better. We talk about \nhow we have reduced the deficit. Reduced the deficit? Yes, that means \nwe used to be overspending $1 trillion a year, and now we are only \noverspending $500 billion, which is one-half trillion. That is still \noverspending.\n  Families across America know you cannot keep spending more than you \ntake in. Is there any indication that this causes a problem? We have \nbeen experiencing some of the lowest interest rates in the history of \nthe country, which means the Federal Government has been able to borrow \nits money for less than it ever has before.\n  A few months ago I went to one of these bond sales. It was $40 \nbillion worth of bond sales, sold in 30 minutes. People in other \ncountries had so much confidence in the United States that they were \nwilling to pay us to take their money. They put in bids of negative \ninterest rates. They paid us to take their money, to keep it, to make \nsure it was secure. They believed it would be secure. So they paid us a \nnegative interest rate.\n  At that particular bond sale, the interest rate was .86 percent to \nborrow $40 billion. That is what it averaged out at. Last week we did \nbond sales. Last week we sold $30 billion worth of bonds. I do not know \nhow many minutes it took to do that, but it was a relatively short \nperiod of time, probably less than 30 minutes as well.\n  Do you know what the interest rate was? It was 3.90 percent. In just \na few months it has gone from .86 to 3.90. Is that factored into this \nbudget? I bet you it is not. If that interest rate keeps going up, if \nit hits 5 percent, we are not going to be able to do nearly as much as \nwe are now. We have to pay our interest first, otherwise we have \nbankrupted the United States and proven it.\n  When we talk about raising the debt ceiling, it is a minor issue \ncompared to being able to pay the interest on the debt. If it keeps \ngoing up significantly, we and our kids and our grandkids are not going \nto be able to pay the debt. That is what I hear across Wyoming. That is \nwhat I hear across America. So what are we trying to do? We are trying \nto come up with a reasonable amount of spending for the United States. \nThis budget does not do it.\n  Because Members are going to be voting on a deal rather than a bill \nthat had the opportunity to be improved through the committee process \nwith feedback from other Members, we will not have the opportunity to \ndiscuss the potential unintended consequences and address them before \nthey become law. I just heard 15 minutes of that discussion from the \nSenator from Maryland who knows a whole bunch of items that are in this \nbill that he is upset with, and I, quite frankly, think he ought to be \nupset with.\n  But I am on that conference committee. When the deal was made, we \nread about it in the papers just like everybody else. We did not get \nany special notice that there had been a deal made. On conference \ncommittees, I have seen the deals made before. I have never seen one \nmade by so few people before. In this one there was a Democrat from the \nSenate and a Republican from the House. The two of them came up with a \nconclusion that this is what we should have.\n  That is not too bad, provided it goes through a normal process, which \nmeans we get to make some amendments. When we make amendments, some \npass, some fail. But at least we get to bring up the unintended \nconsequences that we see. That is why we have so many people in \nCongress: 100 here and 435 on the other side. That is why we have a \nwhole lot of backgrounds looking at everything that happens around here \nfrom a whole lot of perspectives so maybe we can stop the unintended \nconsequences.\n  But that is only if it goes through a normal process. So far the tree \nis filled on this bill. What does that mean? That means no amendments \nallowed. Take it or leave it. No matter what you think of it, forget \nit. We are going to have some unintended consequences that are going to \ncome out of this and they are going to become law.\n  For example, I applaud the proposal that would limit access to Social \nSecurity's Death Master File to prevent identity theft, and individuals \nfrom fraudulently claiming government benefits and tax refunds \nassociated with those who have passed away. That is a good idea. \nHowever, I am concerned that certain organizations that use that same \nDeath Master File for legitimate business purposes that benefit \nconsumers may have their access restricted.\n  If we discussed these issues in committee, we might have been able to \naddress them, perhaps with a sensible solution, perhaps in a way that \nwould\n\n[[Page S8876]]\n\nhave protected the identity and still protected the benefits to the \nconsumer.\n  The budget deal makes a permanent provision that would require States \nto pay a 2-percent administrative fee to the Federal Government for the \ncollection of mineral royalties. This only affects a few States, \nparticularly Wyoming. The negotiators and the administration see this \nas an easy pot of money. We saw the same situation play out last year \nwhen the Federal Government saw a pot of money associated with the \nabandoned mine lands, that primarily go to Wyoming, and spent it on an \nunrelated highway bill.\n  When the Federal Government first started to withhold the mineral \nroyalty money owed to States, I introduced legislation with Senator \nBarrasso and Representative Lummis and a bipartisan group of \nlegislators from affected States to stop it. Each of those States is \nfully capable of collecting its own share of the mineral revenues \nwithout help from the Federal Government. We should not have to pay for \nthat. We will continue to reverse this unjust practice.\n  Another fascinating little item was when we did the sequester, the \nmoney that comes in from Federal mineral royalties to the Federal \nGovernment was considered to be revenue. The money that went out, which \nis by law to the States, was considered to be revenue to the States \nthat passed through the Federal Government. The Federal Government took \n5.3 percent out of it until, of course, we started having a lot of \nsuccess at reversing both this 2 percent that I just talked about and \nthe stealing of the Federal mineral royalties. Suddenly the Federal \nGovernment said: Oh, that was a mistake. You are going to get your full \nhalf of the Federal mineral royalties less, of course, the 2 percent.\n  Another little problem is the deal raises premiums private companies \npay the Federal Government to guarantee their pension benefits. That is \nsomething we have also insisted on. We have said companies need to pay \na fee so if they go out of business, the people they promised a pension \nto will get at least 60 percent of what they were promised. That is \nsupposed to be a trust fund, a trust fund to be able to pay those \npeople if the company goes out of business.\n  We have addressed that a number of times. We have held that \nsacrosanct until a couple of years ago. This raises the premium. That \nis gentle for a new tax. A premium is a tax. If every company has to \npay another $200 per employee who receives a pension, that is a tax.\n  If it goes into the trust fund, maybe it is a fee. But here is the \nreal kicker: This money we raise does not go to the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation, so it is a tax increase. It does not shore up \nthis trust fund. It will be spent on discretionary programs, and it \nwill be spent this year. But it will be collected for 10 years. How \nmany people in America get to take 10 years of revenue, spend it this \nyear, and then not worry about it? Nobody that I know of.\n\n  Employers are still in the process of implementing and paying for a \n$9 billion tax increase called for in the highway bill last year. That, \nagain, is a 10-year tax to build highways for 2 years. When that \nhighway bill comes up, where are we going to steal the money next time?\n  There is always the Social Security trust fund and a whole bunch of \nother trust funds. I can hear the yelling about that, and I will join \nthe yelling about that if it is even considered. If we can tap it in \nthe private sector, undoubtedly we can tap it in the government sector \nas well.\n  A $9 billion increase, that was for the highway bill. We have another \n$200 per employee, so we have another $900 billion increase that is put \non the backs of private industry, the ones pulling the wagon that I \ntalked about. To put it simply, over 2 years the flat-rate premium will \nhave increased 40 percent, and over 3 years the variable-rate premium--\nwhich is a tax if it doesn't go where it is supposed to--will have \nincreased over 100 percent. That is a huge tax.\n  I guarantee that will end the willingness of some companies to \ncontinue pensions. Pensions are voluntary.\n  If the cost to continue them goes up, the companies will reevaluate.\n  In fact, I can state that they are reevaluating right now. When we \nare looking at $200 per year per employee, we have to take a look at \nhow that affects this. Pensions will change drastically because of this \nagreement.\n  A few of the concerns I have just raised could be addressed, if not \nin committee, then on the Senate floor. Once again, the majority leader \nhas decided that no amendments will be allowed. They won't be allowed \nto be offered, and they won't be allowed to be voted on.\n  I filed two amendments to the budget deal that are relevant to this \ndiscussion. One was with Senator Murphy regarding the need to follow \ncongressional intent and to clarify that the funding of the accounting \nstandards-setting bodies is not subject to sequestration.\n  We have a system where there are rules set up to have generally \naccepted accounting principles, and we have a body that is supposed to \nbe very independent that is supposed to come up with those rules.\n  We do force the companies that are in the accounting business to pay \nfor that body, to standardize the accounting process. It comes directly \nfrom the accountants, and it is supposed to go directly to this \naccounting board. We have decided that sequestration should take a \nlittle chunk out of that. That should not happen. That is stealing \nmoney again. That is one of the amendments.\n  Another one was to strike the language making it permanent for the \nFederal Government to withhold 2 percent of mineral royalty owed to the \nStates for administrative expenses. We should have the opportunity to \ndiscuss, debate, and vote on them on the Senate floor.\n  There are a lot of others, but those are the two primary ones. We \nhave to stop dealmaking and we have to start legislating.\n  Our constituents sent us here to legislate. They deserve better than \na deal agreed to behind closed doors without input and improvements \nfrom the rest of the legislators, not even the committee to which it \nwas assigned. Even though I am disappointed in the process that has led \nto this point today, I am even more disappointed in the product that \nresulted from the dealmaking.\n  This budget deal breaks the promise we made to our constituents in \n2011--as part of the Budget Control Act--that we would reduce spending. \nIt has worked. It hasn't worked the way a lot of people would like for \nit to work because it has been across-the-board. But for the first time \nsince the Korean War, it has reduced spending 2 consecutive years.\n  We were close. After 2014, overall discretionary spending would have \nincreased even with the sequester. Yes, we were almost at the end of \nthe part of taking down the spending, but we couldn't find the will to \nprioritize spending this year under the current spending levels and, \ninstead, decided to ask Americans to send in more of their hard-earned \nmoney to Washington so the Federal Government could spend it the same \nway we always have--promise the cuts in the end and take more money in \nthe beginning.\n  I think my constituents in Wyoming know best how to spend their \nmoney. Of course, this penalizes them for their principled budgeting \nwhich they have been doing and makes it look as if they have money. \nEvery State could have money if they were as careful as Wyoming has \nbeen.\n  Washington, DC, has a spending problem. We don't have a revenue \nproblem. We can think of all kinds of things we would like to spend \nmoney on, things that we think would be a good deal and probably that \nwould buy some votes out there. That is wrong. We need to get things \nunder control before that 3.9 percent interest rate goes to 5 percent, \n10 percent--or it has been as high as, I think, 18 percent before.\n  The budget deal increases spending and shows the one thing that some \nDemocrats and Republicans can agree on, and that is putting off our \ndecisions. This plan spends more than the current law. It charges \npeople and States for more and uses the money to increase spending in \nnonrelated areas.\n  Spending cuts are scheduled for outlying years, and so the so-called \nsavings are used right away. Yes, just shift that money from out there \nand put it into the current spending. That isn't real. Nobody else gets \nto do it. It is only a government trick.\n  We cannot spend our way to prosperity. We need to prioritize spending\n\n[[Page S8877]]\n\ncuts. We need to find the spending cuts that will do the least harm, \nstart there, and go through an appropriations process that works. We \nhave been doing omnibus bills around here for a long time. I have \nconstituents who will start coming in January, and they will want me to \ntake a look at their program and add only a few dollars there. I have \nto tell them the last time I had a look at a line on appropriations was \nabout 5 years ago. We just take one whole lump of $1 trillion and vote \nit up or down one time. That is not doing our job. Our main job is \nspending the money. We need to prioritize those cuts.\n  I will tell us how Wyoming did it. Wyoming was facing an 8-percent \ncut, they thought. We are talking about 2.03 percent for the Federal \nGovernment. If we compress it down to only a few months, we are talking \nabout 5.3 percent. But the true amount of that sequestration was 2.3 \npercent.\n  Wyoming thought they were going to get hit for 8 percent, mostly \nbecause of some of the regulations on energy that reduced some of the \nenergy production in Wyoming.\n  How did they go about doing this? The Governor said to every single \nagency: I wish to see from you how you would spend it if you have to \ncut 2 percent, if you have to cut 4 percent, if you have to cut 6 \npercent, and if you have to cut 8 percent.\n  Do you know what he did when he got those four lists from all of the \nagencies? He looked to see if the items at 2 percent, 4 percent, 6 \npercent, and 8 percent were the same.\n  That is the way we find out what the agency thinks they can get rid \nof. That is a simple way of prioritizing spending. Did we ever do that \naround here? No. We do have a process by which the President can have \nhis agencies say what they intend to get done and then tell what they \ngot done and how well they were doing.\n  We never pay attention to that. So the ones that come out rated very \nbadly on this continue spending money as they always did. We need to \nhave a prioritization process. We need to have a way that we can look \nat some of the details of the spending bills. Putting off spending \nforever and forever, and then coming in after the fact and saying: OK, \nthis is how much we spent, how much we are going to spend, then we get \nto vote yes or no, is wrong. That again is dealmaking, not legislating, \nand it won't rein in the out-of-control spending.\n  I have talked a little bit about the prioritization we have to start \ndoing around here. When we do the sequestration, the complaints are the \nagencies will always make it hurt. I watched this when I was in the \nWyoming legislature. If we only told them how much of a cut to make and \ndidn't tell them specifically where to take it, they always did \nsomething that was very visual that their constituents would notice. \nTheir constituents would complain about, and their constituents would \nmake us put it back into the spending.\n  They didn't have to do that. There isn't any business, there isn't \ngovernment agency that doesn't have some waste. That is what ought to \ngo first.\n  Then the duplication ought to go--and there is about $900 billion a \nyear in duplication around here, but we ought to take a look at that.\n  Another thing we can do is the government shutdown legislation. That \nis the one that needs to tell those spending committees they need to \nget the leader to bring up their bill and get it finished with the \namendments in the appropriate time. If they don't, then they will have \nto cut another 1 percent off their spending every quarter until they \nget their work done. Then we don't have a shutdown, but we have a \nreduction in spending; there is some incentive for them to do that.\n  We need to do tax reform. I agree with Senator Cardin. I think that \ncould make a huge difference in how we are doing our revenue.\n  I also have a penny plan. The penny plan just takes 1 cent off of \nevery Federal dollar the Federal Government spends. When I first \nstarted looking at this, the Congressional Budget Office said that it \nwould balance the budget in 7 years. If we did that for 7 consecutive \nyears with 1 percent off every year, it would balance it in 7 years.\n  The newer valuation is that with the sequestration it balances the \nbudget in 2 years--only 2 years. When I talk to my constituents about \nit, that it would be 3.3 percent over 2 years, and it comes to almost 7 \npercent over 3 years--I think that we could do that, and we could do it \nwith so little pain--people would say: Please continue that another \ncouple of years and pay down some of the debt.\n  Just getting rid of part of the deficit means we are still \noverspending, but we ought to at some point start paying down that debt \nso we don't have to pay the interest on the debt.\n  When we pay down a little bit of the debt so we don't have to pay as \nmuch interest, we ought to use that interest that we saved to pay down \nthe debt some more. That is how we pay off things. People who have \ncredit card problems know that is the way to go about it.\n  I would also like to go to biennial budgeting. We supposedly spend $1 \ntrillion in discretionary spending and the military every year--$1 \ntrillion. That is so much money that nobody can look at it, and we \ndon't.\n  If we divided those 12 spending bills up into two packages of six, \nand we allowed them to have spending worth 2 years each time, they \ncould plan ahead much better. We would do the six toughest bills right \nafter the election, the year right after the election and we would do \nthe six easy bills just before election. We could get through those.\n  Then we could do what my constituents think that we are doing, which \nis to look at every one of those expenditures and decide whether they \nought to go up or down--allowing amendments on bills, allowing the \nspending bills to go through one at a time, maybe a week at a time. We \ncould have them all done before October, and then there wouldn't be any \ngovernment shutdown anyway.\n  There are a lot of ideas out there on what we could do. I sit up \nnights worrying about the Nation's debt and how it will affect the \nchildren of Wyoming, how it will affect my children, and how it will \naffect my grandchildren. This budget conference was an opportunity to \napply reasonable constraints to impossibly high future spending, but \ninstead we got more spending and no real plan to solve the problem. \nYes, we said, we got some savings from out there in the future. We will \nspend that now, and we will make those cuts later. It never happens.\n  For all of those reasons, I cannot support the budget deal. I hope \nour next fiscal deadline dealing with the debt limit early next year \nwill provide an opportunity for my colleagues and me to have a real \nconversation about the spending problems our country faces. The \nspending issue isn't going away. The longer we put it off, the worse it \nwill become. That is the reality our country faces.\n  I hope that we continue on the bill that says, no budget, no pay, and \nactually get that done so that we have the emphasis to actually finish \na budget much earlier. Yes, there is blame, blame enough to go around \non the budget process. We are actually too late for the budget process \nto have an impact. We are at the spending part. We are not getting to \naddress that with amendments, and I am deeply disappointed we are not \nlegislating.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Enzi for his leadership on the Budget \nCommittee. He is a long-time member, a senior member, and he has worked \nhard on these issues for years.\n  He is an accountant. He is able to add and subtract. He can see a \ndebt crisis when one is there, and I appreciate the comments he has \nmade. I believe he is exactly correct on so many of those points.\n  The Senator suggested that something is awry on the pension benefit \ncommission in which we, in effect, tax employers more supposedly to \nhelp the guarantee fund be able to honor people's pensions if a company \ngoes bankrupt. But it seems to me in simple dollars and cents if we do \nthat we can't then spend it on other items unrelated to pension \nguarantees.\n  Is that the concern the Senator has raised, essentially?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes, that is exactly the issue I was raising. We keep \npromising people that money is going to go to certain places and then \nwe divert it to other places.\n\n[[Page S8878]]\n\n  I think that under the system of accounting we use, we probably could \nget it to show up in two places and get to spend it twice. That is \ndouble the problem. So we have to start being honest with the public \nabout where we are taking the money and where we are actually putting \nthe money, and that was my purpose in making that comment.\n  I thank my colleague for his comments and for his dedication on the \nbudget. I don't think anybody spends as much time looking at those \nnumbers as the Senator from Alabama does, and commenting here on the \nfloor. It is an effort to educate America on what is really going on, \nand my colleague is very good at it. I thank him for his leadership.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank my colleague. And I was referring to the fact \nthat Senator Enzi is the one who has explained to us in a very clear \nway, from his accounting background, the problems we have had with the \npension guarantee fund, and it is a very real situation. It is \nactuarially unsound in the long run. It needs to be put on a better \nbasis, but we can't put it on a better basis if we tax the employers. \nThat may even reduce, as the Senator from Wyoming says, the number of \nemployers who provide a pension. That would be a terrible policy error, \nif we keep driving up the cost to supposedly fix the fund but then \nspend the money on something else and we therefore disincentivize the \nbusinesses from even having retirement plans for their employees. So I \nthank my colleague for raising that very important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nrecess from 12:30 until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus \nmeetings and that the time during the recess count postcloture on the \nmotion to concur in the House message to accompany H.J. Res. 59.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the bipartisan \nbudget deal that is currently before the Senate.\n  Chairman Ryan and Chairman Murray have shown us true leadership on \ndivisive and complex budget issues. The legislation we have before us \ntoday is the embodiment of compromise--something that has, \nunfortunately, been absent in Washington as of late. They have crafted \na bill that sets forth the guidelines for spending for the remainder of \nthis fiscal year and the platform for the next fiscal year.\n  This deal will set overall discretionary spending for the current \nfiscal year at $1.012 trillion--an amount that is approximately halfway \nbetween the Senate budget number and the House budget number. This \nnumber is also less than the 2014 spending level set forth in Chairman \nRyan's 2011 budget. While the overall spending number is higher than \nwhat I would have wanted, the House and Senate Budget Committee \nchairmen were able to craft a budget deal that produces $23 billion in \nnet deficit reduction. Very honestly, with the deficit we have been \nrunning, $23 billion is a mere pittance, and I think all of us who are \nconcerned about the debt and the deficit of this country would like to \nsee that number higher. But more importantly, they have produced a \nbudget that will set in place some fiscally responsible spending \npolicies and give us a way forward. Regardless of how each Member of \nthis Chamber feels about the resulting policy, we should all recognize \nthe importance of this agreement and thank the chairmen for their \ntireless work to end this chapter of political disagreement.\n  Although I would still prefer a grand bargain to solve our fiscal \ncrisis, this deal marks the first step in that journey. Congress will \nnow be in a better position to tackle the issues of taxation and \nentitlement reform in the short term, and I truly hope the committees \nof jurisdictions will take this as a sign that that does need to be \nwhat happens next if we are truly going to address our fiscal issues.\n  The budget deal before us is not perfect. There is a lot in this \nproposal to like and there is a lot in this proposal to dislike. But \nthere is one provision related to military retirement pay that will \ncertainly have to be addressed after the passage of this bill, and it \nis one of the provisions that, frankly, I don't like. I am told by \nPentagon officials that this provision basically came out of nowhere. I \nthink it is terribly unfair to our men and women in uniform. They \nshould not have a disproportionate share in our deficit reduction \nmeasures.\n  However, I feel confident this issue will be resolved in the near \nterm. I have had a conversation with the chairman of the Committee on \nArmed Services, as well as a number of other members of the Armed \nServices Committee who are committed to making sure we address this, \nand hopefully we will come up with some alternative before this \nprovision takes place, which doesn't happen, interestingly enough, \nuntil December of 2015.\n  Many Georgians have served with honor in our military, and while the \nchanges to their annual cost-of-living increase may appear \ninsignificant on paper in this bill, this is real money promised to \nthose who put their lives in harm's way in defense of this Nation. I \nwant to assure our service men and women that there is ample time to \naddress this issue before it takes effect, and I am committed to \naddressing it, and I will not turn my back on those who fight and have \nfought for this country.\n  That said, this budget deal is a necessary and crucial step toward a \nfunctioning Congress. With passage of this budget deal, we can close \nthe book on discretionary spending arguments for the next couple of \nyears. We can turn our full attention to entitlement reform and tax \nreform as Congress debates raising the debt ceiling once again next \nyear.\n  Also, with this bill we will no longer need to provide additional \nflexibility for defense spending. This bill will give the defense \ncommunity the resources they need, No. 1.\n  In conversations with top officials at the Pentagon and within the \nintelligence community over the weekend, they have urged the support of \nthis bill as a way to address their current budget crisis, and I am \nextremely sympathetic to both those communities and wanted to make sure \nthat whatever product came to the floor of the Senate did that. This \nbill does address the shortfalls and the flexibility issue in the \ndefense community and in the intelligence community.\n  I was pleased at the approach the budget chairmen took will not turn \noff sequester but will extend the mandatory cuts for an additional 2 \nyears beyond what the Budget Control Act prescribed because, as I see \nthis, this has been an $85 billion fix on the sequester that keeps it \nfrom going too deep into the defense budget, which had the potential \nfor causing real problems within the Pentagon as well as within the \nintelligence community.\n\n  With this budget deal, we can also put in place a 302(a) budget \nallocation--the top-line number Congress can spend on discretionary \nspending. For the first time in several years, this will allow the \nAppropriations Committee to do the job that it is actually intended to \ndo. Our appropriators have previously been forced to make spending \ndecisions without a top-line number and through continuing resolutions. \nThey had no information and no guidance from Congress. It is no wonder \nour spending has caught up with us. The country benefits when Congress \napproaches the appropriations process through regular order and not \nthrough last-minute continuing resolutions. This agreement makes that \nprocess more likely.\n  The Budget Committee chairmen have also made a good-faith effort to \nattack the real problems in our budget by cutting money from mandatory \nprograms rather than searching for more discretionary cuts. In their \nagreement, they took notice of how often the Federal Government has \ngiven special treatment to certain groups and they have taken efforts \nto curb that. While many outside groups may attack these reforms, they \nare representative of the types of reforms that will have to be \nincluded in any future agreement to achieve entitlement reform, which \nat the end of the day is where the real problem in our Federal budget \nlies.\n  This deal does little to address the $17 trillion debt, but it is a \nstart down that road, and I truly hope this will lead to more serious \ndiscussions on the floor of the Senate about our debt and\n\n[[Page S8879]]\n\na solution for how we are going to see that $17 trillion repaid.\n  In all, this budget deal represents a partial completion of the work \nthe American people expect from us. It is far from perfect and leaves \nmuch to be desired. But the prospect of compromise on the single most \nimportant issue of our time requires attention and serious looking at \nby every Member of this body. I will vote for the passage of this bill \nbecause it lays the groundwork for the next chapter in our pursuit of \nfiscal sanity.\n  For 3\\1/2\\ years now, Senator Warner and I have been involved in \nseeking out a much larger debt and deficit reduction deal than what is \ncurrently before us. We know the American people are tired of out-of-\ncontrol spending and don't understand why Congress can't address our \n$17 trillion debt. It is not rocket science. The Bowles-Simpson \nCommission gave us a roadmap 3 years ago this month, and I regret that \nthe White House has not followed the leadership of its own Commission. \nThis bill represents a small step toward the type of cooperation that \nwill be necessary to comprehensively address our debt and deficit. It \nis my hope that this agreement allows that effort to restart in a \nmeaningful way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish we had an agreement that is grand \nand great and would do what a lot of people have been dreaming of for \nsome time and would put us on a sound financial path for decades to \ncome. It is within our grasp. But it seems we are unable to make those \nchoices or bring that forward.\n  I believe if the President has led and given a commitment to fixing \nour financial problems in America, we could have done it in the last \nfew years. But he has not. So it has put us in a bad position, and we \nend up with the agreement we have today, which essentially would save \nsome of the risk of a government shutdown and reduce some of the \ntension, which a lot of people think is great and I do too. It would be \ngood for the country to have more predictability. It would be good for \nthe Defense Department to have more predictability. It would be good \nfor the financial community to have more predictability about what is \nhappening in Washington. But what occurred is not sufficient in any \nway, and it has been postured to look a good bit better than it is.\n  Essentially, we remain on an unsustainable financial path in America. \nThe numbers are real clear. We are seeing a reduction in our deficit in \nthe near term, but the Congressional Budget Office tells us in the next \nseveral years we will begin to see the relentless increase in deficits \nevery year, reaching almost $1 trillion again by the end of this 10-\nyear window. That is not a good path to be on.\n  We pay interest on the debt which we accrue each and every year, plus \nall the money we have borrowed previously. The amount is notable. We \nhave exceedingly low interest rates, so it is not impacting us as much \nas it is likely to impact us in the future, as they will return to the \nmean and we will see rates go up.\n  But just to point out that this agreement--the legislation before \nus--spends $63 billion to $70 billion in the next 2 years. Where does \nthat money come from? Essentially, it adds to the debt. But we are told \nnot to worry because we have other cuts in spending, other fees that \nwill come in, which will eventually pay for it. But over half of the \npay-fors occur outside the 8 years left on the Budget Control Act \nwindow and in the last 2 years of the 10-year budget window for this \nlegislation. But the Congressional Budget Office has scored that, \nbecause we are spending more money sooner--money which has to be \nborrowed--it would add $10.5 billion to the interest payment of the \nUnited States over this 10 year period.\n  So the claim it is going to reduce the debt over time if every bit of \nthis is adhered to--which our pattern is not to adhere to what we \npromise. But if we were to adhere to it over the 10 years, the savings \nwouldn't be $23 billion as claimed, it would be $12.5 billion because \nthe legislation supporters haven't discussed the interest cost of this \ngimmicked-up bill, where we spend more now and save later. It is a very \nserious matter.\n  They say the sequester is hard. The sequester is so bad that it \ncannot be sustained, America will collapse, and we will not be able to \nact in a compassionate way and be supportive of people in need or meet \nthe basic needs of the government.\n  The former Speaker Pelosi, now leader of the Democrats in the House, \nsaid the cupboard is bare. There are no more cuts to make. She said on \nSeptember 21 of this year: There are no more cuts to make.\n  There are plenty more cuts to make. There are ways to save money. For \nexample, the majority in the Senate changed the rules of the Senate \nusing the nuclear option to ram through the appointment of three new \nFederal judges. Each one of those, with their staff, costs the \ntaxpayers $1 million a year, and it was for the DC Circuit, which \nabsolutely does not need these judges. They are not needed. The DC \nCircuit has by far the lowest caseload per judge in America, even with \nthe vacancies on the court.\n  So what we should have done, and I worked toward previously, is not \nfilled those judges and move them to other circuits which need judges \nthat we are going to have to fill. That would have saved $3 million a \nyear. That is just one example of the waste of money. It is the \nequivalent of burning $1 million to $3 million a year on the mall out \nhere because those judges were not needed.\n  So to say there are no cuts to make and we can't reduce spending any \nmore is not accurate. It is all through the system. As Senator Enzi \nsaid, his State was prepared to take an 8-percent cut. But under the \nBudget Control Act, which includes the sequester, we are not cutting \nspending over 10 years; we are increasing spending over 10 years. We \nare just increasing it $2 trillion less than before. We were on the \npath to increase spending, at the time the Budget Control Act was \npassed, by $10 trillion--from $37 trillion to $47 trillion over 10 \nyears. We passed the Budget Control Act and said it would increase to \n$45 trillion instead of $47 trillion.\n  So we go from $37 trillion to $45 trillion. That was essentially what \nthe agreement was. It passed both Houses of Congress. It had no tax \nincreases in it. It was simply a commitment to contain the growth of \nspending, and it sharply reduced spending. It reduced spending in the \nnear term. But after this year, spending is allowed to continue for the \nlast 7 years or 8 years of the Budget Control Act agreement, a 2.5-\npercent-a-year annual increase every year after this year.\n  So the cuts began to bite this year. They were being felt this year. \nWhat did Congress do? It folded up like a house of cards. Congress \ncouldn't sustain the heat and couldn't honor the promise we made in \nAugust of 2011 to reduce the growth of spending just a little bit. That \nwas the promise. To raise the debt ceiling $2.1 trillion, we agreed to \nreduce the growth of spending by $2.1 trillion over 10 years.\n  Now we have already hit the debt ceiling. We have already borrowed \nanother $2.1 trillion. So now we hit the debt ceiling again, but we are \nnot honoring the promise to reduce spending.\n  What happened? The sequester said we had to have more cuts this year, \nmore reductions this year, and Congress couldn't sustain it--just \ncouldn't--would not take the heat, and we came up with this new plan \nthat is before us to avoid a shutdown. I guess we can say we avoided a \nshutdown, but we can also say we did not do the right thing about \nspending in America. We have not faced the challenge we have because we \nremain on an unsustainable financial path. In a couple years we will be \nback on a deficit growth pattern which is going to be very serious and \nwill threaten the financial future of America. As President Obama's \nSimpson-Bowles Debt Commission has told us, nothing fundamentally has \nchanged in that.\n  So we have our colleagues who are anxious to have more taxes--more \nrevenue they call it. What they are talking about are more taxes.\n  House Minority Leader Pelosi says that there are no more cuts to \nmake,\n\n[[Page S8880]]\n\nAmerican people. We have cut all we can cut. There is no more we can \ncut. So now we have decided the problem is you, American people. You \nhaven't sent us enough money. We demand, we insist, we require you to \nsend us more money so we don't have to make any tough decisions \nanymore. We don't have to make the financial choices they made in \nWisconsin or Alabama or Wyoming, that every State and city has had to \nface during this financial crisis, and they are leaner and more \nproductive and more efficient as a result of having to make those \nchoices. But we don't have to because we want to have more revenue.\n  So after this August of 2011 Budget Control Act passed, which reduced \nspending over 10 years by $2.1 trillion, the President signed and \nagreed to, had no tax increases in it, it was just a commitment that we \nwould contain spending--that is what the agreement was, a spending \ncontainment bill. In January, President Obama submitted a budget that \nwiped it out, busted it wide open. It would have added $1 trillion in \nnew taxes and $1 trillion in new spending.\n  Wow. What kind of commitment was that to the American people; you \nsign a bill, you say you are going to do something, and before the ink \nis dry you are proposing a different idea that goes back on the very \npromise that was made.\n  Eventually, this year, the Senate Democrats passed a budget \nincreasing spending $1 trillion and increasing taxes $1 trillion. It is \na tax-and-spend budget, the same budget the President submitted each \nyear.\n  They said we are going to have a balanced approach. What they wanted \nthe American people to hear when they said a ``balanced approach'' is: \nWe have a plan to reduce the deficit, and the plan is we are going to \ncut some spending and increase revenues. That is what they wanted the \nAmerican people to hear. It was a subtly and carefully crafted message, \nbut it was not the truth. The truth was that they wanted to spend more \nand tax more. Taxes were not used in a balanced approach to bring down \nthe deficit from the unsustainable path on which we remain. The taxes \nwere used to fund additional spending above the amount we agreed to in \nthe Budget Control Act of August 2011, which is still in effect--unless \nthis legislation passes, and that is going to amend it.\n\n  The fundamental fact is that my colleagues want to tax and spend. \nThey say they have cut all they can cut and they want more revenue and \nmore money from the American people. Just send it to us, and we will \nspread it around and we will do all the good things we can dream of \nwith your money. We don't have enough of it; we want more.\n  I don't think that is good for America. I don't think that is good \nfor the economy. We need a vibrant private sector with growth \npossibilities and the opportunity to have innovation and creativity and \nthe efficiencies that occur in the private sector that are not present \nin the government sector. We can't run this government. We have never \nmanaged the government effectively. It is so massive. We spend so much \nmoney. We need to be leaner and more productive. We need to decide \nwhich areas in our country we don't need the government to undertake. \nWe need to let the private sector handle that wherever possible. If we \ndo that, we can manage a smaller and more efficient government. We need \nto extract less money from the American people.\n  We have commitments. We are committed to Social Security, Medicare, \nand other funding we need to make sure we are honoring. We can't take \nmoney from Medicare, our seniors' health care program, and then spend \nit and say we have strengthened Medicare and made it better because we \nreduced its costs. The money that is saved in Medicare needs to be used \nto strengthen the long-term viability of Medicare, which is in great \ndoubt. It is not on a sound path.\n  I know we can do better. We are going to have to face up to this. It \nis not going to be easy. It has challenges for all of us. But \nreductions in Federal spending can work.\n  For example, they say we need more revenue. Well, have we gotten more \nrevenue? Yes, we have already. This Budget Control Act did not include \nmore taxes. The Budget Control Act represented a $2.1 trillion \nreduction in the growth of spending, but in January of this year we \npassed a $650 billion tax on the rich, upper income people, and the \nObamaCare legislation included a $1 trillion tax increase on top of \nthat. This bill has $34 billion in fees and taxes. Is there not revenue \naround here? Revenue is being increased, but the problem is that it is \nnot being used to reduce our deficits and it is not being used to put \nus on a sound financial path. It is being used to advance more \nspending, and that is the danger we are in, that is the danger we have \nto watch, and that is the danger that threatens us all.\n  I know how seductive it is for us to think we just can't reduce \nspending; the cupboard is bare. Minority Leader Pelosi says that we \ncan't cut any more. Well, we can. There is a lot we can do to make this \ngovernment leaner and more productive, and we are required to do so.\n  I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I listened to the Senator from Alabama \ntalk about the current budget debate we are having on the floor, and I \ncouldn't help but think of the discussion we had when we were debating \nthe ObamaCare legislation a few years ago and how many of us at the \ntime were making the argument that this is the biggest expansion of \ngovernment in literally half a century. I think that it is becoming \nincreasingly clear that was, in fact, the case.\n  We are seeing dramatically more levels of spending. I think we are \ngoing to see dramatically higher levels of debt over time. But you \nwould think that with $\\1/2\\ trillion in cuts to Medicare, $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in tax increases--and when it is fully implemented, it will be \nmuch bigger than that. The overall cost of the bill, when it is fully \nimplemented, goes to about $2.5 trillion. The expansion of government \nthat occurred as a result of the passage of ObamaCare was, frankly, \nstunning relative to anything we have seen in recent history. You would \nthink with that you would see some relief, if you will, in terms of the \nburdens being placed upon middle-class Americans, but we are seeing the \nopposite.\n  Many Americans are already feeling the effects of ObamaCare, whether \nit is higher insurance premiums, canceled health plans, or the loss of \na doctor they like. Middle-class Americans are going to be hit the \nhardest.\n  Lower income families will face steep premiums and deductibles under \nObamaCare, but they will get some help in the form of subsidies from \nthe government to pay for some of their health care costs.\n  Upper income families are also going to face higher health care \ncosts. In fact, the majority leader told a Nevada newspaper that his \npremiums under ObamaCare will rise by $4,500 next year. Affluent \nAmericans will be able to absorb those increases. What about a middle-\nclass family facing a $4,500 increase in health care costs, a family \nwhose budget is already at its limit between housing costs, school \nexpenses, and grocery bills? That family won't be able to absorb those \ncosts. That family doesn't have a spare $4,500 anywhere in its budget. \nFor that family, the $4,500 will have to come from money that was \nallocated for orthodontic payments or college tuition bills or money \nfor a new car.\n  Back when the President was trying to sell his health care proposal \nto the American people, he promised that ObamaCare would ``cut costs \nand make coverage more affordable for families and small businesses.'' \nUnfortunately, the last few months have made it abundantly clear that \nthis promise is not being kept.\n  Instead of seeing reduced costs and more affordable coverage, middle-\nclass Americans are seeing steep premium hikes and soaring out-of-\npocket costs. Those Americans who have been lucky enough not to have \ntheir plans canceled have been receiving insurance plan renewal letters \nwith staggering premium increases. In some cases it has doubled or even \ntripled what they have been paying before. One constituent emailed me \nto tell me that thanks to ObamaCare her premiums will increase more \nthan 100 percent, which she goes on to say is equal to 45\n\n[[Page S8881]]\n\npercent of her monthly income--45 percent just for health care. That is \nmore than most Americans pay for their mortgage.\n  Americans whose health care plans have been canceled as a result of \nObamaCare and who are being forced to shop on the exchanges are \nfrequently facing higher premiums and drastically increased out-of-\npocket costs.\n  A couple of days ago an article in Chicago Business reported that an \naverage Chicago family with a midlevel health plan in the individual \nmarket would go from a $3,500 deductible to a $10,000 deductible if \nthey obtained a similar plan in the exchange. That is $10,000 on top of \nthe $9,000 a year that family would already be paying in premiums.\n  In Federal exchanges, many families are facing deductibles as high as \n$12,700. Barring catastrophic illness or injury, in many cases a family \nwith a deductible that high might as well not have insurance at all.\n  Of course, a family could buy a more expensive plan and greatly \nreduce those out-of-pocket costs. Many of the platinum plans, which are \nthe high-end plans, have no deductible at all. As CBS News points out--\nand this was for a Houston, TX, family--``that means shelling out \nalmost $12,400 per year in monthly premiums, or about the same as the \ndeductible for the bronze plans. Either way, families and individuals \nwho don't qualify for tax credits may find ObamaCare failing to deliver \non its promise of affordable health care.''\n  That is from CBS News when talking about a specific family in \nHouston, TX.\n  What makes it even worse--and this is what the Associated Press \nreported--many families don't fully understand the expenses they are \ntaking on when they sign up for plans with high out-of-pocket costs. \nThe Associated Press notes that ``only 14 percent of American adults \nwith insurance understand deductibles and other key concepts of \ninsurance plans, according to a study published this year in the \nJournal of Health Economics. If people with insurance don't understand \nit, it's likely that uninsured Americans' grasp is even fuzzier.''\n  A family shopping on the exchanges may snap up plans with relatively \nlow premiums without realizing that they are, in effect, purchasing \nnothing more than catastrophic coverage that may leave them on the hook \nfor thousands of dollars in medical costs each year.\n  So far, I have talked about the direct financial consequences of the \nPresident's health care law, but its effects don't end with higher \npremiums and skyrocketing out-of-pocket costs. Middle-class families \nwill also take a financial hit thanks to the damage ObamaCare does to \nbusinesses.\n  ObamaCare puts in place a slew of new regulations, new taxes, and new \nfees on businesses large and small. When faced with that, businesses \nwill have two choices: They can absorb the costs of new taxes and fees, \nthereby reducing the amount of capital they have to expand their \nbusinesses, hire new workers, or promote existing ones, or they can \npass on these costs directly to their workers, further burdening \nfamilies already facing steep health care costs. It is a lose-lose \nsituation.\n  Small businesses are being hit particularly hard. Susan Gabay, \ncofounder and managing director of a small business investment banking \nfirm, published a column on Saturday in the Washington Times in which \nshe discussed the effect the President's health care law is having on \nher business. Thanks to ObamaCare, the health plan she offered to her \nemployees was canceled. The new coverage she was offered contains a 48-\npercent premium increase, which she says ``translates into \napproximately $1,676 in added costs per year for every individual \ncovered on our plan.'' That is a $6,704 premium increase for a family \nof four. She says that is approximately $44,000 in added annual costs \nfor her business that otherwise could be used to hire a college \ngraduate.\n  Maybe her employees are getting better coverage thanks to ObamaCare's \nregulations, right? Well, actually, the answer is no. Let me read her \nanswer to that observation. She says:\n\n       The response to our plight is that we are getting much \n     better coverage. But that isn't true, either. We have \n     historically provided our employees with a generous plan with \n     100% coverage for in-network preventative care and low out of \n     pocket maximums. Conversely, our new ``great alternative'' \n     plan offers comparable benefits with much higher out of \n     pocket maximums.\n\n  So thanks to ObamaCare, Ms. Gabay's business will pay more for health \ncare and so will her employees without receiving any meaningful \nincrease in benefits.\n  As every middle-class parent--wondering where money for the next \ndentist bill or tuition payment will come from--knows, America's \neconomy is still struggling to recover from the last recession. \nBurdening any business--particularly our Nation's small businesses, \nwhich are responsible for a majority of the new job creation in this \ncountry--is the worst possible thing we could do for our economic \nrecovery and for the millions of middle-class Americans searching for \nbetter jobs and opportunities.\n  Democrats and the President made the American people a promise. They \nsaid: We will make health care more affordable. As long as ObamaCare is \nin place, that promise will continue to be broken, and middle-class \nfamilies will suffer as a result. In fact, just recently, when asked a \nquestion in an interview about the health care plan, Secretary Sebelius \nsaid:\n\n       There are some individuals who may be looking at increases. \n     I think you cannot make a statement based on cost unless you \n     compare what they had to what they are going into.\n\n  That was Secretary Sebelius saying there are some individuals who may \nbe looking at increases. I think that is the understatement of the year \nbased upon the experience of literally millions of Americans, some of \nwhom have lost coverage entirely, but millions of Americans who are \nsuffering with the sticker shock of dramatic increases in the premiums \nthey pay for their health insurance coverage, dramatic increases in the \ndeductibles now available under their policies, and dramatic decreases \nin the take-home pay they have to meet the other obligations they have \nfor their families. This is a direct hit to the pocketbooks and the \nfuture economic vitality of middle-class Americans.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, earlier this morning the Senate voted \nto advance a budget agreement that passed the House last week. The \nlegislation has been a topic of much discussion over the past several \ndays, and there are sincere arguments on both sides.\n  While I appreciate the challenges House and Senate negotiators faced \nin crafting these budgetary guidelines, I voted against this \nlegislation because in my view Congress should continue to adhere to \nthe fiscal restraints both parties agreed to under the Budget Control \nAct.\n  I was the principal Republican negotiator of that agreement. I have \nbeen particularly invested in its success, and I was very proud of it. \nAs a result of the Budget Control Act, government spending has declined \nfor 2 years--2 years in a row--for the first time since the Korean war. \nThis was hard-won progress on the road to getting our Nation's fiscal \nhouse in order.\n  As I said, I fully appreciate the constraints Chairman Ryan and \nChairman Murray faced in their negotiations, and there is clearly some \ngood to be said about their agreement. But we should not go back on the \nagreement we made under the BCA.\n  Nonetheless, this has been a very important public debate. \nUnfortunately, our colleagues on the other side do not seem terribly \ninterested in substantial debate on this or any other substantive \nissues this week, least of all ObamaCare, which has been wreaking havoc \non our constituents for months now but which Democrats seem entirely \nuninterested in discussing. Instead, for much of this week the \nDemocrat-run Senate has decided to devote its attention to pushing \nthrough nominations--nominations. They want to spend time seating \npolitical appointees at places such as the Department of Interior--\npositions that, while they may be important, are certainly not in any\n\n[[Page S8882]]\n\nway emergencies that need to be attended to right this second.\n  Meanwhile, out in the real world, millions of Americans will continue \nto suffer under a law they told Washington not to pass in the first \nplace, a law that Washington Democrats still stubbornly refuse to \nchange in any meaningful way. Our colleagues on the other side seem to \nthink they have no responsibility to do anything about the impact of \nObamaCare since the White House issued a press release declaring \npartial victory--partial victory--in fixing the Web site. That is their \nwhole approach to this rolling disaster: Let the White House dodge and \ndeflect on any problem that arises until people forget about the last \none. Point the finger at some bureaucrat or some Web technician and \nbasically do nothing.\n  We are now nearly 3 months into this national calamity, and what have \nDemocrats done about this national calamity? Well, they have issued a \nlot of talking points and some halfhearted apologies. They have mouthed \nnostrums about ``private sector velocity.'' They have waived laws for \nfear of the political impact of leaving them in place. And there has \nhardly been any accountability for the massive consequences faced by \nAmerican consumers as a result of this failed law. In other words, they \nhaven't done much of anything. They have treated this whole thing like \na public relations problem to get past rather than a real-life problem \nfor middle-class Americans to be solved. They are engaged in daily \nbattle aimed at one overriding goal: Protect the law. Yet nearly every \nday we hear more about its painful impact.\n  Since the October rollout, millions of Americans have lost their \ninsurance plans. More than 280,000 have lost coverage in Kentucky \nalone, and so many are feeling the squeeze of this law, folks such as \nLana Lynch, a mom from Brandenburg, KY, who told me the annual out-of-\npocket expenses for her family rose from $1,500 to $7,000 under \nObamaCare, and folks such as Barrett Simpson from Sweden, KY.\n  Barrett had a health plan he liked and wanted to keep, a $540-a-month \npolicy that was, in his words, ``perfect'' for his family. The folks \nresponsible for ObamaCare apparently thought they knew better than he \ndid about the needs of his family, so he lost it. Here is what he had \nto say about that:\n\n       [My] plan is being eliminated because of the ACA, and the \n     cheapest, closest plan will cost [u]s $1,400 next year. We \n     can keep the plan until the end of next year, but we will \n     have to pick a new one. We don't need the extra coverage for \n     maternity, for vision or dental, but yet we will be forced to \n     pay for it.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       These changes are absurd. Most people in this country who \n     are content with what they had are now paying for what Obama \n     is trying to do for a very few.\n\n  Barrett closed his letter by asking me to work to repeal ObamaCare.\n  Well, Barrett and Lana should know this--in fact, every Kentuckian \nshould know this, and every American should know this: Members on my \nside of the aisle hear you loudly and clearly. We are not going to give \nup this fight. No matter how much the other side tries to distract the \ncountry's attention, we won't be fooled and we know you won't be \neither.\n  Look. The folks each of us were sent here to represent--not the \ngovernment--should be the ones choosing plans that make more sense for \ntheir families. And when our colleagues on the other side go around \nreferring to insurance being lost as ``junk,'' that is beyond offensive \nto the people we represent.\n  There is a lot of ivory tower thinking that goes on in this city--way \ntoo much of it. It is time for our Washington Democratic friends to \nfinally climb out of the ivory tower and see the reality of their ideas \nin action, witness the failure of their policies firsthand. It is time \nfor Washington Democrats to drop their refusal to change anything of \nsubstance in ObamaCare, and it is time for them to listen closely to \nthe people who sent us here in the first place.\n  Here is what so many Americans are saying. They want Democrats to \nstart working with Republicans to improve our Nation's health care \nsystem in a positive way, to help us implement real, patient-centered, \ncommonsense reforms that can actually lower costs and improve the \nquality of care because we were sent here to solve problems, not to \nmake them worse, as ObamaCare does.\n  Let's erase that mistake. Let's get rid of it and start over with \nreal reform. Working together, we can do it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to continue to raise a \nsimple point but a point of profound financial significance to America. \nOne of the things that has happened in the bill that is before us is \nthere has been an extension in the 10-year BCA plan--which was enacted \n2 years ago; there are only 8 years left--an extension of a 2-percent \nreduction in payments to hospitals and doctors who provide services \nthrough Medicare, treat patients, and get paid by the U.S. Government. \nSo they were reduced 2 percent.\n  This is scored as a savings for the country. In effect, it is \nperceived as a savings that allows us to spend more money somewhere \nelse. That savings, as was done in this legislation, involved the last \n2 years--years 9 and 10--of the 10-year window from today. It creates \nsome money, they say, because we reduced Medicare costs and we can \nspend that money in this year and next year on nondefense and defense \ndiscretionary spending, and we are going to promise to use the money we \nsave in Medicare in years 9 and 10, outside the promised BCA 10-year \nwindow which is already moving along.\n  What I want to raise is a deep and fundamental point. Medicare is \nalready in deficit. Medicare is already spending more money to provide \ncare for seniors than is being taken in off people's paychecks every \nweek. But Medicare does have a trust fund. Medicare Part A does; it's \ncalled the Hospital Insurance trust fund. Social Security also has a \ntrust fund. People have that money come off their paychecks every week \nwhen they go to work, and they believe, correctly in my opinion, they \nhave a right to receive those benefits in the future.\n  They are not happy. They believe America is going on the wrong track \nwhen we take that money and spend it, therefore, jeopardizing the \nconfidence they should have in retirement that their Medicare and \nSocial Security are going to be in place.\n  We know there are some deep problems with Medicare and Social \nSecurity actuarially because people are living longer and there are \nmore people retiring and we have to deal with some problems there. But \nwhat I want to say is, the worst thing you can do is to do the things \nnecessary to make Medicare sound--tighten up payments to providers, \nperhaps; although there is a limit at some point as to how much you can \ndo there--and do other things that make Medicare more financially \nstable, but you should not see that savings as something you can spend \non a new program. The entitlement programs that went into ObamaCare, \nthe Affordable Care Act, $500 billion of that money that supposedly was \nused to fund it was from Medicare and some from Social Security too--\nsaving money in those accounts.\n  But those programs have trust funds. They have trustees. When they \nran a surplus, as they had done for many decades--but not now--when \nthey were running a surplus, the money was loaned to the Federal \nTreasury and they spent it. But the Federal Treasury owes it back to \nthem. Now that both of those programs are heading into steep fiscal \ndecline, they are calling the notes, they are calling back the money \nthey loaned. The trustees of those programs know whom they represent. \nThey represent Social Security recipients. They represent Medicare \nbeneficiaries. They are demanding their money, they are going to get \nit, and we are going to honor it.\n  So what I am saying is we cannot count that money twice. That is what \nMr. Elmendorf, the Director of the CBO, told us on December 23, the \nnight before the ObamaCare bill was passed on the floor of the Senate \nin 2009. He said: You cannot count the money twice, and to suggest you \nare strengthening Medicare and simultaneously\n\n[[Page S8883]]\n\nproviding a source of money to spend on the new ObamaCare program is \ndouble counting. He used the words ``double counting.''\n  How simple is this? My question to him, when he gave the letter--and \nI asked him to put it in writing. I insisted he do that. He works for \nus, and he did what he is supposed to do. He said: Even though the \nconventions of accounting might suggest otherwise, you cannot \nsimultaneously use the same money to strengthen Medicare and fund \nObamaCare. That is what he said.\n  So under our conventions of accounting, we have what we call a \nunified budget. The CBO does it both ways, but the one we talk mostly \nabout, the one everybody focuses on, is the unified budget. So if \nSocial Security is a little better off, it is assumed it is in the same \npot. Everything is in one pot. So anything that cuts the expenses of \nMedicare and Social Security to make them strong is utilized and \nconsidered to put more money in the pot to be spent somewhere else.\n  What is happening to us now is the unfunded liabilities in pension \nfunds, retirement funds, Medicare, Social Security, and other accounts \nare reaching unprecedented levels, some say nearly $100 trillion, and \nit is growing considerably. This is the long-term threat to America. \nThis is the thing that several attempts have been made in recent years \nto fix, to confront, to put us on a sound path financially, but it has \nalways failed. People can blame everybody, and everybody is subject to \nblame, I assure you. However, I do believe it is quite plain it will \nnot happen unless the President of the United States leads and \nparticipates and says: I want to fix it. He is basically saying: We do \nnot have a problem. We are doing fine. He is not willing to call on the \nAmerican people and use his bully pulpit to lay out the challenges we \nface in how we could put ourselves on a financially sound path without \ndestroying the country.\n  We can do that. We really can do that. But it will take belt-\ntightening in every aspect of our government, and everybody should \nshare equally in the belt-tightening, not just a few, not just \nveterans, military people who have served 20 years, and disabled \nveterans having their retirement cut, as this legislation does. It \nneeds to be something where everybody participates in tightening the \nbelt. We could get the country on a sound path.\n  But I want to register again--and I am going to continue to talk \nabout this because I think it leads to a false impression. It leads to \nthe impression we have more money than we have. You cannot use Social \nSecurity's money, Medicare's money to fund ObamaCare, the Defense \nDepartment or nondefense discretionary spending. It is not possible to \nuse that money twice.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Remembering Erika Robinson\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, over the weekend, the State of \nConnecticut and the country and the world commemorated with grief and \ncontinued pain the first year anniversary of the tragic massacre in \nNewtown.\n  On the morning of Saturday--1 year after the Newtown tragedy--I \nattended a church service, a beautiful, moving, powerful celebration of \nfaith at the St. Rose of Lima Church, whose pastor, Monsignor Robert \nWeiss, has been such a great friend to so many in the community and \nsuch a source of strength and comfort.\n  Later in the weekend, I visited with the family of Erika Robinson of \nWest Haven, Connecticut, who was shot and killed at a nightclub in New \nHaven on October 26. This seemingly random act of violence left Erika \ndead and five other individuals injured by gunfire.\n  I have spent months and have been grateful for the experience with \nthe families of those victims in Newtown. I was equally grateful to \nspend this time with Erika's family--Celeste and Greg Fulcher--at their \nhome, and I want to thank them for welcoming me to their home on that \nday.\n  Erika Robinson was only 26 years old when she became a victim of gun \nviolence. She clearly was a person full of joy and life and goodness \nfor all of her 26 years and including the day she perished.\n  She was building a business, a clothing line. As her business grew, a \nlocal store started selling that line of clothing. Those who knew her \ndescribed her as hard working and driven.\n  She was compassionate. Most recently, she released a special \ncollection in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\n  She had enormous potential. She did everything right. She played by \nthe rules. She stayed out of trouble, and she had the support of her \ntwo loving parents.\n  She was on track to fulfill the American dream, and now her life, \ntragically, has been reduced to a statistic, unless we make sure it is \nmore than a statistic and that we work and fight to make her legacy one \nof helping to protect others, helping to prevent gun violence that \ntakes victims like her who are simply in the wrong place at the wrong \ntime, as she was that night in New Haven, when a shooter who was \nillegally in possession of a firearm--in fact, apparently on bail--\nturned to take as a victim someone else in the crowd that evening in \nthe nightclub, and she became a victim that night inadvertently, \nunintentionally, and five others were wounded.\n  I have her picture here. Erika was more than a statistic. She was a \nperson. Part of her clothing line was this small card she fashioned \nherself:\n\n       It's so regular for us to say ``You only live once'', but \n     do you deeply understand that it's real. What I'm trying to \n     say is be fearless. Do things you always wanted to do. Never \n     let anyone hold you back. Enjoy this thing we call life while \n     we can. People going to talk regardless, so be you!\n       Forever, Erika Robinson.\n\n  May that legacy be forever. May that legacy be with us forever and \ninspire us to work as we have done on behalf of the families of Newtown \nand as we should be doing on behalf of the 10,000 other victims of gun \nviolence since Newtown.\n  The victims are not only the victims who perished among those 10,000, \nthey are others who have been injured, such as the 5 who were injured \nthat night when the shooter at that nightclub in New Haven was aiming \nfor someone else and sprayed gunfire that killed Erika, took her as a \ncasualty but also injured others severely and traumatized countless \nothers who saw or watched or heard what went on in that nightclub that \nnight, an establishment that was legally licensed by the State of \nConnecticut, legally licensed to entertain people and charge for them \nbeing there, an establishment that was the last place Erika Robinson \nknew.\n  Such a promising young woman at the wrong place at the wrong time, a \nwoman who could have contributed so much to New Haven, to Connecticut, \nto our country. This was a tragic loss for her family that continues to \nhonor her life with courage and strength and a tragic loss for all of \nus and for the thousands of people who came to her funeral because she \nhad already, in those young 26 years, touched so many lives.\n  We owe it to her and to her family that her legacy will be one of \nprotecting others such as she, protecting others across America \nregardless of the neighborhood or the place in that neighborhood, \nwhether it is downtown New Haven, an urban area, or Newtown, a suburban \nneighborhood. It should not matter where gun violence is a threat. We \nshould eradicate it everywhere. It should not matter who may be the \nvictim of gun violence, what her background may be, her race, religion, \nanything about her.\n  Every human being, every person in the United States of America is \ndeserving of protection that our society failed to give this young \nwoman. We do a great disservice to our Nation when we fail to honor \nthose individuals who may not be in the headlines, who may not be from \nneighborhoods that we know but others that are unfamiliar to us. We owe \nit to ourselves, not just to Erika and her family but to ourselves as a \nnation to do better and to make America safer. She deserved better from \nthe greatest country in the history of the world. We as citizens of \nthat country deserve better and have an obligation to do better. So we \nwill, I hope, leave a legacy for her in her name that speaks to a \nsafer, better America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S8884]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/17/senate-section/article/S8884-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I come to the floor to speak in support of the 2-year \nbipartisan budget agreement reached by Representative Ryan and Senator \nMurray. I am pleased that the budget agreement passed the House of \nRepresentatives with overwhelming bipartisan support and that cloture \nwas invoked in the Senate today.\n  I understand there are many of my colleagues on this side of the \naisle who are very unhappy with this deal and intend to vote against \nit. My only response to that is I respect their vote, but I would like \nto know what we do in order to avoid another shutdown of the \ngovernment. The American people steadfastly reject a shutdown of the \ngovernment. I have concerns about the budget deal--I think everybody \ndoes--because of the nature of the way business is done. But to somehow \nvote against it without an alternative to keep the government from \nshutting down lacks some intellectual integrity.\n  My support and vote will be based on two important facts:\n  It will prevent another government shutdown, which we cannot put the \nAmerican people through or the people of my State through again.\n  It goes a long way in alleviating the devastating impact of \nsequestration on our military. Have no doubt that the sequestration has \nhad a devastating effect on many aspects of our ability to defend this \nNation. Don't just talk to our leadership but talk to the men and women \nwho are serving. They don't know where they are going to go next. The \npilots aren't flying, the ships aren't sailing, and the training is not \nbeing conducted. That is unfair to the men and women who are serving \ntheir military, and I would remind us that all have volunteered to \nserve this country in harm's way.\n  This budget deal will avert another government shutdown and reduce \nthe impact of sequestration. It will reduce the deficit by roughly $23 \nbillion without raising taxes.\n  Peggy Noonan is a noted conservative columnist who writes for the \nWall Street Journal and served in the Reagan administration. She \nobserved in a Wall Street Journal op-ed:\n\n       [t]he government is now unable even to pass a budget, to \n     perform this minimal duty. Instead, Congress and the \n     administration lurch from crisis to crisis, from shutdown to \n     debt-ceiling battle. That gives a sense the process itself is \n     broken, and this lends an air of instability, of Third World-\n     ness, to the world's oldest continuing democracy. We can't \n     even control our books. We don't even try. That's my context \n     for the Ryan-Murray budget deal.\n\n  She continued:\n\n       Should it be passed? Yes, yes and yes. The good things \n     about it are very good. The idea that Republicans and \n     Democrats are capable of coming to a budget agreement is \n     good. The idea that they can negotiate and make concessions \n     and accept gains is good. The idea the U.S. government is \n     able to produce anything but stasis and acrimony is good. \n     That we can still function even in the age of Obama--good.\n\n  She noted:\n\n       [This] agreement moves us an inch or two in the right \n     direction. Let me tell you what that's better than: It's \n     better than moving a few inches in the wrong direction! And \n     it's better than where we've been, in a state of agitated \n     paralysis.\n\n  Only weeks ago we all witnessed firsthand the impact a government \nshutdown had on our constituents, and none of us wants to go through \nthat again.\n  In my home State of Arizona, the impact was very significant. Nearly \n500,000 visitors were turned away from Arizona's national parks during \nthe shutdown. Arizona lost about $33 million in visitor spending. At \nGrand Canyon National Park, food banks had to rush supplies to 2,200 \nemployees of the concessionaires inside the park who were furloughed or \nlaid off. Arizona spent about $500,000 in donations to reopen the Grand \nCanyon for 5 days during the shutdown.\n  The list goes on and on.\n  Our approval rating, I would say to my friends on this side of the \naisle, and our party's approval rating plummeted. The damage was \nsevere.\n  Now we have an agreement. I repeat to my colleagues who would vote \nagainst this--both on that side of the aisle and this side of the \naisle--if you have a better idea, bring it up, let's consider it, and \nlet's vote on it because the only alternative to this is a government \nshutdown. Let's not deceive ourselves about why we are voting and what \nwe are voting on.\n  I admit it is not perfect. I think it has caused heartburn for all of \nus. One potentially problematic provision--and it is problematic--would \nslow the growth of cost-of-living adjustments for working-age--and I \nemphasize ``working-age''--military retirees. Let me point out that the \nCOLAs for working-age military retirees under the age of 62 will \ncontinue to grow after 2015, in most cases more slowly than before.\n  The fact is that the chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee--one of the most admired and respected individuals in this \nSenate--has stated that we will review this provision, and we will \nreview it in the context of the work that is already being done on the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, and that is a review of all paid \nbenefits and aspects of our military that, in the words of former \nSecretary of Defense Mr. Gates that these entitlements in the military \nare ``eating us alive.''\n  I would like to give an example. In 2012 military retirees and \nsurvivor benefit recipients received $52 billion. In 10 years that will \ngrow to $59 billion. By 2034 it will grow to $108 billion per year. \nFrom 2001 to 2011 payments to military retirees grew by 49 percent. \nEvery penny of it is deserved. Every penny of it we are proud we gave \nthem. But I don't think there is any doubt that we are going to have to \nlook at this whole issue of the pay, benefits, retirement, and all of \nthat of members of the military in a prospective fashion.\n  I am confident that one of the items taken up next year in the Senate \nArmed Services Committee will be what we are passing today, but it will \nbe brought up in the context of all of the aspects of personnel costs \nin the military today--keeping in mind that we have an all-volunteer \nservice and we are proud and pleased of the fact that we have America's \nfinest in the military.\n  But I can say for a fact that with this lurching from shutdown to \nshutdown, these draconian effects of sequestration--and I know my \ncolleagues know that in 2014 there will be a more severe cut than at \nany time--these brave young men and women are getting sick and tired of \nnot being able to do their jobs, and the best and the brightest are \nalready making decisions as to whether to remain in the military.\n  I wish to mention one small aspect that I think is indicative. About \n20 years ago there was a very large influx of pilots into the civilian \nairlines as airlines began to expand rather dramatically. That very \nlarge number of pilots is now nearing retirement age.\n  There is going to be a dramatic demand for airline pilots, who, as we \nall know, are very well paid. We are offering pilots $225,000 to stay \nin and fly airplanes in the military. Do you know that the vast \nmajority of these young pilots, these aviators, are not accepting that? \nOne of the reasons they are not signing up is because a lot of times \nthey don't fly anymore. They are not operating anymore, and they are \nspending time away from their homes and their families without being \nable to do what they were trained to do. This is only a small example \nof the impact of sequestration on the military.\n  I wish all of my colleagues who are members of the Armed Services \nCommittee would listen to the testimony of our military leaders who \ntell us that already they may not be able to defend this Nation in the \nmost efficient fashion because of the effects of sequestration.\n  All I can say is that if I had written this legislation--I think each \none of us individually would have written it differently, but we \ndidn't--the option of shutting down the government and the option of \nfurther damage inflicted by sequestration I hope would override the \nproblems we see with this agreement. I want to promise my colleagues \nthat I will work in every way with Senator\n\n[[Page S8885]]\n\nLevin under his leadership next year--remember, this COLA issue does \nnot kick in until 2015--I will work with my colleagues under Senator \nLevin and Senator Inhofe's leadership to review this provision in this \nbill as to whether it is fair and whether it needs to be changed.\n  Again, I challenge my colleagues who will come to this floor and \nspeak against this agreement to tell me what we can vote on and pass to \nprevent another government shutdown, and then I will be pleased to \nsupport it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. I also rise today to talk about the Bipartisan Budget Act \nof 2013 and to echo many of the reasons for supporting that budget that \nwere just spoken about by my colleague from Arizona.\n  This is the first Budget Conference Committee in a divided Congress \nsince 1986, and compromise leaves every side with something they like \nand something they don't like, but it is what Americans expect us to \ndo.\n  I applaud Senator Murray, our Senate budget chair, for her leadership \nsince our very first Budget Committee meeting in January 2013. I \napplaud Congressman Ryan, the chair of the conference committee, for \nhis work with his House colleagues. I was proud to be a part of the \nBudget Committee in this conference.\n  Americans want us to find a budget compromise to restore some \ncertainty in a way that will help families, help businesses, and help \nour economy.\n  The day that I was sworn in as a Senator, before I took the oath of \noffice, I was interviewed by a radio station in Virginia. They asked me \nwhat were the two things I wanted to do most immediately as a Senator. \nOnly last week I was reminded what I said. I said: I want the Senate to \nfind a budget that will be a budget for all of Congress, and I want to \nend sequester.\n  I have done a lot of budgets as a Governor and a mayor. It was \nchallenging for me to understand how in February we were here without a \nFederal budget but on the verge of embracing nonstrategic across-the-\nboard sequester cuts in a way that would hurt so many priorities \nVirginians care about.\n  I gave my first speech on the Senate floor in February to urge my \ncolleagues to avoid sequester. In the months since, I have visited \nVirginia shipyards, research universities, and early childhood \neducation centers and have seen the effect sequester has on Virginians, \non Americans, and on our economy.\n  I am acutely aware of the budget impasse and continuing challenges \nthat are imposed upon this economy by gimmicks such as sequester, and \nthe absence of a budget for 4 years compounds those things. We have \nseen the harm sequester has done to so many of the priorities we care \nabout.\n  No manager would embrace indiscriminate across-the-board cuts because \nnot everything the Federal Government does is worth everything else. If \nwe are going to be making cuts, they should be strategic. There are \nareas in which we shouldn't be making cuts at all. We should be putting \nmore money into the budget to do what is strategic and what is \nnecessary.\n  So what we have done with this budget deal is we have taken a step \nback to regular budgetary order to give certainty to the economy and to \ngive certainty to our planners who work for the Federal Government. And \nwhile we are not replacing all of sequester--and how much I wish we \nwere--we will do a lot to reverse some of its worse effects.\n  The budget deal is good in a number of ways.\n  It replaces $63 billion in sequestration cuts scheduled to go into \neffect in the next fiscal years--2014 and 2015--and replaces those \nnonstrategic cuts with a targeted mix of responsible spending \nreductions and new fees and revenue.\n  It increases the top-line discretionary spending level for fiscal \nyear 2014 to $1.012 trillion and $1.014 trillion in 2015.\n  It provides budget certainty for 2 years. This is something many of \nus in State governments, who have State government experience, have \nlong embraced--the virtue of 2-year budgets, which are common at the \nState level because they provide more certainty.\n  Under the agreement defense cuts of an additional $20 billion that \nwere scheduled to take effect in January will not go into effect, and \nwe will find ways to restore funding and avert sequester cuts to \nnondefense accounts as well.\n  The bill will let Chairwoman Mikulski and appropriators write full \nappropriations bills to reverse the cycle of widespread continuing \nresolutions. Many folks in the Federal Government tell me that as \ndamaging as sequester is, a continuing resolution--that locks in line \nitems at the level of last year or the year before that, instead of \nallowing flexibility to deal with these situations--is just as \ndangerous. So our appropriators can now write full-year appropriations \nbills for fiscal year 2014 and 2015.\n  With budgetary certainty, our Department of Defense will be able to \nplan and strategize for the future, as will our domestic agencies. We \nwill fund critical readiness issues. We will allow the Navy in Virginia \nto continue to work on ship building and repair, which is so critical \nand, above all, we can show the American public that Congress can work \ntogether in a bipartisan way, which is what we are all trying to do and \nwhat the American public asks us to do.\n  We do know, as Senator McCain and all have mentioned, like any \ncompromise this budget compromise is not perfect. I would put on the \ntop of my list as the most grievous challenge with the budget \ncompromise not something that is in it but something that is not in \nit--the extension of unemployment insurance benefits to the long-term \nunemployed. In this economy, all of the economic data suggests the \nextension of those benefits is not only good for the individuals, they \nare good for the economy itself. The suggestion is the expiration of \nthese benefits could cost the country 200,000 to 300,000 jobs. That is \na weakness in this proposal.\n  An additional weakness is the way we have dealt with the cost-of-\nliving increase for military retirees pre-age 62 who are not disabled. \nI don't agree with that compromise provision. It requires a reduction \nin the cost-of-living increase for certain military pensions. The \nSenate budget that all those currently in this Chamber worked so hard \non to pass in March did not contain that provision. It was not the way \nwe felt we should be dealing with the budget. Obviously, we liked the \nSenate budget, and we found a way to replace sequester without making \nthis change to military pensions. But it was added during the \nconference in order to find compromise with the House to move forward. \nCompromise is necessary because absent compromise the very folks who \nwill be affected by this particular change will also be affected, \nbecause we have seen sequester and shutdown and furloughs affect \nmilitary employees. We have seen it affect military operations, and so \nthe alternative of brinkmanship and shutdown is no better for our \nretirees than this provision.\n  We have heard from Secretary Hagel and Chairman Dempsey that they are \nsupportive of the overall framework of the deal and it will help them \naddress military readiness challenges. I am pleased Senator Levin, the \nchairman of Armed Services Committee--a committee on which I serve--has \nsignaled his intention to review the COLA provisions in the Armed \nServices Committee next year, since it will not be scheduled to take \neffect until 2015.\n  I am also disappointed that new Federal employees will be targeted \nfor increased pension contributions. We have now increased those \ncontributions in a somewhat tiered level for new employees twice in the \nlast 3 years. But again, while that compromise is challenging for those \nnewly hired Federal employees, the alternative is more challenging, \nbecause we can't keep going through the uncertainty of shutdowns or \nfurloughs. It wouldn't be fair to those employees for us to do that.\n  So again, we have replaced a portion of the nonstrategic cuts, and \nthat is the way we should go going forward. I will continue to work to \nget rid of the rest of sequestration and replace it with similarly \ntargeted strategies.\n  For those reasons I urge my colleagues to support this deal. While I \nwouldn't agree with all items in it, that is like any compromise I have \never engaged in in my life. All of us who are part of a group--from the \nSenate of the United States to families--know that if you are part of a \ngroup, it\n\n[[Page S8886]]\n\nis not always your way or the highway. You have to give and expect \nothers to give as well, and that was an important aspect of this \ncompromise.\n  I will say in conclusion that another aspect of this deal I like very \nmuch is that it has unified the Virginia congressional delegation. \nThere are 13 of us, 11 in the House and 2 Senators. There are 8 \nRepublicans and 5 Democrats. We get along well and work together well, \nbut there aren't many issues like this--big policy issues--where all of \nus agree. In the House last week, all 11 Members of Congress of both \nparties voted for this budget compromise. Senator Warner, as a budget \nconferee, together with all of us in the Chamber right now, are \nsupporting this budget compromise. I am glad my colleagues from \nVirginia have pulled together, and I think it is a tribute to the fact \nwe have all seen the impacts that the budget uncertainty and sequester \nhave caused. I am glad we seem to be on the verge of providing that \nsense of certainty that will be good for the public and good for the \neconomy.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I want to take the floor today because I \nam very disturbed by the apparent shift in attitude by many elected \nleaders, including some in this body and in the House--the attitude \ntowards people who do the work that makes this country run. They do not \nsit behind desks. They do not wear coats and ties every day or \nwonderful clothes. They do not sit in air-conditioned offices. They do \nnot clip coupons. They just do hard work. They are the people you run \ninto every day when you go into the local coffee shop and you order \nyour latte. Maybe you see them when you go out and have lunch at a \nrestaurant or you hail a taxi. Maybe you get on a bus or the subway. \nMaybe now, since it is near Christmas time, you go to a department \nstore to do your Christmas shopping, and it is that person standing \nbehind the counter.\n  You think that person is only there for you when you go in there to \nbuy your Christmas present. Think about it. She has probably been \nstanding there all day long, and after you get out of there, she is \nstill standing there to wait on somebody else.\n  That is who I am talking about. They are not the big wheels in our \nsociety. They never thought of themselves as being big wheels, but they \nare the cogs and the inner workings that make our country run.\n  There used to be fairly universal agreement that these people are the \nbackbone of this country and the foundation of our economy; that our \njob as elected officials is to do all we can to ensure that all working \nAmericans have a decent shot at the American dream. We used to agree \nthat if someone worked hard and played by the rules, they should be \nable to earn enough to support their family, keep a roof over their \nhead, put some money away for a rainy day, and have a secure \nretirement. We used to agree that if one loses their job through no \nfault of their own, especially at a time of chronically high \nunemployment, they should have some support to get them through the \nrough patch while they are looking for new work. We used to agree not \ntoo long ago, on both sides of the aisle, that no child in this country \nshould go to bed hungry at night. I say both sides. I remember McGovern \nand Dole, Dole and McGovern, and the great work they did on hunger in \nAmerica.\n  In recent years, it has been alarming to see how these fundamental \nprinciples and values are being attacked in our public discourse. For \nmany, the new attitude is: You are on your own. If you struggle, even \nif you face insurmountable challenges, well, it is probably your own \nfault.\n  It just seems to me that there is a harshness in our land, a \nharshness that I think of as sort of borne of a benign neglect toward \nthose Americans who have tough lives, may be ill-educated, marginally \nemployed or they are just down on their luck. It used to be we only \nheard harsh rhetoric such as that from radio talk show partisans trying \nto get their ratings up. Sadly, it has now become a part of our \neveryday conversation, even in the Congress.\n  We hear how minimum wage workers don't deserve a fair increase \nbecause they are just not worth $10.10 an hour. We hear that unemployed \nworkers should be cut off from unemployment insurance because they are \nbecoming ``dependent.'' At a time when there are three job seekers for \nevery job, we hear it is critical to take away food assistance from \nmillions of individuals so that, supposedly, if we take away their food \nand take away their unemployment insurance, they will now somehow learn \nthe redemptive power of work. As if young mothers working service jobs, \nlaid-off factory workers delivering newspapers, unemployed families \nreceiving SNAP benefits--that somehow they need to be lectured by \nMembers of Congress about work. These people know what it is like to \nwork.\n  What happened to our respect--our respect for the people who do the \nwork and want to work in our country? What happened to our values, \nbasic moral truths that people shouldn't go hungry in the richest \ncountry in the world? Whence comes this harshness of ours, reminiscent \nof the late 19th century workplace in America? How did we get to the \npoint where many of us value the work of day traders pushing paper on \nWall Street, but we ignore the contributions of the people who work in \nour daycare centers, educate our kids, care for our elderly in the \ntwilight of their lives? What about their value?\n  I wish the people who are pushing this harsh rhetoric would talk to \nTerrence, a father of three in Kansas City, MO. He works 50 hours a \nweek. Don't lecture him about working. Fifty hours a week, two jobs--\none at Pizza Hut and one at Burger King--to try to make ends meet. He \ncan barely insure his 15-year-old car or purchase shoes for his three \ngirls. Last year, he lost his house. He told the Washington Times:\n\n       We work hard for companies that are making millions. We're \n     not asking for the world. We want to make enough to make a \n     decent living. We deserve better. If they respect us and pay \n     us and treat us right, it'll lift up the whole economy.\n\n  I will bet Terrence never got a degree in economics, but he says it \nbetter and understands it better than a lot of these economic thinkers \ndown at our big banks and these economic think tanks.\n  They should speak with Edward, a father in Illinois. Both he and his \nfiancee earn the minimum wage. He said:\n\n       We have three children and our paychecks combined barely \n     cover the necessities like a roof over our heads, gas and \n     lights, and clothes for the kids. We wouldn't be able to make \n     it without government assistance like food stamps and a \n     medical card. There is constant stress because we are living \n     paycheck to paycheck and never have enough money. Everyone \n     needs help sometimes, especially since the economy is so bad \n     and it has made life even harder for working people. This \n     isn't about needing more money for luxury things, we need a \n     raise in the living wage in order to survive.\n\n  Edward and Terrence clearly are not lazy. They are doing exactly what \nwe might expect them to do, what we have told them they must do to make \nit in this country. But they are slipping further and further behind, \nthrough no fault of their own.\n  The fact is our economy has changed. It is not working for many \nfamilies right now. We can't stick our heads in the sand and pretend it \nis not true. We shouldn't suggest it is Edward's and Terrence's fault \nor that their kids don't deserve to eat or to wear shoes.\n  We as elected officials have an obligation to recognize the \nfundamental truths about the challenges working families face in \nAmerica. We have a duty to support policies which will help these \nfamilies both weather the continuing economic storm and also build a \nbrighter future for their children.\n  First, we have to acknowledge the truth that while we are slowly \nmoving in the right direction, the economy has not recovered, \nespecially for those at the bottom of the economic ladder, the Edwards \nand Terrences and others. Jobs are still scarce. Four million people \nhave been pounding the pavement for at least 6 months looking for new \nwork. There are three job seekers for every job. Our economy is still \nmillions of jobs short of what we need.\n  In the past when the job market was this challenging, politicians on \nboth\n\n[[Page S8887]]\n\nsides of the aisle agreed the Federal Government had an obligation to \nstep in and help the long-term unemployed while they are struggling to \nfind work. In fact, the current Federal Unemployment Insurance Program \nwas put in place in 2008, under a Republican President, George W. Bush, \nand we did it when the unemployment rate was 5.6 percent. Today the \nunemployment rate officially is 7 percent. We know it is higher. That \nis the official rate. But unofficially, if we include folks who want to \nwork full time but can only find part-time work, those who have given \nup actively looking for work, the rate is actually 13.2 percent. That \nis the real unemployment rate in America.\n\n  So given that the unemployment rate remains high in many parts of the \ncountry, my colleague Senator Jack Reed and I have introduced a modest \nproposal to extend the current system of federally funded extended \nunemployment insurance until the end of 2014. It is vitally important \nthat we do so because it is going to expire in 2 weeks. Almost 5 \nmillion American workers will exhaust their State unemployment \ninsurance and lose their last lifeline before the end of next year. We \nare their last lifeline. They are counting on us. How can we think \nabout turning our backs on them?\n  But instead of joining a call to action, some of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle are actually suggesting that an extension of \nunemployment insurance will hurt jobless Americans. I was rather \nshocked when I heard this from our colleague from Kentucky, Senator \nPaul, on a Sunday talk program. Here is what he said:\n\n       When you allow people to be on unemployment insurance for \n     99 weeks, you're causing them to become part of this \n     perpetual unemployed . . . group in our . . . economy, and . \n     . . while it seems good, it actually does a disservice to the \n     people you're trying to help.\n\n  A disservice? I don't understand this kind of harshness for people \nwho are out of work, who have paid into unemployment insurance and they \nare seeking now to get their insurance payments. First of all, this 99 \nweeks is not quite right. The maximum is 73 weeks, and that is only for \nthose who have been unemployed the longest and it is only in two \nStates. Only two States have 73 weeks. Those are the two States with \nthe highest unemployment rates. The rest of the States have access to, \nat most, 63 weeks. In my State, Iowa, it is only 40 weeks, not 99.\n  Secondly, unemployment insurance is a desperately needed program. \nLet's be clear, unemployed workers are not living high on the hog on \nthese insurance payments which average about $310 per week nationally. \nIf you are on it for 1 year, that averages about $15,000 per year. \nThere are some that are less than that. Mississippi, for example, is \n$193 a week. The truth is they are barely subsisting, barely hanging \non, not sitting around watching TV. Why? Because there is only one way \nyou can collect unemployment insurance benefits. That is, No. 1, if you \nhave worked and paid into the system. So you have already earned the \nright to access the insurance you paid for. Secondly, you can only \ncollect on the insurance if you are actively looking for a job.\n  So contrary to the statement of my colleague from Kentucky, it is not \na disservice to provide this meager benefit to the long-term \nunemployed, a benefit which they have earned. The only disservice is to \nfloat this absurd myth that jobless Americans want to be unemployed. I \nthink it is offensive to suggest they are lazy and don't want to work. \nTo me, it is morally repugnant to conclude that they will somehow be \nmiraculously better able to find a job if we simply let their kids go \nhungry.\n  That same harsh kind of thinking has also crept into our national \ndebate about the most fundamental aspect of our social safety net--food \nassistance. Millions of American families depend upon the SNAP program, \nthe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It is what everybody \nthinks of as food stamps. Such a basic thing, having enough to eat, in \nthis country. Again, many of these people are in working families.\n  In 2011, 41 percent of SNAP participants lived in a household where \nsomeone was working. Over the last several years, my Republican \ncolleagues have sought again and again to slash food assistance for \nthese families.\n  The House-passed farm bill, engineered by Republicans in the House, \nproposed cutting food stamps by $40 billion over the next 10 years. \nContrast that to what we passed in the Senate. Under the leadership of \nSenator Stabenow, we passed a farm bill which made some cuts over 10 \nyears of a little over $4 billion. That was supported by most people on \nboth sides of the aisle. The House bill was only supported by the \nRepublicans: Forty billion the Republicans wanted to cut versus $4 \nbillion in the Senate. That would have cut 3.8 million individuals from \nthe SNAP program next year.\n  Other parts of their proposal would have cut off food stamps and \nbenefits in the future for some of the poorest adults, many of whom \nSNAP is the only income assistance they have or it would result in \nthrowing 210,000 children out of their free school meals program, \nraising the level so low-income kids would be cut out of their free \nlunch program.\n  Yet another provision the House Republicans put into their bill would \nhave provided strong financial incentives to States to kick people off \nthe SNAP program. The House farm bill would allow States to cut off \nSNAP benefits to most adults receiving or applying for SNAP, including \nparents with children as young as 1 year old, if they are not working \nor participating in a work or training program for at least 20 hours a \nweek. That was it. There was no exclusion for mothers with little kids.\n\n  The House bill meant that mothers with young children still in \ndiapers could be cut off from the SNAP program even if they don't have \naffordable childcare. Imagine that--forcing a mother to choose between \nemployment and safe child care for her child. That is harsh.\n  As I said, this is not realistic. We already said there are three job \nseekers for every job, and 48 States have a waiting list for our \nlargest training program, the Workforce Investment Act. Are we going to \ntell a young mother with a child who can't get adequate childcare that \nshe has to be in a job training program? The lists are so long that you \ncan't get in. Are we then going to tell her that she has to work? There \nare three job seekers for every job. What is she going to do?\n  Never mind reality. Somehow Republicans seem to think that denying \nfood assistance will magically make people find jobs despite the fact \nthat jobs don't exist. Getting people into the workforce will require a \nstronger, growing economy with real jobs and strong job-training \nprograms that really will help people get ahead. Promoting draconian \ncuts to SNAP programs under this benign-sounding work label does not \nmake the effect any less harsh.\n  What we have seen in recent years with respect to the SNAP program \nare not concerted and sincere efforts to help people leave the SNAP \nprograms because they have gained employment or because our economy is \nget stronger; quite the contrary. Many Republicans want to eliminate \nfood assistance for families without regard for the true nature of the \neconomy or the effect on those families. In addition to acknowledging \nthe fundamental economic truth that our job market has not adequately \nrecovered--and for many Americans, programs such as unemployment \ninsurance and food stamps are essential to basic survival--we also have \nan obligation to face another, perhaps even more alarming, economic \nreality. For those at the bottom who are working and playing by the \nrules, it is not enough.\n  Hard-working people who are working full time--sometimes multiple \njobs--are not getting paid enough to make ends meet. Full-time workers \nare living in poverty. Families are living in poverty. They go to work \nevery day. This is a fundamental failure of our economy. It is \nsomething I believe we have a moral obligation to address by fixing and \nraising the minimum wage in America.\n  I have introduced a proposal that I have worked on for a long time \nwith Congressman George Miller in the House--the Fair Minimum Wage Act. \nIt would gradually raise the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour, where it \nis now, to $10.10 an hour, then it would link the minimum wage to the \ncost of\n\n[[Page S8888]]\n\nliving in the future. It would be indexed.\n  We would also provide a raise in the minimum wage for tipped workers, \nwhich has not been done in more than 20 years.\n  Let's look at what happened to the minimum wage. If we kept the \nminimum wage at the same level when adjusted for inflation, and made \nthat adjustment based on the minimum wage for 1968, which was a pretty \ngood economic year, the minimum wage today would be $10.75 an hour. It \nis now $7.25 an hour.\n  You wonder why there are more people on food stamps. Look at what's \nhappened. By the way, these are people who are working, and they are \npeople you see every day. You see them every day when you go in to get \nthat coffee, go to that lunch counter or that department store. You see \nthese minimum-wage workers every day. If you have daycare for your \nkids, you probably see them there too.\n  Again, if we kept at this level, that family making minimum wage \nwould have an additional $7,000 every year to spend on necessities. It \nis no wonder that working people turn to the safety net. In fact, a \nrecent study found that taxpayers have to pick up the tab for millions \nof working families who are getting minimum wage. We have to pick up \nthe tab to the tune of about $243 billion a year. Why? That is what we \npay for food stamps, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, the Earned Income Tax Credit Program, and Temporary Assistance \nfor Needy Families. Taxpayers are picking up the tab to the tune of \nabout $243 billion.\n  If you want to say who benefits from an increase in the minimum wage, \nit is not only the people who are making the minimum wage, taxpayers \nwill benefit too because a lot of this would fall by the wayside \nbecause people wouldn't qualify any longer for the safety net programs.\n  Businesses will benefit too. The biggest problems for businesses--\nespecially small businesses--is the lack of consumer demand and poor \nsales. If you put money back in the pockets of low-income workers, that \nwill be a boon to small businesses, and it will be a boon to businesses \non Main Street because that is where they will tend to shop.\n  Many of these low-income workers don't drive out to the suburbs. A \nlot of them don't go online and buy at amazon.com, but they will go to \ntheir neighborhood stores, and that is where they spend their money.\n  In a poll earlier this year two-thirds of small business owners said \nthey support raising the minimum wage because they know it will help \nincrease consumption and reduce pressure on taxpayer-funded public \nbenefit programs.\n  We always hear the claim that if you raise the minimum wage, it will \ncost jobs. That is just not true. The most sophisticated empirical \neconomic research conducted over the last 2 decades has shown \nrepeatedly that minimum-wage increases do not cause job loss--not \ngenerally, not among teenagers, and not among restaurant workers.\n  In short, history shows us time and again that despite all the cries \nof doom and gloom from richly paid lobbyists and well-funded trade \nassociations, there is simply no real negative economic consequences \nfrom an increase in the minimum wage. To the contrary, the benefits are \nenormous.\n  The Economic Policy Institute estimates that our bill would pump an \nadditional $22 billion into the gross domestic product, thereby \nsupporting 85,000 new jobs, and giving workers an additional $35 \nbillion to spend over the 3 years of the implementation, and, of \ncourse, more beyond that.\n  Fourteen million children in America will have a parent who gets a \nraise because of increasing the minimum wage. Again, this makes a real \ndifference in people's lives. They are not going to the Riviera. They \nare not taking vacations to the beach.\n  Fifteen million women, 13 million men, 4 million African-American \nworkers, 7 million Hispanic workers, and 7 million parents will get a \nraise. It is going to make a real difference in their lives.\n  A boost to $10.10 would mean an extra $6,000 a year. Think about what \nthat would mean for someone who is making the minimum wage, which puts \nthem at $14,000 to $15,000. After 3 years of implementation, they would \nget $6,000 more a year, which amounts to 7 months of groceries, 6 \nmonths of rent, 1 semester at a 4-year public university or 1,600 \ngallons of gas. That is a real difference.\n  I have heard some say that they think the Earned Income Tax Credit \nshould be the answer to the problem of low wages. What this overlooks \nis that the Earned Income Tax Credit only helps families with children. \nChildless adults who work full time at the minimum wage actually earn \ntoo much to qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit. The minimum wage \nis not enough for a single person to survive on.\n  Moreover, just relying on the Earned Income Tax Credit would simply \nshift more costs to the taxpayers rather than requiring employers to \npay a fair wage. It would actually incentivize employers to pay even \nless in wages, even to workers who don't qualify for EITC.\n  The minimum wage raise we are proposing is particularly important for \nmillions of tipped workers. They will receive a raise for the first \ntime in 22 years. Workers who receive tips will get a raise in their \nbase wage. These include not only restaurant servers, but also nail \nsalon workers, pizza delivery drivers, coat checkers, parking \nattendants, and many more.\n  Right now, under our current Federal law, employers are required to \npay only $2.13 an hour to tipped workers. So rather than supplementing \nwages, tips have actually, over the last 20 years, replaced wages, \nwhich is insecure for workers. It often leaves them in poverty. There \nis no predictability when counting on tips. Often workers go home with \nonly tips because tax deductions canceled out their cash wages.\n  This is an actual copy of a real check made out to a restaurant \nworker in the District of Columbia. It is a paycheck. The check date is \n8/5/2013, and it says $0.00. This is made out to a real person. She got \na paycheck for $0.00. Why? After they took out her withholding and FICA \ntaxes, she didn't make enough to get paid. Some people might say, well, \nshe got tips. Maybe. But anyone who gets tips can tell you one day they \nare up and the next day they are down. Sometimes they are good; \nsometimes they are not.\n  How do you budget on that? That is like saying the Earned Income Tax \nCredit. I have already pointed out the fallacy of that, but that only \ncomes a year later. I am talking about--how do you live from paycheck \nto paycheck when your paycheck is zero? You can't make plans based on \nyour budget, and you can't raise a family based on it. No one who works \nfor a living should come home with a paycheck that says $0.00 when they \nhave worked over 40 hours a week.\n  My bill would establish a fair balance between wages and tips by \nslowly--over 6 years--lifting the base wage for tipped workers from \n$2.13 an hour to 70 percent of the minimum wage. That is more in line \nwith how the wage for tipped workers worked in the decades that have \nsince passed.\n  The National Restaurant Association claims it can't afford to raise \nthese wages. They say that every time we propose raising the minimum \nwage. The National Restaurant Association opposes any minimum wage \nincrease at any time. But they can afford it.\n  In fact, the last minimum wage increase from 2007 to 2009, which \nmeant raises for workers such as bussers, kitchen staff, and others who \ndon't regularly receive tips, didn't hurt the industry. But they said \nso at the time. Here is what they said in 2007. When we were here \ndebating an increase in the minimum wage, here is what they said: ``A \nminimum wage increase will cost our industry jobs.''\n\n  That is what they said in 2007.\n  Flash forward to 2012. Here is what the restaurant industry said: \n``The restaurant industry not only provided much-needed job growth \nduring the sluggish last decade, it also is poised to post steady \ngrowth well into the future.''\n  They can't have it both ways. This is the truth, that they provided \njob growth during that time. More power to them. But don't come and \ntell us that an increase in the minimum wage and an increase in the \nminimum wage for tipped workers is going to cost them jobs. That just \ndoesn't hold.\n\n[[Page S8889]]\n\n  I will close with one more statement from a real worker whose life \nwill be improved if we step up and support the people who work in our \ncountry. She has a lesson for us. Jackie Perkins works at a restaurant \nin Denver, CO, and she says:\n\n       You are talking about real people. You sit in your ivory \n     tower in the legislature and talk about economics, numbers, \n     jobs, but what you don't understand is there are real jobs \n     and real workers who have families that they need to support, \n     and raising the minimum wage helps me support myself and my \n     family and to advance and to achieve the American dream.\n\n  So I believe in Jackie's dreams and those of all of these hard-\nworking Americans, as I said earlier, who make the country work, who \nmake it operate. As we look ahead to the Christmas season and the new \nyear, I hope all my colleagues will take time over the holidays to \nthink about all the blessings we have been given and all that we should \nbe thankful for. I hope we put ourselves in the shoes of these working \npeople who just want to build a better life for themselves and their \nchildren. Think about the minimum wage retail worker we see when we go \ninto the store to shop for that Christmas present, who works hard \nrunning that cash register, standing on her feet all day, and she can't \neven afford to shop in her own store. Think of the unemployed worker \nwho must go to the local food bank because he can't find a job. The \nfood stamps have run out and he can't afford that nice big turkey and \nall the dressing and everything else for Christmas dinner.\n  I will close where I started. We have to stop being so harsh and \nhaving these harsh attitudes toward people at the lower economic end of \nthe spectrum. They have value too. Their lives have value. Their work \nhas tremendous value. The country couldn't exist, couldn't operate \nwithout people such as they.\n  So let's refine our public policies to be a little bit more \nconsiderate, a little bit more compassionate, a little bit more \nunderstanding of the tough lives some people have in our society. Let's \nhave a compassion that is borne of an understanding that we are so \nprivileged to live in the richest country in the world. We can afford \nto make sure people have enough food to eat. We can afford to make sure \npeople who are unemployed get unemployment insurance benefits next \nyear. We can afford that. We can afford to increase the minimum wage. \nWe can afford these things, and we will be a better country socially \nand economically if we do so.\n  We have a duty, I believe, to put ourselves in their shoes. We have a \nduty to make sure people who do the work such as that in our country \nget a fair chance to aspire to the American dream.\n  So I hope we all have a good holiday season--Christmas and New Year's \nwith our families and our friends. I hope we take time to pause and \nreflect also, as I said, on our blessings and our obligations toward \npeople who may not be as fortunate as we are. I hope when we come back \nwe will support a strong food assistance program, a deserved and long \noverdue increase in the minimum wage, and an extension of Federal \nunemployment insurance, and let's have a new year that is filled with \nless harshness and a little bit more compassion and understanding for \nour fellow Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from \nWashington on the floor who I assume wishes to speak; if not, I ask to \nbe recognized for up to 5 minutes and then I will yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, last Friday I left this Chamber with a \nfolder containing most of the information from the Ryan-Murray \ncomprehensive agreement on the budget. I left with the ringing of \nsuggestions in my ear from some colleagues on the floor that it wasn't \nenough, it didn't do enough, and that we didn't need to pass it. But \ninside me I had that little voice of conscience all of us get from time \nto time that said the time was right to do what was right.\n  So on the airplane back to Atlanta, I read the entire agreement. \nThen, when I spent the weekend at home while doing Christmas shopping, \ngoing out with grandchildren and talking to my wife, I also listened to \nthe people of Georgia. I listened to what they said, and there were \nsome remarkable things that happened this weekend. At church on Sunday \nfollowing a cantata--and usually I am accosted at church by people who \nhave all kinds of various suggestions about what I should or should not \nbe doing--but I was remarkably surprised by how many people came up to \nme and said: Thank goodness you all have finally found an agreement \nwith predictability on the spending in our Federal budget. I received \nnot one negative comment.\n  I left church, went to lunch, and then went shopping at the mall \nwhere I was stopped three or four times by people--some Democrats, some \nRepublicans; some I knew, some I did not--again, the same comment: \nFinally, you guys have gotten your act together and you have gotten a \nbipartisan agreement on the budget.\n  I went to a dinner party with a lot of partisan activists Sunday \nnight. Although there was some grumbling about not getting this or \nthat, there was some relief that we weren't going to go through what we \nwent through on October 1 and the threats we have gone through in the \npast about government shutdowns and the failure of our government to \nfunction.\n  Then I got on the plane to fly back to Washington yesterday morning \nand, once again, members of the military, people I did not know, people \nI do know; some with the bureaucracy, some not, all stopped and \ngenerally said the same thing: Finally, it is about time.\n  So when I voted earlier today to shut off the debate or end the \ndebate and bring to a final vote a vote on the bipartisan budget \nagreement, I voted in favor of it because it is the right thing to do \nat the right time. When the final vote comes in the next 30 hours, I \nwill vote for it again. I want to give three precise reasons why.\n  No. 1, I have been the voice of a biennial budget in this Congress \nfor the last 15 years and in this Chamber for the last 9. I have talked \nabout how we need to bring more predictability and more continuity to \nthe budget process. I have spoken about how we can't continue to pass \nCR after CR after CR which, on its face, is an admission we cannot do \nour job.\n  Jeanne Shaheen, the distinguished Democratic Senator from New \nHampshire, and I have coauthored the biennial budget proposal. This is \na biennial budget taking us through 2015, giving us predictability. \nThat is something we need to take advantage of and build on into the \nfuture and replicate over and over as we bring more continuity to the \nbudget process.\n  No. 2, yes, I know there are a couple of pension tweaks and, yes, I \nknow there are some savings in a couple of pension tweaks. But we are \ngoing to have to do a lot of tweaking in terms of long-term \nentitlements over the next few years if we are ever going to rein in \nthe spending. Our biggest problem is not nearly as much as what we \nspend in discretionary spending in 1 year as the obligation and the \nmortgage we are accumulating over decades. This particular proposal \nwill save $22.6 billion over the next decade but $100 billion over the \ndecade to follow because it accumulates and it compounds and those \nsavings on entitlement programs can make a tremendous difference.\n  No. 3, and most important, we stumbled and fell last October when we \ndecided to shut down the government rather than do our job. I commend \nSenator Murray and I commend Paul Ryan. I want to refer to my \ncolleagues a conversation Paul Ryan and I had on Saturday via cell \nphone. I was at Mount Bethel Methodist Church in the gymnasium watching \nmy 8-year-old granddaughter play basketball. He was in Wisconsin \nwatching his daughter play basketball as well. He called me on my cell \nphone and we talked for about 15 minutes, not as much about the budget \nproposal as about my granddaughter and his daughter, recognizing that \nif we fulfill our responsibility as representatives of the American \npeople in this Congress this year, if we begin the process of \npredictability in appropriations and budgeting, and if we can begin the \nprocess of recognizing our entitlements are running away from us and \nthat our debt and deficit will kill us, maybe--just maybe--instead of \nbeing the first generation of American\n\n[[Page S8890]]\n\npoliticians to leave our children and grandchildren worse off, we will \nbe the first generation of American politicians who returned to the \nsanity of fiscal soundness, biennial budgeting, and accountability in \nthe way we do our business.\n  I vote for that, and I will vote for the Ryan-Murray budget tomorrow \nwhen it comes to the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and defer to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I am here to speak on the budget, but \nuntil our other colleague from Pennsylvania gets here, I ask unanimous \nconsent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Disappearance of Bob Levinson\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, over the course of Friday and through the \nweekend there has been the publication, first by the Associated Press, \nof a missing American, a missing Floridian, Bob Levinson, a retired FBI \nagent and that publication has spurred other entities, primarily the \nNew York Times, which had been holding the story for a number of \nyears--well before the Associated Press ever got the story--to then \nprint a story of additional information about the disappearance, 7 \nyears ago, of Bob Levinson on Kish Island, a resort island in the \nPersian Gulf right off the coast of mainland Iran.\n  Of course, we have been searching for any shred of evidence about \nBob. He has here in the U.S., in Florida, a wife and seven children. \nThe length of time he has been missing, unfortunately, seems to have \nmet or exceeded the amount of time of almost any American.\n  The family, of course, desperately seeks any shred of evidence. They \nwere heartened 3 years ago when Christine Levinson, his wife, received \na secretive email with a video that showed that Bob was alive. In it he \nmade statements that he had served the government of the U.S. for 30 \nyears and: Please help.\n  About a year later, she received, also by another circuitous email, a \nphotograph of him, obviously later because his hair is long and there \nis a full beard. His hair is silver, his beard is silver. In both the \nvideo and the last item, the photograph, he appears quite gaunt. Of \ncourse, we know he has health problems, high blood pressure, and so \nforth, and, of course, we fear.\n  We also know that just this morning, on ``CBS This Morning,'' a \nfellow who he was seeing--an American who lives in Iran, a fellow who \nhe was seeing on Kish Island--saw him taken by Iranian authorities.\n  It is no secret that all levels of the government, including their \nFlorida Senator, have reached out to the Iranian Government over the \nyears, including the President of the United States when he spoke to \nthe newly elected President of Iran when that United Nations meeting \noccurred in September.\n  I have spoken within the last couple of days to the Iranian \nAmbassador to the United Nations and reiterated the plea of those of us \non a humanitarian basis for this family to be reunited with their loved \none and have offered to the Ambassador, if it would in any way help, \nthat I am willing to go to Iran if in any way it would secure his \nrelease. If the Iranian authorities took him, somebody in the \nGovernment of Iran knows of his whereabouts.\n  I will conclude by saying that for the first time we have what \nappears to be successful talks going on between the two governments \nwith regard to the Iranian nuclear program, and those are at a critical \nstage to, hopefully, bear fruit within about 5 months from now.\n  What better time for the Government of Iran to show their good will \nthan to step forth and produce Bob Levinson so he can return home to \nhis family.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my remarks on Bob Levinson for the \nmoment. I will continue to speak on this matter.\n  Now I would like to turn to the matter at hand with regard to the \nbudget, since my colleague from Pennsylvania and, of course, our chair, \nthe Senator from Washington, are here.\n  I would like to take a moment to acknowledge a small but significant \nprovision in this budget compromise. It is section 203 of the Budget \nAct of 2013, and it limits access to what is known as Social Security's \nDeath Master File, which is important because criminals utilize \nfraudulently the Death Master File to steal people's identities.\n  When someone dies, the Social Security Administration puts their \ninformation into the Death Master File and releases it to the public \nthrough the Commerce Department. It lists their name, their Social \nSecurity number, and other personal identification information.\n  The public release shortly after death of the Death Master File came \nabout as a result of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit back in the \n1980s. Over time, Federal agencies and industries came to rely on the \ninformation from the Death Master File. Life insurers use it to know \nwhen to pay out benefits. Banks and credit card companies use \ninformation from the file to prevent fraud. A whole host of Federal and \nState agencies, as well as other industries, depend on the information \nfor legitimate purposes, including pension funds, unclaimed property \nauditors, and identity theft protection companies.\n  But there is somebody else who is using the Death Master File too. It \nis the criminals who are stealing identities, including especially the \nSocial Security number. When that is posted online, they are using it \nfraudulently. What are they doing? They are filing an income tax \nreturn. They are utilizing somebody else's identity--in this case \neasily accessible, the Death Master File--creating a false return and \ngetting a tax refund.\n  You may find this hard to believe, but this actually happened in \nTampa, FL. Street crime--hijackings, stickups, burglaries, dope \ndealing--actually dropped because the criminals found a new way of \nbeing able to steal people's money. They did it with a laptop instead \nof with a crowbar or a gun. Street crime actually reduced because the \ncriminals have found a new way.\n  They would steal people's identities in many different ways. They \nwould go to senior citizens' mailboxes, and they would get their ID, \nthey would get their Social Security number. They would go through \nhospital records, and they would get Social Security numbers. They \nwould do it a number of ways. But one of the easiest ways was this \nDeath Master File.\n  I want to tell you about the story of Alexis Agin, the daughter of \ntwo courageous parents John and Neely, who have joined us today. \nTragically, Alexis died from cancer 2 weeks shy of her 5th birthday. \nObviously, no parent should have to go through the pain of seeing their \nchild go through this kind of ordeal and then losing the child.\n  So you can imagine how they felt when months later they learned that \nsomeone had used Alexis' identity, obtained from the Death Master File, \nto file a fraudulent tax return, claiming a refund, and the IRS--when \nthey tried to correct this--asked them to prove that Alexis was their \ndaughter and was not the one responsible for the fraudulent tax return.\n  Because I have heard so many stories of innocent Americans whose \nidentities have been stolen, this Senator filed this legislation that \nwould restrict access to the Death Master File by establishing a \ncertification program run by the Commerce Department while still \nallowing access to the Death Master File for legitimate purposes.\n  This brings us to the budget agreement. I am very pleased that the \nSenator from Washington has included within this budget that we are \ngoing to pass--it would be nice if it were today, but it looks as if it \nis going to be tomorrow--what some of us have been calling on for \nyears: restricting access to this master file, making it harder for \ncriminals to steal identities and therefore making it harder to steal \ntaxpayer money.\n  That is where this actually has a revenue effect because we are going \nto actually save the U.S. Government money by doing this. We are going \nto save the U.S. Government money that otherwise would be stolen. So I \nthank\n\n[[Page S8891]]\n\nthe courageous chairman of the Budget Committee for including this idea \nin the act and for crafting what used to be S. 676, the Identity Theft \nand Tax Fraud Prevention Act.\n  It was never the intent of this Senator or the cosponsors to deny \naccess to the master file by the people who need it for legitimate \npurposes. The language in this budget deal would include the file in \nthe Freedom of Information Act exemptions so that it will not be \navailable to just anyone off the street. However, the Social Security \nAdministration and Commerce would still be able to release the \ninformation in the file for those who need it.\n  So I want to ask the distinguished chair of the committee whether is \nit true that as Commerce sets up a certification program, the Social \nSecurity Administration and Commerce will still be able to release the \nDeath Master File to folks who need to use it for legitimate purposes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent to engage \nin a colloquy with the Senator from Florida and the Senator from \nPennsylvania so I may respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Florida is correct. That is absolutely \nour intention. There is nothing in law that prevents the continued \npublic release of the Death Master File while the Commerce Department \nsets up the certification program. This act simply exempts the Social \nSecurity Administration's death records from freedom of information \nrequests under section 552 of title 5 of the United States Code, \nsubsection (b).\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, echoing the comments of my colleague from \nFlorida, I am pleased that the budget includes language to address the \nfraud that is perpetrated with information from the Death Master File. \nTax fraud is a large and growing problem. We know that. In 2012, for \nexample, the IRS reported that they identified over 1.2 million \nidentity theft returns. As of June 2013, they identified 1.6 million \nfor this year. Thousands of these cases involve the identities of \ndeceased taxpayers. A recent audit of the 2011 tax year identified \n19,000 fraudulent returns from recently deceased taxpayers. Under \ncurrent practice, for $10, criminals can purchase the full name, Social \nSecurity number, date of birth, and date of death of a deceased citizen \nor legal resident.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, I have worked with my \ncolleagues to address this issue. I am pleased to see the language \nlimiting access to the Death Master File in the budget deal.\n  As Commerce begins its rulemaking, it is essential to strike the \ncorrect balance. The reality is that the Death Master File is used by \ncompanies across Pennsylvania and the Nation to prevent fraud and \nprovide other essential consumer protections. Banks, investment \ncompanies, insurers, and numerous other businesses run this file to \nensure the identity of those accessing their services. Striking the \ncorrect balance in the regulatory process is critical to ensuring the \ncontinued legitimate use of this information.\n  Businesses and those who contract for assistance with fraud \nprevention and other businesses must maintain access to the file. \nFurthermore, access must remain available as those regulations are \npromulgated.\n  In short, as a certification program is set up, it is important that \nwe get it right. The Death Master File is critical to fraud prevention \nand must remain available to legitimate users. To that point, I ask the \nSenator from Washington, the distinguished chairwoman, is it the \nintention of the Bipartisan Budget Act for the Commerce Department to \nseek input from stakeholders as it creates the certification program to \nensure legitimate users maintain access to the file?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania is correct. \nWe intended for Commerce to follow notice-and-comment rulemaking \nprocedures in the establishment of the certification program.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to close by again thanking the \ndistinguished chairwoman of the committee. She has been a quiet hero, \nand the proof is in the pudding of all of her labors. She deserves the \npraise of the country that we have a budget, No. 1, but I also thank \nher for making it a lot more difficult for criminals to steal the \nidentities of those who have passed on.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have decided to support the budget \nagreement, though it is by no means the budget solution that I would \nhave written and it contains some imperfections.\n  Following up on earlier remarks today in a colloquy on the Senate \nfloor by my colleagues from Florida, Pennsylvania, and the Senate \nBudget Committee Chair, Senator Murray, I wish to provide some \ninstructive remarks about the Death Master File provision of the budget \nagreement. The Death Master File is a data set compiled by the Social \nSecurity Administration, and made available to various researchers and \nbusiness interests through the Commerce Department. Many researchers, \ngenealogists, and businesses use the data for bona fide reasons \nincluding fraud prevention, ancestry research, identifying remains of \ndeceased individuals, retirement plan administration and prevention of \nimproper payments. As long as they can show the Commerce Department \nthat they have rigorous privacy protections and protocols put in place, \nthey should be able to become certified by Commerce to have access to \nthe Death Master File data.\n  I concur with what much of what my colleagues have said in their \nrecent colloquy about the Death Master File provision of the budget \nagreement. Specifically, I wish to reiterate the need for balance in \nthe regulatory process and in the rulemaking procedures that the \nCommerce Department is called upon in the budget legislation to \nundertake. We need a robust rulemaking process, where all interested \nparties are afforded the time and opportunity to adequately express \ntheir interests. And, importantly, we need to ensure that during that \nprocess, there will be access to Death Master File data for bona fide \npurposes, including fraud prevention, identifying remains of deceased \nindividuals, forensic and other genealogical research, prevention of \nimproper payments, and assurance of proper payments.\n  As the budget agreement is currently written, there appears to be \nsome confusion and ambiguity concerning implementation of the \nregulatory process and rulemaking procedures that the Commerce \nDepartment is to undertake and whether access to data in the interim, \nwhen rules are being promulgated and aired, will be assured. I must say \nthat a more robust and inclusive process for arriving at the Death \nMaster File provision of the budget agreement could have eliminated the \nconfusion and ambiguity that has arisen. The Finance Committee, of \nwhich I am the Ranking Member, has jurisdiction over the manner in \nwhich the Social Security Administration governs Death Master File \ndata, and the Finance Committee has expertise that could have been \ncalled upon. Unfortunately, that was not the case, as the Death Master \nFile provision of the budget agreement was not processed through \nregular order with adequate Finance Committee input.\n  Mr. President, it is becoming far too common for important \nlegislation to bypass committees of jurisdiction and for it to be \nwritten by legislators who do not necessarily have the depth of \nknowledge and expertise necessary to avoid writing laws that either do \nnot work or contain glitches, ambiguities, and confusing language. In \nmy opinion, we need to return to regular order where committees of \njurisdiction are the places where issues in their jurisdiction are \ndebated, processed, and agreed upon in a bipartisan fashion. Certainly, \ncommittees of jurisdiction must be consulted when others decide to \nwrite legislation that involves issues that lie squarely within their \njurisdictions. That will be the surest route to preventing a \nreoccurrence of the ambiguity and confusion that has, unfortunately, \narisen from the Death Master File provision of the budget agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, we are watching America pass from the \nhands of the ``greatest generation'' to the hands of the debt-paying \ngeneration with nothing to show for it but the bill. For months \nRepublicans have challenged President Obama to fix the\n\n[[Page S8892]]\n\nFederal debt, to save entitlement programs that Americans depend upon, \nand to rescue young Americans from being forever known as the debt-\npaying generation.\n  Earlier this year, for example, I called on the President to show the \nsame kind of leadership that President Johnson did on civil rights, \nthat President Nixon did on China, that President Carter did on the \nPanama Canal Treaty, and that President Reagan did on Social Security. \nConfront your own party. Say what needs to be said. Do what needs to be \ndone. This has not happened.\n  I appreciate very much the efforts of the Senator from Washington and \nRepresentative Ryan to try to bring certainty to the budget process. \nThat is why I voted today to allow a vote on the House-passed budget \nagreement. It seems to me, at least, that a Republican Senator could \nallow a vote on legislation passed by the House of Representatives with \nthe support of the House Republican leadership and two-thirds of the \nHouse Republicans, so I voted yes to allow a vote.\n  However, I am going to vote against the Ryan-Murray budget amendment \nbecause it avoids the Federal Government's single greatest challenge; \nthat is, reducing the growth of runaway entitlement spending. Instead, \nit spends savings that should be used to strengthen Medicare, to \nstrengthen pensions, and to strengthen the air transportation system.\n  I believe in user fees. When you build a highway, you have a gas tax \nto pay for the highway. You do not raise the gas tax to pay for \neducation. You do not raise the gas tax to pay for a health program. A \nuser fee is related to the service it provides. This budget agreement \ndoes not withstand that test.\n  It would have been much better to pay for this budget agreement by \nusing a small part of the almost $1 trillion in entitlement savings \nthat Senator Corker and I have suggested in the Fiscal Sustainability \nAct or with meaningful entitlement savings from the President's own \nbudget.\n  The Fiscal Sustainability Act that Senator Corker and I have \nsuggested would slow the growth of out-of-control mandatory spending \nby, among other things, recommending a more realistic Consumer Price \nIndex. This is a Consumer Price Index that most economists have said is \nmore realistic in its assessment of what the increase in the standard \nof living is. The monthly difference between the current Consumer Price \nIndex and the more accurate Consumer Price Index is about $3 per month \nfor the average beneficiary, which is less than the average cost of a \ngallon of gasoline. This modest change would help to slow the growth--\nnot cut but help slow the growth of mandatory entitlement spending. The \npurpose of that is to help make those programs solvent so beneficiaries \ncan depend on them.\n  The Medicare trustees have told us that Medicare will not have enough \nmoney in it in 13 years to pay all of the hospital bills. What are \nseniors going to think of Senators who in 2013 did not take the steps \nto make Medicare solvent? We could do that if we would begin to adopt \nsome of the recommendations in the Corker-Alexander Fiscal \nSustainability Act or in the President's own budget. He also \nrecommended a smaller version of the more realistic Consumer Price \nIndex. He recommended several hundred billion other dollars of changes \nin entitlement programs that Republican Senators might be able to agree \nwith.\n  To go back to the Consumer Price Index, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, we could save $162 billion over 10 years \nif we adopted a more realistic Consumer Price Index for entitlement \nprograms. That is twice as much money as we needed for the budget \nagreement. The rest could have been used to reduce the debt today, and \nthe reduction would be even more in future years.\n  As I emphasized before, the purpose of reducing the growth of \nentitlement spending is so the programs are solvent, so a Medicare \nbeneficiary does not get to a point in 13 years and say: Why does \nMedicare not have enough money to pay for all of my hospital bill?\n  Here is another way we could have cut wasteful spending: Eliminate \nthe wind production tax credit. The Senator from West Virginia and I \nhave written a letter to the Finance Committee and suggested we do \nthat. Here we are in the budget agreement struggling to find $63 \nbillion over the next 10 years. Where could we find $63 billion? That \namount about equals what we could save if we did not extend the wind \nproduction tax credit each year for the next 10 years.\n  So any way you slice it, we could either have taken some of the \nPresident's suggested savings in entitlement spending, some of Senator \nCorker's and my suggested savings, we could have taken half of the \nsavings from the more realistic Consumer Price Index, paid for the \nbudget agreement that way, and then I could have voted for it because \nwe would have moved money from the out-of-control side of the budget to \nrelieve the sequester, and we would have done what we should have done.\n  What I have to ask with all respect is, Where was the President in \nall of this? I mean, if Lyndon Johnson can pass a civil rights bill and \nRichard Nixon can go to China, if Jimmy Carter can pass the Panama \nCanal Treaty and Ronald Reagan can work with Tip O'Neill on Social \nSecurity, why can't President Obama get involved with his own budget \nrecommendations and help us begin to deal with entitlement spending, \nwhich everybody knows is the single biggest problem we have facing our \ncountry?\n  Washington could learn a lot about debt and taxes from Tennessee. \nTennessee's tax burden ranks third lowest of any State, it has the \nlowest per capita debt, and it balances its budget every year. All that \ndid not happen by accident. I was Governor when we needed three big \nroad programs. Instead of borrowing the money, we paid for it as we \nwent. We used user fees, the gasoline tax, but we applied that to the \nroads. Guess where we are today? We have one of the best four-lane \nhighway systems in America and zero road debt. While other States have \nbillions of dollars of road debt, we have zero. So all of our gas tax \nmoney goes to keeping one of the best four-lane highway systems in the \ncountry. Those policies have paid off. According to the Department of \nLabor, Tennessee is the fourth best State in the country in net new \njobs.\n  Getting debt under control is the foremost problem we have facing our \ncountry. If we do not do that, the people who depend upon Medicare and \nother important programs will be not able to depend on them to pay \ntheir hospital bills. Runaway spending is going to leave our young \nAmericans forever known as the debt-paying generation.\n  We are watching America pass from the hands of the ``greatest \ngeneration'' to the debt-paying generation with nothing to show for it \nbut the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Warren pertaining to the introduction of S. 1837 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. WARREN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Unemployment Insurance\n\n  Mr. REED. I come again to the floor to remind my colleagues that in \n11 days 1.3 million Americans will lose their unemployment insurance. \nWith the goal of providing certainty to these families that they will \ncontinue to have access to this vital lifeline, I and my colleague from \nNevada, Senator Heller, are introducing a bill that would extend \nunemployment insurance compensation benefits for 3 months.\n  I hope this sensible and bipartisan approach will provide a path \nforward to extending the program through 2014, which will give families \nand our economy more time to recover.\n  In many parts of the country, recovery is just getting underway. My \nown State of Rhode Island has 9.2 percent\n\n[[Page S8893]]\n\nunemployment. There are States throughout the country that have over 8 \npercent unemployment. There are some States that are doing well and we \nare very pleased they are. But for the millions of people who are still \nlooking for work, they need this help.\n  This program is designed so workers continue to look for work while \nthey receive very modest compensation. In my State the average is about \n$354 a week. That is not the kind of money that is going to induce \nsomeone to simply sit back and collect. It is going to provide some \nsupport for them to just put food on the table.\n  This safety net is not only there for them, it is for everyone, as \n23.9 million Americans have received these Federal benefits since the \nstart of the program in 2008. Some, thankfully, have found work and \nreturned to work. But all of them, in a very critical time, received \nassistance and support. They only qualified for the support because \nthey worked. This is a program that is based on one fundamental \nprinciple--they have worked long enough to qualify for these benefits. \nAs a result, I think we have to go ahead, follow through, and not leave \n1.3 million people, on December 28, literally with nothing, in many \ncases.\n  As we look by household, the number of Americans this program has \nhelped rises to about 69 million people, not only the workers but their \nfamilies, sons, daughters, and spouses. In fact, it includes about 17 \nmillion children who would not have received support without the \nbenefits provided by this program.\n  In terms of income, over 40 percent of those households new to \nreceiving UI in 2012 had household income between $30,000 and $75,000. \nThat is an important point to make. These are working families. These \nare people who were enjoying a reasonably good living and suddenly, \nbecause of many changes, globalization, downsizing, you name it, they \nare without a job in a very difficult job market.\n  They went from people with good, solid, middle-class jobs to \ndesperately looking for work. At least this program gave them some \nsupport as they made that great effort to look for work.\n  This program has been and continues to be a crucial benefit to \nmillions of American households all over the country and of nearly \nevery conceivable demographic background. That is why it is such a \nsignificant part of our recovery too. Its expiration will hurt \nfamilies.\n  It has been estimated that if we do not extend this program over the \nnext year, we will lose 200,000 jobs. And the logic of this program is \nvery compelling. People who receive these benefits, people who used to \nmake $50,000 a year, for example--and many of them did--they are not \ngoing to go ahead, turn around, take these benefits and just sort of \nsquirrel them away or go off on a vacation. This is about paying the \nrent and paying for fuel in a cold winter or a hot summer in the South \nand Southwest. It is about making sure their children get a little \nsomething. Again, about 17 million children have benefited over the \nlast several years--since 2008--from this program.\n\n  This is absolutely critical. It is critical to our economy. It is not \nonly the right thing to do, it is the economically smart thing to do. \nIt has been estimated that without the extension of unemployment \ninsurance, we will lose .2 percent of GDP growth this year, and this is \nat a time when we all very sincerely profess that our No. 1 job is \njobs--getting people back to work and growing the economy. And if we \ngrow the economy, that has many beneficial effects. Not only does it \nlower the number of people who need this type of assistance, but as a \nresult of that and other activities, it begins to lower our deficit.\n  For so many reasons, both economic and central to our purpose as a \ngovernment--which is when people who have worked hard run into a \nsituation where they lose their employment through no fault of their \nown, this is something that is there for them, and I hope we can move \nforward on it.\n  I am so pleased Senator Heller has stepped up and has joined me, and \nI will join him, in urging all my colleagues to give us the opportunity \nnot only to bring this legislation up but for at least 3 months to \nextend it so we can look longer term. Some of my colleagues have raised \nsome very interesting points about how perhaps there are reforms \nnecessary for the program. Well, in the context of a program that \nexpires on December 28, it is hard to take the legislative time and \ninsight to develop reforms that will work for everyone. But if we can \nextend this for at least 3 months, we will have that opportunity.\n  Mr. President, again, I will return. This is not the last time I will \nspeak on this point. But I did want to come back and remind people that \nthis program is central to so many families. It is an important part of \ncontinuing our economic expansion, and it is particularly difficult at \nthis time of year when 1.3 million Americans in this holiday season are \nfacing a cutoff of benefits that to many of them are the difference \nbetween paying the rent, paying the mortgage, and keeping the kids in \ntheir sports programs or doing those things families in America need to \ndo.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about an \nissue about which I am deeply concerned.\n  While I certainly appreciate the work done by Congressman Ryan and \nSenator Murray on the recent budget agreement, in my view there is a \nprovision in this agreement which makes it a deal breaker. That \nprovision is, there is $6 billion taken from our current military \nretirees over the next 10 years from their cost-of-living increases to \npay for this budget agreement.\n  I do not believe we have to take from the backs of our men and women \nin uniform to pay for more spending. I believe there are other ways we \ncan find $6 billion in the trillions and trillions we will spend over \nthe next decade, rather than taking it from the men and women in \nuniform who have sacrificed the most for our country.\n  What troubles me most about this particular provision of this budget \nagreement is our military retirees under the age of 62 were singled \nout. There are some changes to the contributions that Federal employees \nwill have to make to their retirement, but those changes are only made \nprospectively to new hires.\n  Our men and women in uniform were not grandfathered under this \nagreement. They are the only ones singled out under the agreement to \nhave their benefits cut.\n  What I find most appalling is the question we pressed and we pressed \nthe Department of Defense for an answer to, and that is: What happens \nto our disabled veterans?\n  Many of us have been to Walter Reed. We have seen the injuries our \nmen and women in uniform have sustained fighting on our behalf in \nAfghanistan. Some did multiple tours in Afghanistan and also served our \ncountry in Iraq. When you have a disability that occurs in the line of \nduty, you are entitled to a disability retirement, and this agreement \nwill also cut the cost-of-living increases for our disabled veterans, \nwhich I find appalling, particularly with some of the horrific injuries \ntoo many of our men and women in uniform have sustained in defending \nour country and taking bullets for us all.\n  Under this agreement, an E-7--sergeant first class--who retires at \nage 40 could stand to lose $72,000 by the time he or she turns age 62. \nTo put that in perspective, the average retirement for an E-7 is \nroughly $25,000. So in that period, this cut of 1 percent to their COLA \ncould equate to $72,000. Think about the impact that has on our \nveterans and our men and women in uniform who have done so much for our \ncountry. Why are they being singled out in this agreement?\n  The other issue I wish to raise is this notion about which some have \nsaid: We have to vote for this agreement or we are going to face \nanother government shutdown. I think that is a false choice. We may be \nin a rush to get home to our families for the holidays, but the notion \nwe can't find $6 billion somewhere else on a bipartisan basis for our \nmen and women in uniform is a false one. We can keep this government\n\n[[Page S8894]]\n\nopen, we can address the budget issues, but we should not do so on the \nbacks of our men and women in uniform singled out in this agreement.\n  Right now, as this agreement stands, the so-called amendment tree has \nbeen filled. That means any amendments which either side would want to \noffer cannot be offered right now because the majority leader has \nfilled every part of the amendment tree, not allowing individual \nMembers to offer amendments.\n  Were I allowed to offer amendments, I have filed two amendments which \nwould address this issue for our military and have found other pay-fors \nto address the issue. Those are just two ideas which I came up with. I \nam sure if we committed in this body to working on this issue, we could \nquickly find $6 billion that would not be taken from the backs of our \nmen and women in uniform and would not be taken from the backs of our \ndisabled veterans, who have already suffered too much on behalf of our \nNation. I do not believe this is too much to ask of us.\n  We are blessed to be in this country and blessed to enjoy the \nfreedoms we enjoy in this country because of our men and women in \nuniform and what they have done to defend our Nation.\n  Make no mistake, a military retirement is not like any other \nretirement. When you retire from the military, you understand that you \ncan be called back. You can be called back at any time. And who is most \nlikely to be called back? Our younger veterans. In fact, since 2001, \nthousands of our veterans who thought they were going back into \ncivilian life have been called back by our government to serve their \nNation again. They didn't get to say yes or no. They agreed to do that \neven though they thought they would be retired. That is what \ndistinguishes a military retirement from other retirements, or an \naverage civilian retirement.\n  They earned this for defending our country. I believe we should \nfulfill our responsibility to them, and that they should not be singled \nout. Of all the groups to be singled out, they should not be the group \nto be singled out, especially after everything they have done for our \nNation.\n  I ask that we take a few moments in this body and come up with $6 \nbillion some other way instead of taking it from the backs of our men \nand women in uniform. Why don't we have an amendment process that would \nallow us to address this issue and allow us to fix this now?\n  To those who are saying: We will fix this later, that is such a \nWashington answer. For those who are serving our country right now in \nAfghanistan, what kind of comfort is that to them that we will fix this \ndown the line after we vote on this agreement? How about fixing this \nnow?\n  I ask my colleagues to fix this now on behalf of our military, the \nbest in the world, those who have sacrificed the most for our country.\n  If this body is to pass this agreement, I would call on our Commander \nin Chief to veto this agreement. Bring us to the White House. Make the \nHouse and the Senate sit together so we can resolve this issue. As the \nCommander in Chief of this country, don't accept the cuts to the \nmilitary and have our military retirees singled out, particularly our \ndisabled veterans, in this agreement.\n  We can get this done. We can get this done before the holidays. Yes, \nwe will suffer some personal inconvenience, but think about that. That \nis nothing compared to what our veterans have done for us and continue \nto do for us every single day in this great country.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I join with the Senators from New \nHampshire and Alabama in trying to urge the body to take a pause here \nand see if we can right a wrong before it matures. The good news is \nthat we have a bipartisan agreement to try to fund the government in a \nfashion where we will not have a government by crisis. I appreciate \nthat. I understand how hard it is to reach a consensus around here.\n  My objection is not to the deal as a whole. I appreciate the fact \nthat sequestration relief occurred for our DOD budget for 2 years, and \nnondefense spending, and it was paid for. I appreciate that very much \nbecause sequestration has really cut into our ability to defend this \nNation in a dramatic fashion, and to have it paid for is also a worthy \ngoal and the right thing to do.\n  The point Senator Ayotte, Senator Sessions, and I are trying to make \nis that a budget is about your priorities. What we are doing today is \ntelling everybody in America what is important to the Congress, the \nSenate, and the House when it comes to getting a budget passed for 2 \nyears and how we should pay for it. Here is what I can't understand: Of \nall the groups in America you would go to and single out, unlike any \nother group, to pay for the offset and come up with some money out of \ntheir pocket to get this budget deal passed--which doesn't keep us from \nbecoming Greece, by any means, but I do applaud the effort--we picked \nthe military community.\n  Here is what we have done to our military retirees, past, present, \nand future: We have taken their cost-of-living adjustment and reduced \nit by 1 percent until they get to age 62. If you are an E-7, a master \nsergeant in the Air Force, who retires at 42 in 2015, by the time you \nget to 62, this 1-percent reduction a year of your COLA amounts to \nalmost $72,000 in lost benefits.\n  Do you know how much a master sergeant with 20 years of service makes \nin retirement? It is less than $25,000 a year. So that almost $72,000 \nnumber requires the master sergeant to give up 3 years of retirement, \nbecause $24,000 to $25,000 a year is what they make for a 20-year \nperiod, and the cost of the COLA reduction is almost $72,000, so \nbasically you have taken 3 years of their retirement away to do a \nbudget deal that could be accomplished without having to do that to our \nmilitary.\n  By the way, nobody else in the country is doing this. No Social \nSecurity recipient has given up a dime. The COLA formula for the \nmilitary is exactly the same as Social Security and other COLAs that we \nget around here.\n  Should we look at reforming our military retirement pay pension \nbenefit system? Yes, because it is unsustainable in the future. \nEntitlement growth in the military is real, just as it is on the \ncivilian side. Nobody has ever envisioned doing it this way, to take \nthe military retiree community and retroactively apply a benefit cut to \nthem that takes $6.3 billion out of the retiree community. These are \nthe people who have been fighting the wars for 20 years. These are the \npeople who have been serving continuously since 9/11, overseas and at \nhome, trying to protect the Nation, and this COLA reduction doesn't \njust apply to people who have retired and are in good health at 40 or \n42 or 45, it also applies to people who are medically retired. Someone \nwho has had their legs blown off in Afghanistan or Iraq, and most \nlikely will not be able to get a second job, is going to lose thousands \nof dollars in this cost-of-living adjustment, and nobody else in the \ncountry is so situated.\n  Can we do better? You better believe it. Here is what Congress told \nthe Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission. We \nset up a commission last year to advise the Congress next year on how \nwe can fairly adjust retirement packages to make the personnel costs \nmore sustainable in the Department of Defense in the future and how we \ncan do that fairly.\n  Do you know what we told the commission. We mandated that any change \nthey recommend has to grandfather existing forces and retirees. We put \nit in the law that created this commission. We put a restriction on the \ncommission's ability to come up with pension, pay, and benefit reform \nby saying: You cannot apply it to people who have signed up and are \nexpecting certain things. They are grandfathered.\n  We should have told ourselves that. We limited the commission, but we \ndo exactly what the commission is not allowed to do. I don't know how \nmy colleagues are going to explain this when they go back home. I hope \nsomebody will ask what you are trying to accomplish. Trying to have a \nbipartisan budget that avoids a government shutdown is good, but asking \nthe people who have been on the front lines of defending this Nation, \nwho have been in the military for 20 years--and do you have any idea \nhow many times the average military family moves in 20 years? Do you \nhave any idea how many\n\n[[Page S8895]]\n\nschools their children will attend because they move every couple of \nyears? Do you have any idea what it is like to serve this country since \n9/11?\n  All I can say is if we want to find $6.3 billion over the next decade \nto pay for this budget deal, we can find better alternatives than this \nif we take some time.\n  If my colleagues don't like what Senator Ayotte is doing, there are \nother ways. I am not asking a Democrat to defund ObamaCare to keep the \ngovernment open. I am not asking a Democrat to take away a safety net \nfrom a group of Americans who are struggling. I am not asking a \nRepublican to raise taxes. I am asking both of us, before Christmas, to \nrethink what we are doing here and take a little bit of time to fix a \nproblem that, quite frankly, is unconscionable.\n  If you make over $250,000 a year in retirement, you receive $109 a \nmonth for a subsidy to pay for your Part D prescription drug bill. Here \nis what I would say: If you want to pick on rich people, let's do it. \nTo me, $250,000 puts you in a category of living pretty good. Why in \nthe world does our government give you $109 a month to pay your \nprescription drug bill when we as a nation are broke? That subsidy \nalone is worth $54 billion over the next 10 years. What if we took some \nof that money? What if we went to the $250,000 retiree and said: Would \nyou give up some of your subsidy to pay your drug bill so military \nretirees don't have to lose the retirement benefits they have earned \nand have fought so hard to defend this Nation for so long? I bet they \nwould say yes.\n  Here is the point: We are going to rush through this. If you ask me \nwhat bothers me the most about this, it is how insensitive we have \nbecome as a nation. We trip over ourselves to welcome the troops home \nwhen they come back from deployment. Members of Congress want to be \nthere when the Guard unit leaves. We want to show how much we love the \ntroops. That is a good thing.\n  Every American--Republican, Libertarian, vegetarian, Democrat--we all \nlove the troops, but your Congress is expressing that love in a very \nstrange way.\n  How far have we fallen? Do we have no shame? As a body elected by the \nAmerican people to make sure the Nation is well run, what is the proper \nfirst role of the Federal Government? To defend the Nation. Tell me how \nto defend this Nation without people willing to die for it.\n  The budget doesn't defend this Nation. The CBO, the OMB, and all \nthese acronyms do not defend the Nation against radical Islam. I am \nurging my colleagues in a spirit of bipartisanship and common decency: \nDo not single out the military retiree who has served so long and so \nhard and ask them to give so much when others are doing almost nothing.\n  As to our Federal employees, you are being asked to contribute more \nto the Federal retirement system, and I am sure that is a burden. But \nwhat do we do to Federal employees? We say that everybody who is in the \nsystem today does not share that burden. They are grandfathered. It is \nonly for people who are hired in the future.\n  As to the military retiree, thank you for all of your hard work. Boy, \ndo we have a deal for you.\n  This is not going to stand. This is going to pass because everybody \nis hellbent on getting out of here and going home and celebrating a \nbipartisan breakthrough, and we are going to talk about how we have \nbecome functional again. I do appreciate the effort to become \nfunctional, but to me, in our effort to become functional, we have lost \nour way and, quite frankly, lost our soul. Any political body that \nwould do this in the name of good government has forgotten what \ngovernment is all about. It is for, by, and of the people.\n  I will tell you right now, from the CEO to the doorman, when they \nhear about what we have done to pay for a budget deal at the expense of \nthe military retired community, they are not going to be very \nappreciative. I promise this: If we don't fix it now, not only are we \ngoing to review it, we are going to fix it.\n  To our President: There is only one Commander in Chief. How could any \nCommander in Chief sign a bill that does this? Call us down to the \nWhite House, put us in a room, Republicans and Democrats, and don't let \nus out until we find a $6.3 billion offset that doesn't do injustice to \nthe military retired community. If I were the President, I sure as hell \nwould do that. Nobody would be going home until we got this right.\n\n  So the President owes a duty to the troops greater than anybody \nbecause he is their Commander in Chief. I don't know whether we are \ngoing to get this fixed. The train is running, and the retired military \ncommunity is on the tracks, and a few of us are trying to get them off. \nI promise their families that if we fail today, we are going to come \nback at this tomorrow, over and over and over, until the Congress finds \nits soul.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first of all, my good friend from South \nCarolina is a mind reader. He always looks at you and figures out what \nyou are going to say and then he says it better.\n  There are a couple of things that haven't been said during this \ndiscussion, and I want to mention them, and then I know we are going to \nvote. One is that our military was told--and I talked to several of the \ngroups, the military retiring groups and others--that they would be \ngrandfathered in. Now, I want everyone grandfathered in if we are going \nto do something like this. Certainly, in one installation in my State \nof Oklahoma, we have 13,000 civilian employees who are going to be \ngrandfathered in, and I want them to be grandfathered in. That is the \nright thing to do.\n  People make career decisions predicated on what they are told at the \ntime. And these military guys--and I look around the room and most of \nthe Senators who are in here have spent a lot of time, as I have, in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, and we talk to these guys in the mess hall, and \nthey talk about how they happened to get in. They make these decisions, \nand then we come along and take it away.\n  I think it has been said enough, the example of the gunnery sergeant \nat age 42, having been in for 20 years, and it is going to cost him \nsome $72,000, but not much is said about the officers. For the \nofficers, it is actually a lot more than that. An O-5 officer at that \nagency under the same circumstances would lose $124,000. These are not \nwealthy people; these are people who depend upon this for their \nretirement.\n  They were told, as I mentioned, that they also--the military people--\nwould be grandfathered in. Now, anytime one is grandfathered in, then \nobviously they change the rules and the new people making a career \ndecision will make it predicated on those circumstances of retirement \nthat are there at that time.\n  I have to say this: Tomorrow we are going to be involved in the bill \nthat was put together by the big four. It is the NDAA. It is a must-\npass bill. We will pass it. I can't imagine there won't be the votes to \npass it. But I can tell my colleagues this: If we had known this was \ngoing to come up, we would have addressed this in the NDAA. This is \nsomething that could have been addressed and could have been offset.\n  So I agree with everyone who has spoken on this issue. I think it is \nvery difficult to understand how this could happen. We do know this: \nOne of the differences between civilian employees and military \nemployees is that we can't recall civilian employees.\n  We have a figure here. Are my colleagues aware that we actually have, \nsince September 11, 3,456 military retirees who have been recalled to \nduty? Every one of them is going to be affected by this. This is a \ntravesty we cannot allow to happen.\n  I applaud my friend from Alabama for bringing this up, and hopefully \nwe will be able to correct it. We are going to have a vote right now, \nand I hope this is a solution to it. Then tomorrow we will have a \nchance to get into the details about the NDAA bill, which is a very \nsignificant bill that addresses provisions such as this.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for their \nheartfelt remarks about the cuts in this bill that will immediately \nimpact the retirements of American military. They are subject to \nrecall, to Active Duty. They are expecting these payments. Other\n\n[[Page S8896]]\n\ndepartments and agencies and government employees are not going to get \ntheir retirement reduced; only people who served in the military. It is \nnot correct, and it should not happen.\n  What I want to emphasize to all of my colleagues and highlight for us \nhere today is that the legislation before us now was brought forth in a \nway that will not allow any amendments. If people have an idea about a \nproblem with this legislation that was agreed to in secret by a couple \nof Senators--I suppose maybe some staff involved, so they agreed to \nthis language. It is the first time we have seen it. It is the first \ntime it has been before the light of day in the Senate, and we find \nproblems with it, real problems.\n  If people ask schoolchildren, if people ask senior citizens in \nAmerica, if a bill hits the floor of the Senate and it has bad \nprovisions in it, what can Senators do, well, they will say that \nSenators offer an amendment and they fix it. Isn't that what we were \ntaught? Isn't that what the history of the Senate is all about? It is a \nplace where people can debate and amend and improve legislation. But we \nare in an odd and unusual circumstance--not so odd in recent years.\n  The majority leader of the Senate has sought recognition, as he is \nable to do, and he has filled the amendment tree, and nobody can get an \namendment. Nobody can get a vote on this amendment to fix this part of \nthe legislation that plainly needs fixing. It is not available to us. \nThat is awfully hard to believe. It is awfully hard to believe that in \nthe great Senate--as Senator Robert Byrd said, there are two great \nSenates: the Roman Senate and the American Senate; and he defended it \nand its rights and priorities. But we have one leader of the Senate, \nsupported by his colleagues, who says: We don't want amendments because \nwe might have to take tough votes, and all we want to do is rubberstamp \nthis agreement, this bill written in secret, and we want to pass it \nwithout any amendments.\n  How did that become the policy of America? How did that become the \npolicy in the Senate? What justification can be given to the concept \nthat duly-elected Senators can't stand up on the floor of this body and \ndefend the rights of their constituents and their States by offering \namendments to improve legislation?\n  Tomorrow we are going to have the Defense spending bill, authorizing \nthe expenditure of over $500 billion--$500 billion-plus--to fund our \nmilitary. A lot of people have ideas about how to improve that bill. We \nare not going to get a single amendment because the majority leader has \nfilled the tree and he is going to deny the Members of this body, who \nrepresent millions of people in their States--and really we represent \neverybody--the right to offer amendments to improve that bill. It is \ncontrary to our tradition. It is contrary to our heritage. It is \ncontrary particularly to the heritage of the U.S. Senate, where open \ndebate and discussion is so important.\n\n  I thank Senator Wicker. He spoke this morning. I thank Senators \nAyotte, Graham, and Inhofe, who shared their thoughts about the lack of \nwisdom in this legislation.\n  I am going to offer a tabling motion, and the purpose of it will be \nto remove the parliamentary maneuver of Majority Leader Reid and allow \nus to have a vote. So what is this motion about? This motion will \nremove the filling of the tree, and it will allow the Senate to vote on \nthis amendment to strike the military retiree pay cut--and other \namendments, perhaps, but this amendment in particular. I believe that \nis in the tradition of the Senate. I believe it is extremely important.\n  So, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \nmotion so that I may offer a motion to concur with amendment No. 2572 \nwhich is filed at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill object, first, as many of my colleagues here know, I have \ndedicated much of my career to fighting for our Nation's veterans and \nour military families. I am the daughter of a World War II veteran. I \nam the first woman ever to chair the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee. I have worked tirelessly time and again to safeguard the \nhealth care and the benefits and services that those in our uniforms \nhave sacrificed for. So obviously any provision that impacts them or \nthe benefits our servicemembers have earned is of great concern to me.\n  As is true with any very difficult compromise, there are certain \npolicy changes in this bill I would never have made on my own. \nThankfully, though, we wrote this bill in a way that will allow 2 years \nbefore this change is implemented--2 years--so that Democrats and \nRepublicans can keep working together to improve this provision or find \nsmarter savings elsewhere. In that time I know there is an armed \nservices-mandated military retirement commission due to report their \nfindings, which would give both Chambers time to legislate a solution \nbefore any COLA change is ever implemented.\n  I also know the senior Senator from Michigan, the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, has indicated he is going to move forward \nwith efforts to review this change before it takes effect, and I \nsupport that effort. I am quite sure other Members of the Senate will \nlook for ways to replace these savings in a different way. In other \nwords, we can and we will look at other hopefully better ways to change \nthis policy going forward.\n  But opening this bill to changes today, after the vast majority of \nCongress has voiced their support for a deal that ends the repeated \ncrises we have faced in this Nation, is not the solution. In fact, \njeopardizing this deal right now only threatens our national security, \nand it will force layoffs of those very servicemembers and civilian \nmilitary personnel so many Members have come out here to speak on \nbehalf of.\n  As with any bill, the oversight process in Congress will move forward \nthe moment we pass it, and there is no doubt that improvements will be \nmade where they are needed. But this motion, I say to my colleagues, is \nan effort to bring down this bill, to stop us from moving forward, and \nfor that reason alone it should be voted down. Therefore, Madam \nPresident, I object to the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. WICKER. Will the distinguished chairman yield on her reservation?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I still have the floor, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I believe that is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. WICKER. I don't mean to prolong this, but I wish to ask this of \nthe distinguished chairman.\n  I think everyone should understand that although the Senator from \nWashington chairs the committee and was a member of the conference \ncommittee, this is not a report of the conference committee. The \nquestion I wish to ask is, Did the negotiators realize, when this COLA-\nless-1-percent provision was inserted in the conference committee, that \nit would mean $80,000 lifetime out of the retirement pay of the typical \nenlisted retiree? Did the conferees realize the magnitude of what they \nwere agreeing to? Did the two negotiators agree to the magnitude of \nwhat they were sending to the House and Senate?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Alabama yield to the \nSenator from Washington to answer that question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would be pleased to yield to the \nSenator without yielding the floor to answer that question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I would suggest that the Senator ask \nthat question to Chairman Ryan. But I would say again, as many of us \nhave talked about here today, this is not the deal Democrats would have \nwritten on our own. It is not the deal Republicans would have written \non their own. Nobody got everything they wanted, and we each had to \ngive up some things to get to where we are today, again, to bring us \nback to a time of certainty because without a budget moving forward \ntoday, we would be facing a time in a few short weeks where there would \nbe dramatic changes and cuts to, in particular, our Department of \nDefense, meaning furloughs and layoffs and a threat to our national \nsecurity, as so many Members of the military have told us.\n\n[[Page S8897]]\n\n  So I hope we can move forward. I know we are going to go through some \nparliamentary inquiries and a motion here in a minute. But I hope our \nMembers would take the time to say, ``What is the end process here.'' \nand vote with us to not change this at this point and to allow us to go \nforward and bring certainty to so many families across this country at \nthis holiday season time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has the floor.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I wonder if the Senator from Alabama \nwould yield to me for 60 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield to the Senator without yielding the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I would ask the Senator from Alabama, it seems to me no one wants to \nclaim parenthood of this very onerous penalty on the retired \nservicemembers of the United States of America. I would have to infer \nfrom the answer of the Senator from Washington that she was not aware. \nOne percent from COLAs sounds so innocuous, but when its comes to \n$130,000 for officers and $80,000 for enlisted people, it is real \nmoney.\n  This is a penalty, and it is hitting the people who step forward and \nvolunteer to serve our country and protect our security. So until \nsomeone is willing to step forward and claim ownership, I have to \nassume the negotiators did not know the impact this would have on our \nmilitary retirees. It seems to me the Senator from Alabama has devised \na way to surgically remove this provision, pay for it elsewhere, and \nsend it back to the House. I think we would be doing them a favor, \nfrankly.\n  I thank my friend from Alabama for yielding.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, I thank the Senator.\n  I would note that Senator Ayotte, who has spoken, Senator Graham, and \nSenator Wicker, along with myself, were conferees on the budget \nconference committee and that this was supposed to be the kind of thing \nwe would discuss. But we were not called to the final discussion, and \nnow this legislation is brought to the floor that we did not have time \nto approve in advance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield for a second?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I say to Senator Graham from South Carolina, I am \npleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator.\n  To follow on what Senator Wicker said, I have been trying to find out \nhow this started to begin with too. Whose good idea was this?\n  So I called the Secretary of Defense, and he said: We did not do \nthis. I talked to Chuck Hagel, and he said: This did not come from us. \nBecause I said: What are you all doing over there? Please understand, \nSenator Graham, this did not come from us.\n  I think Senator Wicker knows the exact number. But if you are a \nmilitary retiree, on your DD214 form--I do not know if the Senator from \nAlabama knows this, but when you get your retirement, your discharge \nDD214 form, at the bottom it says: Subject to being recalled.\n  Does the Senator know how many military retirees have been recalled \nsince 9/11?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I do not, I say to Senator Graham.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think the Senator from Mississippi may have the exact \nnumber, and it amounts to a brigade of soldiers, almost.\n  I ask the Senator from Mississippi, what is the number?\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, if the Senator would yield for an answer \nto that question, precisely 3,456 DOD retirees--the very people we are \npenalizing in this provision--have been recalled to Active Duty since \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I say to Senator Graham, you are a full colonel in the \nAir Force, still serving in the Reserve.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. Take my pay.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Bless your heart. But it is a fact that this retirement \npay is really more than retirement pay, is it not? It is really an \nincome, a source of payment that ensures that the person can be \nrecalled. So it is part of the right to recall you, a compensation for \nthat.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The answer is that when you retire after 20, you are \nsubject to being recalled as long as you are physically able. I know \none individual who was recalled at age 56 who was a JAG officer who had \nbeen out of the military for years. He set up his practice, and he \nsaid: Can they do this? I said: Hey, man, you are the lawyer. Of \ncourse. Read it. You know they can do this. And they did, only because \nwe had to, and he went and did his part.\n  I bet you that of those 3,400, some of them were volunteers and some \nof them were not. But the cost-of-living adjustment is to make sure \ntheir retirement over time maintains its value. That is why we have a \ncost-of-living adjustment.\n  How much money do you make if you are a master sergeant after 20 \nyears of service? It is less than $25,000 a year in retirement. So \nthese people do not become millionaires when they retire. Try to raise \na family of four on $25,000 without a COLA. So the COLA is designed to \nkeep the benefit vibrant over time. When you do a COLA minus 1 percent, \nit does diminish the value of the package.\n  Here is what gets me the most. If we did it for everybody in the \ncountry, that would be one thing. These are the only people in America \nwho get this special good deal.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator Graham. I think he \nmade the defining point there, that this is a one-sided reduction of \nretirement benefits to people who served in the military, not impacting \nlots of others.\n  I want to return to the central point. This bill that will be voted \non tomorrow--final passage--cuts military retirement by $6 billion. \nThat $6 billion is counted in the numbers of the proponents of the \nlegislation toward their justification for spending more money the next \n2 years. They say they are paying for it by reducing this $6 billion \nover time. It is mandated. It is not an option in the bill. We should \nnot pass legislation that does that.\n  So what I would propose is that we not go along with Majority Leader \nReid's determination to run the train over the men and women of our \nmilitary, that we slow down and we follow the regular process of the \nSenate, not fill the tree, and allow amendments to be voted on on this \nsubstantive matter.\n  So parliamentary inquiry, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Is it correct that while the majority leader's motion \nto concur in the House amendment with an amendment to which the \nmajority leader has also offered a second-degree amendment is pending--\nwhile it is pending, no Senator is permitted to offer an amendment to \nthe House-passed spending package?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So let me repeat to be sure my colleagues and I \nunderstand the situation. The Chair has just told the Senate that I \ncannot offer an amendment to the House-passed spending bill that would \nstrike the military retiree pay cut because the majority leader has \nfilled the tree with his own amendments. I have read the majority \nleader's amendments, and I see they merely change the date of enactment \nby a few days.\n  Further, parliamentary inquiry, Madam President: If a motion to table \nthe majority leader's motion to concur with an amendment is successful, \nwould there be an opportunity for me to offer a motion to concur with \namendment No. 2572?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, there would.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Again, summarizing for my colleagues, the Presiding \nOfficer is telling this Senate that if there can be 51 votes to table \nthe current amendment tree to the House-passed spending bill, then \nthere will be an opportunity for me or other Senators to offer by \nmotion a motion to concur with the amendment that strikes the military \npay cut.\n  So, Madam President, in order to make a motion to concur with \namendment No. 2572, I move to table the pending motion to concur with \nan amendment offered by the majority leader, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested.\n\n[[Page S8898]]\n\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Section 401 of the Bipartisan Budget Act \nof 2013 creates a new category of employee called a further revised \nannuity employee and would require further revised annuity employees to \ncontribute additional amounts into the Civil Service Retirement and \nDisability Fund. It is the intent of Congress for the Office of \nPersonnel Management to create a new normal cost for the further \nrevised annuity employees, and to ensure that the retirement plan not \nbe underfunded.\n  Additionally, it is the intent that for the new further revised \nannuity employee plan that the only determinant of whether an \nindividual is a Federal Employee Retirement System, FERS, employee or \nMember, as opposed to a FERS revised annuity employee or FERS further \nrevised annuity employee, is through application of the FERS revised \nannuity employee test. And that the new further revised annuity \nemployee test only differentiates between FERS revised annuity employee \ncoverage and new FERS further revised annuity employee coverage.\n\n\n                        Transboundary Agreements\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I want to briefly discuss Section 304 of \nthe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which contained an amendment to the \nOuter Continental Shelf Lands Act. I was disappointed to see that the \namended Section 32 requires submissions regarding future transboundary \nhydrocarbon agreements be made to the Speaker of the House, the Senate \nMajority Leader, the chair of the Committee on Natural Resources of the \nHouse of Representatives, and the chair of the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources in the Senate. This language fails to mention the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, an omission I find curious in light \nof the Foreign Relations Committee's jurisdiction over international \nagreements. I would like to yield to my colleague from Washington in \norder to clarify that this language was not intended to negate the \nForeign Relations Committee's jurisdiction of transboundary hydrocarbon \nagreements.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator for his question, and I appreciate \nhis leadership as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I \nunderstand his concerns and can assure him that the language in the \nBipartisan Budget Act of 2013 was not intended to alter or negate the \nForeign Relation Committee's jurisdiction.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the Senator from Washington for her response, \nand I appreciate the tremendous work she has done to arrive at a budget \nagreement. Due to the importance of this issue, I want to seek \nadditional confirmation of this point. The February 20, 2012 Agreement \nbetween the United States of America and the United Mexican States \nConcerning Transboundary Hydrocarbon Reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico \nwent through the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources with \nthe approval of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee because the \nimplementing legislation was narrow and addressed the ability of the \nDepartment of the Interior to carry out the agreement. However, the \nForeign Relations Committee engaged in robust oversight of this \nagreement in meetings with high-ranking officials at the Department of \nState and the Department of the Interior, including the submission of a \ndetailed letter with several questions, which received a lengthy \nresponse. These actions reflect the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee's intention to retain oversight of transboundary hydrocarbon \nagreements, and to reserve the right to draft and oversee implementing \nlegislation for future transboundary hydrocarbon agreements.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. It is quite clear by the extensive work the committee has \ndone on the U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Hydrocarbon Agreement that the \ncommittee has an expertise in international agreements and should play \nan integral role in the oversight of future transboundary hydrocarbon \nagreements. The language in the Bipartisan Budget Act was not intended \nto undermine the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's jurisdiction with \nrespect to any matter that would be properly before it.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the chair of the Budget Committee for her \nresponses.\n\n\n                     Not-For-Profit Loan Servicing\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Murray, and several of my \ncolleagues regarding the not-for-profit student loan servicing \nprovisions in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013.\n  Is it your understanding and intent that the not-for-profit servicing \nprovision in this act does not require the termination of the existing \nFederal loan servicing contracts of any not-for-profit servicers who \nare currently servicing Federal loans?\n  Is it further the understanding and intent of the chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee that the Education Department will continue to \nenter into contracts with not-for-profit servicers based on their \nperformance?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from Vermont is correct. It \nis my intent that existing contracts to use the services of not-for-\nprofit servicers are not terminated by this bill and that they will be \npermitted to compete with the Department of Education's title IV \nservicers for additional accounts. I know several of my colleagues also \nfeel strongly about this issue. I would like to recognize the following \nSenators to also join in on the colloquy: Senators Leahy, Harkin, \nAlexander, Hatch, Shaheen, Begich, Grassley, King, Baucus, Tester, and \nMurkowski.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I may join in this colloquy, I am glad \nfor the clarification from the senior Senator from Washington and am \npleased to know it is her legislative intent for the Department of \nEducation to continue to use not-for-profit servicers and maintain \ntheir existing contracts and that not-for-profit servicers will be \npermitted to compete in the future for additional accounts. Like other \nnot-for-profits around the country, the Vermont Student Assistance \nCorporation, VSAC, has provided counseling services and low-cost loans \nto students and Vermonters for more than 40 years. Since then, VSAC has \nworked hard to establish and maintain strong and longstanding working \nrelationships with Vermont's higher education institutions, as well as \nK-12 schools, to provide outreach programs critical to the economic \nvitality of Vermont. In their new role servicing Federal loans, VSAC \nhas consistently received praise from their customers and scored high \nin customer satisfaction surveys. In fact,\n\n[[Page S8899]]\n\nwhen Congress switched to direct lending we ensured that not-for-profit \nservicers would continue to service Federal loans because of the \nsuperior customer service experience that not-for-profits servicers \nhave consistently provided. I am glad that Congress is continuing to \nrecognize the importance of not-for-profit servicers in our communities \nand intends to allow for their continued role of servicing Federal \nloans and helping more students gain access to college and more \nstudents to complete their degrees.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as chairman of the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee, which holds jurisdiction over the \nservicing of our Federal student loan programs, it is my understanding \nthat the intent of the budget agreement is to allow for the \ncontinuation of the existing not-for-profit servicer contracts and that \nthey will be permitted to compete based on performance with the \nDepartment of Education's title IV servicers for additional accounts, \nso that students receive the best possible service and taxpayer funds \nare used efficiently.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for \nengaging in this dialogue and appreciate the Senator from Washington \nclarifying that it is the intent of the budget measure for the \nDepartment of Education to continue to use not-for-profit servicers for \nthe Federal loan program and that these entities should be permitted to \ncompete for additional loan volume in the future.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont and the \nSenator from Washington for providing clarification on this issue. I am \nhappy to hear that the legislative intent of the budget deal is to \ncontinue the use of the not-for-profit student loan servicers and that \nthey will be permitted to compete in the future for additional \naccounts.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with \nthe comments of the senior Senator from Washington and am pleased to \nknow it is her intent that not-for-profit servicers, like the New \nHampshire Higher Education Loan Corporation and the NHHEAF Network, \nwill be able to continue their important work and that they will be \nable to compete in the future for additional accounts.\n  For over 50 years, the New Hampshire Higher Education Loan \nCorporation and the NHHEAF Network have provided critical college \naccess, financial education, and default-prevention programs to \nstudents in New Hampshire and across the country. The New Hampshire \nHigher Education Loan Corporation's dedicated staff services a national \nportfolio over 250,000 borrowers, helping them to manage repayment of \nalmost $5 billion in student loans. These professionals play a uniquely \nimportant role in helping students to succeed in postsecondary \neducation, and I am pleased that it is the Senator from Washington's \nintent to allow them to continue their work.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise as well to thank the senior Senator \nfrom Washington for her insight and to echo the comments from my \ncolleagues, especially my good friend from Alaska. The not-for-profit \nstudent loan servicer in my State, the Alaska Student Loan Corporation, \ndoes an outstanding job of servicing student loans. They take a \nproactive and supportive role with the accounts they receive from the \nDepartment, and I want to ensure they will be able to continue to \nparticipate in this important program. I was pleased to learn that the \nchairman's intent in including this language was not to exclude not-\nfor-profit servicers from competing for additional servicing accounts.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with \nthe comments of the senior Senator from Washington and am pleased to \nknow it is her intent that the use of not-for-profit servicers \ncontinues and that not-for-profit servicers will be permitted to \ncompete on an equal basis in the future for additional accounts.\n  Mr. KING. Mr President, I wish to associate myself with the comments \nof the senior Senator from Washington. I am pleased to know that it is \nher intent that the work of not-for-profit servicers advances and that \nthey will continue to be allowed to compete for additional accounts in \nthe future. In Maine, two not-for-profit servicers, the Finance \nAuthority of Maine and Maine Education Services, provide essential \nservices to Maine students through financial literacy education and the \nservicing of Federal student loans. Indeed, not-for-profit servicers do \nmeaningful work across the country, and I am glad to know it is the \nSenate Budget Committee Chairman's intent to continue to allow these \nState agencies and nonprofits to play a role in servicing federal \nstudent loans.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would also like to associate myself with \nthe senior Senator from Washington, my colleague from Vermont, and my \ncolleague from Montana. Our Montana servicer, the Student Assistance \nFoundation, provides vital services to Montana students by delivering \nfinancial aid education, scholarships, and grants. I am therefore \npleased to know it is the intent of the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee that not-for-profit student loan servicers will continue to \nplay a role in the servicing market and will be permitted to compete \nfor future servicing contracts.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise to share in this important \ndiscussion and would also like to associate myself with the comments of \nthe senior Senator from Washington and my colleague from Montana. The \nStudent Assistance Foundation is a strong employer in Montana, \nrepresenting nearly 200 jobs, and I am pleased to know it is the chair \nof the Budget Committee's intent that the use of not-for-profit \nservicers continues. I am also pleased that not-for-profit servicers, \nsuch as the Student Assistance Foundation, will be permitted to compete \nin the future for additional accounts.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to know it is the intent \nof the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee--the chief Senate \nnegotiator for the Bipartisan Budget Act--that nonprofit servicers will \ncontinue to play an important role in servicing Federal student loans, \nboth now and in the future. I strongly support this intent and the \nvital public service role that nonprofit and State agency servicers \nhave played in Federal student loan programs on behalf of Federal \nstudent loan borrowers and the American public. I will be one of those \nwho will expect the Department to pay close attention to congressional \nintent in this matter. I also look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on both the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee and the Appropriations Committee to ensure that this intent \nis carried out.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee, who coauthored this legislation, for \nclarifying that it is not the intent of the bill's authors to require \nthat existing contracts with not-for-profit student loan servicers be \ncanceled and that such servicers will continue to be able to compete \nfor additional Department of Education contracts in the future. Not-\nfor-profit servicers provide students in Maine and across the country \nwith important financial counseling services, and I am pleased to know \nthat they will continue to be allowed to compete to perform this work \nunder this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam Chair, I yield 1 hour of my time postcloture to \nSenator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 3588, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3588) to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to \n     exempt fire hydrants from the prohibition on the use of lead \n     pipes, fittings, fixtures, solder, and flux.\n\n\n[[Page S8900]]\n\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third \ntime and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3588) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. To go over what happened, this is on behalf of myself \nand Senator Toomey. It is a bipartisan bill.\n  There was a recently released Environmental Protection Agency \ninterpretation of a law that could cost local governments, \nmunicipalities, and taxpayers across the country millions of dollars \nand undermine public safety.\n  It is a classic case of the Federal bureaucracy and restriction \nharming our local communities and their budgets. No one would believe \nthis, but it is about one of the most basic functions of government--\nfire hydrants.\n  Almost 3 years ago, Congress passed the Reduction of Lead in Drinking \nWater Act, legislation with an admirable goal, a goal that is spelled \nout right in the name, and the law is set to be implemented on January \n4, 2014.\n  As we know, Congress intended for this law to direct the EPA to make \nrules that would keep our drinking water safe from coming into contact \nwith lead-based parts. Congress did that and EPA exempted parts in \nbathtubs and showers that don't have direct impact on the quality of \nthe drinking water, such as the knobs, the hot and cold knobs. Of \ncourse, the faucets would be under the law.\n  But at the end of October, suddenly, the EPA released a new \ninterpretation of the law that for the first time put fire hydrants \nunder the new standard set by law, meaning everyone needs to buy and \ninstall new and upgraded fire hydrants that contain less lead.\n  It took everyone by surprise. Only a small fraction of fire hydrants \nare ever used for drinking water. Even when they are, lead poisoning is \nassociated with long-term exposure, which does not occur on the \noccasions when someone might drink from a hydrant.\n  While that surprising rule was announced at the end of October, the \nEPA expects all new fire hydrants installed after January 4 to be of \nthis new reduced-lead standard. No manufacturer can make fire hydrants \nthat quickly. If the interpretation stands, cities and county water \nauthorities would be forced to throw out hundreds of hydrants now in \nstock, wasting millions of dollars and passing that waste on to \nconsumers in terms of rate hikes. At the same time, there would be no \nnew hydrants they could install when a fire hydrant malfunctioned, when \nit was run over by a car in an accident or when a snowplow knocked it \ndown.\n  We are pleased this legislation we have just passed--my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania and I--will now exempt fire hydrants from the reduced \nlead standard, just as bathtub and shower pieces that don't have \ncontact with the water are exempt.\n  Simply put, the EPA's interpretation of reduced lead standards \nunnecessarily imposed a huge burden on municipalities and first \nresponders without any discernible safety benefit. We have now undone \nthat danger.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Would the Senator yield?\n  I yield to my colleague from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I wish to thank the Senator and our colleague from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Toomey, for the work on this issue.\n  Municipalities all around the country, including my State of Ohio, \nwere shocked to hear about this. I appreciate joining my colleague from \nNew York in a letter to the EPA.\n  Cash-strapped cities in New York, Ohio, and other States are happy to \nknow they are not going to have to take on this burden. It makes sense \nto stop, take a look at this, and be sure we are not forcing these \nhydrants--that are otherwise in good shape--to be repaired and \nreplaced. It is not something that is in the budgets of these cities.\n  I appreciate the Senator's work on it and look forward to ensuring \nthat this does not move forward into regulation but also that we figure \nout a more sensible way to deal with the issue.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague from Ohio. We appreciate his good \nwork. We have now saved municipalities millions of dollars, as well as \nensured safety in our communities because the fire hydrants that are in \nstock will be able to be used.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. On the last vote, I wish to mention to my colleagues \nwhat happened and what has happened. A major bill dealing with the debt \nof the United States was supposed to come out of a budget conference \ncommittee and come here.\n  The budget conference committee failed to complete its meetings and a \npiece of legislation was sent to the Senate. That legislation has not \nbeen subject to amendment.\n  The majority leader decided there would be no amendments, and he \nwould simply tell us that if we have amendments that will kill the bill \nor if we have amendments that will make us delay, we can't do it and we \nwill not do it and we will not get an amendment.\n  A number of good amendments have been filed. The one we just voted on \nwas one of the more egregious. That amendment reduces the retirement \npay of the U.S. military without reducing the retirement pay of anyone \nelse who served in government, only the military. So I moved to table \nthe filled tree that Majority Leader Reid has been using to block \nanybody from having amendments in the Senate on serious legislation.\n\n  I mean, this is serious legislation we didn't get to vote on. So the \nchoice for our colleagues, when they cast their vote, was would they \nvote to allow an amendment to be voted on that would protect veterans, \nmilitary retirees, from having their pensions reduced; or would they \nsupport the majority leader in his determination to block any \namendments to the legislation? So a majority has voted. They voted to \nblock the classical rights of Senators to have amendments and therefore \nto protect the leadership and the domination of this Senate in an \nunprecedented way by the majority leader.\n  He has already filled the tree more times than the previous four \nmajority leaders combined--more than twice as often. On every bill now, \nit seems, he fills the tree. To get an amendment, he has to approve it \nor you don't get it. If he decides there are no amendments, there are \nno amendments. So this is contrary to the tradition of the Senate, and \nwe have to change this. This highlights the danger of supporting that \nkind of process because it keeps us from fixing bad legislation and \nimproving it.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/17/senate-section/article/S8900-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8900-S8902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MAYORKAS NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, soon we will be voting on the \nnomination of Mr. Mayorkas for Deputy Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security. I have concerns about the nomination. First, I will \ndiscuss how Mr. Mayorkas has carried out the President's directive \ngiving legal status to thousands of individuals who are in the United \nStates unlawfully.\n  In 2012, Mr. Mayorkas was charged with implementing this President's \ndirective known as DACA--DACA--Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. \nI have always questioned whether the President's directive is legal. \nThe administration never responded to our requests for their legal \nbasis or opinions. This administration has not been transparent about \nwho is getting deferred action, how they are processing them, and \nwhether those who have been denied have been processed for removal.\n  They may call this program Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, \nbut it clearly benefits older adults, and possibly people who \nintentionally broke our laws. The agency didn't deny any single \napplicant until after the 2012 election. We still don't know how many \npeople were actually denied. We do know, however, that people were \napproved despite shoddy evidence, such as an Xbox receipt and Facebook \nposting. They always seem to find a way to get approval.\n  All denials for DACA have to be run through Washington. Adjudicators \non\n\n[[Page S8901]]\n\nthe line were given clear instruction they were not allowed to deny any \napplicant. Whistleblowers tell me that Mr. Mayorkas himself had to \napprove all denials.\n  Think about that. No denials were allowed unless the head of the \nagency personally approved the denial. What kind of message does that \nsend to civil servants, the career employees trying to do their job \nunder the law as the law requires, and to be very impartial. The boss \nhas his thumb on the scales. That isn't the rule of law.\n  Mr. Mayorka's message to adjudicators seems to have been that they \nhad better get to yes or he would personally get involved. This ``get \nto yes'' philosophy came up time and again with agency whistleblowers. \nThe Office of Inspector General looked into the situation and the \ninspector general confirmed what employers had said. A quarter of \nImmigration Service Officers interviewed felt pressured to approve \nquestionable applicants, and 90 percent felt they didn't have \nsufficient time to complete the interviews of those who seek benefits. \nThe report of the Office of Inspector General clearly showed the agency \nhad been pervaded by this ``get to yes'' culture.\n  Unfortunately, that culture hasn't changed under Mr. Mayorkas's \nleadership. In fact, based on concerns I heard from whistleblowers who \ncontacted my offices in mid-July of this year, it seems to have even \ngotten worse. These whistleblowers were aware that Mr. Mayorkas had \nbeen nominated to this Homeland Security position by late June. They \nwere also aware that since the fall of 2012, Mr. Mayorkas had been the \nsubject of an Office of Inspector General investigation into \nallegations of ethical or criminal misconduct.\n  When Mr. Mayorkas's nomination hearing was scheduled, the \nwhistleblowers were very surprised. They wondered why a hearing would \nproceed while the investigation was still open and pending, and then \ncontacted my office to make sure Congress was told about the \ninvestigation. The existence of this investigation was news to me at \nthat time. However, I didn't sit on the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs. So my staff contacted the staff of the \nranking member of that committee, Senator Coburn. His staff was also \nunaware the nominee was under investigation by the Inspector General.\n  It is extremely troubling that a hearing was scheduled to proceed \nwithout the ranking member of the committee knowing about the pending \ninvestigation of the nominee within the executive branch. Both my staff \nand the staff of Ranking Member Coburn contacted the inspector \ngeneral's office. We told his office about the whistleblower \nallegations and asked for confirmation as to whether there was an open \ninquiry.\n  This type of procedural information is routinely disclosed by an \ninspector general's office to Congress, and rightly so. Further, we \nasked for an explanation of why that information would be withheld \nwhile the committee was considering the nomination.\n  Understand, the Senate has a constitutional function of providing \nadvice and consent on these nominations. In order to do our duty, every \nSenator who is asked to vote on that nominee needs to have all the \nrelevant information about that nominee, and particularly when there is \na pending investigation.\n\n  To its credit, the Office of Inspector General answered our questions \nand confirmed there was indeed an open criminal investigation. Their \nwritten description stated that the inquiry involves ``alleged \nconflicts of interest, misuse of position, mismanagement of the EB-5 \nprogram, and an appearance of impropriety by Mayorkas and other . . . \nmanagement officials.''\n  How was it possible that this information was withheld from staff for \nthe ranking member of the committee considering that nomination? If not \nfor the whistleblowers who came forward, would we have known of the \ninvestigation?\n  When a nominee is under investigation, the Senate has no business \napproving that nominee until the facts are in. Historically, committees \nhave followed this precedent. As ranking member Coburn explained last \nweek, both the President and the Vice President supported this \nprecedent when they were in the Senate.\n  In July 2005, one ambassadorial nominee owned a company under \ninvestigation. Then-Senator Biden spoke out and supported delaying the \nvote on that nomination because of the investigation. Eventually, the \nnominee's company agreed to settle the investigation against it. Then-\nSenator Obama's spokesman issued a statement saying that due to the \nfact that a settlement was reached, Senator Obama would not seek to \nblock the nomination.\n  Like then-Senators Obama and Biden, I believe the Senate should wait \nfor investigations to conclude or, if the executive branch is taking \ntoo long, then Congress should do its own fact-finding. But forcing \nSenators to vote in ignorance is not a legitimate option. In fact, it \nis irresponsible.\n  Voting to approve a nominee who is under investigation without \nwaiting for the facts is incredibly risky. What if the investigation \ndetermines allegations are true? By rushing to approve the nominee, \nthis body would have failed one of our key functions under the \nConstitution.\n  I pointed this out when the Senate was considering the nomination of \nB. Todd Jones to become permanent head of the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Mr. Jones was the subject of an \nOffice of Special Counsel investigation due to allegations he \nretaliated against a whistleblower in the U.S. Attorney's office in \nMinnesota.\n  As Mr. Jones' nomination progressed through the Senate, the Justice \nDepartment and the whistleblower agreed to try mediation. The majority \ntried to claim the special counsel's case was, therefore, closed. \nHowever, I did state on the floor the special counsel's investigation \nwould continue if mediation failed.\n  Nevertheless, despite the open special counsel investigation, we \nvoted on July 31 to confirm Mr. Jones. In early September, the \nwhistleblower's mediation with the Justice Department did, indeed, \nfail.\n  The special counsel has resumed its investigation of Mr. Jones, just \nas the special counsel had told the Senate that it would. So the \nretaliation complaint against Mr. Jones is still pending this very day. \nWe don't know what the outcome will be because we did not take time to \ngather the facts, as Senators should. If we are unwilling to wait for \nan executive branch inquiry, then we should further gather the facts \nourselves.\n  Last week, Ranking Member Coburn asked Chairman Levin of the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations whether that committee would \nconsider interviewing witnesses in the controversy involving Mr. \nMayorkas. While he declined, Chairman Levin rightly noted if the \nsubcommittee were going to launch such an investigation, the vote on \nMr. Mayorkas would need to be delayed. I completely agree. This vote \nshould not take place until someone has been able to gather testimony \nand draw conclusions about these allegations.\n  Whistleblowers have provided my office with very troubling evidence \nregarding the substance of some of the allegations. Much of the \nevidence involves the EB-5 regional center program, which Mayorkas is \nresponsible for managing. The evidence appears to support allegations \nMr. Mayorkas and his leadership team at Citizenship and Immigration \nServices are susceptible to political pressure and favoritism. Our \nimmigration system should be governed by equal application of the law, \nnot by who has the best political connections to the director of the \nagency.\n  I have given Mayorkas a chance to defend himself and explain the \nevidence, which seems compelling. Back in July and August I wrote \nseveral letters to Mr. Mayorkas outlining whistleblower allegations and \nattaching some of the documents the whistleblowers provided. I asked \nhow he accounted for this evidence, but he has utterly failed to reply \nto my letters.\n  It has been 4 or 5 months since I sent Mr. Mayorkas these letters. \nJust like his personal oversight of DACA, these documents show Mr. \nMayorkas being much more directly involved in individual EB-5 cases \nthan he has led my staff or the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee to believe. They appear to show him intervening in \nEB-5 decisions involving Gulf Coast Funds Management, an organization \nrun by nobody other than Hillary Clinton's brother Anthony Rodham.\n\n[[Page S8902]]\n\n  This decision benefited GreenTech Automotive, a company run by Terry \nMcAuliffe which was receiving funding from Gulf Coast Funds Management.\n  This evidence about political influence and intervention is \nparticularly troubling because of Mr. Mayorkas' prior history. In 2001 \nMr. Mayorkas had a role in a group of pardons and commutations issued \nby President Clinton in the closing days of the second term. A 2002 \nHouse report found that then-U.S. Attorney Mayorkas inappropriately \nsought to influence a decision regarding whether drug trafficker Carlos \nVignali's prison sentence should be commuted.\n  However, my concerns about the investigation pending against Mr. \nMayorkas are about more than just improper political influence. Under \nhis leadership over the last few years, the EB-5 Program has grown far \nbeyond its original intent, which I supported. It is intended to be an \navenue for foreign investors to participate in new commercial \nenterprises which actually create jobs in this country in exchange for \na U.S. visa. The program was created as a pilot, allowing regional \ncenters to pool funds from investors to create new businesses and jobs. \nIn the process, the centers had to prove they were creating the jobs \nthey promised to create.\n  Skeptics questioned whether the program truly creates jobs. \nWhistleblowers have expressed concerns that foreign investors are not \nbeing vetted carefully enough. They say Mr. Mayorkas is more interested \nin approving applications quickly than making security checks more \nrobust.\n  Given what we know about these security concerns inside the agency, \nCongress needs to reexamine this program. It should serve its purpose \nwithout compromising our national security.\n  Mr. Mayorkas claims he has changed the program since learning of \nfraud and security concerns. The only tangible change we have seen is \nthat additional economists have been hired and adjudicators from \nCalifornia were moved here to Washington, DC. Yet moving the EB-5 \nprocess to Washington increased Mr. Mayorkas' control over the program, \njust as he has in the DACA Program.\n  Whistleblowers have provided me with emails from Mr. Mayorkas saying \nthat he wants to keep fraud and national security concerns about \nGreenTech or the SLS Hotel in Las Vegas ``close hold.'' As I said \nearlier, the rule of law isn't possible when the boss has his thumbs on \nthe scales.\n  Further, the regional center program has serious national security \nrisks that the Director hasn't addressed. He convened a working group \nwith national security advisers but no formal product was finalized. \nThe interagency collaborations seemed to fizzle. Whistleblowers say the \nworking group was mere window dressing.\n  In the agency, employees received EB-5 applications from individuals \nwith derogatory information about them in classified government files, \nbut they were given little or no guidance about how to make sure that \nsuch were denied. Instead, they were pressured to approve applications \nas quickly as possible.\n  Simply put, the integrity of our immigration system is in question as \nlong as the program continues without needed reforms which could be \ndone this very day.\n  On May 15, 2012, Chairman Leahy and I wrote to Mr. Mayorkas regarding \nthe program and expressed our concerns about the potential for abuse of \nthe program. We asked for his commitment to administratively reform two \naspects of the program. He responded that he was interested in the \nreforms. Yet it has been a long 19 months and he has taken no action.\n  Mr. Mayorkas says he is concerned with fraud and abuse of the \nprogram, but actions speak louder than words. Despite my recent letters \nwith questions about fraud and security concerns, not to mention \npolitical influence, Mr. Mayorkas is either completely unwilling or \nunable to respond to the allegations.\n  I sat down with Chairman Carper on August 1, and he agreed that I \ndeserved answers to my questions from the nominee. Now he has pressed \nforward without getting answers. I am truly surprised that this \nmajority is not interested in getting to the bottom of these \nallegations--in other words, something that is under investigation--the \nsame way that Senator Biden and Senator Obama demanded that we do \nduring a previous Presidency.\n  If this body is unwilling to await the end of an investigation or if \nwe aren't willing to conduct our own inquiry, one day this whole \nnomination will come back to bite us. As I said when B. Todd Jones was \nconfirmed, eventually a situation will embarrass the Senate and damage \nthe reputation of the Federal Government.\n  If this majority is determined to ignore ongoing investigations and \nat the same time ram through nominees, the American people should hold \nthe Senate accountable for not doing its constitutional job--in fact, \nrefusing to do its constitutional job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/17/senate-section/article/S8902-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8902-S8903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ENOUGH IS ENOUGH\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I come to the floor for a few minutes, \nas I have most weeks, to mark a new number. That number is 11,584--the \nnumber of gun deaths America has experienced over the last year, since \nDecember 14 of last year. That date is burned in the memories of those \nof us in Connecticut and across the Nation because that was the date 26 \npeople--20 little 6- and 7-year-olds and 6 teachers and educators who \nwere there to protect them--died in Sandy Hook. We recognized the 1-\nyear mark of that shooting this weekend. Almost 12,000 people have died \nat the hands of guns since then.\n  I have tried to come to the floor of the Senate in the months since \nto remind folks that these victims have stories and to give voice to \nthese victims. I will share a few more today.\n  We were all gripped just a few days ago by news of another school \nshooting. Not too far from Columbine, Arapahoe saw another very \ntroubled young man walk in with a shotgun and essentially open fire, \napparently because of a grievance he had with his debate coach. Caught \nin the crossfire was a 17-year-old girl, Claire Davis.\n  Claire was described as outgoing, athletic, and an excellent student. \nAccording to reports, she loved horses and recently placed second in an \nequestrian competition. Another student said Claire is ``one of the \nnicest people I've met at Arapahoe'' High School. Claire, 17 years old, \nsurvived, but she is still in a coma today just because she was in the \nwrong place at her high school--a place where everyone expects to be \nable to go to school in safety. She isn't on this number yet because \nshe survived, but her life is changed forever because of yet another \nschool shooting.\n  School shootings now seem to pop up on the news on a weekly basis. \nBut it is not just these school shootings where mass violence takes \nplace. Now you can pick up most local papers every month and see \nevidence of a new mass shooting.\n  In Manchester, CT, on December 7 of this year, 41-year-old John Lynn \nshot Brittany Mills, 28, Kamesha Mills, 23, and Artara Benson, 46, \nbefore killing himself in a quadruple murder. He had a history of \ndomestic violence. Police haven't completely sorted out exactly what \nhappened, but all four of them are dead, marking the eighth homicide \nstemming from intimate partner violence in Connecticut since January 1, \n2013.\n  Just days before, in Alma, AR, Tim Adams, believed to be in his early \nfifties, before killing himself killed his 4-month-old grandson, 4-\nyear-old granddaughter, and Michael Williams, the 31-year-old boyfriend \nof his daughter, in the midst of what seemed to be a pretty simple \nargument about his daughter's court date that exploded into an episode \nof mass violence that took the lives of a 4-month-old, a 4-year-old, a \n31-year-old, and then, as many of these episodes do, the life of the \nshooter himself.\n  These episodes of mass shootings are not just happening in schools, \nmovie theaters, or places of worship; they are happening in backyards \nin Alma, AR, and they are happening in apartment complexes in \nManchester, CT. And this body, in the 360-some-odd days since December \n14, has done absolutely nothing about it. The survivors of these \nincidents of violence are the stories we don't talk about.\n  I have come down here to tell the story today of Claire Davis, \nBrittany\n\n[[Page S8903]]\n\nMills, Kamesha Mills, Artara Benson, Tim Adams, Chayson Williams, \nKierra Adams, and Michael Williams. They all died by gunshots. They \nleft behind children, parents, and neighbors who are scarred for life.\n  Psychologists will tell you that when a shooting occurs, there are at \nleast 10 people who experience life-altering trauma. What we know is \nthat episodes of trauma don't just affect you up here; they affect your \nentire body. We have new developing evidence which shows that children \nwho experience multiple episodes of trauma in their lives--and they \ndon't have to be as grave or serious as a shooting--are physiologically \naffected for the rest of their lives. People who witness trauma and \nexperience trauma die earlier than people who don't, never mind have \nepisodes related to post-traumatic stress that stay with them for the \nrest of their lives. So the spillover, the ripple effects of these \n11,000 deaths, frankly, represents a number that can't even fit on a \nchart like this.\n  There is no simple solution. Sometimes it seems as if the only thing \nwe come down here and talk about is stricter gun laws. And I don't \nbelieve there is any reason why we don't require background checks for \nguns before they are purchased or we don't just simply say that these \ndangerous assault weapons should stay out of the hands of people who \naren't in law enforcement or the military. But that is not the \nbeginning and end of the conversation.\n  This young man, Karl Pierson, who walked into Arapahoe High School \nstarted shooting the place up because he was upset about his place on \nthe debate team. He apparently had a history of disciplinary incidents \nat that school, but he clearly had some serious issues of mental \nillness not identified and treated. Of course, the same thing can be \nsaid of Jared Lee Loughner and Adam Lanza and this long list of mass \nshooters across this country. We absolutely have to put more resources \ninto our mental health system.\n  I appreciate my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have \nsaid: We are not willing to go with you when it comes to background \nchecks or assault weapons, but we will work with you on mental health \nfunding.\n  In order to do that, we actually have to put the money behind the \nsystem. We have closed down 4,000 in-patient mental health beds in this \ncountry over the last 5 years. Why? Because the Federal Government is \npulling funding from the very programs that actually support increased \nmental health resources which can identify these individuals before \nthey perpetrate incidents of mass violence. So there is an illusion of \nbipartisan support around the issue of mental health even while we have \nthese outstanding disagreements on gun laws. Yet there really isn't \nagreement because when you are fighting over the budget, when \nRepublicans are calling for massive cuts to programs such as Medicaid \nor the mental health block grant, then they are undermining the very \nprograms that actually identify and help people such as Karl Pierson or \nAdam Lanza.\n  Enough is enough. I will be down here after the holiday, and that \nnumber will be over 12,000--12,000 individuals, many of them little \ngirls and boys like those represented on this chart: Daniel Barden and \nJesse Lewis and Dylan Hockley.\n  Back in Newtown, out of respect for the families who are tired from \n365 days of grieving, there was no big public remembrance on Saturday. \nThere was a small private ceremony which I had the honor of attending \nat St. Rose Church, where so many of the children were parishioners.\n  As tired as that community is, they also were bewildered, in Newtown, \nbecause they went up to the State capitol in Connecticut and got laws \npassed that will prevent these kinds of episodes of mass violence in \nthe future, but they came down to Washington and, while they got a lot \nof meetings, they got absolutely no progress--zilch, zip, nada.\n  As we head into 2014, I hope the memory of these little boys and \ngirls will not fade as we get beyond the 1-year mark of Sandy Hook. My \nhope is people will start paying attention to this number, creeping up \nto 12,500 deaths, and will recognize that while this number simply \nrepresents the number of people who have died, there are all sorts of \npeople out there such as Claire Davis, who survived, but survived gun \nincidents that will cripple them for the rest of their lives, and there \nare, frankly, hundreds of thousands of more people who surround these \nincidents of violence who have their lives changed forever because of \nthe trauma they experienced.\n  All of these victims, whether they were killed in the incident or \nwere part of the collateral damage, have voices, voices that should \ncommand this place sometime soon to action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/17/senate-section/article/S8903-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8903-S8905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n\n                          Thanking Todd Bianco\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, this is my 53rd time for consecutive \nweeks we are in session that I have come to the floor to speak about \nclimate change and to urge my colleagues that it is time to wake up. \nThese speeches are not easy. A great deal of effort goes into assisting \nme with research and crafting of them. I am particularly grateful for \nthe hard work of Dr. Todd Bianco in helping me to prepare them. He is \nthe fellow sitting on the other side of the sign, looking embarrassed \nthat I have just called him out.\n  Todd joined my office in September of 2012 as a Geological Society of \nAmerica-U.S. Geological Survey congressional science fellow. He has \ncontributed considerable scientific understanding and analytical rigor \nto our work. His ability to interpret the latest climate research has \nhelped me to convey complex scientific concepts both accurately and in \na way that is accessible and meaningful to policymakers and the public. \nYou may be used to seeing him with me here on the floor for each week's \nspeech, but he has also been effective in researching legislation and \npreparing for hearings in the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  I say this because this week marks the end of Todd's fellowship and \nhe will soon return home to Rhode Island with his wife Allison. Allison \nBianco, by the way, is a very talented artist whose work reflects our \ndeep human connection to the natural world. In addition to lending us \nTodd, Allison has also lent us some of her artwork which is hung on \ndisplay in my front office. So in addition to thanking Todd for his \nefforts, I also want to thank Allison. Todd, like me, is an over-\nmarried human being.\n  I wish them both the best of luck back home, and I thank Todd for his \nwork in the U.S. Senate to advance responsible public policy, grounded \nfirmly in the best science.\n  It is time at last for Congress at least to heed that best science \nand act responsibly. It is time to wake up. Denying and delaying is \nirresponsible. In the judgment of history, it will ultimately, I \nbelieve, be shameful. Carbon pollution from the burning of fossil fuels \nis altering the climate. The consensus around this fact within the \nscientific community is overwhelming, and public awareness of this \ncrisis is growing stronger.\n  Interestingly, it is growing stronger across party lines. Republicans \nmight want to listen to this. A survey conducted for the League of \nConservation Voters found that more than half of young Republican \nvoters, 53 percent of Republicans under the age of 35--53 percent would \ndescribe a politician who denies climate change is happening as \n``ignorant,'' ``out-of-touch,'' or ``crazy.'' Madam President, 53 \npercent of Republicans under 35 view that kind of climate denying as \n``ignorant,'' ``out-of-touch,'' or ``crazy.''\n  Even though a majority of young Republicans understands that denying \nclimate change is out of touch with reality, Republicans in Congress \nrefuse to get serious. Why? Another national survey, this one by the \nPew Research Center, found that 61 percent of non-tea-party Republicans \nactually agree there is solid evidence the Earth is warming, with a \nplurality saying it is mostly because of humans. But the tea partiers \nare different. Seventy percent of tea partiers, contrarily, say there \nis\n\n[[Page S8904]]\n\n``no solid evidence'' the Earth is warming and 41 percent of tea \npartiers assert that warming is ``just not happening.'' Not that we \ndon't have enough information yet, but it is ``just not happening.''\n  Regardless of what you think is the cause, there are legion \nindependent measurements that the Earth is warming. This is not a \ntheory. We measure that the temperature of the atmosphere and oceans is \nrising. We measure that snow, ice caps, and glaciers are melting. We \nmeasure that seas are rising. We measure that the very seasons are \nshifting.\n  It is one thing to be the party that is against science. The tea \npartiers would make it the party against measurement. Just as the tea \npartiers led the Republicans off the government shutdown cliff, just as \nthe tea partiers tried to defeat the budget deal most Republicans \nsupported, so the tea party wants to lead the Republican Party off the \nclimate cliff.\n\n  Outside these walls it is different. Responsible Republican voices \nmore and more acknowledge the threat of climate change and call for \nresponsible solutions. Many want to correct the market failure that \naids and abets the polluters' irresponsible practices.\n  My colleagues, Representative Henry Waxman, Representative Earl \nBlumenauer, Senator Brian Schatz, and I have put forward just such a \nmarket-based proposal, a revenue-neutral fee on carbon emissions, the \nrevenues of which would be returned back to the American people. Here, \nwithin Congress, where the polluters' money flows so abundantly, no \nRepublican colleague has come forward to join us. But outside of \nCongress here are some of the responsible voices in the Republican \nParty: Former South Carolina Representative Bob Inglis has long urged \nhis party to get serious on climate change. In an article in the Duke \nEnvironmental Law & Policy Forum this year, Mr. Inglis invoked the \ntenets of conservative economics. He wrote:\n\n       If you're a conservative, it is time to step forward and \n     engage in the climate and energy debate because we have the \n     answer--free enterprise. . . . Conservatives understand that \n     we must set the correct incentives and this should include \n     internalizing pollution and other environmental costs in our \n     market system. We tax income but we don't tax emissions. It \n     makes sense to conservatives to take the tax off something \n     you want more of, income, and shift the tax to something you \n     want less of, emissions.\n\n  That was Bob Inglis and that is exactly how you use his words \n``internalize pollution and other environmental costs in our market \nsystem.'' You do it with a carbon fee.\n  Sherwood Boehlert and Wayne Gilchrest, former Republican \nRepresentatives from New York and Virginia, in a joint February 2012 op \ned with Representative Waxman and Senator Markey, made the fiscal case \nfor a carbon fee. Here is what they said:\n\n       The debate over how to reduce our nation's debt has been \n     presented as a dilemma between cutting spending on programs \n     Americans cherish or raising taxes on American job creators. \n     But there is a better way: We could slash our debt by making \n     power plants and oil refineries pay for the carbon emissions \n     that endanger our health and environment. This policy would \n     strengthen our economy, lessen our dependence on foreign oil, \n     keep our skies clean--and raise a lot of revenue. The best \n     approach [they continue] would be to use a market mechanism \n     such as the sale of carbon allowances or a fee on carbon \n     pollution to lower emissions and increase revenue.\n\n  For one former Republican Member of this body, the threat of climate \nchange has serious professional implications. As Secretary of Defense, \nit is Chuck Hagel's job to account for all hazards to our national \nsecurity and our interests in the world. He gave this clear-eyed \nassessment at the Halifax International Security Forum just last month:\n\n       Climate change does not directly cause conflict, but it can \n     significantly add to the challenges of global instability, \n     hunger, poverty, and conflict. Food and water shortages, \n     pandemic disease, disputes over refugees and resources, more \n     severe natural disasters--all place additional burdens on \n     economies, societies, and institutions around the world. . . \n     . The effects of climate change and new energy resources are \n     far-reaching and unpredictable . . . demanding our attention \n     and strategic thinking.\n\n  Top advisers to former Republican Presidents have joined this chorus \nof Republicans speaking out on climate and urging a carbon fee. \nRepublican Presidents listened to these men and women. Who knows, maybe \nRepublican Members of Congress will listen to them also.\n  William D. Ruckelshaus, Lee M. Thomas, William K. Reilly, and \nChristine Todd Whitman, all headed the Environmental Protection Agency \nduring Republican administrations. They spoke with one voice in an \nAugust New York Times op-ed. They wrote:\n\n       As administrators of the EPA under Presidents Richard M. \n     Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush, we held \n     fast to common-sense conservative principles--protecting the \n     health of the American people, working with the best \n     technology available, and trusting in the innovation of \n     American business and in the market to find the best \n     solutions for the least cost.\n\n  These former Republican officials recognize both the wisdom of \nproperly pricing carbon and, as well, the obstinate opposition that \nstands in the way of progress in Congress. They continued in their \narticle:\n\n       A market-based approach, like a carbon tax, would be the \n     best path to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but that is \n     unachievable in the current political gridlock in Washington. \n     But we must continue efforts to reduce the climate-altering \n     pollutants that threaten our planet. The only uncertainty \n     about our warming world is how bad the changes will get and \n     how soon. What is most clear is that there is no time to \n     waste.\n\n  They could even have said that it is time to wake up.\n  George Schultz, another prominent Republican, served as Secretary of \nboth Labor and Treasury under President Nixon and Secretary of State \nunder President Reagan. He, too, is calling for an end to the \npolluters' free ride.\n  In an April op-ed with Nobel economist Gary Becker that appeared in \nRealClearPolitics, George Schultz appealed to our American sense of \nfairness writing:\n\n       Americans like to compete on a level playing field. All the \n     players should have an equal opportunity to win based on \n     their competitive merits, not on some artificial imbalance \n     that gives someone or some group a special advantage. We \n     think this idea should be applied to energy producers. They \n     all should bear the full costs of the use of the energy they \n     provide.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       They all should bear the full costs of the use of the \n     energy they provide . . . Clearly, a revenue-neutral carbon \n     tax would benefit all Americans by eliminating the need for \n     costly energy subsidies while promoting a level playing field \n     for energy producers.\n\n  Veterans of a much more recent Republican administration are likewise \nacknowledging the appeal of a carbon fee proposal.\n  David Frum, speechwriter to George W. Bush, wrote in a December 2012 \ncnn.com op-ed that a carbon fee could help address a number of pressing \nnational issues. Here is what he wrote:\n\n       Take three worrying long-term challenges: climate change, \n     the weak economic recovery, and America's chronic budget \n     deficits. Combine them into one. And suddenly three tough \n     problems become one attractive solution. Tax carbon. . . . \n     The revenues from a carbon tax could be used to reduce the \n     deficit while also extending new forms of payroll tax relief \n     to middle-class families, thus supporting middle-class family \n     incomes.\n\n  Gregory Mankiw, economic adviser to George W. Bush and Mitt Romney, \nspecifically highlighted our carbon fee proposal in an August op-ed in \nthe New York Times. Our bill, he wrote, ``is more effective and less \ninvasive than the regulatory approach that the federal government has \ntraditionally pursued.''\n  Speaking of us, he said:\n\n       If the Democratic sponsors conceded to using the new \n     revenue to reduce personal and corporate income tax rates, a \n     bipartisan compromise is possible to imagine. Among \n     economists, the issue is largely a no-brainier.\n       I say to Mr. Mankiw, as one of the Democratic sponsors, we \n     are very interested in a bipartisan compromise. We just need \n     a Republican to come to the negotiating table and we can \n     begin. That is what the American people want, what voters \n     want, and it is what responsible State and local leaders want \n     as well.\n\n  Take, for example, Jim Brainard, a five-term Republican mayor from \nCarmel, IN. In an Indianapolis Star op-ed this month, Mayor Brainard \nimplored Democrats and Republicans alike to face up to the reality of \nclimate change. Here is what Mayor Brainard said:\n\n       [T]his issue isn't just about saving polar bears. It's \n     about saving our cities. . . . No matter your politics, there \n     is overwhelming evidence of climate change and we as a nation \n     have a moral obligation to address these issues.\n\n\n[[Page S8905]]\n\n\n  For himself, he says he plans ``to urge the federal government to \ntake a stronger leadership role in helping our cities prepare for what \nis certainly coming our way.''\n  There are a lot of Republicans out there who are awake to the threat \nof climate change and to the win-win-benefits of pricing carbon and \nusing the revenues to invest in tax reductions and adaptation and other \nways to protect ourselves and advance our economy.\n  Unfortunately, in Congress, the dark, heavy hand of the polluters is \nhelping the tea party drive the Republican party off the cliff. One day \nthe Republican Party will pay a heavy price for this, and that day may \nbe soon. They need to make the change.\n  It is the responsibility of Congress to heed the warnings of \nenvironmental calamity, to stamp out market distortions that favor \npolluters, and to steer this country on a prudent, reasonable path \ntoward a proud future that is both sustainable and equitable. It is \ntime for Congress to wake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/17/senate-section/article/S8905-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8905-S8906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BUDGET AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the budget agreement \nbefore the Senate. We had a vote today on moving ahead to that \nlegislation, and I supported that movement. I supported the cloture \nvote and will support the underlying budget agreement because it does \ntake modest steps to reduce the deficit. It does so without raising \ntaxes. It also relieves some of the sequester's worst impact on our \nnational security, and it also prevents another government shutdown \nnext month and also next year.\n  I also support it because it is time for us to have a budget. We have \nnot had a budget for 4 years. It will enable us to begin the process of \nhaving appropriations bills again. In the appropriations process, of \ncourse, we have oversight over the Federal departments and agencies and \nwe prioritize spending, which is very important. Among other things, \nthis will give us the opportunity to root out some of the waste and \nfraud and actually determine what programs are working and not working \nto be able to use the power of the purse that Congress has, to help be \nsure taxpayer funds are being used efficiently and effectively.\n  As Members know, this agreement was the culmination of what is called \na Budget Conference Committee between the House and the Senate. So it \nwas Democrats and Republicans but also the House and Senate coming \ntogether. That has not happened in 4 years. So we have not had a budget \nin 4 years. We have not had a budget conference in 4 years. If you \nthink about that, is it any wonder that during those 4 years Congress \nhas racked up historic debts and deficits?\n  The deficits of the past 4 years have been the largest deficits in \nthe history our country, and one reason is we have not had the \ndiscipline that comes with having a budget and being sure there is some \naccountability for the spending. We have not made the hard choices our \nconstituents have to make every day, how much to spend and what to \nspend it on. That is what a budget is supposed to do.\n  This budget agreement we will be voting on this week is far from \nperfect. There is a lot I don't like about it. In fact, I just \nsupported the attempt to amend it on the floor of the Senate to improve \nit, but I do believe that with a divided Congress--Republicans in \ncharge in the House, Democrats in charge in the Senate--it was the best \nwe could hope for. There were no tax increases, as the Democrats \nwanted. We just heard from one of my colleagues about how more taxes \nare needed, but there were no tax increases in this budget agreement.\n  There is actual deficit reduction, although I will acknowledge that \nthe deficit reduction is way too small. There is about $22 billion in \ndeficit reduction over 10 years compared to the existing law.\n  It does provide some sequester relief for the Department of Defense. \nThe Department of Defense was facing across-the-board sequester cuts \nwhich were kind of arbitrary across-the-board cuts of about $20 billion \nstarting on January 15 and over the next few months.\n  This relief is very important to our military. We have heard from \nthem. It is important to our readiness. It is important to our troops. \nIt is important to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio and other \nbases around the country. It is important to our war fighters who are \nstationed around the globe tonight and putting their lives on the line \nfor us. So I think the sequester relief for the Department of Defense \nthat is in the budget agreement is important.\n  While this might be the best 2-year budget agreement that is \nimaginable in a time of a divided government, such as we have with all \nof the dysfunction in this town, it is certainly not the comprehensive \nagreement the American people deserve.\n  Through this agreement, Congress has now accomplished the bare \nminimum of what the American people should be able to expect from \nCongress. After all, Congress does have, as I said earlier, the power \nof the purse, and that is in the Constitution. Every dime has to be \nappropriated by the Congress. We should be the ones determining how \ntaxpayer dollars are spent, and we certainly need a budget.\n  There are some who took to the floor today, and will tomorrow I am \nsure, who will say this is a great budget agreement; this shows \neveryone how Washington can work and come together to fix a problem. \nFair enough. We avoided a government shutdown. Yes, we are not going to \ngut national security, and, yes, we will have a small deficit \nreduction--again, about $22 billion.\n  Let's be honest about the opportunity Congress missed this week with \nthis budget agreement. When it comes to the very real budget and fiscal \nproblems we face as a country, when it comes to the mandatory spending, \nwhich is two-thirds of the budget and is on autopilot, that is the part \nthat is driving our country toward bankruptcy and threatening to \nundermine important vital programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, \nand Medicaid.\n  We have done nothing on that side of the ledger in this budget \nagreement. We kicked the can down the road one more time and missed the \nopportunity. As we all know, unless we address these fiscal problems, \nthe day of reckoning is coming.\n  This is a pie chart of Federal spending that will kind of show where \nwe are relative to 1965 when mandatory spending--again, this is the \npart Congress does not appropriate. It is on autopilot. It is 34 \npercent of the budget. Defense is 43 percent of the budget, domestic \ndiscretionary is 23 percent.\n  Here is where we are today: Mandatory is 66 percent of the budget. We \nwent from 34 percent to 66 percent. Remember, this is Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, also interest on the debt. By the way, defense \nspending has gone from 43 percent down to 18 percent. Yet the sequester \ndisproportionately takes most of the savings out of defense, which is \none of the reasons this budget agreement was needed.\n  We have seen big growth in mandatory spending. By the way, over the \nnext 10 years, it goes from 66 percent to 76 percent. What does that \nmean? That means it crowds out discretionary spending--defense \nspending, research spending, education spending, infrastructure \nspending. That is what is happening.\n  Our deficits are going to record highs over the next couple of \ndecades and mandatory spending is exploding and it is squeezing the \nother spending in our budget.\n  Over the next decade, the Federal Government is going to collect \nrevenue of about $40 trillion, spend about $46 trillion, and run a \ndeficit of $6.3 trillion. Over the next 10 years, there will be another \n$6.3 trillion on top of the $17 trillion debt.\n  In that 10th year, by the way, 2023, the best case scenario has a \nprojected annual deficit of nearly $1 trillion--$895 billion for 1 \nyear. By the way, it assumes no wars, it assumes a decade of \nprosperity, and it assumes 10 years of historically low rates. It is \nquite a rosy scenario. If any of these factors fall through, things \ncould be much worse, and it could be well over $1 trillion.\n  This is not a problem that can be solved by just cutting \ndiscretionary spending. Over the next 10 years, Washington will spend \nmore than $22 trillion on these vital programs: Medicare, Medicaid, and \nSocial Security. If we\n\n[[Page S8906]]\n\nwere to cut our defense budget over the next decade all the way down to \nzero--have no defense spending at all, zero--we could pay for just one-\nquarter of that cost of the $22 trillion.\n  If we removed every penny of potentially identifiable waste in \ngovernment--which we should do, by the way, and that is why we need to \nget back to appropriations--we could pay for less than 10 percent of \nthis exploding cost on the mandatory side.\n  If we pulled out of Iraq and Afghanistan today and ended all bailouts \nand corporate welfare, reversed the tax cuts for all Americans making \nless than $450,000 a year that we kept as part of the fiscal cliff \nagreement, repealed ObamaCare altogether--if we did all of those \nthings, we would cover just 20 percent of the cost of those programs, \nthis $22 trillion.\n  In other words, even if we wanted to try to do it by cutting this \nspending, we could not do it because there is not enough money in that \npart of the budget. So it is not just a matter of choosing spending \npriorities and it is certainly not a matter of raising taxes.\n  Earlier my colleague talked about how we needed to raise more taxes \nfor different things, and I understand a lot of people are saying that, \nbut let's be honest about this: It is a bad idea at a time of a weak \neconomy to raise taxes. Plus, over the next decade, you know what \nhappens on taxes. Over the next decade we have been told by the \nCongressional Budget Office that taxes will be--as a percent of the \neconomy, which is the way economists tell us we ought to look at it--at \nhistorically high levels.\n  So the economy is already weak, tax revenues are headed toward their \nhighest sustained levels in history, and when it comes to taxes, there \nis an alternative, which is let's reform the Tax Code.\n  What we should be doing is restraining spending, reforming these \nvital but unsustainable programs, while also raising more revenues \nthrough growth, and economic growth can come through tax reform. That \ntax reform gives the economy a shot in the arm. It helps bring back the \njobs. It increases revenue through growth. That is why we need both \nentitlement reform and tax reform.\n  The issue of entitlement reform is a tough one politically. A lot of \nMembers of Congress are hesitant to touch it. It is called the third \nrail of American politics. That is akin to the electrified rail in the \nsubway system, where if you touch it you are electrified. Let's start \nsmall. How about means testing of Medicare. This could be a first step \nin the right direction.\n  Under Medicare, the average two-earner couple retiring today pays \n$119,000 in lifetime Medicare taxes, yet receives $357,000 in lifetime \nMedicare benefits. So $1 of taxes for $3 of benefits. That is how \nMedicare works. That is for a typical family in Ohio or around the \ncountry. When we multiply this by 77 million retiring baby boomers, we \ncan see why we have an unsustainable program, because not enough money \ngoes in to pay for the benefits going out.\n  Providing $3 in benefits under Medicare for every $1 paid in taxes \nfor low-income seniors is one thing. We want to be sure low-income \nseniors are being taken care of. For the most part, in their working \nyears, they probably didn't earn enough income to pay large Medicare \ntaxes, and the program is designed to see that they do receive the \nmedical coverage they wouldn't otherwise get. But should upper income \nseniors--seniors who are on Medicare--receive benefits that far exceed \nwhat they pay into the system? That is what happens now. Is that fair? \nI don't think so, when the program is going bankrupt, when our kids and \ngrandkids are facing massive tax increases to pay for a problem that we \nall foresee and yet fail to correct.\n  By the way, I tried in this latest budget agreement to say, on the \nmandatory side of the ledger, why don't we deal with means testing of \nMedicare. That would provide enough revenue to provide relief on \nsequester. We wouldn't be doing things such as TSA fees or things such \nas reducing the benefits for our military. It was rejected. I talked to \na number of Democrats about it who said we can't touch that. We can't \ntouch even means testing of Medicare without raising taxes. So, in \nessence, raising taxes on the wealthy is necessary to reduce benefits \nfor the wealthy. That is the point we are at. That is how tough it is. \nThat is why we need a new approach. That is why we need some \nleadership--in the House, in the Senate but also in the White House. We \nneed a President willing to help us on this, to talk about it.\n  Have we ever heard the President talk about the fact that there is $3 \nof benefits coming from Medicare for every $1 paid in? Have we ever \nheard the President talk about the fact that entitlements are otherwise \ngoing to bankrupt the country? We need a little straight talk and \nhonest dialogue about this.\n  If we do nothing, as we have done with this budget agreement in the \nSenate with regard to mandatory spending, entitlement spending, and as \nwe have done time and time again, the Social Security disability trust \nfund will go bankrupt in 2016, a couple years from now. Medicare will \nfollow in 2026--again, every year, much more being paid out than being \npaid in. Social Security, already in a cash deficit, meaning there is \nmore money coming out in terms of benefits than there are payroll taxes \ngoing in every year--but it will collapse, the trust fund will collapse \nin 2035. Medicaid has no trust fund, so it will not go bankrupt itself; \nit will just continue to grow at unsustainable levels, helping to \nbankrupt the country, but also, in that case, it may take the States \ndown with it, and States will tell us it is generally their largest and \nfastest growing expense, Medicaid.\n  So these are issues we must address. On the floor of this Chamber, we \noften talk about the next generation. We hear speeches about protecting \nthe elderly and ensuring every American gets the benefit of the bargain \nmade when Social Security and Medicare came into being. I agree, but to \ndo that we need to improve and preserve these programs, and we need to \nstop blaming one another for what happened because, frankly, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike are responsible for this. We have done \none thing that is truly bipartisan in the last few decades; that is, we \nhave overspent and we have overpromised, Republicans and Democrats \nalike. Because we helped create this mess together, we have to work \ntogether to resolve it.\n  With this vote on the budget this week, another budget crisis has \npassed, and that is good. We are on the road to avoiding another \ngovernment shutdown in January and again next year. That is the most \nbasic job of government, and I think that is good. We have a little bit \nof deficit reduction, we didn't raise taxes on a weak economy, but we \nneed to aim higher. Perhaps in the context of the debt limit debate \nthat is coming up in a matter of only a few months, we can get more \nserious about the underlying problem, because it is that underlying \nproblem that is driving our future deficits. We all know that. We all \nagree on that. We all know it has to be fixed. So let's do it this \ncoming year.\n  We have seen how divided government can achieve something important \nbut small. That is what happened with this budget agreement this week. \nIn 2014, next year, let's see how divided government can achieve \nsomething big and critical to economic growth and jobs and to the \nfuture of our children and grandchildren. That is our solemn \nresponsibility in the Congress, to ensure that we are leaving a better \nworld to future generations. We cannot do this if we do not address \nthis fiscal crisis.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary \ncareer of United States Capitol Police Sergeant Kathleen Bignotti, who \nis retiring after more than 28 years of service to the Department.\n\n[[Page S8907]]\n\n  Sgt. Bignotti began her career in October 1985, when she was \nappointed as a U.S. Capitol Police officer and assigned to the House of \nRepresentatives Division. Less than 1 year later, she was selected to \nserve as a member of the First Responder Unit.\n  Her career with the Capitol Police included assignments to the Office \nof the Chief of Police, the Dignitary Protection Unit, the Senate \nDivision, the Patrol Division, and the Library of Congress Division. \nSgt. Bignotti's most highly regarded assignment came in 2003 when she \nwas promoted to serve as Unit Commander of the USCP Mounted Unit. Her \nhorse, Henry, will always have a special place in Sgt. Bignotti's \nheart.\n  Sgt. Bignotti represented the department with distinction in her \nduties that included assisting during the 1990 Goodwill Games in \nSeattle, WA; serving as a representative during National Police Week \nceremonies; participating in the Special Olympics ceremonies and \nrecruiting class graduations, and other special events as designated by \nthe Chief of Police. In 1991, she received commendation as a member of \nthe Ceremonial Unit for Honor Guard duties associated with Queen \nElizabeth's visit to the Capitol.\n  As a former officer with the U.S. Capitol Police, I have a special \nappreciation for the commitment and dedication of the men and women on \nthis force. I, along with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nwish Sgt.

Mr. President, last week I introduced the Foreign Medical \nSchool Accountability Fairness Act. The bill seeks to fix a loophole \nexploited by for profit schools to tap into the federal Treasury at the \nexpense of students.\n  Under current law, a small number of medical schools in the \nCaribbean--about five, four of which are for profits--are exempt from \nmeeting the same requirements to qualify for title IV funding that all \nother medical schools outside of the U.S. and Canada must meet. This \nloophole allows these schools to enroll large percentages of American \nstudents--which means access to more Federal dollars.\n  The biggest of these schools are St. George's, Ross, and American \nUniversity of the Caribbean whose enrollments of Americans are 70 \npercent, 91 percent, and 86 percent respectively. Other schools are \nprohibited from having U.S. citizens make up more than 40 percent of \nenrollment.\n  These for profit schools have turned the idea of being a foreign \nschool on its head--they are located outside of the United States, but \nhave majority-American enrollments. They do not have to meet the same \nhigh standards U.S. medical schools must meet, but also do not have to \nmeet the same requirements as schools located outside of the U.S. to \naccess hundreds of millions of dollars of Federal funding.\n  Pretty sweet deal, huh?\n  In fact in 2012, the three schools I mentioned earlier--St. George's \nand the two DeVry-owned schools--took in more than $450 million from \nthe Federal Government from American taxpayers. That amounted to more \nthan two-thirds of all title IV funding that went to all foreign \nmedical schools.\n  To sum up--three schools, two-thirds of the Federal funding, exempt \nfrom the law.\n  Not only are these schools exempt from the enrollment requirement, \nbut they don't have to meet a minimum standard of success--having 75 \npercent of their students pass the U.S. board exams--a requirement for \nany of its students to actually practice medicine in the United States. \nThe University of Sydney--with its dozen or so American students--has \nto meet this standard in order to receive title IV dollars. But DeVry's \nRoss University, with 1,000 or more American students, does not.\n  It doesn't seem right to the Department of Education, which says \nthere is no rationale for continuing the exemption. And it doesn't seem \nright to me, either. Especially when you consider what students are \ngetting for this Federal investment--more debt, higher rates of \nattrition, and lower residency match rates than U.S. medical schools.\n  Translation: More debt and less chance of becoming a doctor.\n  In September, an article in Bloomberg by Janet Lorin entitled ``Devry \nLures Medical School Rejects as Taxpayers Fund Debt'' shined a bright \nlight on the poor student outcomes of these schools.\n  It is no secret that for profit foreign medical schools prey on \nstudents who have been rejected by traditional U.S. medical schools. \nThey promise to fulfill the unrequited dreams for students who want to \nbe doctors, but for one reason or another, did not make the cut in the \nU.S. On average, scores on the MCAT, the test required to enter medical \nschool, of students attending these offshore for profit schools are \nlower than those of students who are admitted to medical schools in the \nU.S. In 2012, students at U.S. medical schools scored an average of \n31.2 out of 45 on the MCAT while students at the DeVry medical schools \nscored an average of 25.\n  The attrition rate at U.S. medical schools averaged 3 percent for the \nclass beginning in 2009, while rates at for profit foreign medical \nschools can be up to 26 percent or higher. More than a quarter of the \nstudents at some of these schools drop out.\n  On average, students at for profit medical schools operating outside \nof the United States and Canada amass more student debt than those at \nmedical schools in the United States. For example, in 2012, graduates \nof the American University of the Caribbean had a median of $253,000 in \nstudent debt versus $170,000 for graduates of U.S. medical schools.\n  To add insult to injury, these foreign trained graduates are on \naverage less competitive candidates for coveted U.S. residency \npositions. In 2013, residency match rates for foreign trained graduates \naveraged 53 percent compared to 94 percent for graduates of medical \nschools in the United States. They are even less likely to land a \nresidency position the second time around.\n  According to the Bloomberg article I referenced earlier, one graduate \nof St. George's University, Michael Uva, amassed almost $400,000 in \nmedical school loans, but failed to land a residency spot twice. \nMichael now works at a blood donation clinic earning $30 an hour. \nAlthough he sacrificed years of his life training for it, without \ncompleting a residency he will never get to practice medicine and this \n$400,000 debt will likely follow him throughout his life.\n  Congress has failed taxpayers and students by subsidizing these \nCaribbean schools with billions in Federal dollars for years without \nadequate accountability and oversight. This bill takes a first step at \naddressing that failure by ensuring these Caribbean schools must meet \nthe same standards other schools outside of the United States and \nCanada must meet.\n  At the same time, these schools are just another example of the \nsystemic problem we have with for profit colleges trying to make a buck \noff of students in this country and usually bilking Uncle Sam to do it. \nIn fiscal year 2010, we sent $32 billion to all for profit schools.\n  There are three numbers you need to remember when thinking about for \nprofit schools:\n  The percentage of high school graduates that enroll in for profit \nschools--12 percent;\n  The percentage of Department of Education title IV funds that go to \nfor-profit schools--25 percent;\n  The percentage of student loan defaults for profit schools are \nresponsible for--47 percent.\n  I have been fighting these schools for a long time. But today I have \na message for those schools down in the sunny Caribbean who may have \nthought they could continue to exploit taxpayers and students without \nanybody noticing--we're watching.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/17/senate-section/article/S8907-2", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8907-S8908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I regret that I was absent from the Senate \nyesterday and was unable to vote on the nomination of Jeh Johnson to be \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Had I been here, I \nwould have voted in opposition to this nominee.\n  Reforming our broken immigration system is one of the Nation's top \npriorities. To that end, ensuring that our borders are secure and \npreventing illegal entry is absolutely vital. In my capacity as the \nsenior Senator from Arizona and one of the lead advocates of\n\n[[Page S8908]]\n\ncomprehensively reforming our immigration system, I have a solemn \nobligation and a constitutional prerogative to make sure that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, DHS, accomplishes that mission. In \nfurtherance of that obligation and that prerogative, I--indeed \nCongress--must count on DHS cooperation to provide any relevant \ninformation I and this body request.\n  Unfortunately, in connection with the Senate's effort to craft \nlegislation to help secure our borders, the former DHS Secretary \nunjustifiably refused to provide such information. The information I \nasked for was intended to let Congress and the American people judge \nfor themselves if progress is being made to protect our borders from \nillegal entry. To date, I never received that information from this \nadministration.\n  So first during his confirmation hearing and then in writing, I asked \nMr. Johnson to commit to me that, if confirmed as the new DHS \nSecretary, he would provide me that same information. Unfortunately, on \ngrounds that I find to be specious and unacceptable, he declined. On \nthe basis of his response, I can only conclude that, if confirmed, the \nlevel of cooperation between DHS and me, particularly on the vitally \nimportant issue of border security--when comprehensive immigration \nremains such a vitally important issue--would remain business as usual, \nand that is unacceptable. It is unacceptable to me and to the people \nwho interests I am committed to representing.\n  For this reason, I have no choice other than to oppose Mr. Johnson's \nnomination.\n  I have known Jeh for some time. I have respect for his work while \nGeneral Counsel for the Department of Defense. In particular, I applaud \nhis efforts in the development of the Department of Defense's policy \nregarding the use of deadly force in connection with counterterrorist \noperations and other important defense and national security issues.\n  But what I have seen all too frequently is the inability or \nunwillingness of appointed officials within this administration to free \nthemselves from the unelected, unpointed, political staff in the West \nWing that put political expediency ahead of meaningful governance. I \ncan have no tolerance for another Secretary who will act as nothing \nmore than a road block on behalf of those with a political agenda and \nis either unwilling or unable to provide transparency into the actions \nof this department and its components.\n  Congress, particularly those of us who are the border, has the right \nto have that information. It is our responsibility and obligation to \nour constituents. I have constituents in my State who every night, \nthere are people who are crossing their border illegally. I have \nconstituents that every day, drug smugglers are going across their \nproperty and their homes. They certainly have the right, as citizens, \nto know what measures need to be taken in order to control our border.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration bill \nwith 67 votes that included unprecedented increases in spending to help \nsecure the border. The information we based these spending increases on \ncame directly from leadership within the Border Patrol, and I believe \nit will be successful. But the American people deserve to have more \nthan my faith in the efforts of the Border Patrol as to whether the \nborder is made secure. Our constituents are relying on us to finally \nsecure the border but also be good stewards of their tax dollars and to \nhave the capabilities to ensure their money is being used wisely and if \nnot, to make the appropriate adjustments.\n  When developing this legislation, we requested information from \nSecretary Napolitano that I believe would have helped make the \nlegislation stronger and potentially garner more support from my \nRepublican colleagues. This information was never provided to us, I \nbelieve, for solely political reasons but has ultimately harmed our \nability to get comprehensive immigration reform legislation signed into \nlaw.\n  This is the source of my disappointment with Mr. Johnson: His refusal \nto commit to provide the information necessary would prevent Members of \nCongress from making reasonable and informed decisions that serve the \nAmerican people. And Mr. Johnson did so under circumstances that other \nMembers of this body have sought--and obtained--commitments of \ncooperation.\n  For example, here is what Secretary Kerry said in response to a \nrequest for answers regarding the Bengazi raid: ``[H]ere's what I say \nto you. After 29 years here--in my 29th, I respect the prerogatives of \nthe United States Senate and the members of Congress. You represent the \nAmerican people, you're the other branch of government, you have the \nright to know what took place. And I have an obligation commensurate \nwith the, you know, regulations and classifications and privacy and \nother things that are at play here, to help you get the answers, and \nwe'll do that.''\n  And what did I get from Mr. Johnson? ``If I am confirmed . . . I \npromise that addressing your letter will be a top and immediate \npriority for me.''\n  For years, we were told that apprehensions are down and the border is \nmore secure. In reality, we all knew that the economy was the primary \ndriver in reducing potential illegal border crossers. In the last 2 \nyears, with slight improvements in the economy, we have seen a 20 \npercent increase in the number of apprehensions. Does that mean the \nborder is less or more secure?\n  For years DHS has been telling us they are developing a border \nsecurity index in a shift away from using apprehensions as the sole \nmeasure of success and to get a true measure of security along the \nborder. We have been waiting 3 years with no sign that the index will \nbe made public. All indications are the development of the index has \nbeen shelved.\n  Until Congress is provided greater information on the capabilities \nand deficiencies of the Department of Homeland Security's abilities to \nsecure the border, Congress will not be able to determine if the border \nis secure.\n  I regret that Jeh Johnson has refused to commit to providing this \ninformation to Congress, and I do not support his nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/17/senate-section/article/S8908-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8908-S8909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO KAREN PONZURICK BROWN\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the outstanding \nwork of an invaluable member of my staff. Karen Ponzurick Brown, who is \nreally quite young, has already reached 25 years of service on Capitol \nHill, and she has chosen to retire. For 7\\1/2\\ years, she has worked \ntirelessly in a job that calls for 24/7/365 attention. I cannot thank \nher enough for her dedicated assistance. And I also thank her husband \nPaul who has shared his wife's attention with me for these many years.\n  Karen came to work for me at a time when technology was rapidly \nchanging for the position that she held. While she had never worked in \nthis type of capacity before, her sharp mind and intuitive sense \nquickly assessed how to put together a system that ensured Idahoans \nreceived priority attention on my schedule. She has been instrumental \nin creating efficiencies and effective processes in our office and in \nmy time. Karen is conscientious, structured and hardworking. She was \naccessible to anyone who needed her and was a mentor to many of our \nstaff. Her calm demeanor has soothed many agitated callers seeking \nappointments. Her sense of decorum has provided me and my staff with a \ngreater sense of professionalism. Her ability to anticipate challenges \nhas saved the day many times over. I have great respect for her \nthorough, diligent and well-thought-out approach to tackling any \nproblem, and I will truly miss having her input on the many challenges \nthat are encountered in our everyday workplace.\n  But above all her professional qualities, Karen has been a great \nfriend and trusted advisor, and there are no words strong enough to \nexpress my gratitude for that friendship, which I hope will continue. \nNo matter the challenges at hand, she always strives to meet and exceed \nexpectations. Karen has been a great asset to me, my staff, Idahoans \nand countless others throughout her two and a half decades of committed \npublic service. Thank you, Karen, for your dedication. Your confident \nand strong guidance will truly be missed, and I wish you all the best. \nRetirement has been a tough choice for you, but I know that you are at \npeace with that\n\n[[Page S8909]]\n\ndecision, and you are certainly young enough to enjoy it!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/17/senate-section/article/S8909-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO VINCENT FORLENZA\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, Senator Hatch and I join together today \nto recognize the contributions of Vincent A. Forlenza, chairman, CEO \nand president of BD, in establishing and leading AdvaMedDx, an \nimportant new voice for the role of medical diagnostic tests in patient \ncare.\n  BD, the leading global medical technology company, has a strong \npresence in both Maryland and Utah as do other companies in the medical \ndevice and diagnostics sectors. We understand firsthand the growing \nimportance of diagnostics to power medical discoveries and transform \npatient care.\n  Mr. HATCH. The diagnostics sector spans thousands of different kinds \nof tests, from blood tests for cholesterol to new genetic tests that \nidentify cancer variants and match patients to the most appropriate \ndrugs. Diagnostic tests facilitate evidence-based medicine, improve \nquality of care, promote wellness, enable early detection of disease \nand often reduce overall health care costs.\n  In short, diagnostics play a critical role in the health care system \nand are an essential part of quality patient care. While these tests \naccount for only about 2 percent of health care spending, they \ninfluence the large majority of the health care decisions made each and \nevery day.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The impact of diagnostics, however, is not always well \nunderstood by patients, policymakers and, sometimes, even physicians. \nIn 2010, Mr. Forlenza played an instrumental role in bringing together \na group of leading diagnostics manufacturers to form a new trade \nassociation, AdvaMedDx, whose core mission is to create an \nunderstanding of the role diagnostics play in the health care system \nand help foster patient access to innovative, safe, and effective \ntests. Soon after the founding of the AdvaMedDx, Mr. Forlenza assumed \nthe role of chairman of the board of directors, a position he has held \nfor the last 3 years.\n  Mr. HATCH. During Mr. Forlenza's tenure as chairman, AdvaMedDx \ndoubled the size of its membership and established itself as a credible \nvoice on health care policy in Washington and around the world. Under \nMr. Forlenza's leadership, the diagnostic industry has worked with a \nrange of stakeholders to pursue initiatives that aim to reform and \nmodernize the diagnostics regulatory and payment environment in order \nto keep pace with innovation and the changing health care landscape. \nAdvaMedDx works not only with Members of Congress and key public health \nagencies but also with organizations ranging from patient advocacy \ngroups to cancer research societies to the World Health Organization.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. As part of its contribution to the policy dialogue, \nAdvaMedDx has organized Capitol Hill briefings at which leaders in the \nfield of diagnostics have shared insights and current developments on \ntopics including women's health, cancer diagnostics, antibiotic \nresistance, and infectious diseases. Just a few weeks ago, AdvaMedDx \nand the American Association for Cancer Research held a daylong \nsymposium on personalized medicine and companion diagnostics, keynoted \nby the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and the \nDirector of the National Institutes of Health.\n  Mr. HATCH. AdvaMedDx also has established itself as a global leader, \ndriving collaboration with allied associations in Europe, Canada, \nBrazil, Japan, and Australia.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. Forlenza has been a tireless champion for the power \nof diagnostics to promote wellness, improve patient outcomes and \nadvance public health. The success of AdvaMedDx in a few short years is \nin large measure due to this vision that he brought to the \norganization.\n  Mr. HATCH. Congratulations to Vince on his accomplishments during his \ntenure as AdvaMedDx chairman, and best wishes to AdvaMedDx for many \nfuture successes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/17/senate-section/article/S8909-2", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       REMEMBERING DR. RAY DOLBY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of Dr. Ray Dolby, a trailblazing engineer, \nentrepreneur, and pioneer in the field of sound who passed away on \nSeptember 12, 2013. He was 80 years old.\n  Born in Portland, OR and raised in the San Francisco Bay area, Ray \nDolby was a dedicated tinkerer from a young age, always curious about \nhow things worked. As a high school student, he worked after school for \nthe electronics company Ampex Corporation, playing a key role in \ndeveloping Quadruplex, the world's first commercially successful video \ntape recorder, which revolutionized the world of television \nbroadcasting.\n  After graduating from Stanford University with a bachelor's degree in \nelectrical engineering, Ray began a doctoral program in physics at \nCambridge University in England, receiving his doctorate in 1961. The \nnext year, his life changed: He met the love of his life, Dagmar, who \nwas also at Cambridge studying as a summer student, and the two married \nin 1966 and had two beautiful sons, Tom and David.\n  In search of adventure, Ray spent 2 years traversing India as a \ntechnical adviser for the United Nations, working with the Indian \nGovernment to establish a new national laboratory focusing on the \ndevelopment of scientific and industrial instruments. Buoyed by his \nresearch in India, Dolby returned to England in 1965 and founded Dolby \nLaboratories, which he moved to San Francisco in 1976.\n  Throughout his career, Ray Dolby pioneered many of the most \nsignificant developments in sound and audio design. Early on, he \ninvented noise-reduction technology that eliminated the hiss that had \nmarred earlier forms of tape recorded sound and in the 1970s introduced \nDolby Stereo, which allowed movie studios to record films in \nmultichannel surround sound. The innovation of surround sound played a \npivotal role in allowing theater goers around the world to enjoy the \nsound effects in such groundbreaking movies as ``Close Encounters of \nthe Third Kind'' and ``Star Wars'' and innumerable other popular films \nproduced in the decades that followed. Since then, Ray Dolby and Dolby \nLaboratories have pioneered a multitude of technologies in noise \nreduction, audio and video processing, live sound, and digital cinema, \nand won multiple Emmys and Academy Awards for their work.\n  While Ray is often recognized first and foremost for his \nrevolutionary work in the field of sound, he and his wife Dagmar are \nalso known as leaders in San Francisco's philanthropic community. They \ngave generously to numerous causes and organizations, supporting \neverything from stem cell research to community parks to the performing \narts. I extend my deepest condolences to Ray's loving wife Dagmar; his \nchildren, Tom and David, and their spouses; and his four grandchildren. \nDr. Ray Dolby will be deeply missed, but his legacy of generosity and \ninnovation will live on in the countless lives he touched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/17/senate-section/article/S8909-3", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8909-S8910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING ELIZABETH DENEBEIM\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of Elizabeth ``Libby'' Denebeim, a pillar of the \nSan Francisco community, who passed away on November 15, 2013. She was \n83 years old.\n  Libby was born and raised in the Midwest and graduated from the \nUniversity of Missouri, where she met the love of her life, Robert \nDenebeim. After getting married, Libby went on to obtain a master's \ndegree in education and taught elementary school in Tampa, FL, while \nRobert completed his service in the U.S. Air Force.\n  In 1956, the couple moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. Libby had \nalways been dedicated to public service, and in San Francisco she \nbecame a leader in the community. She worked on behalf of so many \nagencies and organizations dedicated to improving education, mental \nhealth, the arts, and family services, including the San Francisco \nBoard of Education; the San Francisco Mental Health Association; the \nMayor's Advisory Council on Families, Children and Youth; the Mayor's \nCriminal Justice Council; San Francisco Head Start; and Jewish Family \nand Children's Services.\n\n[[Page S8910]]\n\n  Libby was also a fierce advocate for the LGBT community. She fought \nto end the definition of homosexuality as a ``mental illness'' and \nremove it from the National Psychiatric Association's Manual of Mental \nDisorders. She campaigned against California Proposition 6, the Briggs \nInitiative, which sought to ban gays and lesbians from working in \nCalifornia's public schools, and also served on the San Francisco \nHealth Department's Committee on Services for People with AIDS, the \nMayor's HIV Task Force, and the NAMES Project.\n  Those lucky enough to know Libby recognized her as a vibrant, \ninspiring and generous woman who gave selflessly to her community. \nThrough the years, she was honored by organizations ranging from the \nUnited Way to the Pacific Medical Center to the California State \nLegislature. Her contributions to the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond \nwill be remembered fondly by everyone whose lives she touched. She will \nbe deeply missed.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \neliminate the taxable income limit on percentage depletion for oil and \nnatural gas produced from marginal properties; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to announce the \nreintroduction of a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code to \neliminate the taxable income limit on percentage depletion for oil and \nnatural gas produced from marginal properties.\n  Since 1926 small producers and millions of royalty owners have had \nthe option to utilize percentage depletion to both simplify their \naccounting methodology and to account for the decline in the value of \nminerals produced from a property. Percentage depletion is particularly \nimportant to America's 700,000 low-volume marginal wells. The average \nmarginal well produces barely 2 barrels per day, yet cumulatively they \naccount for nearly 28 percent of domestic production in the lower 48 \nstates. Since every on-shore natural gas and oil well eventually \ndeclines into marginal production, the economic life span and \ncorresponding production of all wells is extended by allowing the use \nof percentage depletion.\n  Until 1998, the deduction marginal producers could take from \npercentage depletion was limited to 100 percent of taxable income from \neach individual property. Many producers, however, specialize in \nmarginally producing wells and have many properties operating \nsimultaneously. Naturally, some wells in a producer's portfolio are \nmore productive than others. Some would have depletion rates greater \nthan 100 percent of taxable income, while others would have depletion \nrates lower than the limit. Removing the taxable income limitation \nallows producers to take percentage depletion deductions on a \nportfolio-wide basis, which makes their entire operation more \neconomical.\n  Since 1998, Congress has understood this fact and has suspended the \nlimitation. Unfortunately, the provision has never been made permanent. \nIt has just been extended year after year as part of the Tax Extenders \nPackage. Since we have had this suspension on the books for more than a \ndecade, I think it is time to give producers the predictability they \nneed by making this common sense tax accounting provision permanent.\n  At a time when our unemployment rate remains over 7 percent, we need \nto be doing everything we can to encourage economic growth. The energy \nindustry is a major contributor to our economy, and it has a lot of \nroom to grow. The Congressional Research Service released a report that \nsays the United States has the most energy potential under its soil \nthan any other country on earth. Hiding beneath our soil are jobs, \nwealth, and lower deficits. We should allow this sector to grow. This \nis a common sense, easy way to do this, so I urge swift passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 1834. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend the depreciation rules for property used \npredominantly within an Indian reservation; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to bring to your attention a \nbill I am reintroducing that would make permanent the current tax \nprovision that allows capital assets on Indian lands to be depreciated \non an accelerated schedule.\n  For many years, the Federal tax code has provided an incentive for \nbusinesses to invest in operations on Indian reservations and lands \nacross the country. According to the law, businesses that purchase \ncapital equipment and use it on Indian lands will be able to depreciate \nit, on average, more than 40 percent faster than would otherwise be \nallowed.\n  This tax provision is important to Oklahoma because of our \nlongstanding history and unique relationship with Indian tribes. With \nour sluggish economy, we need to do all we can to encourage businesses \nto reinvest in and expand their operations, as this will create \nsustainable job growth.\n  The accelerated depreciation schedule gives businesses the \nopportunity to recover investment dollars in capital assets more \nrapidly. This frees money that would have been tied up in the value of \ntheir capital assets, such as buildings, equipment, and machinery and \nenables companies to reinvest it more quickly than was available with a \nslower depreciation schedule.\n  The Oklahoma Department of Commerce has reported that many companies \nattribute this provision as a key reason for relocating to and \nexpanding within the State. One Oklahoma food processing plant manager \nstated that the credit was a significant factor in the company's \ndecision to expand.\n  Additionally, today's announcement by Macy's, Inc. to locate a new, \nworld class online processing center in Tulsa was justified in part by \nthe Indian lands tax provision. This new 1.3 million square feet \nfacility will employ\n\n[[Page S8916]]\n\n1,100 people full time and will expand to 2,500 people during peak \nperiods. Construction on this project will begin in 2014, and the \nfacility will open for business in 2015. I could not be more excited by \nMacy's decision to expand its operations in Oklahoma. It is a testament \nto Oklahoma's strong, business friendly culture and capable work force.\n  Although the accelerated schedule is currently allowed, the law \nstates it will expire at the end of this year. The provision has \ntypically been renewed each year, but many business leaders have \nexpressed concern that it is not permanent, including the executives of \nMacy's.\n  As a former businessman, I understand the problem of unpredictability \nand so do Oklahoma's business leaders who have expressed frustration \nover dramatically changing government policies ranging from \nenvironmental regulations to the tax code. This kind of environment \nmakes it difficult for businesses to proceed with investment decisions. \nBusinesses need stability, and this is particularly true during times \nof economic weakness. We in Congress should take this point seriously, \nand take a step in the right direction by making permanent this \nimportant tax provision.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1834\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT EXTENSION OF DEPRECIATION RULES FOR \n                   PROPERTY ON INDIAN RESERVATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (j) of section 168 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking \n     paragraph (8).\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to property placed in service after December 31, \n     2013.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. WARREN (for herself, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Brown, Mr. Leahy, \n        Mr. Markey, Mrs. Shaheen, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 1837. A bill to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to prohibit \nthe use of consumer credit checks against prospective and current \nemployees for the purposes of making adverse employment decisions; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I come to the floor in support of the \nEqual Employment for All Act, a bill I introduced today with Senators \nBlumenthal, Brown, Leahy, Markey, Shaheen, and Whitehouse. This \nlegislation would prohibit employers from requiring prospective \nemployees to disclose their credit history as part of the job \napplication process. It makes sure that hiring decisions are based on \nan individual's skill and experience--not on past financial problems. \nThis is also about basic fairness. Let people compete for jobs on the \nmerits, not on whether they have enough money to pay all their bills.\n  Many people have bad credit because they hit hard times. They got \nsick, their husband left or their wife died or they lost their jobs. \nThese are tough events under any circumstances, and they often put a \nreal financial strain on a person. That strain sometimes results in \nlate payments or an increase in the amount of money they must borrow.\n  The problems of bad credit were compounded following the 2008 \nfinancial crisis. Millions of people stumbled financially when \nshrinking home prices left them unable to refinance or to sell a home. \nDepreciated savings left people with a smaller financial cushion to \nsurvive fluctuations in their income. People lost their small \nbusinesses and found themselves mired in debt. For too many people, the \nfallout from the 2008 crisis also damaged their credit.\n  Much of America, hard-working, bill-paying America, has a damaged \ncredit rating, and the impact of that bad credit rating lasts a long \ntime. Negative information generally remains on a credit report for 7 \nyears and, in some cases, it lasts even longer.\n  Most people recognize that one consequence of bad credit is that they \nare going to have trouble borrowing money or they are going to pay more \nwhen they borrow. But for many people, a damaged credit rating can \nblock access to a job. After a terrible blow--a job loss, a death in \nthe family, a divorce, a serious medical problem--many people are \nscrambling to get back to work or to pick up a second job or to change \njobs so they can get back on their feet financially, but they are \nknocked back by damaged credit. Today, highly qualified applicants with \nbad credit can be shut out of the job market. This is wrong.\n  It was once thought a credit history would provide insight into a \nperson's character and, today, many companies routinely require credit \nreports from job applicants. But research has shown that an \nindividual's credit rating has little to no correlation with his or her \nability to succeed in the workplace. A bad credit rating is far more \noften the result of an unexpected personal crisis or economic downturn \nthan a reflection of someone's character or abilities.\n  The Equal Employment for All Act would amend the Fair Credit \nReporting Act to put an end to these unfair and harmful practices. This \nwould benefit millions of American families down on their luck, giving \nthem a chance to rebuild their financial security. It will particularly \nhelp women, minorities, students, and seniors because these groups are \ndisproportionately likely to be hit hard by bad credit ratings. For \nexample, the economic fallout from a divorce often hits women's \nfinances particularly hard. It only gets more difficult for women when \nthey apply for good jobs for which they are fully qualified, but they \nare barred because employers insist on examining their credit history.\n  Another challenge with using credit reports during the job \napplication process is that they are not always accurate. According to \na February 2013 FTC report, 20 percent of consumers could identify at \nleast one error in their credit reports.\n  Unfortunately, someone whose credit report has a significant error \nmay have trouble learning about the mistake and, even if the mistake is \nidentified, have trouble getting it corrected in a reasonable time.\n  According to the same FTC report, correcting credit report errors can \nbe difficult to manage and the reporting agencies can be unresponsive. \nThis means innocent job applicants are paying the price for a credit \nrating company's mistake.\n  This is only one more way the game is rigged. A rich person who loses \na job, gets divorced or faces a family illness is unlikely to suffer \nfrom a drop in his credit or her credit rating. But for millions of \nworking families, a hard personal blow translates into a hard financial \nblow that will show up for years in a credit report. No one should be \ndenied the chance to compete for a job because of a credit report that \nbears no relationship to job performance and that can be riddled with \ninaccuracies.\n  In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis--a crisis that hammered \nmiddle-class families and from which millions of families are still \nstruggling to recover--these practices should be stopped. It is time to \ngive more families a chance to get back in the workforce and to get \nback on their feet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/17/senate-section/article/S8916-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8916-S8917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n            Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs\n\n  Mr. CARDIN.
