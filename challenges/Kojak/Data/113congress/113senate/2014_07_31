Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion \nto proceed to S. 2648, the emergency supplemental appropriations bill, \npostcloture. The time until 10 a.m. will be equally divided between the \ntwo leaders or their designees. The ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Sessions, will control the time from 10 a.m. to 11 \na.m. and the majority will control the time from 11 a.m. to 12 noon.\n  We will notify all Senators when votes are scheduled.\n\n\n                Measure Placed on the Calendar--S. 2709\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand that S. 2709 is at the desk and \ndue for a second reading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bill by \ntitle for the second time.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2709) to extend and reauthorize the Export-\n     Import Bank of the United States, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would object to any further proceedings \nwith respect to this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bill will \nbe placed on the calendar.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I respect, admire, and applaud Senators \nCantwell and Manchin for the work they have done on this most important \nbill. We need to find a way forward on it.\n  There are some in the House of Representatives and a few over here \nwho have made this very difficult to do, and it is so important to the \neconomic stability of our country.\n  I met yesterday with the head of Boeing aircraft, and they have \n800,000 jobs directly and indirectly connected to this--I shouldn't say \n``to this.'' But it is a significant part of what they do and need to \ndo to get their finances in order. It would be a shame if we weren't \nable to renew this. It expires at the end of September.\n\n\n                        September Work Schedule\n\n  Before we finish our business and Senators return for the work period \nat home, I want everyone to know about what is going to happen when we \ncome back.\n  Following the August recess, when we convene on September 8, we will \nbe here for 1 week, 2 weeks, and 2 days. That is it. September 23 is \nour target date to adjourn until after the election. I hope we can do \nthat. This leaves us little more than 2 weeks and 2 days. That is not a \nlot of time for the workload we have to do.\n\n[[Page S5160]]\n\n  We need to pass appropriations measures to keep the government from \nshutting down. We need to pass a temporary extension to the Internet \nTax Freedom Act. We need to do something about the items I just \nmentioned about the Ex-Im Bank. We have to do the Defense authorization \nbill, which is extremely important for the fighting men and women of \nthis country. We are going to address the Udall constitutional \namendment on capping finance reform. And we are going to reconsider a \nnumber of issues: college affordability, minimum wage, Hobby Lobby, \nstudent debt.\n  We have a lot of work to do. So everyone needs to know that when we \ncome back on September 8, there will be no weekends off. There are only \n2 weeks until we go home, and everyone should not plan things on these \nweekends. So no one can say: You need to give us notice.\n  You have been given notice.\n  I had a chairmen's lunch yesterday. Every chairman there said we \nshould work those two weekends. So everybody, this isn't me trying to \ndictate a schedule. At lunch yesterday, the chairmen of this \ninstitution said we should work those two weekends.\n  I just mentioned a few things we have to do. So again, Saturday, \nSeptember 13; Sunday, September 14; Saturday, September 20; Sunday, \nSeptember 21, we need to be here, including the Fridays that precede \nthose dates that I gave. Every day between September 8 and September 30 \nis fair game. Friday, Saturday, Sunday, we need to be here.\n  I repeat for the third time here this morning: There is so much to do \nand so little time to do it. We have not had a productive Congress. We \ncan't push everything back to the so-called lameduck. Much of what we \nare able to accomplish in September depends on the Republicans in the \nHouse. Will they get their business done and pass legislation that is \nimportant for our country and including the economy?\n  Here we have lamented the fact that they refuse to take up and pass \nour comprehensive immigration reform. What a good piece of legislation, \na bipartisan bill passed out of this body by an overwhelming margin, \nand Republicans refuse to take it up. Among other things, it will \nreduce the debt by $1 trillion.\n  We have no extension of long-term unemployment benefits. I have \ntalked about minimum wage and I have talked about student debt. I have \ntalked about Hobby Lobby. I have talked about equal pay for women, \ngetting paid equally for the work they do that is the same as men. But \nthey have no interest in these issues. They certainly have no interest \nin getting corporate bosses out of health care for women.\n  No, they are busy turning the House floor into a theater. And it is a \ndouble feature like we used to go to when they had double features--at \nleast I don't think they do anymore. It is a double feature.\n  House Republicans are, first of all, going to sue the President. And, \nabove all, the Republicans in the House and the Senate--the most anti-\ntrial-lawyer group of legislators in the history of the country--who \nare they going to? Trial lawyers. Who is going to pay those trial \nlawyers? The American taxpayers. And if that isn't enough, once their \nlawsuit gets going, they are going to try to impeach the President.\n\n  So that is what it is all about. We have a lot to do. A lot depends \non the political theater in the House. If the House Republicans are \nserious and focus their time on legislation to help American families, \nthen it could be a very productive month in September. If they keep up \nthe sue-and-impeach show, we will stay right here working until they \nfinally get serious about giving the American people a fair shot.\n\n\n                     Reservation of Leadership Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 10 a.m. will be equally \ndivided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                             Border Crisis\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the ongoing humanitarian crisis at our \nNation's southern border demands a solution. It really just boggles the \nmind that the President of the United States would rather fund raise in \nHollywood than work with members of his own party to forge a \nlegislative response to this tragic situation and to do something to \nprevent more young people from making the perilous and potentially \nlife-threatening journey across the desert.\n  The President initially laid out reforms that, while modest, \nrepresented a step in the right direction. But evidently the politicos \nwho increasingly have the President's ear these days couldn't go along \nwith that, so the President stopped defending his own policy reforms. \nInstead, he demanded a blank check that would literally preserve the \nstatus quo, a blank check he knew wouldn't fix the problem, a blank \ncheck he knew couldn't pass Congress, and a blank check he knew members \nof his own party in Congress didn't even support.\n  Faced with a national crisis, he listened once again to his most \npartisan instincts instead of uniting Congress around a common solution \nso he could lay blame for that crisis on somebody else. Apparently no \ncrisis is too big to be trumped by politics in the Obama White House. \nIt is exasperating for those of us who want to work toward bipartisan \nsolutions; it is confusing, I am sure, to the Democrats who share our \ndesire to get something accomplished; and it is emboldening to \nDemocrats who don't, including the Senate Democratic leadership.\n  When faced with a crisis, a President's job is to show Presidential \nleadership and to get his party on board with the reforms necessary to \naddress it. Scuttling reform and prolonging the crisis is not part of \nthe job description.\n  So what I am suggesting, Mr. President, is that you spend a little \nmore time actually doing the job you were elected to do. Press \n``pause'' on the nonstop photo-ops and start demonstrating some real \nleadership instead. The barbecue joints and the pool halls will still \nbe there after we solve this problem.\n  Mr. President, it is a dangerous journey to the border. Children are \nsuffering at the hands of some seriously bad actors down there. News \nreports suggest you even knew about this long before it started making \nnational news. You could have intervened before this turned into a \nfull-blown humanitarian crisis, but you didn't. You could have worked \nwith us to get a bipartisan solution. You didn't.\n  Mr. President, you have a special responsibility to help us end this \ncrisis in a humane and appropriate way. Congress cannot do it without \nyour leadership or your engagement. It is literally impossible to do \nthis without you. So pick up the phone you keep telling us about and \ncall us. Call your fellow Democrats and lobby them to get on board. \nWork with us, and let's address this crisis.\n\n\n                             Foreign Policy\n\n  Recently I expressed deep concern that the President pursued a \nforeign policy based on withdrawing from America's forward presence and \nalliance commitments, hollowing out our Nation's conventional military \nforces, placing an overreliance upon personal diplomacy and \ninternational organizations, and literally abandoning the war on \nterror. I believe this will leave his successor to deal with a more \ndangerous world and with fewer tools to meet the threats.\n  Later this morning several Members of Congress charged with leading \nnational security committees and policymaking will meet with the \nPresident to discuss national security. I don't expect the President to \nbrief us on his plan for rebuilding the military, especially in a way \nthat would allow us to meet our commitments in Europe and the Middle \nEast or that would allow for an effective strategic pivot to Asia, nor \ndo I expect the President to lay out for us his plans to provide the \nintelligence community with all the tools it will need to deal with the \nthreat of international terrorism from Al Qaeda and its affiliated \ngroups over the next decade. Those are strategic threats best addressed \nby integrating all the tools of our Nation's power, and, candidly, it \nwould require the President to revisit the policy stances he took as a \ncandidate back in 2008.\n  I do hope that at a minimum the President will discuss two near-term \nissues:\n\n[[Page S5161]]\n\n  First, I hope he will explain his plan or efforts to assist the \nIsraelis in demilitarizing Gaza and ensuring that Hamas is not left \nwith the ability to launch indirect fire attacks against the civilian \npopulace or to infiltrate Israel through tunnels. In coordination with \nIsrael, we can assist the Palestinian Authority with any programs to \nassume responsibility for monitoring those access points into Gaza.\n  Absent any active efforts by the administration, I would at least \nlike assurances that the President is not working to impose a cease-\nfire upon Israel that is harmful to the objectives of the current \nmilitary campaign.\n  Second, earlier this month a group of Republican Senators wrote to \nthe President imploring him to craft a plan for containing the threat \nposed to Iraq and Jordan by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. \nSpecifically, we asked the President to deploy an assessment team to \nJordan to develop a plan to prevent the spread of ISIL in a way that \nthreatened our ally Jordan.\n  Although Ambassador Susan Rice responded to our letter, her letter \ndid not address how the administration intends to combat ISIL. Instead, \nAmbassador Rice renewed the administration's request for a new \ncounterterrorism partnership fund. To this point, the administration \nhas failed to provide the Congress with any plan for how this new \ncounterterrorism fund would assist our ally, further our own interests, \nor train and equip a moderate opposition within Syria. That would be a \ngood starting point for today's discussion with the President.\n\n\n                        Opiate Addiction Impacts\n\n  Prescription drug and heroin abuse have risen to epidemic levels in \nmy home State of Kentucky. More Kentuckians now lose their lives to \ndrug overdose--largely driven by painkillers--than to car crashes. It \nis a huge problem.\n  Earlier this year I convened a listening session in the Commonwealth \nto hear from those closest to the problem, from professionals across \nthe medical, public health, and law enforcement spheres, as well as a \nbrave young man who managed to break his heroin addiction after \nwatching his own friends overdose. We discussed the extent of the \nproblem, and one issue in particular that grabbed my attention was the \nincreasing number of infants being born in Kentucky dependent on \nopiates. Researchers estimate that more than one baby every hour--one \nbaby every hour--is now born dependent on drugs and suffering from \nwithdrawal--a number that has increased in my home State by more than \n3,000 percent since the year 2000. We have gone from 29 infants \nidentified as suffering from drug withdrawal annually to more than 950. \nExperts believe there are even more cases that go unreported. This is \nheartbreaking. I say this especially as a father of three daughters. \nThese children are the most innocent members of our society. We have to \nprotect them.\n\n  Thankfully, the Commonwealth is taking this problem seriously. Both \nthe Kentucky Perinatal Association and the Kentucky Perinatal Quality \nInitiative Collaborative have made as their primary focus reducing the \nnumber of infants born dependent on opiates and other drugs. I \ncertainly commend their efforts, but there is more we can do at the \nFederal level.\n  Maternal addiction and infant opiate dependency are epidemics that \ncan best be overcome by effective coordination between stakeholders at \nthe State and Federal levels.\n  One bill that was recently introduced in the House, the CRIB Act, \nwould help address the need for greater coordination between doctors, \nnurses, hospitals, and governments at the State and Federal level. I \ncommend the sponsors of that legislation for their leadership.\n  Today in the Senate I will introduce the Protecting Our Infants Act, \nwhich seeks to address not only infants suffering from opiate \nwithdrawal but maternal opiate addiction as well. It would help \nidentify and disseminate recommendations for preventing and treating \nmaternal addiction so that we can reduce the number of infants born \ndependent on opiates and other drugs.\n  My bill would also promote recommendations as to how to pinpoint \nthose babies suffering from withdrawal and how best to treat them. \nBecause I have heard from so many experts in Kentucky on the need for \nmore research into infant withdrawal and its long-term effects, my bill \nwould shine a light on those areas as well.\n  The Protecting Our Infants Act would also encourage the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention to work with States to improve the \navailability and quality of data so that they can respond more \neffectively to this public health crisis.\n  My legislation is certainly no silver bullet, but it is a step in the \nright direction, and it would help ensure that our public health system \nis better equipped to treat opiate addiction in mothers and in their \nnewborn children. Together we can overcome this tragic problem. I am \ngoing to remain focused on it until we do.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                          Family Medical Leave\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the need to strengthen \nAmerican families and enhance workplace flexibility, and I am very \npleased to be joined here on the floor of the Senate this morning by my \ngood friend the junior Senator from Maine.\n  In Nebraska and all throughout the country, too many families \ncontinue to struggle in this weak economy. Even with moms and dads \nworking two or three jobs, some families find it hard to get ahead. \nHousehold income has plummeted by more than $3,300, and 3.7 million \nmore women are in poverty. The average price for a gallon of gas has \nnearly doubled, and the labor force participation rate has declined by \n2.9 percentage points since 2009.\n  Many economists agree that the surest way to generate sustained \neconomic growth and empower struggling families is to pass \ncomprehensive tax reform. Addressing overregulation should also be a \ntop priority. Moreover, it is a simple truth that less government \nspending means families will keep more of their own money. Agreement on \nhow exactly to achieve these needed fiscal reforms remains elusive and, \nunfortunately, unlikely in a Capitol paralyzed with election fever. \nNonetheless, there are reasonable policy changes we can all agree on, \nand those changes will make life easier for families.\n  I have been working on a number of commonsense measures--my Strong \nFamilies, Strong Communities plan--to empower working families, \nincrease take-home pay, and ensure flexibility in the workplace. Today \nI would like to discuss part of that plan.\n  The Strong Families Act is a bipartisan proposal I introduced with \nSenator King to address the challenge of paid leave. It is no secret \nthat balancing responsibilities at home with duties at work is a common \nstruggle for working parents. For an increasing number of Americans \nthese pressures include raising young children while also caring for \naging parents.\n\n  While I believe we must do more to help these working families, the \nusual Washington answers of one-size-fits-all Federal mandates and \nhigher taxes are not a part of the solution we are proposing. Instead, \nI believe we should focus on a more balanced approach that respects \nboth family obligations and the employer's costs of doing business. \nThere are ways to increase the options for working adults without \nhurting existing employment arrangements or threatening job security.\n  The Family and Medical Leave Act--FMLA--of 1993 requires employers of \n50 or more employees to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave, which \ncan be used for events such as the birth or adoption of children, \nserious medical issues, or providing care to close family members.\n  The problem for many families is that current law does not require \npaid time off. Unpaid leave is practically impossible for countless \nAmericans, especially hourly workers who live paycheck to paycheck. \nMany employers voluntarily offer generous compensation packages that \ninclude paid parental or medical leave. A survey of more than 1,100 \nemployers found that 68 percent of large employers provide paid \nparental leave. At the same time not all workers enjoy these options \ndespite increasingly complex family demands. Again, this is especially \ntrue for low-wage workers. With more than half of women working as the \nprimary breadwinners, workplace flexibility has become a necessity for \nour 21st-century families.\n  It is not just children who require personal care and attention; it \nis also\n\n[[Page S5162]]\n\nour aging parents. Nearly half of middle-aged adults have elderly \nparents, and they are still supporting their own children. Over 43 \nmillion Americans provide direct care to older family members, with \nwomen serving as 66 percent of all primary caregivers. As the baby \nboomer generation ages, the number of senior citizens requiring care \nwill likely spike. Less take-home pay for these caregivers means \ntighter finances, more stress, and lost opportunities--all at a time \nwhen families are confronting health crises or dealing with unique \nchallenges of starting a new family. With such events often coinciding \nwith high medical bills, the last thing a stressed family needs is a \nsmaller working budget.\n  Senator King and I have offered a proposal that would enable working \nfamilies to have continued access to pay while they are meeting \nnecessary family obligations. Our plan would create a tax credit to \nencourage employers to voluntarily offer paid leave for workers. To be \neligible for that tax credit, the employer must at a minimum offer 4 \nweeks of paid leave, but they could offer more. Paid leave would be \navailable on an hourly basis and would be separate from the other \nvacation or sick leave. For each hour of paid leave provided, the \nemployer would receive a 25-percent nonrefundable tax credit. The more \npay the employer offers, the greater the tax credit. This tax credit \nwill be available to any employer with qualified employees regardless \nof size. Importantly, our bill is reasonable. It is a balanced solution \nthat can make a real difference in the lives of working families.\n\n  When we do this without new mandates or new taxes, it creates an \nincentive structure to encourage employers to offer that paid leave, \nspecifically targeting those who hire lower income hourly paid workers. \nThis should not be just another election-year issue. This is a middle-\nclass issue and our bill takes the partisan politics out of it and \noffers a meaningful solution we can pass.\n  I wish to thank my friend from Maine, Senator King, who joined me in \noffering this bill.\n  Once again, this now famous surf-and-turf caucus is working together \non a commonsense proposal, and it is a proposal that can help American \nfamilies. I am grateful for the Senator's input, his hard work and \nfriendship, and I look forward to closely working with him in the \nfuture so we can advance this measure in the Senate.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my colleague from \nNebraska to introduce what I think is an important and commonsense and \nworkable bill that could be passed in the next several weeks, and I \nthink there will be broad agreement across the political spectrum.\n  The question we are answering is: What does Suriname, Papua-New \nGuinea, and the United States have in common? The answer is: They are \nthe only three countries in the world that we have been able to turn up \nthat don't have any provision for paid maternity leave. Every member of \nthe industrialized world, except the United States, has some kind of \ncoverage for paid maternity leave.\n  This chart gives the various levels. You will see in red is the \nUnited States, Suriname, Papua New Guinea, and that is it in the whole \nworld. This is something we can do that will not affect our \ncompetitiveness, will not be a problem in our economic growth, and in \nfact I believe it will contribute to it.\n  Today a family who has a health crisis with an elderly parent, a \nchild or has the joyful issue of a new child in their family has a \nterrible dilemma. The dilemma is: Do I stay home to take care of the \nchild or the elderly parent in a health crisis or do I have to put food \non the table by going to work because for every hour of work I miss I \nlose an hour of pay. That is a dilemma we should not put our people \nthrough.\n  As I have said, I believe this is a productivity issue. All of the \ndiscussions we have had in recent months about pay and gender inequity \noften come down to the issue of workplace flexibility, particularly in \nthe case of women who are often the ones who are put in the dilemma I \nmentioned of having to choose between their earnings and family \nobligations. Women are the ones who are often trapped in this dilemma, \nand they are the ones who are asking for and seeking--quite \nreasonably--the same kind of flexibility that virtually every other \nworking person in the world already enjoys.\n  I like this bill and agreed with my colleague from Nebraska to join \nin it because it is voluntary. It is not a mandate from Washington, it \nis not something that says every employer in the country has to do \nthis, and there will be rules and bureaucracy and adjudications and all \nthose kinds of things. No, this is a voluntary, incentive-based program \nthat says every employer--not just those 50 and above or 100 and above \nor 500 and above--in the country will have this tax credit available to \nthem that will allow them to offer paid leave to their employees.\n  I think this is the way we should approach this and not, as my \ncolleague has said, with a one-size-fits-all mandate emanating from \nWashington. I think incentives are always better than mandates.\n  The other element that is important about this bill is it focuses on \nthe people who are currently least likely to have some kind of paid \nleave available to them, and usually those are people who work on an \nhourly basis. That is whom this bill is focused on. The interesting \naspect of the data is that as it goes up the income scale into salaried \nemployees, more than two-thirds of American workers in this category \nalready have a paid leave policy. It is when you get down into the \nworking people--the hourly workers--that we have discovered the real \nproblem lies. That is why I think this bill has an important focus on \nhourly workers, people who are covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act \nand people who otherwise are not going to have this kind of protection.\n  This is about flexibility. As I have talked to and listened to \nwomen's groups and advocacy groups, flexibility is always first on the \nagenda, and that is exactly what we are talking about, so people--men \nor women--don't have to make that agonizing decision, people who are \nliving paycheck to paycheck don't have to make the agonizing decision \nbetween being able to put food on the table and pay the rent or staying \nhome to take care of an ill child or an elderly parent or to stay home \na reasonable period after the joyous occasion of the arrival of a new \nchild.\n  It is also about productivity. I believe we will see an increase in \nproductivity because people will not be preoccupied when they are at \nwork. They know they are going to be there and they know they are going \nto have this protection and it takes away that agonizing worry and \nanxiety. It also--by giving people paid leave--will enable them to \ncontinue to contribute to the economy, and I believe it will actually \nbe a positive stimulus to our economy.\n  Of course everybody says we are in competition with the rest of the \nworld. Not on this. Every place else in the world provides this level \nof benefits so we are in a catchup situation, and I believe, as I said, \nI think we will see an increase in productivity and in economic \nactivity.\n  Finally, it is about fairness. Frankly, to some extent it is about \ngender fairness. It is about fairness to working women who are expected \nin our culture to be the ones to take care of a sick child. That may \nnot be fair, that may not be the wave of the future, but that is a fact \ntoday. It is about fairness to those working women who have to make a \nchoice between putting food on the table or taking care of a sick child \nor taking the necessary time off after the birth of a child in order to \nhave that event be a happy one and not an economic strain on the \nfamily.\n  I am delighted to join my colleague from Nebraska--the leader of the \nsurf-and-turf caucus--on her brilliant bill that I believe is something \nwe can come together on, on a bipartisan basis, and actually do \nsomething about and not just talk about the problem of income equality \nand not just talk about the problem of fairness and not just talk about \nthe problem of flexibility in the workplace but actually do something \nabout it in a practical and commonsense way that I think will have \ntremendous ramifications across the country.\n  I am delighted to be able to join her. I compliment the Senator from \nNebraska for her work in bringing this\n\n[[Page S5163]]\n\nforward, and I look forward to what I hope will be an expeditious \nconsideration of her bill in the Senate and in the Congress. This is a \nchange we can make that will make a real difference in people's lives \nacross America.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the people of the United States have \ntruly begged and pleaded with their lawmakers for years to create a \nlawful system of immigration--one that works, one that is fair, one \nthat serves the national interest, one that we can believe in. They \nhave been justly and rightly convinced of that fact, and they have \ndemanded it of their elected officeholders to secure their communities \nand protect the integrity of our national borders. Some say there is \nsomething wrong with that. I say there is absolutely nothing wrong with \nthat. That is the right thing. That is the moral thing. That is the \nresponsible thing. That is the decent thing. That is what any great \nnation should have--an immigration policy that serves its national \ninterest and is fairly and lawfully conducted.\n  But these pleas have fallen on deaf ears. Our border is absolutely \nnot secure. It is in a state of crisis. Our communities are not safe. \nPreventable crimes occur every day because our laws are not being \nenforced and our sovereignty, at its base level, is not being \nprotected. And, we have a President planning to issue sweeping \nexecutive amnesty in violation of law, in ways in which he has no \npower, and threatens the constitutional separation of powers. Congress \npasses laws; the President must execute the laws. The President is not \nentitled to make laws, to conduct actions contrary to plain laws. The \nPresident simply cannot say Congress didn't act, so I have to act.\n  Well, Congress decided not to act in a way he wanted. They considered \nlegislation, rejected it, and now he is going to--it appears from \narticle after article--go forward and carry out an action anyway. It \nwould be fundamentally wrong. This cannot stand. It will not stand.\n  My position has been and remains that Congress should not pass border \nlegislation that does not foreclose the possibility of these unlawful \nExecutive orders. As an institution, this Congress has a duty to \nprotect this institution and our constituents.\n  Currently, the President has issued approximately half a million \ngrants of administrative amnesty and work permits to individuals \nunlawfully present in the country up to 30 years of age. Now the \nPresident wants to issue another 5 to 6 million work permits to illegal \nimmigrants of any age, despite a clear prohibition in the Immigration \nand Nationality Act. He is not entitled to do that. Plain law says you \ncannot employ someone in the country unlawfully.\n  People think: Well, it is one thing to say you will not deport \nsomebody. But, colleagues, what was done previously was to provide, \nunder the DACA legislation, an ID card with the words ``Work Permit'' \nacross the top, ``Work Authorization'' across the top.\n  So the President is providing, in violation of plain law, the ability \nof people in the country to work who are not entitled to work, who will \nbe able to take jobs from any American today. We have a lot of \nAmericans today struggling for work. At a time when millions of \nAmericans are out of work, the President's plan is a direct affront to \nthem--to every single unemployed American, to people around the world \nwho have applied to come to the United States and have not been \nadmitted, so they did not come unlawfully. What do we say to them when \nthis happens?\n  It is particularly damaging to those in the poorest and most \nvulnerable communities in America. So who is speaking for them? Who \nwill give them a voice in Congress? Will Members hear? Will we hear \ntheir pleas? I have been shocked that we have not seen a willingness in \nthe Congress to resist more effectively than what we are seeing today.\n  So let's consider a bit more deeply for a moment what the President's \nExecutive action would do to immigration enforcement in America. Let me \nsay clearly, colleagues, we are not making this up. We are not having \nsome idea that he might do something for 5 or 6 million more people. It \nhas been repeatedly leaked from the White House--not leaked; they have \ndiscussed it. The President has promised it to activist groups like La \nRaza and the ACLU that he has been meeting with. He has told them he \nintends to do this. It is only a question of how and the time. The \nlatest article yesterday in the Wall Street Journal--a big article--\nsaid it would happen shortly after Labor Day. Well, this is not \nsomething we are making up. It is a direct threat, a direct promise, a \nstatement, it appears, from the White House.\n  I hope they will not go forward with it. Surely cooler heads in the \nWhite House will push back. Surely his Attorney General will say: Mr. \nPresident, you cannot do this. His legal counsel in the White House \nwill say: Mr. President, do not do this. This is not lawful. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security needs to be saying: This would be \ndevastating, Mr. President. How can we enforce any laws? Please do not \ndo this.\n  I do not think it is absolutely certain to happen. But it seems to me \nthat by every indication it is an absolute intention right now of the \nPresident to go forward with this or they would not have had at least a \nhalf a dozen articles on it--the National Journal, Time magazine, and \nothers.\n  I have spoken many times with a great American by the name of Chris \nCrane, a former marine. He is also an ICE officer and president of the \nofficers' ICE Council--the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council. \nHe has explained how his officers are ordered not to do their job. They \nhave even sued the Secretary of Homeland Security for blocking them \nfrom fulfilling their oath to enforce the laws of the United States of \nAmerica. Can you imagine that? I was in Federal law enforcement for 15 \nyears. I have never heard of a situation in which a group of law \nofficers sue their supervisor saying, in Federal court: Mr. Judge, my \nsupervisor is ordering me not to do what my duty and my oath requires \non a daily basis.\n\n  That is a stunning development. Their morale for years has been one \nof the lowest in the Federal Government. Now I think it is the lowest \nbecause they have been demeaned and rejected in a duty they believe is \nworthwhile for them to carry out.\n  One of the things Mr. Crane explained is that the President's \nprevious Executive amnesty for the so-called DREAMers basically halted \nenforcement for anyone who asserted protections under that new \nadministration policy. Mr. Crane would report that ICE officers would \ncome into contact with individuals unlawfully present in the country--\nindividuals they would encounter in prisons and jails. They would be \ncalled by a local police department that they have arrested someone for \na serious crime. They would tell the ICE officers. Routinely they are \nsupposed to go and pick them up and deport them. They would encounter \npeople in jail--that is one of the big jobs they have--and they would \nbe forced to release them simply because they assert: I came here as a \nyouth. Nobody is going to do any investigation on this. How do you \ninvestigate it? The effect is to demoralize and make it difficult, and \nalmost impossible, to enforce the law.\n  Now imagine, then, what would happen if the President expands this \nadministrative amnesty and work authorization program to cover millions \nof unlawful immigrants of all ages. Everyone ICE comes in contact with \nwill assert these protections: I am qualified under the President's \namnesty. And any who fail the application will say they are eligible \nfor this amnesty.\n  So what then? Will the FBI open investigations, check when they \nentered the country or whom they entered the country with, and where \nthey came from? They are not going to do that--of course not. The \nofficers are going to be totally unable to resist false claims from \napplicants, who happen to be the people they have arrested. It is going \nto demoralize immigration enforcement officers. ICE officers will again \nbe\n\n[[Page S5164]]\n\nissued orders basically to stand down. No enforcement is going to \noccur. It will be the effective end of immigration enforcement in \nAmerica, in my opinion.\n  You cannot maintain an effective, lawful, consistent, fair \nimmigration enforcement policy with these kinds of regulations \noccurring and these kinds of orders from the White House, who is the \nChief Executive Officer of America, who is empowered and directed to \nensure that the laws of the United States are carried out--not \nempowered to violate the laws of the United States.\n  We have also heard from officers who have processed immigration \napplications. These are people who receive applications to come to the \nUnited States in a lawful way. These dedicated folks at the U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services are people who have to process all \nof these millions of applicants if the President issues his order.\n  So let me read at length from a statement from the President of the \nUSCIS Council, who represents these CIS officers who have an awesome \nduty. He wrote last year--this is what he said:\n\n       USCIS adjudications officers are pressured to rubber stamp \n     applications instead of conducting diligent case review and \n     investigation.\n\n  This is the officers saying that their bosses are pressuring them to \njust rubber stamp applications right now--not to investigate, not to \nask questions--just approve them. He goes on:\n\n       The culture at USCIS encourages all applications to be \n     approved, discouraging proper investigation into red flags \n     and discouraging the denial of any applications. USCIS has \n     been turned into an ``approval machine.''\n\n  That is what the top CIS officer said in a statement last fall. They \nhave been turned into an approval machine. No wonder the American \npeople are unhappy with what goes on here. Does anyone really know how \nserious this is? It is amazing that we would undermine the very \nintegrity, really, of the entire process, and that is why they have \nprotested. That is why they have come forward. It hurts them. They feel \nbad to see the great laws of the United States being routinely \neviscerated.\n  He went on to say this:\n\n       USCIS has created an almost insurmountable bureaucracy \n     which often prevents USCIS adjudications officers from \n     contacting and coordinating with ICE agents--\n\n  Who know something about these people, perhaps--\n\n     and officers in cases that should have their involvement. \n     USCIS officers are pressured to approve visa applications for \n     many individuals ICE agents have determined should be placed \n     into deportation proceedings.\n\n  That is a very serious charge, and that is happening. He is not \nmaking that up. It goes on:\n\n       The USCIS officers who identify illegal aliens that, in \n     accordance with law should be placed into immigration removal \n     proceedings before a federal judge, are prevented from \n     exercising their authority and responsibility to issue \n     Notices To Appear.\n\n  This is a notice to appear in court. They are being obstructed and \ntold not to do it. He goes on to say:\n\n       The attitude of USCIS management is not that the Agency \n     serves the American public or the laws of the United States, \n     or public safety and national security, but instead that the \n     agency serves illegal aliens and the attorneys which \n     represent them. While we believe in treating all people with \n     respect, we are concerned that this agency tasked with such a \n     vital security mission is too greatly influenced by special \n     interest groups--to the point that it no longer properly \n     performs its mission.\n\n  What a devastating critique. Does anyone care? Has the President done \none thing to respond to these allegations? Is the Senate bill that is \noffered by Senator Reid and our Democratic colleagues, with the \nblessings of the President--does it do one thing to fix one of these \nproblems? No. They have no intention of fixing these problems. They do \nnot want to fix these problems. This is their policy: to foment more \nlawlessness and to see that the laws are undermined in such a way they \ncannot be effectively enforced.\n  It is just wrong, colleagues. Republicans and Democrats need to stand \nup to this. Don't we need to respond to the desires of the American \npeople for a lawful system of immigration? Isn't that right and just \nand decent that they ask of us? Yet we go along in total ignorance and \nignore these kinds of statements from our own enforcement officers, \nwhich anybody who looks at the border and sees what is happening could \nbelieve every bit of. And indeed it is true.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       This agency is tasked with such a vital security mission is \n     too greatly influenced by special interest groups--to the \n     point that it no longer properly performs its mission.\n\n  In virtually every article we see the President is meeting with some \ngroup, such as La Raza, which has very extreme policies on \nimmigration--basically an open borders policy. They have opposed every \npolicy of lawfulness. Another similar group, the ACLU, was commenting \nrecently on what they thought the President had told them he was going \nto do about not enforcing the law.\n  These are the kinds of groups he is meeting with. He is not meeting \nwith the law officers. He never sat down with them to ask: Tell me what \nit is like on the border. Let's see if we fix this thing. Let's make \nthis system work. He has never done that. That is very indicative. This \nlegislation that would spend $2.7 billion, proposed by the Democratic \nleadership in the Senate, and totally blessed by the President. This is \nthe President's bill and it does nothing to fix any of the problems. It \njust asks for more money.\n  The President of the United States Citizenship and Immigration \nServices wrote last year:\n\n       DHS and USCIS leadership have intentionally established an \n     application process for DACA--\n\n  That is his first amnesty for DREAMers that the President issued.\n\n     --that bypasses traditional in-person investigatory \n     interviews with trained USCIS adjudications officers. These \n     practices were put in place to stop proper screening and \n     enforcement,--\n\n  He is saying that these practices were put in place to stop proper \nscreening and enforcement.\n\n     --and guarantee that applications will be rubber-stamped for \n     approval, a practice that virtually guarantees widespread \n     fraud and places public safety at risk.\n\n  This is the head of the USCIS Officers Association. He is laying out \nevent after event, action after action, that demonstrates we are \ndealing with an administration that does not want the law enforced. Can \nyou believe these words?\n  The president of USCIS goes on to say:\n\n       U.S. taxpayers are currently tasked with absorbing the cost \n     of over $200 million worth of fee waivers bestowed on \n     applicants for naturalization during the last fiscal year. \n     This is in addition to the strain put on our Social Security \n     system that has been depleted by an onslaught of refugees \n     receiving SSI benefits as soon as their feet touch U.S. soil.\n\n  So the story that there are no Social Security benefits is not \ncorrect. The refugees who enter our asylum system through the refugee \nprogram are entitled to these benefits when they hit the soil.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Large swaths of the Immigration and Nationality Act are not \n     effectively enforced for legal immigrants and visa holders, \n     including laws regarding public charges as well as many other \n     provisions as the USCIS lacks the resources to adequately \n     screen and scrutinize legal immigrants and non-immigrants \n     seeking status adjustment. There is also insufficient \n     screening and monitoring of student visas.\n\n  These are breathtaking reports from our top officers, from the front \nlines of law enforcement, from people who screen and review \napplications every day for the United States of America.\n  Now think--just imagine what will happen to our system if the \nPresident goes forward with his executive action. It would overwhelm a \nsystem that is already buckling under the weight of massive illegality \non our southern border.\n  We must end this lawlessness. We can end this. We can do so. Let me \nrepeat. I know it can be done. But to do so, we must first stop doing \nmore damage. We must prevent the President's massive executive amnesty \nfrom going forward. The public, once riled to these issues, will not be \nignored this time, in my opinion. They will not let the representatives \nof either party acquiesce to lawlessness. That is why I have said that \nCongress as an institution must not support any border bill that come \nforward that does not expressly prohibit the President's executive \namnesty ideas that he has been talking about, and would block him from \nspending any money to execute an unlawful plan of this kind.\n  How can we not take this position, colleagues? What basis do we have \nto\n\n[[Page S5165]]\n\nsay we will not take any action when we were being told on a daily \nbasis what the President plans to do? Are we ready to go to recess for \nAugust having done nothing, said nothing, offered nothing to oppose the \nstated intentions of the President in this way?\n  There is currently no legislation pending for a vote in either \nChamber, House or Senate, which passes this test. Senator Cruz has \noffered language, but they are not willing to allow it to come up for a \nvote. As a result, both the House and Senate packages should not be \nsupported. Congress should not adjourn until it has firmly stood \nagainst the President's unconstitutional and dangerous action.\n  The American people are asking for us to help. They are pleading with \nus to help. We must answer their call. We must fight for the lawful and \njust system of immigration that we can be proud of. Let's put this into \na bigger picture. Wages are down. Labor force participation is \ndeclining. The percentage of people in the working ages who are \nactually working has been declining steadily. Indeed, it has not \nreached a level this low since the 1970s.\n  Since 2000, the Federal Government has lawfully issued nearly 30 \nmillion immigrant and foreign work visas--for people to come to this \ncountry to work--almost 30 million visas to legally work in the United \nStates or permanently reside in the United States. During this time, \nthe number of Americans with jobs--Americans with jobs--declined on \nnet. On net, fewer U.S.-born workers ages 16 to 65 had jobs in 2014 \nthan in 2000. Amazing.\n  There are fewer people working today--even though the population has \nincreased--than in 2000. The President's planned work permits for \nillegal immigrants is in addition then to the already huge flow of low-\nwage labor into the United States.\n  We have a problem, colleagues, with Americans needing jobs. We do not \nhave too few workers. We have too few jobs. I would contend that that \nis pretty clear because wages are down.\n  If we had a shortage of workers, wages would be up. When you have a \nsurplus of labor and surplus of workers, wages decline. According to \nthe Wall Street Journal, in 2007, a family income of 4 would amount to \nabout $55,000, on average. It has now dropped to $50,000. That \nrepresents a huge diminishment of the wealth of America. Is it not time \nwe did something for American workers? Who do we represent? Do we not \nrepresent the people of this country? Do we not know we cannot--while \nwe believe in immigration, we respect and admire and love immigrants, \nwe ought to have a lawful system. The number of people who come ought \nnot to be so large that it destabilizes our labor market. Is that not \nthe right policy for a great country to pursue? The American people \nhave begged and pleaded for this system. I believe we ought to give it \nto them.\n\n  Let me sum up one more time here. What we are seeing in the bill \npresented by the majority, and demanding that it pass the Senate today, \nis a bill that just provides money. It does not deal with any of the \npolicy problems in any real way that would end the lawlessness and end \nthe belief by people around the world that if they can just come to the \nUnited States, particularly if they come as a young person, they will \nbe allowed to stay. We have not acted to end this belief in any \neffective way.\n  It could easily be done. We do not need a law to fix that. We have \nlooked at it. Some legal changes could help. But, first of all, the \nPresident needs to act.\n  The House is putting up some money. They are saying it has got to be \nused for some of the things that would be beneficial to ending this \nflow. But even then, we have seen the President does not have to use it \nand does not have to comply with their vision to end immigration into \nAmerica.\n  So the President has set this up. He issued his amnesty documents, \nhis policies, and encouraged more people to come to America. If he does \nthis new Executive order amnesty, it would encourage more adults to \ncome to America. It just will. It will weaken the moral authority of \nall our immigration laws. You cannot take these kinds of actions--as \nsomebody who has been in law enforcement for a long time, you cannot \ntake these actions and think there are not ramifications on them, that \nthere are not impacts throughout the entire world and throughout the \nentire law enforcement community, for our ICE officers and our USCIS \nofficers working every day dealing with hundreds of these cases.\n  You have to have clarity. You have to have integrity. You have to \nhave consistency. You have to mean what you say. You cannot say: I am \nfor strong borders, and I am for legal immigration, and then present a \nbill that is going to do nothing to change the path we are on. It is \nsomething I hope our people will look at and pay attention to it.\n  This bill is going to go down. It is not going to pass. It should not \npass. It will be blocked. It will have no chance to pass in the House \nif it were to get out of the Senate. What I want to say to colleagues \nis: It is indicative of the lack of seriousness from the majority party \nwhen they produce such a poor piece of legislation.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues of one more thing. The only way the \nadministration can run out of money is if it refuses to spend the money \nthat is currently available to it for the border disaster. There is no \nlaw, no regulation preventing the administration from spending money in \nthe current fiscal year. Even the bill they submitted to us, when it \nwas examined, showed it only asked for $25 million for this fiscal \nyear, through September 30. So it is not the kind of crisis we have to \nrush out and pass a bill today, tonight, or the country is going to \nshut down. They can reallocate funds. But what we need is, and what \nCongress needs to do as a representative of the American people, is to \nsay: We are prepared to provide some money, but we need to know, Mr. \nPresident, that you are serious. We need to know, Mr. President, you \nare going to let your officers do their duty and not block them from \ndoing their duty. We need to know, Mr. President, you are not, in a few \nweeks, going to issue a massive administrative amnesty to millions of \npeople who will be given work permits to compete in America for any job \nthat is out there--any job.\n  We need to know where you stand on this. We represent our people. We \ncannot just throw money at this problem, which is what this legislation \ndoes.\n  Let me take a moment to go back and discuss how we got here. We have \nhad the current law basically in effect for a number of years: 5, 6, 7 \nyears. We did not see a spike in entries of young people until the \nPresident issued an Executive order basically legalizing people of \nyouth--up to 30 years of age--who came to America. That was seen around \nthe world as an invitation for young people to come. They have come in \nextraordinary numbers, overwhelming our system.\n  In 2011, it was 6,000. This year it is going to be 90,000. What a \nhuge surge that is. It should never have happened. Now we are reduced \nto being here in the Congress and having the President come to us \ndemanding billions of dollars to fund this program and deal with the \ncrisis his policies created. Because it is true, and has been true, the \nyoung people who come to America turn themselves in to the immigration \nofficers, who then take them to the Health and Human Services officers \nand turn them over to them. They go out and find housing. That is why \nwe have seen this all over the country. Find housing for them. Months \ngo by, or, if anyone comes to pick them up, they are turned over to \nthem. They do not inquire if they are legally here, those who come to \npick them up. They expect no proof that they are related to the child.\n  Maybe it is a 17-year-old. Most of them are older teenagers who pick \nthem up, and they are released on a permiso or bail and they never show \nup. Nobody has the time or the numbers or the capacity to begin to go \nlook and see why they didn't show up in court. But if we get a traffic \nticket and don't show up in court in Alabama, California, Texas, \nsomebody is coming after us.\n  This is the way the system is being collapsed in America today. It is \njust a tragedy. It breaks my heart. The American people have never \napproved of this.\n  So word got out and we had this surge, and now the President, without \nany real plan to fix it, comes forward and says: Give me $4 billion--\nthe bill here I think is $2.7 billion--without any clear commitment or \nproof that we have any plan or any commitment\n\n[[Page S5166]]\n\nfrom his leadership to alter the dynamics of the situation we are in.\n  This is not acceptable. The bill before us now is not acceptable. It \nwill not pass. It will not become law. We need to insist--the American \npeople will continue to insist--that this Congress and this White House \ndo their duty to make sure we have good, sound immigration laws and \nthen ensure they are faithfully and fairly executed to serve the \nnational interests of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad that people have decided to speak \nabout immigration reform.\n  This body passed overwhelmingly--Republicans and Democrats joined \ntogether--a comprehensive immigration bill last year.\n  We did it after six hearings during which we received testimony from \n42 witnesses. We had five markups and 37 hours of debate, often late \ninto the night, over three weeks. There were 212 amendments, of which \n136 were adopted, all but three of them on a bipartisan bases. Staff \nand Senators, Republicans and Democrats, worked together throughout \nthat time, and the Senate, by a better than 2-to-1 margin, passed a \ncomprehensive immigration bill. It was supported by people from the \nright to the left.\n  It went over to the other body. In the other body there were enough \nvotes to pass it. And what happened? The Republican leadership said: \nNo, we will not bring it up. And so it died there.\n  Today, faced with a surge of migrants from Central America, they are \ngiving great speeches: Oh, my God. We have to do something about \nimmigration. Why don't we do something about immigration? And then they \nblame Democratic President Obama.\n  My response is: What are you doing? They could have brought up the \nbill. We would be a lot better off had they brought it up and voted on \nit. Vote yes or vote no. That is what we are supposed to do. The Senate \ndid that, and we passed it.\n  The Republican leadership is so afraid they might actually have to \ntake a stand on immigration. They might actually have to vote yes or \nno. It is so much easier to do nothing, just to let it sit there and \nsay: Oh, it must be President Obama's fault. Oh, it must be the \nSenate's fault. Oh, it must be somebody else's fault. Or maybe it is \nthe fault of these 6- and 7-year-old children who are trying to escape \nbeing killed or molested, the 12-year-old girls who are afraid they are \ngoing to be raped by gangs, the 12-year-old boys who are going to be \nforced into gangs or be shot in front of their families.\n  It is so much easier to say: This is terrible. It has to be President \nObama's fault. Let's sue him.\n  What I say is: Why don't you have the courage to vote yes or no on \nthe immigration bill we sent you?\n  I defy any one of them to go home during August and say: Oh, we have \nto do something about immigration. I hope people ask: How did you vote? \nWell, they didn't vote yes and they didn't vote no. They didn't vote at \nall.\n  I spoke in this Chamber earlier this month about the importance of \nliving up to our own principles and traditions by addressing the influx \nof unaccompanied Central American children because it is a humanitarian \ncrisis.\n  While there is no easy solution, the Border Supplemental \nAppropriations Bill offers a chance to make a downpayment on a strategy \nto address this crisis comprehensively, in accordance with our legal \nobligations and moral values.\n  The supplemental was described by the Appropriations Committee \nchairwoman Senator Mikulski yesterday. We know it is significantly \ndifferent than the bill put forward by the House Republican leadership \nthis week. The House bill provides $1 billion less than the Senate to \nhelp unaccompanied children currently in the United States and $700 \nmillion less to support the Departments of Homeland Security and \nJustice so they can effectively address this issue and adjudicate these \nchildren's cases appropriately.\n  There is nobody in this body or the other body, if they have children \nor grandchildren, who has to worry about them going hungry or has to \nworry about them living in fear every day. Let's get out of our ivory \ntower and pay attention to what is happening.\n  As I said earlier, the House ignored our bipartisan comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill. Thirty pages of policy reforms included in the \nHouse supplemental and all it does is support their enforcement-only \nagenda to get rid of these children. Just throw them out. Let's pretend \nwe have no responsibility. Send them back to face whatever horrors back \nhome.\n  While many of these children and families don't qualify for \ninternational protection and would be better off not risking the \ndangerous journey, which the Senate bill seeks to address, many others \nhave legitimate claims to protection because of the violence and \npersecution they have suffered in their home countries.\n  That is why this is a humanitarian issue. That is why we can't expect \nother countries with far fewer resources--such as Jordan or Turkey or \nEthiopia--to accept far larger numbers of refugees from outside their \nborders if we are not willing to do our part.\n  The little country of Jordan is being overwhelmed by hundreds of \nthousands of refugees from Syria. We say: Oh, thank you for doing that. \nHere we are talking about a tiny percentage compared to the size of our \ncountry. We say we want other countries to do this--but, gosh, the \nwealthiest, most powerful nation in the world can't. That's not who we \nare as Americans.\n\n  That is why it is unconscionable that the House on the one hand \nrecognizes these Central American countries are among the most \ndangerous in the world, where gangs and other violent crime is taking a \nhorrific toll on children and families. They will give speeches on \nthat, but on the other hand they will say: However, that is their \nproblem. Send these children back. Eight-year-old, you can fend for \nyourself against the gangs with machine guns. Go back, and do it as \nquickly as possible because we have to go on recess. We don't want to \nbe bothered about you.\n  That is why it is also unacceptable that the House would pay for \ntheir misguided approach in part by cutting nearly $200 million from \nother programs in the foreign aid budget, the very funding needed to \nhelp reduce poverty, corruption, and violence in Central America so \nchildren won't flee in the first place.\n  Critics of the administration want to point fingers, but blame games \naren't going to solve this problem. There is no single cause. It didn't \noccur overnight. It has been building for years as drug cartels, \nresponding to the insatiable demand for illegal drugs in the United \nStates, have migrated to Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador.\n  It is caused by members of Central American gangs, arrested and \nimprisoned in the United States and then deported, who have resumed \ntheir threats and extortion and killing sprees with a vengeance.\n  It is caused by abusive and corrupt police forces and judges and the \nfailure of the Central American governments to address the lawlessness \nand impunity in their own countries.\n  It is caused by the lack of educational and employment opportunities \nthat are among the reasons Central American youth join the gangs.\n  So let's not play politics over something as complex and deadly as \nthis. Let's vote for the Senate supplemental. It includes the funding \nneeded to begin addressing some of the contributing causes of the \nmigration and leaves intact the important legal protections in the \nTrafficking Victims Protections Act.\n  The $300 million in the State and foreign operations chapter of this \nbill requires a multiyear strategy to support the efforts of Central \nAmerican governments to dismantle their criminal gangs and combat \nextortion, human smuggling and trafficking and domestic and sexual \nabuse, strengthen their social services, law enforcement, and judicial \nsystems, develop child welfare services, and expand programs in \neducation and get rid of the barriers to economic growth and \nopportunity.\n  It also provides funds for public information campaigns to discourage \npotential migrants from making the perilous journey in the first place, \nand it includes provisions that will ensure vigorous oversight of the \naid we provide.\n  The emergency spending in this supplemental is needed to respond \nurgently and responsibly to this crisis. It\n\n[[Page S5167]]\n\nis about what we stand for as Americans. Let's uphold our Nation's \nlongstanding tradition of providing a safe haven for refugees that is \nengraved in the Statue of Liberty, for the well-being of thousands who \nhave fled violence and risked everything to arrive at our borders, and \nfor the millions in Central America who live every day in fear. Let's \ngive them some hope for a better life. Let's pass this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Leahy for his \nextraordinary leadership on this issue. He serves on the Appropriations \nCommittee that has brought us this supplemental appropriation. He is \nalso the chair of the Judiciary Committee.\n  I had the great privilege for a short period of time to serve on the \nJudiciary Committee--too short a period of time--and saw his \nextraordinary leadership. I know it was his committee that brought \ntogether an immigration reform bill that would have dealt with some of \nthe major problems we have in our immigration system. Through great \nwork we got that bill passed in the Senate over 1 year ago.\n  I find it somewhat ironic that in the House they are now talking \nabout how they can change the immigration law while we have a bill that \nis over there. Pass our bill and it would go a long way toward helping \nthis issue.\n  I thank Senator Leahy for his leadership on immigration issues and \nhis passion on the humanitarian issues we have before us.\n  I join Senator Leahy, and I hope the majority of this membership \nwill, in support of the emergency supplemental. I hope we can pass it \ntoday, and I hope our colleagues in the House will also pass it.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski, my colleague from Maryland, for her \nleadership as chair of the Appropriations Committee and bringing \nforward a supplemental appropriation that deals with the humanitarian \ncrisis on our border.\n  We all know about the unaccompanied children on our border. In fiscal \nyear 2014 it will equal 60,000. That is an extraordinary number. But \nlet me make it clear. It is not because of border security issues that \nwe have this problem. When these children approach our border they say: \nWe are here. They are not trying to sneak into the United States. They \nare trying to get to our country and then they turn themselves in. We \nknow most are coming from Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, and we \nknow the circumstances in those three Central American countries.\n  First and foremost, the information they have about the transit and \nwelcome in America is different than reality. The reality is that if \nchildren are transited to our border, they are very likely to be at \ngreat risk, great risk because of the traffickers who could very well \nabuse them--certainly very costly transit--and give them information \nthat is not accurate about the laws of our country.\n  If they make it to our border, what happens is they are put in \ndeportation. There is no right to enter America. We have to evaluate \ntheir circumstance. Those are our immigration laws.\n  First and foremost, we want to make sure the people of Honduras and \nEl Salvador and Guatemala understand the risk factors and that their \nchildren should remain in their country.\n  But the root cause, as Senator Leahy pointed out, is also the current \ncircumstances in these three Central American countries. It is not \nsafe. Too many young people have the choice to either join a gang of \nviolence or themselves be victimized by violence. The economic \ncircumstances in these three countries give little hope for an economic \nfuture for these children. It is in our interests to partner with all \nthree of these countries to deal with the root causes of why parents \nwould put their children in transit to our borders at great risk or why \nfamilies would try to come to America and leave their native country.\n  So it is in our interests to deal with that, and the supplemental \nappropriations bill that is now on the floor provides $300 million of \nhelp that we can use to deal with root causes in the Central American \ncountries. We can make a difference.\n  I will give the dollars for one second. Three hundred million dollars \nmight seem like a lot of money, but it is not the billions we need to \ntake care of the problems on our border as a result of families sending \ntheir children to our border.\n  We can make a difference. Our development assistance programs work. \nThey work. It is part of our national security. We understand that if \nwe have stable countries, it provides a more stable relationship and \nstrategic partnership with us and other countries, helping our national \nsecurity interests, and we can make a difference.\n\n  Let me remind my colleagues that under President George W. Bush, in a \nbipartisan manner in 2003, we passed the PEPFAR law which dealt with \nHIV/AIDS because we recognized the security of the world was being \njeopardized by the spread of HIV/AIDS. And guess what. Our PEPFAR \ninitiative made a huge consequential difference. Today the landscape is \ntotally different than it was just a decade ago. That is because we, \nthe United States, showed leadership.\n  We can show the same kind of leadership in dealing with the root \nproblems in Central America that can make our hemisphere safer--and, by \nthe way, help children and help children of the future who could help \ntheir country and help the global economy. We have programs in these \ncountries. We have the Partnership for Growth as one example in El \nSalvador.\n  But we have to make it consequential. We have to make it \nconsequential to get rid of these gangs, to give economic hope, to deal \nwith good governance. The first step is in this supplemental \nappropriation that provides $300 million of help to these countries. \nThese children at the border require a humanitarian response from the \nUnited States.\n  I have the honor of chairing the U.S. Helsinki Commission. It is \nknown for many things. It is known for standing up for human rights \nglobally.\n  We have talked about America asking the international community to \nhave open borders when there is instability in their community--most \nrecently the problems in Syria. We thank the people of Turkey and the \npeople of Jordan for having open borders so people can find safe \nhavens. We had better take care of our issues at home first.\n  We have humanitarian responsibilities, and this supplemental \nappropriation takes care of that, with $1.2 billion to help human \nservices to deal with adequate shelter for these children so they are \nproperly cared for. That is our responsibility; they have certain \nrights.\n  The majority will be returned to the host country in a safe manner, \nbut there are many who are entitled to asylum. There are many who have \nbeen victimized by the traffickers and are in fear of their life and \nthere is no safe option and have a right to expect our country to reach \nout in a humanitarian way to take care of their needs.\n  This supplemental takes care of that--with moneys for HHS, moneys for \nthe Department of Justice--$124 million to deal with the judges so we \ncan handle these issues in a prompt manner--to deal with adequate legal \nrepresentation.\n  As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, yes, we have to \nimprove our immigration laws. We have already done it. The bill from \nthe Senate is at the House. All they have to do is take up our bill, \npass it, and in a balanced way, representing I think not only the \nphilosophical views of the Congress--which can be a challenge at \ntimes--but representing the views of most Americans.\n  I hope we will support the supplemental bill. I might also add it \nprovides $615 million for wildfires in the West. We know that is an \nemergency, an urgent situation that needs to be dealt with. It provides \nhelp to our ally and friend Israel, $225 million to replenish the \nmissiles that have been used in Iron Dome to shoot down the missiles \ncoming into Israel. It is a well-balanced supplemental. It represents \nthe best interests of this country, and I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n[[Page S5168]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know the Senate is now considering \nwhether we should vote on the motion to proceed to the emergency \nsupplemental bill. That means under our rules of another century we \nactually don't get to the bill. We have a debate or even have a \nfilibuster on whether we should even move to the bill. It was designed \nto cool the passions of the time so the Senate could be the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world. However, these procedures now have been \ndistorted. We are no longer the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld; we are the greatest delaying body in the world. Delay has become \nnot only a tactic to come up with better ideas, delay has become an \noutcome unto itself.\n  We are facing a serious problem in our country, and I hope we would \nvote on the motion to proceed so we could actually get on the \nlegislation for the urgent supplemental funding to deal with three \ncrises facing our country, one of which is wildfires burning in the \nWest, in which property, communities, and livelihoods are being \ndestroyed and first responders are being exhausted. While they are \nbeing exhausted, local and State funds are being exhausted, along with \nthe Forest Service of our own government.\n  We need to stand with our neighbors in these Western States because \nthis is a calamity. The Presiding Officer was the mayor of a great city \nin New Jersey--Newark. He knows what happens when a hurricane hits the \ncity and hits a State. He could tell me and I know he has spoken \nfrequently about how New Jersey is still trying to recover from Sandy.\n  Well, the fires raging in the Western States are their hurricane. It \nis their tornado. It is their Sandy. I hope we would pass the $615 \nmillion to help our own fellow citizens in the 8 Western States.\n  Then we have a treasured ally that is under attack by a terrorist \norganization and needs to defend itself using technology called the \nIron Dome. They defend themselves by shooting interceptor rockets. It \nis not an offensive rocket, shoot to kill, it is shoot to defend. They \nare using up these rockets at an unprecedented rate, and the Secretary \nof Defense sent a letter to the Congress asking for $225 million to be \nable to replenish their arsenal.\n\n  We also have a crisis in Central America and the violence by the \nnarcotraffickers--or the narcoterrorists--that is causing a surge of \nchildren to come into our country. I hope we will pass the legislation \nwhich will allow us to get the money that is needed to address that \nsituation, and I will elaborate on that in a moment.\n  After all is said and done, I hope this will not be another day where \nmore gets said than gets done. We need to respond to the needs that are \npresented to us.\n  I wish to talk about the children at this time. Much has been said on \nthe floor about the current situation, and much has been said about \nPresident Obama's failed immigration policy; we need to give the \nNational Guard police powers.\n  I am proud many Senators went down to the border. I myself went to \nthe border. I went to see the situation, as chair of the Appropriations \nCommittee. No. 1, I wanted to see if there was an urgent need; No. 2, \nwhat would it take to meet that need; and No. 3, how we can work \ntogether on a bipartisan basis to protect the children and protect our \nown country. Well, I got an eyeful, and I have to tell you about it.\n  I traveled with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary \nof HHS, Secretary Burwell, down to the border. We went to the McAllen \nBorder Patrol station. We also went to Lackland Air Force Base, where \nchildren are temporarily housed. I had the opportunity to meet with \ngreat Border Patrol agents, a wonderful faith-based organization that \nis caring for the children, and fantastic young lawyers from the \nUniversity of Texas at Austin campus and St. Mary's Law School. The law \nstudents and professors are there to make sure the kids have legal \nservices on a pro bono basis. They are doing it on their own time. We \nsaw a lot. I also had a chance to talk to the children.\n  First, I will talk about the number of children. There was talk on \nthe floor that made it sound as if we were under siege rather than \nfacing a surge. I think there is a big difference between feeling as if \nwe are under siege and facing a surge. As of this minute, we are \ntalking about 60,000 children. That is a lot of children, but if you \nwent to Baltimore to the Ravens stadium, the Ravens stadium holds \n60,000 people. We are not talking 600,000 or 6 million children; we are \ntalking about 60,000 children. Maybe it will swell to 90,000 children. \nAll 90,000 children could still fit in the new Dallas stadium.\n  We are talking about a number so small that it could fit into an \nAmerican stadium.\n  We are a country with 300 million people. We can certainly deal with \n60,000 children who are fleeing traffickers, drugs, and sexual slavery. \nAre we not big enough, tough enough, and strong enough to be able to \ndeal with that? I think we are. If you could see what has been going \non, you would know what I mean.\n  Let's talk about these 60,000 children. It is literally a children's \nMarch across Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, through Mexico, and \ncoming up the Rio Grande. They are not coming across all 1,900 miles of \nthe border. They are going to a specific area, and they are crossing \nthe river on rafts, swimming, and doing whatever they can to get to the \nborder.\n  It starts like this: The children either come on their own or they \ncome because a smuggler or coyote brings them here. That means some \nmother, father, or aunt in the United States of America, making minimum \nwage, is scraping together the $3,000 to $5,000 the smuggler is \ncharging to deliver--kind of like a FedEx or UPS for human beings--\nthese children to the Rio Grande border. The violence is so bad that \nthey are willing to trust a crook to bring the children to this \ncountry.\n  These children trek through a jungle, through filth and dirt and \ndanger. They stop at what they call safe houses. That is an oxymoron; \nthere is nothing safe about a safe house. There are children with all \nkinds of different people on that road. These people take advantage of \nthe children. I won't describe it.\n  From this safe house, they finally make it to the border by a train \ncalled The Beast. The Beast is a cargo train. This is not a lovely \ntrain that goes up and down our coast from Boston to Savannah. This is \na train called The Beast. The children ride on the top of these trains, \nholding and clutching to each other. I talked to a 9-year-old girl who \nsaid that she rode for 2 days and had to stay awake for 48 hours \nbecause she was worried about falling off and losing an arm or leg or \ndeath itself.\n  Why would children risk this? Why would parents risk this? It is \nbecause of the danger, danger, danger in Central America. We are \ntalking about arming the border more. We need to go after these \ncriminals and arm our law enforcement officers so they can fight the \nnarcotraffickers in Central America. We need to deal with our \ninsatiable appetite for drugs that fuels and is driving this movement.\n  When they send the children back, what are they going to send them \nback to? We are sending them back to countries that are recruiting boys \nto engage in criminal activity, and girls are recruited into human \ntrafficking. It is not as though we are going to send them back on a \nplane and Juan Diaz will be there with yellow roses saying: Welcome \nback, children of Honduras and El Salvador. They will go back to the \nvery danger from which they ran.\n\n  When I went to the McAllen Border Patrol station, which is really a \ndetention facility--it was designed to detain adults--underline that \nword. It was designed to hold up to 300 people, usually illegal \nimmigrants trying to cross the Rio Grande. These really look like \ncells. They are cement cinder block facilities that were designed to \nhold 10 or 12 adults, and they hold as many as 20 or 30 children who \nare sleeping on the floor.\n  The Border Patrol is doing the best they can. The Border Patrol is \ntaking care of children because we can't move them to humanitarian \nfacilities as the law requires. The children are taking turns sitting \non a cement block to even be able to rest. There are 20 or 30 in a room \nsleeping on the floor and using empty water bottles for pillows. They\n\n[[Page S5169]]\n\nhave blankets that look like aluminum foil. These are the lucky ones. \nThey are able to come in from the overfilled outdoor area, where the \nboys are often put in a covered area where they sleep outside. The \ngirls can be ``inside,'' but they are in these holding cells. They have \nvery limited showers and very limited hygiene.\n  The Border Patrol is doing everything they can. It is not something \nwe are used to seeing in the United States.\n  I know there is another codel going to the border. Go, go, go, go. Go \nand see this.\n  I talked to a 12-year-old girl. She was in charge of bringing her 6-\nyear-old sister to the border. Their parents sent them here to escape \nthe gang violence. The mother told the older girl to watch out for her \nyounger sister. They said to her: Don't let her out of your sight until \nyou get to America, and then try to get to your aunt.\n  I talked to a 15-year-old girl from Honduras. Both of her parents had \nbeen killed by gang violence. She worked in a restaurant to save enough \nmoney to pay the coyote. It took her 2 months to get to the United \nStates. She escaped violence along the route to get here.\n  Are you going to send her back? Are you going to send the 6-year-old \nback? Wow.\n  I then had the opportunity to see what the conditions were like for \nthese children. If you talk to the border law enforcement agents, they \nwant to be law enforcement guys. Gee, are they terrific. They know the \nsurge at the border has been caused by the criminal activity here. They \ntalked openly about it. There are seven organized crime syndicates that \nare sparking a lot of this. They know about the false recruitment of \nyoung people who are promised a new way and new day to get to the \nUnited States of America. They know about that, and they want to be \nable to do what they were hired to do--law enforcement. But in order \nfor them to be able to do what they need to do, we have to have the \nfacilities for the children to be housed, clothed, and fed while their \nlegal status is being determined under the law.\n  I went up to Lackland Air Force Base. The children are being cared \nfor in unused dormitories that once housed our Air Force. We have new \nfacilities for our enlisted personnel. Did you know we pay for that? \nThe Department of Health and Human Services has to pay the Department \nof Defense to house those children. It is on a military base with all \nthe rules and regulations associated with that. It is the most \nexpensive housing we have, but it is the best housing we have right now \nbecause of this rejectionist fear that is being promulgated through our \ncountry that somehow or other these children pose a danger to us. It is \nthe best we can do.\n\n  I will say that it is a very nice facility. It is operated by a \nfaith-based organization, the Baptist Conference. My hat is off to \nthem. I speak now as a professionally trained social worker. It is one \nof the most outstanding child welfare service organizations I have \nseen, from the nurses to the social workers.\n  They are doing a fabulous job, but they are under a contract. \nAlthough they are a voluntary, faith-based organization, they are being \ncompensated for their time and services because that is what we should \ndo. We want to be able to use such groups all over America. What was so \nheartwarming to me was that Catholic Charities, based in Oklahoma, came \nto Texas to see what the Baptists were doing because they were getting \nready to take care of the kids. That is the American way--Catholic \nCharities learning from the Baptists.\n  They were all concentrating on the welfare of the children. They know \nthese are all children in God's eyes and should be treated with \ndignity.\n  I then talked to the legal services people--the lawyers, law \nprofessors, law students from the University of Texas at Austin and St. \nMary's College. The services they were providing were on their own time \nand their own dime. They are using their money and their summer \nvacation to help these children. There was no compensation, even for \nexpenses, so they could begin the interview process to determine if any \nof these children had the opportunity to voluntarily return home. It is \nclear the coyotes misled them.\n  Well, we can't keep doing this on this emergency patchwork basis. We \nneed the urgent supplemental, No. 1, to help Homeland Security's law \nenforcement and help Health and Human Services. They need to crack this \nbacklog, and they need to be able to place these children in a proper \nfacility. They need to determine if they have a right to refugee \nstatus.\n  Even when you have volunteer legal services such as the outstanding \nwork I saw in Texas--outstanding. I know the Presiding Officer is a \nlawyer and would have been proud of these volunteers and the way they \nwere responding to these children. They also offered bilingual \nservices. They need more help, for example, from paralegals.\n  They need help to pay for the backlog of cases. We need to make sure \nwe have enough immigration judges.\n  There is so much myth, so much misinformation, and so much distortion \nout there that I am afraid we will end this day and still not have had \na vote to proceed to the urgent supplemental. Debate it, discuss it, \nand then let's vote on it or else it will languish.\n  As a social worker, I want to say that what I have seen these \nchildren go through is unimaginable. They have come here to escape \nviolence and death. They deserve to be treated with compassion and \nintegrity, and they deserve for us to do our job. Anyone who thinks we \nshould just deport these children without giving them every right \nafforded them under our law should go down to McClellan and look into \ntheir eyes and listen to their stories.\n\n  The time to act is now. Let's put together a comprehensive program, \nand I believe we can meet this surge, deal with the root cause, and be \nable to function in a way in which we are all proud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                        Internet Tax Freedom Act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Internet has been possibly the most \nsignificant force driving our economy over the past 16 years. It is \nclearly this century's shipping lane and history's most powerful \ncommunications tool. Part of the reason the Internet has revolutionized \nAmerican life is that it has been protected from discriminatory \ntaxation, thanks to the Internet Tax Freedom Act, first enacted 16 \nyears ago.\n  This law, as we might expect, is extraordinarily popular among the \nAmerican people, and it has obviously been of enormous importance to \nthe millions of families and businesses that use the Internet each day.\n  However, in a few short months the Internet Tax Freedom Act is set to \nexpire. If it does, millions of American Internet users could face \nmultiple and discriminatory taxes from thousands of state and local tax \ncollectors around the country. That cannot be allowed to happen. \nCongress needs to come together on a bipartisan basis and say clearly: \nDon't hit the Internet with discriminatory taxation.\n  Sixteen years ago I was the author of the Internet Tax Freedom Act, \nalong with our former Republican colleague, Congressman Chris Cox. \nAlong with our colleague from South Dakota, Senator Thune, and 52 \nbipartisan cosponsors, I am the author of the pending bill that would \nmake that protection permanent. I believe if we were able to hold a \nvote on our bill today, it would pass with overwhelming support. \nUnfortunately, that is not a political reality. Yet the clock keeps \nticking toward expiration.\n  Protecting the Internet and every Internet user in our country ought \nto be a matter that takes precedence over politics and partisanship. \nThe Senate can move this short-term extension today while the Senate \nworks on a bipartisan basis to deal with the issues raised by those who \nbelieve that allowing localities to collect taxes across the country is \nmore important than a ban on discriminatory taxation.\n  I hope the Senate will join me in supporting the temporary extension \nof the Internet Tax Freedom Act as a bridge to permanent legislation.\n  To reflect very briefly for a minute, we thought this law would work \nwell 16 years ago. To describe what triggered my interest, 16 years \nago, when I was a young Member of this body and I had a full head of \nhair and rugged good looks, we would hear for example about how if \nsomeone bought the newspaper--the online edition of the paper--they \nwould face a stiff tax in some jurisdictions,\n\n[[Page S5170]]\n\nbut if they bought the snail mail edition they wouldn't face the tax. \nDemocrats and Republicans coming together said that is discriminatory. \nThat is discriminating against technology, against the future, against \nthe promise of the Internet.\n  We thought this proposal would work well. It is quite clear. We just \nhave to make sure what we do online is not more burdensome and an \nendeavor that involves more taxes than what we do offline. That is what \nthe bill has been all about. So we thought it would be promising, but \nit has far exceeded our expectations in terms of what it has done to \npromote innovation and for small businesses and others who don't have \npolitical action committees and don't have big lobbies advocating for \nthem. Ensuring they are not hammered by multiple and discriminatory \ntaxes by thousands of localities has been a lifeline in terms of their \nbeing successful.\n  I could take more time this morning. We have colleagues and of course \nmany matters still to deal with before we leave. I hope that given this \nhistory, which has been a bipartisan history--I so enjoyed working with \nour former colleague Chris Cox on this legislation 16 years ago. My \ntake is that the overwhelming number of Senators would like to \npermanently reauthorize this ban on multiple and discriminatory taxes \non the Internet today, and that is what Senator Thune and I have sought \nto do in our legislation, which has more than half of the Senate \ncosponsoring it. That is not possible today. But what is possible is \nthat we act now so we don't bump up against that deadline that if \nreached our small businesses are subject--we have more than 5,000 \ntaxing jurisdictions, and if even a small number of them were to \ninflict discriminatory taxes on Internet commerce, that would be a big \nblow in a fragile economy.\n  So for purposes of the temporary extension of the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act as a bridge to permanent legislation, let us say loudly and \nclearly that we as a body--we as the U.S. Senate--are not going to \nhammer the Internet with multiple and discriminatory taxes.\n  I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Veterans Health Care\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I rise today to urge support for a \nsuccessful veterans health care program that will be extended if we \npass this bipartisan package of Veterans Affairs reforms.\n  My colleague across the aisle Senator Heller and I have joined to \nintroduce legislation to extend the Assisted Living Program for \nVeterans with Traumatic Brain Injury, or AL-TBI, and give it the kind \nof support veterans with these severe brain injuries deserve.\n  I am grateful for the leadership of Senator Heller and his \npartnership on this very important critical issue. I am proud to work \nwith him, and I am hopeful all of our colleagues will join to pass the \nbipartisan package of VA reforms which now includes our legislation.\n  I thank Senator Sanders, Ranking Member Burr, along with Senators \nMcCain, Pryor, Murkowski, Landrieu, Johanns, and Baldwin for joining \nwith us in this important effort.\n  This program places veterans suffering from moderate to severe \ntraumatic brain injury, or TBI, in privately run facilities where they \nreceive 24-hour team-based attention.\n  These are our veterans who stood for us, who answered the call to \nservice, who went into harm's way, and have suffered traumatic brain \ninjury, who now need to get the kind of care and attention they \ndeserve.\n  They are immersed in this therapy that helps them with their \nmovement, their memory, their speech, their gradual community \nintegration. That last point is actually the key. This program does not \njust prepare veterans for transition from one health care setting to \nanother health care setting; it is about giving them the practical \nskills they need to return to their communities and live independently.\n  That is what is so special about this program.\n  This is the kind of innovative work that Senator Heller stands for in \nhis community and I in New Jersey and that all of our veterans across \nthe country should have. Congress should support this kind of work more \noften.\n  This past week I had the opportunity to visit a facility in \nPlainsboro, NJ--one of several facilities using this program. While I \nwas there, I spoke with an incredible veteran named Gary.\n  Gary first enlisted in the military and completed his tour in the \nNavy after graduating from high school. Then 9/11 happened, and Gary \nstood up, reenlisted, this time with the National Guard, and served in \nIraq.\n  During his time there he suffered a traumatic brain injury. Upon \nreturn home, Gary was confined to a wheelchair and the doctors told him \nhe would never ever walk again. But then he began treatments through \nthis program that Senator Heller, myself, and others are trying to \nextend.\n  Now, because of this program, Gary can walk again. He, himself, and \nhis family called it a miracle. He is now using a cane. When he is \nindoors he can walk without assistance.\n  Gary's sister told me that before receiving this unique care through \nthe program, Gary was very negative, often depressed, often angry. But \nnow that he has made progress, Gary's whole attitude has changed. He is \nmore than upbeat. He is social and enjoys cooking. In fact, he offered \nto cook me a meal, which, I say to Senator Heller, as a bachelor, I \ntake all the meals I can get.\n  Another veteran named Duane sustained a traumatic brain injury in \n2003 while serving our country in the Navy. Unable to live \nindependently or get around without the aid of a wheelchair, this \ngentleman, this honorable veteran, who was not even 25 years old, found \nhimself living in a nursing home alongside a population many decades \nhis senior.\n  In 2011, through this program in our legislation, his life was \nchanged. He moved into a specialized facility in New Jersey, where he \nstill lives today and receives a range of treatments, including \nphysical, occupational, speech therapies, as well as psychological \ncounseling and residential assistance.\n  He is making incredible progress. I saw it with my own eyes, heard it \nfrom his family and his care workers. He has actually also traded his \nwheelchair for a cane and manages a regime of his own chores, adding \nmore dignity to his already exemplary life of courage. He has an active \nsocial life. He has friends and comrades, and he believes he has a \ncountry that has been there for him when he is in need.\n  These are the heroes who stepped up to serve our country when we \nneeded them most, and now it is our responsibility to serve them with \nthe extension of this incredible program.\n  This program means independence for these veterans with severe brain \ninjuries. We cannot cut their or any other veterans' care short. This \nis a cost of war. We should not just be there to spend resources when \nwe are sending them off; we should be there with open arms and support \nwhen we are welcoming them home.\n  The VA now offers no alternative program to the one I have \ndescribed--no alternative program--that provides the same kind of \ncomprehensive, rehabilitative, long-term care in a residential setting. \nThese brave men and women who are benefiting from this specialized care \nwere willing to put their lives on the line for our country. It should \nnot be an option; it should be our obligation to take care of them when \nthey return home.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to do their duty, to pass \nthis reform package, and extend this life-changing program.\n  I want to again thank Senator Heller.\n  If I may yield to him, he has been a stalwart partner, a leader on \nthis issue. I have been encouraged by this opportunity to work together \nwith him. I am only disappointed that he would not shave his head, as I \nhave. That would have shown true bipartisan camaraderie. But despite \nthat, I look forward to his continued leadership on issues for our \nveterans, and now I look forward to his remarks.\n\n[[Page S5171]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, let me begin, if I may, by thanking my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Booker, for partnering with me on this \ncritical piece of legislation that helps our Nation's veterans, \nespecially those suffering from traumatic brain injuries. I would urge \nhim to participate in that meal from that veteran. I assure the Senator \nthat in this city where the food is so rich, he will probably find the \nmeal much healthier--much healthier. I know that is important to the \nSenator. Having said that, I know that Senator Booker and I have always \nviewed veterans issues to be truly a bipartisan issue. I am pleased we \nwere able to work together and we were able to accomplish this work as \npartners.\n  I would also like to applaud my other colleagues, Senators Sanders, \nMcCain, and Burr, for their work on the conference report, and also \nHouse Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Miller and the rest of the \nconference members for reaching an agreement to ensure that Congress \nkeeps its promise to our Nation's veterans.\n  The conference committee's bill is a good start to address problems \nwith appointment wait times, VA scheduling practices, accountability, \nand overall quality of care provided at VA's medical facilities.\n  As my colleague Senator Booker discussed, there is a very critical \nprovision in the conference report legislation that he and I took a \nlead on addressing; and that is the extension of the Assisted Living \nProgram for Veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury. I applaud my friend. \nI applaud my colleague for the ability and the opportunity to work \ntogether. So I thank him for that.\n\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs' Committee, I was eager to \nresolve this issue because of its impact on Nevada's and our Nation's \nveterans, and together we were proud partners.\n  This program operates in two locations in Nevada and serves wounded \nwarriors who are trying to restore their quality of life.\n  As the battlefield has changed over the years, so have the injuries \nthat servicemembers and veterans sustain, including traumatic brain \ninjuries. TBI is a complicated injury to treat because the effects can \nbe both mental and physical--from headaches, dizziness, and irritation, \nall the way to speech difficulties, visual impairment, loss of memory, \nand severe depression.\n  Every traumatic brain injury is different, which is why some veterans \nneed more advanced care to rehabilitate and regain their full \nindependence.\n  That is why Congress created the assisted living TBI pilot program in \n2008. Under that program, veterans can access a full range of \nrehabilitation services in a residential setting, including physical \ntherapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and other activities to \nprepare veterans to return home and live a productive life.\n  When I found out the program would be expiring and the VA was \nprepared to start kicking veterans out, I teamed up with Senator Booker \nto introduce legislation to extend authorization of this program for \nanother 3 years.\n  At a time when the VA is facing a health care crisis and access to \ntimely care, it would have been unacceptable to let this critical \nprogram expire, leaving veterans in Nevada without a comparable \nalternative to treating this serious injury.\n  I wish to thank the conference committee for listening to us when we \nexpressed the urgency of extending this program so veterans could \ncontinue receiving residential rehabilitation. I am also pleased the \nconference committee provided a 3-year extension so veterans can have \nthe certainty that this program will remain in place for the next few \nyears.\n  I also wish to thank Representative Cassidy from Louisiana for his \nwork in pushing this issue in the House of Representatives, as well as \nthe veterans service organizations that fought alongside of us for this \nextension. It is our responsibility in Congress to ensure veterans \nacross this Nation receive timely and quality care from the Veterans' \nAdministration. Senator Booker and I share this commitment.\n  I am pleased we were able to work together to get our legislation \ninto the final compromise. As the Senate prepares to vote on final \npassage of this critical VA reform bill, I hope my colleagues recognize \nthe importance of this compromise bill at a time when veterans are \nlosing faith in the VA system and need certainty that Congress will be \nthere to provide oversight, accountability, and legislative action to \napprove the care they receive from the Nation they sacrificed for and \nserved.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Unemployment Insurance Benefits\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I come to the floor today to once again \npress for action on my bipartisan legislation to restore emergency \nunemployment benefits. Over 3.5 million Americans have lost benefits \nsince the program expired last December. The need to help these \nindividuals, their families, and the economy remains compelling to all \nof us.\n  In April, Senator Heller and I were able to draft a bipartisan bill, \nand with the help of many of our colleagues, the Senate acted to \nrestore these benefits. Unfortunately, the House Republican leadership \nhas refused to take up the Senate-passed bill or consider their own \nproposal. While the President has occasionally talked a good game about \nthe need to extend this aid to job seekers, it has never been made a \n``must have'' by the administration. Indeed, it is hard to understand \nwhy an extension of these benefits was not included in the President's \nsupplemental appropriations request.\n  So as we consider this supplemental appropriations bill this week, \nwhich includes critically important emergency funding measures, it is \nsomewhat disheartening that extending unemployment insurance, another \nemergency need, has once again been ignored.\n  In the past 6 months, the national unemployment rate has dropped from \n6.7 to 6.1 percent. The long-term unemployment rate has dropped just \nbelow 2 percent. It is great to see these positive strides in our \neconomy. But I strongly disagree with those who would argue that these \nsigns of improvement suggest that emergency benefits are no longer \nneeded. Let me underscore a few reasons why emergency unemployment \nbenefits are still necessary.\n  First, while the long-term unemployment rate has dropped from 2.3 \npercent in January to just under 2 percent in June, the current level \nis still significantly higher than at any other point when emergency \nbenefits were allowed to expire. In June 2008, under President George \nW. Bush, when the long-term unemployment rate was just 1 percent, a \nsupermajority of Members in both Chambers voted to create emergency \nunemployment insurance benefits for the long-term unemployed. That was \nat 1 percent.\n  Now we are about twice that. Today our long-term unemployment rate of \nabout 2 percent means over 3 million Americans are out of work through \nno fault of their own, and have been searching for work for more than 6 \nmonths. These individuals are struggling. With each passing month, \ntheir financial situation becomes increasingly dire. They should not be \nheld to a different standard than those who were searching for work in \n2008.\n\n  Second, the long-term unemployed are still struggling mightily to \nfind work. According to a recent report by economists at the Federal \nReserve, when you look at the likelihood that someone will find a job \nin a given month, the rate for the long-term unemployed is roughly the \nsame as it was at the height of the great recession several years ago. \nIn fact, someone who is long-term unemployed is almost twice as likely \nto stop looking for work altogether and fall out of the labor force as \nthey are to get a job.\n  These difficulties in finding work are persistent across educational \nlevels and age groups, although they are much more pronounced among the \nAfrican-American and Latino communities. So we are seeing people who \nare trying very hard to find work but they are facing the same \nobstacles they were facing at the height of the great recession.\n  Again, I think this underscores the need to help these people. Some \nhave\n\n[[Page S5172]]\n\nargued that the improvement in the labor market is driven by Congress's \nfailure to extend emergency benefits. According to this argument, \ntaking away unemployment insurance benefits pushes people to step up \ntheir job search. I find this argument very difficult to accept when \nyou face people back in my home State of Rhode Island who have been \nlooking desperately, in a situation where there are usually three, \nfour, five, six applicants, in some cases, for every job. They are \nlooking and looking and looking. In Rhode Island, our unemployment rate \nis tied for the highest in the Nation. It is not the position we want \nto be in.\n  To suggest that these people are not desperately searching for work \nreally sort of, I think, demeans them unnecessarily. We all know, \nbecause we go home. There are people who have been looking. They are \nskilled. They are talented. They have worked for 20 years. They want to \nwork. Getting the $300 a week, perhaps, in benefits is nothing like the \nsalary they commanded. It will not, in the long term, pay for their \nmortgage, pay for their children's education, pay for the necessities \nof life. They know that. They are in a desperate situation. This \nassistance helps a little bit.\n  Not only the contact we have with our constituents but recent \nresearch also demonstrates that this argument is flawed, that ``just \ncut off the benefits and everybody goes right back to work.''\n  We can use North Carolina to test the impact of cutting benefits, \nbecause that State took steps in July 2013 to terminate unemployment \nbenefits for anyone who has been out of work for 20 weeks or more. If \nopponents of extending unemployment insurance are correct, North \nCarolina's policy change should have led to significantly sharp \ndeclines in its unemployment rate.\n  A recent article in the New York Times by Justin Wolfers, an \neconomist with the University of Michigan and the Brookings \nInstitution, explores evidence from North Carolina to assess this \nclaim. According to his research, when North Carolina is compared with \nother Southern States that did not cut their programs, North Carolina's \neconomic growth ``looks quite similar to its peers, and certainly not \nbetter.'' The levels of job growth in North Carolina are similar to \nneighboring States such as South Carolina that did not change their \nprograms. Dr. Wolfers concludes that, ``There's simply no evidence . . \n. that cutting benefits cuts unemployment.''\n  Others have argued that cutting UI at the State level will save money \nand help the economy of the States. In response, eight States decreased \nthe number of weeks an individual could receive State-level \nunemployment insurance benefits. However, a recent report from the \nEconomic Policy Institute suggests these States did not save \nsignificant amounts of money or boost employment. This is further \nevidence that cutting UI benefits is simply not a good idea.\n  The refusal by House Republicans to renew unemployment insurance \nbenefits does not just hurt individuals and families for each week they \ndo not get this modest support. The effects are more far reaching, with \nresearch suggesting that the long-term unemployed will be hurt for \ndecades to come.\n\n  According to research by a senior economist at the Federal Reserve \nBank of Boston, ``workers unemployed for more than 26 weeks experience \na much larger negative income effect and have lower earnings even after \n10 or 15 years than those workers that experienced shorter-duration \nunemployment spells.''\n  Many are forced to rack up debt on their credit cards just to meet \nbasic level needs.\n  A recent Gallup poll also shows that nearly 20 percent of individuals \nwho were unemployed for 12 months have been treated for depression. \nThis is a serious blow not just to your economic well-being but to your \nidentity, to your sense of worth, to your sense of being able to help \nyour family and provide for your family. These effects are long term \nand very serious\n  This rate of depression is twice as high as for those who have been \nunemployed for just a few weeks. So there is, apparently, a \ncorrelation.\n  The impact is far-reaching for individuals, their families, and the \neconomy as a whole. It undercuts, again, the notion that there is no \ncost or that there is some benefit to cutting these benefits. There is \na long-term cost.\n  One of the aspects too, is in order to qualify for these benefits, \nyou have to be actively searching for work. Without these benefits, the \nincentive to look for work is, in some respects, diminished. Indeed, \nother phenomena take place: the lack of resources, the increasing \ndesperation and depression.\n  Again, it is encouraging to see that there are signs of economic \nimprovement. It is encouraging to see that some of the long-term \nunemployed have found jobs. We dipped below that 2-percent level.\n  But that does not mean we should turn our backs on those who are \nstill looking. That does not mean we should treat them differently than \nwe did people in 2008 in the same position in a difficult economy \nlooking for work. Those of us who continue to fight for the long-term \nemployed--I must also say that Senator Heller in this effort has been a \nstalwart. We have heard lots of excuses and a lot of discussion, in my \nview, of flawed arguments about how we should abandon the program, and, \nmore pointedly, abandon these people. I don't think we should.\n\n  What is certain in terms of analysis is the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office estimates that our failing to renew this program last \nDecember will cost over the course of this year 200,000 jobs. And this \nemergency aid helps families make ends meet until they find work.\n  One of the great ironies here is that in refusing to extend these \nbenefits, we basically shut down 200,000 jobs in this country. It is \nalmost absurd. It is a catch-22: We are shutting the doors on the \nunemployed so we can get them to work, but yet the analysts will tell \nus that if we had extended benefits, we would have gained 200,000 jobs.\n  Why? Because these payments go right back into the economy. Someone \nwho is unemployed is going to take that modest check, about $300, $350, \nand pay the phone bill so they can call about work, they are going to \nget the car repaired so they can get to the job interview, and they are \ngoing to do the things they have to do to help their children get \nthrough the day. They are not going to save it or buy French \nimpressionist paintings. They are going to go right into the local \neconomy and spend the money.\n  For many reasons this is why I think we have to do it. That is why \nSenator Heller and I have filed an amendment to this emergency \nappropriations bill, on a bipartisan basis. The amendment will be the \nsame as we have proposed previously, except for offsets, because for \nthe second time offsets we have identified to pay for an extension of \nbenefits have been used for another measure. I guess we must take some \nsatisfaction that we have developed offsets for restoring emergency \nunemployment insurance and then another program grabs them and it gets \npassed here. But I would rather have the extension of benefits too.\n  So we are moving forward. I hope we can. I am committed to fighting \nfor these American workers so they won't be left behind now and in the \nyears to come.\n  Madam President, I encourage my colleagues to join us.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Border Security\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to talk about the crisis at our \nsouthern border and the need for unified action to deal with it and the \nneed to come together on a commonsense enforcement approach that \nundoubtedly will need some additional resources, but also clearly \ndemand some changes to the current law so we may quickly deal with the \nneed to quickly deport folks illegally coming over our Mexican border \nback to their home country.\n  In the case of alien children, we need to get them out of the hands \nof criminal gangs and reunite them with their families in their home \ncountry. That is an obvious need in the eyes of the American people. I \nthink a vast majority of Americans realize we need that\n\n[[Page S5173]]\n\nsort of approach which starts with much better enforcement of our \nsouthern border, and, yes, if people do get across, they need to \nquickly deal with their situation and quickly and effectively deport \nthem. That is the approach we need. Sadly, that is not what the \nPresident has proposed, and that is not what Harry Reid is even \nallowing us to vote on on the Senate floor.\n  For a couple of weeks, at least, after this crisis hit the first page \nof the newspaper, President Obama constantly pointed to those parts of \nthe law that he said tie his hands in terms of quickly and effectively \ndeporting some of these individuals. He pointed to the 2008 changes of \nthe law over and over and over again. The problem is that a couple of \nweeks after that--when he actually sent a proposal to Congress to deal \nwith the crisis--any mention of that was gone. There was no suggestion \nof any change in the law in that regard or any other regard. The only \nrequest he made was for $3.7 billion--a huge amount of additional \nmoney. The great majority of that money is to feed, house, and relocate \nthese illegal aliens, including unaccompanied alien children, within \nour own country.\n  The problem with that is it will encourage this flow of illegal \nimmigrants into our country and this problem will continue to grow. It \nwill not discourage it and it will not end it. We need that \ncomprehensive approach--including necessary changes to the law and \nenforcement--to quickly deport these folks to their home countries and \nreunite them with their families.\n  In the absence of the President leading us in that regard, I came up \nwith my own legislation. I introduced it in the Senate, and I have now \nintroduced it as a floor amendment to the spending bill which Senator \nReid is bringing to the Senate floor. It would change the aspects of \nthe law that we need to change in order to streamline the process and \nallow us to quickly deport individuals within 72 hours so they can be \nsafely reunited with their families in their home country. That is the \nonly thing that will stem this increased tide, this increasing flow, \nand this increasing problem.\n  There has also been a lot of debate about the resources that are \nnecessary and the increased spending that is clearly necessary. But \nbefore we pass the President's proposal, we need to marry it with these \nenforcement measures and these changes to the law. We need to pay for \nthat enforcement and deportation and not simply pay to feed and house \nthese illegal aliens within our country. We need to actually relocate \nthem to other places within our country with no foreseeable end in \nsight. We can't do that unless we get the right enforcement measures.\n  I also have suggestions on how we can help pay for whatever increased \nenforcement, border security, and quick deportation we need. I have two \nsuggestions in particular. I have two specific bills which I introduced \nsome time ago in the Senate. I introduced each of these bills this week \nas amendments to the spending bill that Harry Reid is bringing to the \nSenate floor.\n  One is S. 1176, which is a freestanding bill, but I also introduced \nit as a floor amendment. It is called the Remittance Status \nVerification Act of 2013. What is this about? This is about remittances \nby illegal aliens in this country and how they are sending money back \nto families and others in their home country.\n  The GAO--which is a respected nonpartisan organization--previously \nnoted that the United States is the largest remittance-sending country \nin the world, with the majority of funds being sent to Latin America \nand the Caribbean and substantial amounts of money also being sent to \nAsia and Africa.\n  In the past 10 years the total number of international remittances \nhas increased by 8 percent in 2013, and is expected to grow 10.1 \npercent in 2014 and 10.7 percent in 2015. It is reaching an \nastronomical number. In 2015, it will be over half a trillion dollars.\n  If folks are working in this country legally, that is fine. We don't \nwant to hassle them or make any problems for them. But, clearly, a \nsignificant portion of the folks we are talking about are here \nillegally and working illegally. That is wrong, and we need the \nlegislation I am proposing to fix that, with four important goals in \nmind.\n  First of all, we need to see if the folks who are sending these \nremittances are here illegally; second, we need to ensure U.S. taxpayer \nfairness; third, we need to address inaccurate U.S. data on remittances \nand collect all the facts; and, fourth, we need to make sure that \nillegal aliens who are receiving U.S. benefits are--we need to see if \nthey are remitting higher amounts abroad.\n  My legislation would address all of these goals and would \nfundamentally get a handle on the situation and make sure that those \nwho are not in this country legally pay a substantial fee, and that fee \nwould be used on border security and other immigration enforcement. \nThat could grow a significant amount of revenue specifically dedicated \nto border and other enforcement.\n  The second proposal I have is in the form of other freestanding \nlegislation, which I also introduced this week as a Senate floor \namendment for the supplemental appropriations bill. It is about child \ntax credits. This amendment addresses a clear loophole in the IRS code \nthat allows illegal aliens to access income-tax-based benefits, such as \nthe child tax credit and the additional child tax credit.\n  According to the Treasury Department's inspector general--again, this \nis not some partisan Republican source, it is the Obama \nadministration's inspector general for Treasury. They issued a report \nrecently that said $4.2 billion--with a B--is sent each year to folks \nwho are probably here illegally and do not qualify under these \nprograms. We send them a check, a refundable tax credit, and it costs \nthe taxpayers $4.2 billion.\n  As the inspector general has said, there is a pretty simple way to \nfix this by requiring a valid Social Security number or other \nappropriate identification number. This approach is straightforward, it \nis simple, and it will fix the problem. It would cut down the $4.2 \nbillion--with a B--worth of spending that we are sending improperly and \nillegally to largely illegal aliens and illegal alien families. We can \nuse those resources, instead, on enforcement.\n  Those are simply two specific suggestions that I filed this week in \nthe form of Senate floor amendments that could help raise the \nadditional resources we need to address this issue.\n  Again, I want to emphasize that we need to do a number of things, and \nit is not all about throwing money at the situation, particularly when \nmost of that money under President Obama's proposal is simply to house \nand feed these folks who are here illegally and then distribute them \nthroughout the country for an indefinite period of time. Fundamentally, \nwe need to marry that with real enforcement measures, including those \naddressed and listed in my bill. I hope we take that approach. I hope \nSenator Reid allows that debate and allows those votes. Right now he is \nlying across the tracks. The only thing he is allowing a vote on is \nthis spending measure which just gives the President a blank check. \nThat will not solve the problem. That is not the correct response. We \nneed to do all of the things, broadly speaking, I have laid out. I hope \nwe do that and come together--as, in fact, the American people have--\naround my commonsense approach with a clear consensus.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, relinquish the floor, and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I wish to speak about health insurance. \nWe notice that nationally and back in our States, the angst over the \nAffordable Care Act--often derisively referred to as ObamaCare--has \nsubsided. In part, that has occurred because more people are being \ncovered. As a matter of fact, in the first tranche of signups of people \nwho did not have insurance, over 8 million people--which exceeded the \ngoal of 7 million--by the time the cutoff came for signing earlier this \nyear, over 8 million people had signed up. And that was just a narrow \npopulation of those who wanted insurance\n\n[[Page S5174]]\n\nbut could not afford it. Then they had it available through the State \nexchanges or the Federal exchange in the States.\n  Another part of the population that did not have health care was \npeople who were actually in a low-income situation; therefore, there \nwas no chance they could afford it. That is why we expanded Medicaid in \nthe Affordable Care Act to up to 138 percent of poverty, which is a \nvery low level of income. I believe, if I remember correctly, for a \nfamily of four, it is somewhere around $32,499 of annual income. Well, \nwe can imagine that with a family of four, people can't even think \nabout having the money to provide health insurance with that kind of \nlimited income, and that brings them up to 138 percent of poverty.\n  The only part of the Affordable Care Act, since it was declared by \nthe Supreme Court as constitutional--the only part that was struck down \nas unconstitutional was the part of the law that was mandating upon the \nStates to expand Medicaid, which is funded by a State and Federal joint \nprogram, up to 138 percent. So it made it voluntary. Well, half of the \nStates have expanded it and about half of the States have refused, such \nas my State of Florida. The Republican Governor and the Republican \nlegislature, not wanting to have anything to do with what they were \ncondemning as ObamaCare, refused to expand Medicaid in Florida and \nthereby refused to give health care to a population, if my colleagues \ncan believe this, of 1.2 million people in Florida--people who would \nhave had health care but do not get it because the State legislature \nand the Governor refused to raise the level.\n  By the way, that was taking Floridians' Federal taxpayer dollars of \n51 billion over the next several years that were allocated for that \npurpose and refusing to accept them for the health care of poor \nFloridians, over 1 million people. That seems unconscionable.\n  This stuff is so complicated. People don't realize that in large part \nthat is, in fact, what happened over the course of the last two \nlegislative sessions--that they could have expanded health care in \nFlorida, and it is Floridians' tax dollars they are giving away instead \nof letting that apply to health care for Floridians.\n  Nationwide, if I recall correctly, it was somewhere around another \n6.7 million people were brought on with the expansion of Medicaid even \nthough States such as Florida were refusing to expand it, and that is \nin addition to getting health care to those who could afford it with \nsubsidies or because of better rates could afford it in the first \nplace. That was a group of another 8 million.\n  We can see we are starting to chip away at that group of people in \nthe country who had no health care because they had no health \ninsurance. Yet, when they got sick, where did they end up? They ended \nup in the emergency room. They couldn't pay. Of course, now it was an \nemergency because they had no preventive health care. And since they \ncouldn't pay, who do my colleagues think pays? All the rest of us pay \nin our insurance premiums. It is estimated that in a State such as \nFlorida, for the average family health insurance policy, people are \npaying upwards of $800 to $1,000 of their premiums per year just to \ntake care of the group who ended up in the emergency room because they \ndidn't have any health care. That is part of what the Affordable Care \nAct was intended to do.\n  Another part of the Affordable Care Act was to save Medicare from \ngoing into bankruptcy. Back in the early part of the last decade, we \npassed a nice-sounding law called the prescription drug bill. As its \nname suggests, it was to provide prescription drugs for senior \ncitizens. Omitted in the explanation of it was that not only were \npeople paying premium prices that the government had always gotten as a \ndiscount, but now the government was paying a premium price with no \ndiscount for all the drugs under Medicare. But a part of that was \nsetting up Medicare being delivered by an insurance company with a \nfancy name called Medicare Advantage.\n  Always before, if we were going to deliver Medicare through a health \nmaintenance organization--an HMO, which is an insurance company--one \nwould expect it would bring the costs down per person. That is how it \nstarted out--about 95 percent of the per-person cost in Medicare, \nregular Medicare fee-for-service. But, no, in the prescription drug \nbill, this was turned upside down. Now they were going to offer \nMedicare through an HMO, but the reimbursement from Medicare was going \nto be 14 percent above Medicare fee-for-service per person, reimbursed \nto the insurance company at 114 percent of Medicare fee-for-service. As \na result of that, Medicare was going broke.\n  That was another reason for the ACA--to stop Medicare from going \nbroke by winnowing down that 14 percent and giving incentives to the \ninsurance companies to do what ought to be the goal, which was quality \nof care instead of just paying a dollar percentage value per patient. \nThus, we have the re-created Medicare Advantage, and it is being rated \non its quality so that seniors can vote with their feet by going to the \nbetter rated insurance plans in Medicare Advantage.\n  Why am I retracing all of this? To get to this point: For this next \nround of Medicare Advantage, we are just getting to the point of having \nthe insurance companies announce their rates. Some of them are going to \ngo up. Some of them are going to go down.\n\n  But I want the people of Florida to know that 2 years ago in their \nState legislature they took away the legal power of the insurance \ncommissioner of Florida to approve the rate hikes. They took that away. \nI happen to understand something about this. Before I came to the \nSenate, I was the elected insurance commissioner of Florida, and I \njealously guarded the ability to approve rate increases and decreases \nin order to protect the insurance consumer. The Florida Legislature \nstripped that ability of the insurance commissioner--now appointed, not \nelected--in Florida. Therefore, if they see rate hikes for Medicare \nAdvantage in this next round just about to be announced--they took the \nability of the State regulator to limit the rate hikes. That sounds \nunconscionable. It certainly does. Every year insurance companies are \ngoing to try to raise their rates. It is the job of a State regulator \nto regulate what happens to those rates. So the Florida Legislature \nlast year passed senate bill 1842, and one of the things it did is it \nstripped the Office of Insurance Regulation of one of its chief \nresponsibilities--regulating health insurance rates. That is after \nFlorida had had some of the strongest laws governing insurance, and \nthat was the case when I was insurance commissioner 15 years ago, where \nI could not only approve rates but I could reject rate increases.\n\n  Well, we saw this at the time a year ago. I contacted the Governor \nand urged him to veto the bill, but, sadly, it is the law of Florida. \nTherefore, that is why I come to the floor today, because I am \ndisappointed in the news reports that are starting to say that these \nrate increases in Florida are being blamed on the Affordable Care Act. \nThey are being blamed on ObamaCare.\n  Well, the insurance commissioner used to have an opportunity to look \nat those rates and say they were not right and to stop those rate \nincreases or to give a rate increase that was actuarially sound. Not \nany more. There were a lot of other things that had been done in our \nState of Florida to stop the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. \nFirst of all, our State refused to accept a planning grant in order to \nget ready for the Affordable Care Act before it was ever starting to be \nimplemented.\n  I have already told you about refusing to expand Medicaid to cover \nmore than an additional million people in Florida who otherwise would \nnot get health care.\n  What was the purpose of the ACA other than trying to save Medicare--\nwhich it has done--financially from disaster? It was to help make \ninsurance coverage available and affordable. There were provisions in \nthere, technical terms like ``medical loss ratio,'' that said that an \ninsurance company had to give 80 percent of the premium dollar back in \nhealth care instead of giving it off to CEOs' salaries and executive \nperks; and if they did not, what the insurance company had to do--if \nthey did not get 80 percent of the premium dollar back in health care \nto the patient--they had to return that part in refunds.\n  I can tell you that, happily, that law is working. One million \nFloridians last\n\n[[Page S5175]]\n\nyear received over $41 million in refunds. It was an average of $65 per \nfamily. Why? Because some insurance companies did not spend enough on \nmedical care for their policyholders.\n  Another part that we had talked about was making private insurance--\nremember how they said this was going to be government health care--\nprivate insurance companies selling insurance. People could afford it \nbecause there were subsidies for families with income up to the level \nof 400 percent of poverty. Well, of the 1 million Floridians who \nenrolled--and remember, I gave you the figure that 8 million nationally \nenrolled. Of that 8 million, 1 million people needed and wanted \ninsurance so much in our State alone that they enrolled, and 91 percent \nof them were able to receive a subsidy under the graduated subsidy \nlevel in order that they could purchase that private insurance. The \nfolks who bought a plan using subsidies reduced their premiums through \nthe subsidies by an average of 80 percent.\n  So what we had in health insurance before the Affordable Care Act was \nnot--it was like the Wild West. Plans could deny you coverage. An \ninsurance plan, if you had coverage and you were suddenly getting \ntreatment, could cancel your coverage. They could also deny you \ncoverage by saying you had a previous existing condition, and it could \nhave been something as simple as a rash. You could not get health \ninsurance. Now all of those things they cannot use as an excuse.\n  So what I see is the last throes of this resistance to the Affordable \nCare Act, and you are going to hear it again as insurance plans come \nout on Medicare Advantage and show that they are hiking their rates. \nYet I want the people of Florida to know it was the State legislature \nthat took away the ability of the Insurance Commissioner of Florida to \nregulate those rates.\n  Madam President, I would like to clarify my previous remarks. I was \nreferring to the removal of the authority to regulate private insurance \nrates by the state insurance commissioner in SB 1842, not Medicare \nAdvantage.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Debt\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, this is my 10th year in the Senate. \nEvery time we come to a close of the session for a summer break or for \na holiday break all of a sudden we start hearing all these unanimous \nconsent requests--they come to the Senate. For those of you who are \nlistening to this and to my colleagues, these are requests that bills \nbe passed without a vote. I am fine with that, as long as they meet \ncertain characteristics and considerations.\n  But what the American public does not know is that about 70 percent \nof the work the Senate does happens by unanimous consent, with no \nrecorded vote on the back of any one Senator. Today is no different. I \nhave heard of five or six requests for unanimous consent. They are fine \nwith a couple of provisions. The first provision is they ought to be \nwithin the powers of Congress as enumerated by the Constitution in the \nenumerated powers. The tendency is: Oh, we have to do this; it has to \nhappen now. For some of the things that is true, but the reason it has \nto happen now is because we had not done it before now because we \nfailed to do it. We utilize the end of the session to force people to \ngive on positions they would never give on otherwise because they do \nnot want to take the heat for being responsible for stopping something \nfrom happening, even though it might not fit within the enumerated \npowers, it might not be under our constitutional authority.\n  But the most egregious of all of this is the fact that we are going \nto be asked today, probably 7 or 10 times, to pass pieces of \nlegislation the very cost of which will fall on the backs of our \nchildren and our grandchildren--not us. With over $400 billion in waste \nper year in the Federal Government--waste, fraud, duplication--to ask \nus to spend $200 million here or $2 billion here or in the case of the \nveterans bill, $17 billion, of which $5 billion of it is actually paid \nfor, without doing the hard work of not transferring more debt to our \nchildren is not acceptable to me.\n  So my rights as an individual Senator are going to be utilized \ntoday--until we go home--to make sure we do not transfer another penny, \nif I can stop it, onto the backs of our children. It would be different \nif we were efficient, if we did not have any waste, if we did not have \nany fraud, if we did not have any duplication. But you see, it is an \nexcuse to not do the hard work we were sent to do.\n  So I am putting my colleagues on notice that if they want to pass any \nbill that is going to go by unanimous consent, they better find some \nwaste somewhere to offset it with or I will object. I do not mind \ntaking the heat, no matter what the issue. I have done it before, I \nwill do it again. Our children and our grandchildren are worth any \namount of heat that creates a future opportunity for them that is at \nleast as equal to what we have had.\n  I wanted to say that before I start talking about the veterans bill. \nI voted for the veterans bill that went out of the Senate. My \nbackground as a physician and businessman--businessman first, a \nphysician second, regrettably a politician third--but I voted for that \nbecause I thought in conference we would actually fix it. What is wrong \nwith the VA? Leadership, a culture of corruption, a culture of not \ncaring. That does not apply to all of the VA employees, it does not \napply to all of the VA hospitals, but it certainly does apply to a \nnumber of them.\n  How did we get there? I would note for the record that VA spending is \nup 60 percent since 2009. Let's start in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and \n2014. It is up 60 percent. Patient demand is up only 17 percent in that \nsame period of time. The number of providers has increased by 40 \npercent. So it surely cannot be a problem of money.\n  If we look at the increased utilization of those services over the \nnext progressive 10 years, it will be less than 20 percent. We did some \ngood things in the bill in the Senate, most of which are capped, but we \ndid not do enough. If we are going to manage the VA, we have to give \nthe head of that organization the ability to be able to manage it. \nSenior Executive Service, the Secretary of the VA is going to have that \ncapability to hire and fire. For a very limited number of title 38 \nemployees--those are hospital managers, physicians--for a very limited \nnumber, he will have that as well. But for where we have seen a lot of \nthe problems, he will not be able to fire people who have directly \nharmed our veterans.\n  So we have not given him the tools to create the environment and the \nchange that has to happen and a cultural change that has to happen in \nthe veterans organization.\n  The other thing I would note is that if we look at the requirement \nfor primary care physicians and physician extenders--nurse \npractitioners and PAs--their load is about one-fourth of the load of \nprivate practitioners in this country. That is not true clinic to \nclinic, but on average that is true. In Oklahoma we have some great \nphysicians who work every night until 10:00 taking care of veterans. We \nhave great caregivers in lots of instances. But we have a lot of \nstinkers, and on average we are not demanding of them what the private \nsector routinely does.\n  One of the good things in the bill is we are going to finally have VA \nhospitals and clinics reporting outcomes, just as every other hospital \nin this country has to report. If they take Medicare or Medicaid \ndollars, they have to report to CMS their outcomes--their readmissions, \ntheir death rates, their infection rates, their quality of care. They \nhave to be reported.\n  Also, physicians have to be credentialed. Not true in the VA. So if \nthey are not credentialed, the VA patient is going to know what their \ncredentials are--if they have lost their medical license.\n  Those are positive aspects of this bill. What is not positive is the \nfact that we won't fix the real problem, and we are going to say we did \nand we are going to spend our grandkids' money\n\n[[Page S5176]]\n\nsaying we did over a very short period of time, and we are still not \ngoing to hold the organization accountable.\n  It is unconscionable to me, after a 60-percent increase in funding \nover the last 4 years, that we would borrow against our children's \nfuture an additional $12 billion when we have all this waste throughout \nthe Federal Government and in the VA and say that is the best Congress \ncould do. I think that is an incrimination upon Congress, and it is a \ndereliction of our duty--to our Republic but also our future.\n  So I will be doing a couple things:\n  No. 1, I will be raising a point of order against this bill; and No. \n2, I will be voting against it.\n  Let me say a little bit about why I am voting against it. Yesterday I \ntalked to a Vietnam veteran who is 100 percent disabled and presented \nto the emergency room of a major VA hospital in this country with chest \npain. This patient was observed for 2 hours. She had no acute changes \non her EKG, but she had--as any doctor would know--unstable angina. Her \npain never went away. She was sent home. In less than 48 hours she \npresented to an emergency room in her local community and an hour after \nthat had three stents placed in her left coronary artery. She was \nignored medically. That is happening today as we have had this \ndiscussion.\n  Another wonderful retired veteran in Oklahoma had to have a knee \nreplaced. She was service-connected. She went to the VA and had her \nknee replaced. It was a failure. She had to have it done again. A \ncouple years later her other knee needed to be replaced. They replaced \nher knee. It failed. As they replaced the second knee, as can happen, \nthey fractured her femur. Today she has a replaced knee, and she walks \nwith a terrible limp because her left leg is 1\\1/2\\ inches shorter than \nher right one. The likelihood of that happening to one individual is \nabout 1 in 10 billion, but the outcomes never get reported. A femur can \nbreak while doing a knee prosthesis, there is no question about it. But \nfive major surgeries? That means outcomes don't compare.\n  When this VA episode started soaking in, as a physician I went to the \nmedical literature and looked at all the studies that have been \npublished on VA care. I did a LexisNexis. I looked at them all. What \ndid they show? VA care is better than anyplace in America. That is what \nthe studies show. Except when we drill down on it, what we find is the \nway they were cheating on appointments is the way they were cheating on \noutcomes. In other words, the outcomes weren't accurate. So the culture \nis one of looking good, protecting those within the VA, and not \nprotecting our veterans. Again, I would say that does not apply to all \nVA employees. The vast majority of them are great. But the leadership \nhas stunk. We have to have a bill that fixes that. I don't believe this \nis going to do it.\n  I also wish to talk about whistleblowers because I have had a \nmultitude of whistleblowers whose complaints I have investigated and \nfound to be truthful. The culture at the VA against whistleblowers has \nbeen a channel in the past from whistleblowers back to management. And \nwhat happens to them? They get fired. They get demoted. They get \nharassed. They end up ultimately leaving. These are the people who \ncare, who want to make it better.\n  There is a big job ahead of Secretary McDonald. He has the capability \nand he has the experience to fix this but only if we give him the \ntools. My fear is that we will not give him the tools with this bill.\n\n  The final point I would make, and I think we all ought to think about \nit--every American ought to think about it. Remember, we are an All-\nVolunteer Army right now. If somebody has served this country in \ncombat, putting their life on the line to protect us, to protect our \nway of life, to protect the very freedoms we cherish, should that same \nindividual ever be at the back of the line on anything related to \nhealth care that is associated with their service? They should be in \nthe front. They should be ahead of every Senator, every President, \nevery doctor. They should get the first care, not the last. They should \nget the best care, not the worst. That is how it ought to be. It is the \nveterans VA system, not ours. It is for them. And when they no longer \nare the object of service by this country, for them, for their \nsacrifice, then we are in a whole lot more trouble than any of us \nrealize. We have turned things upside down. Union representation at the \nVA is more important than the VA patient. Benefits for VA managers are \nmore important than the VA patient.\n  The one critical thing that really needs to happen to clean up the VA \nis to give veterans the absolute choice to go wherever they want, their \nfreedom to choose whatever care they want based on what they have done \nfor us. By doing that, the VA will either have to become competitive \nand just as good or they should die. We have not done that in this \nbill. We need to do that in this bill.\n  We have centers of excellence in the VA that beat all the private \nindustry, all the private health care. When it comes to prosthetics, \nwhen it comes to closed-head injuries, when it comes to traumatic brain \ninjury, when it comes to post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, \nwe are great. The VA is great, but in too many areas it is not. Tell me \nthis bill will change all that, and I will vote for it even if it does \nsacrifice our children. But it won't.\n  I won't be here when the results are assessed, but I can predict what \nthey will be--more of the same, too much money and not enough \nleadership.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, before I speak on the topic of \nAffordable Care Act, reports are emerging that the House of \nRepresentatives is going to adjourn without taking any votes on a \nborder supplemental that would allow this country to humanely deal with \na crisis of epidemic proportions on our border as over 50,000 children \nright now are being warehoused, shoulder to shoulder, without any sign \nfrom the Congress of help coming.\n  There are legitimate differences in what manner we provide this \nemergency funding to try to deal with this humanitarian crisis, but \nshame on the House of Representatives as they leave town today without \neven having attempted to take a vote on a supplemental appropriations \nbill for the border.\n  I was in the chair yesterday as I listened to about three or four of \nour Republican colleagues come down to the floor, as they often do, and \nregister their ongoing complaints about the Affordable Care Act. As has \nbeen the trendline over the past 4 months, those complaints have moved \nfrom those rooted in data to those rooted in anecdote.\n  There is no doubt that there are people in every single State in this \ncountry who continue to have poor interactions with the American health \ncare system. It is one-sixth of our economy, and as was the case before \nthe Affordable Care Act, it will be the case after the Affordable Care \nAct. There are many people who will still pay too much, and there are \nstill plenty of people who will not get enough in return.\n\n  But I wanted to spend a little bit of time on the floor today talking \nabout what the actual data shows us, what the empirical evidence shows \nus. It is overwhelming in its conclusion that the Affordable Care Act \nis working--in many respects working better than anybody thought it \nwould. So I want to take my colleague's arguments one at a time.\n  The first is a pretty simple one. Every bad interaction that happens \nin the American health care system is not the fault of the Affordable \nCare Act. I woke up a couple of days ago with a sore throat, but that \nwasn't President Obama's fault. That wasn't the fault of the Affordable \nCare Act. I had kind of a rough day. But I understand there are bad \nthings that are going to continue to happen to me--especially when it \ncomes to health care--that cannot necessarily be fixed by the \nAffordable Care Act. So one of the ongoing statistics that is used is \nthe number of people who had their plans canceled. Well, most of the \nnonpartisan medical journals that have surveyed the number of \ncancellations before the Affordable\n\n[[Page S5177]]\n\nCare Act and the number of cancellations after the Affordable Care Act \nsuggest this has been a problem that has been ongoing for years, that \nthere is substantial churn every single year in terms of the number of \nplans that were offered that then are stopped being offered. The \nAffordable Care Act is not solely responsible for the fact that plans \nare being cancelled. People will still pay a lot in premiums. The \nAffordable Care Act makes it better. There are a lot fewer premium \nincreases of over 10 percent since the Affordable Care Act was passed \nthan before it was passed. But every time somebody is paying more than \nthey would like for the health care they receive, that is not the fault \nof the Affordable Care Act.\n  The second argument is the difference between data and anecdote. So \nlet me just spend a few minutes talking about what the ongoing \navalanche of information, of data, of statistics tells us. So many of \nmy colleagues come down and talk about the huge rates that people are \npaying for health care and blame it on the Affordable Care Act. The \naverage premium that individuals paid for a plan on one of the \nAffordable Care Act exchanges over the course of the first year of its \nimplementation was $82 per month--$82 per month. Now, there are some \npeople who are paying more, but the average is $82 a month. That is a \npretty sweet deal to get health care coverage in this country.\n  And they needed it. A study showed that 60 percent of adults with new \ncoverage used it and 60 percent of those individuals say they could \nnever have afforded to get the care had they not had insurance in the \nfirst place.\n  And people like it. Consumer survey after consumer survey shows that \nthe majority of people who are on these new plans want to keep them and \nhave said their experience has been good, excellent or satisfactory. So \nthat is the real story about what is happening on the exchanges.\n  What about cost? My colleagues say it really hasn't done anything to \ncontrol costs. That is not the case. Health care inflation in this \ncountry is at a 50-year low. Medicare spending--that is the money that \nwe all pay as federal taxpayers--is $1,000 per beneficiary lower than \nit was projected to be in 2014. So $1,000 in spending per individual \nhas disappeared from the system, and a large part of the reason for \nthat is the Affordable Care Act.\n  We had a bipartisan briefing sponsored by the Commonwealth Fund this \nweek, and both the Republican economists and the Democratic economists \nbelieve the Affordable Care Act, though not solely responsible for that \nreduction in price, is a big, big part of that cost-reduction story.\n  People will say it is not coming through on premiums; we are still \nseeing premium increases that are bigger than we would like. Well, they \nare smaller than they were before the Affordable Care Act, but the \nAffordable Care Act also has this provision in it that requires \ninsurance companies to spend a certain percentage of all the money they \ncollect on care, and if they pad their profits with too much of your \npremiums, then they have to return that money to you. We just found out \nthat consumers have already saved $330 million in money that was \ndirectly returned to them, and over all have saved $9 billion in \nsavings on premiums because of this provision, which essentially says \nif you get charged too much, the insurance company now cannot keep that \nmoney for themselves. They have to return it to you. That is the best \nprotection you can have from premiums that are too high. It is not \ntheoretical; it is practical--the $330 million in checks written by \ninsurance companies and given to individuals.\n  The data continues to show us the Affordable Care Act is working, and \nI haven't even gotten into the data I have brought down here week after \nweek, which is stunning in terms of the number of people who now have \ninsurance: 8 million people insured on the exchanges--a 25-percent \nreduction in the number of uninsured in this country. Even the most \noptimistic of ACA supporters could never have thought we would have a \n25-percent reduction in the number of uninsured in this country in the \nfirst 6 months of implementation. The numbers don't lie.\n  But here is my last point: Senators and Members of Congress who come \ndown and complain about the performance of the Affordable Care Act in \ntheir State, when their State has done everything in its power to \nundermine the Affordable Care Act, have some explaining to do. The \nreality is there are States such as Connecticut that are working hard \nto implement the Affordable Care Act, and there are other States that \nare working to undermine the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care \nAct works really well in States that want it to work, and it has a \nlittle bit more trouble in States that are trying to undermine it. Let \nme give you an example that comes from a speech given earlier on the \nfloor by Senator Nelson. Senator Nelson talked about how Florida, \nthrough its Republican Governor and Republican legislature, has taken \naway from the insurance commissioner the ability to approve increases \nin insurance rates. And so, guess what. They are seeing premium \nincreases that are rather unappetizing to Florida residents because the \nlegislature has taken away from the government the ability to monitor, \nreview, and approve those rates.\n  Compare that with the State of Connecticut, which is working hard to \nimplement the Affordable Care Act and act on behalf of rate payers and \nconsumers. Our biggest insurer a couple of months ago proposed a 12-\npercent increase in rates under the Affordable Care Act in \nConnecticut's exchange. We have the ability to review those rates in \nConnecticut. We did that, and the insurance commission in our State \njust 2 days ago came back and reduced that rate increase from 12 \npercent to 1 percent. Blue Cross Blue Shield is not going to stop \noffering insurance on the Connecticut exchange. They are just going to \ndo it with a rate increase that is commensurate with the actual \nincrease in costs of care to Anthem rather than a number that is not \nbased on actual data.\n  So in a State such as Connecticut, where we have seen twice as many \npeople enroll as we originally estimated, where we have seen Medicaid \nexpansion provide access to insurance for thousands upon thousands of \nConnecticut residents who have insurance in a way that people in \nFlorida do not because of their lack of Medicaid expansion, we also \nhave taken steps to protect consumers from premium increases.\n  So for colleagues who are going to complain about high premium \nincreases, you have to acknowledge there are steps that your State \ncould have taken to make it better. For colleagues who are going to \ntalk about the fact that there aren't enough people enrolled, well, \nthen your State could have taken steps to enroll more people.\n  Not everything is the fault of the Affordable Care Act when things go \nwrong for families. The data does not back up the anecdotes that are \nbrought to this floor. In States that are working to implement the law, \nit works a lot better than in States that are working to undermine it.\n  The story is clear. Whether it is a decrease in people that don't \nhave insurance, the decreasing rate of medical inflation all across the \ncountry or the improving quality of health care in every corner of this \nNation, the Affordable Care Act is working.\n  I yield back the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I see two of my colleagues who are here, \nand I want to ask unanimous consent that Senator Barrasso be given 10 \nminutes, then Senator Sessions be given 3 minutes, and then the \nremainder of the time be turned over to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Did the Chair rule?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President----\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I would ask that the Senator modify his \nrequest to allow Senator Bennet to alternate with one of the Republican \nspeakers in this series of remarks.\n  Mr. HATCH. I was supposed to speak here at 2:15 p.m.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I will withdraw my request for \nmodification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I have come to the floor to discuss \nsome\n\n[[Page S5178]]\n\nof the issues related to the health care law and the side effects of \nthe health care law. I see my friend and colleague from the State of \nConnecticut--a place where I spent 5 years as part of my residency \nprogram training--has just spoken on this issue. So I followed the \ndevelopments in that State quite a bit and talked to many of the \nphysicians who practice there on a regular basis, some of whom I have \nstudied with for up to 5 years. So they have routinely sent me articles \nabout the failure of the President's health care law in Connecticut--\nbecause remember, the President said, actually, that the costs would go \ndown, not go up under the President's health care law. I think he said \n$2,500 per family per year. Nancy Pelosi on ``Meet The Press'' said \ncosts would go down for everyone--down for everyone. She didn't say \nthey would go up a little. She didn't say they would go up at all. She \nsaid they would go down for everyone, and this was in the last 2 years.\n  I come to the floor noting that just the other day in Hartford, CT, \nthe headline story said that one of the insurance companies was seeking \na 12\\1/2\\-percent rate increase. The Norwich Bulletin says: ``Anthem \nseeks 12.5 percent rate increase.''\n  I heard my colleague from Connecticut say the insurance commissioner \nwouldn't allow it to go up that much but did allow it to go up and said \nit was going up; is that what my colleague just said on the floor? \nPerhaps not as much as this, but certainly the President said they were \ngoing to go down by $2,500 a family. Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the \nHouse, said they were going to go down for everyone. And in Connecticut \npeople who believed the President, people who believed the Speaker of \nthe House, Nancy Pelosi, realized they weren't told the truth. Rates \neven after this 12.5-percent request was reviewed and lessened--the \nrates still went up.\n  So I look at these headlines.\n  Another story out in the Daily Caller: ``Obamacare Update: Now EVEN \nMORE States Report Double-Digit Premium Hikes.'' They talk about \nVermont and they talk about Arizona, States where premiums are going up \nover 10 percent.\n  I looked at the story in Politico last month: Connecticut exchange \nreports breach--breach of security of individual people, hundreds of \nnames left on the sidewalk, with Social Security numbers, with \naddresses, with information about them.\n  A story coming out of the Connecticut Mirror: ``CT's Latinos face \nhurdles in enrolling in ObamaCare.'' It says: ``No group of people in \nConnecticut is more likely to be uninsured than the state's Latinos, \nand ObamaCare won't change that.''\n  I just heard from my colleague that it is working. Not according to \nthe press in his home State.\n  July 1, 2014, the Connecticut Mirror:\n\n       Federal auditors question Access Health CT's internal \n     controls.\n       Federal auditors reported Tuesday--\n\n  These are not individual stories of one person or another, because we \nknow all across Connecticut there have been families who have been \ndropped, people who have had problems, individuals who are being hurt.\n  ``Access Health CT says it will start calling thousands of customers \nFriday''--this was earlier this month--\n``. . . 5,784 customers were identified as having incorrect tax \ncredits'' under this program that my colleague says is working in his \nhome State.\n  It says: ``About 3,900 customers,'' in the State of Connecticut \n``were told that they qualified for government-funded Medicaid coverage \nwhen, in fact, they did not.''\n  It says: ``An unknown number of customers got a bill from their \ninsurance company that was more than they expected . . . ''\n  `` . . . 903 customers were dropped by their insurer.''\n  These are the facts.\n  So I hear that the Federal auditors are questioning Connecticut's \ninternal controls, and then look at the many stories about doctors who \nare saying no to ObamaCare: ``Report: Connecticut is Less Competitive \nAfter Federal Health Care Reform'' in the Hartford Courant.\n  It just reminds me there are so many side effects of this health care \nlaw all across the country--stories from every State. Premiums are \ngoing up, people are having to pay more in copays, people are having to \npay more in terms of their deductibles, and people continue to be \noffended that they were not told the truth.\n  The rates continue to go up. The President said they would go down. \nNancy Pelosi said they would go down for everyone. That is not the \ncase. And I think what I am hearing also is----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President----\n  Mr. BARRASSO. People believe that Washington is in control.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. The Senator will yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Yes.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator.\n  I appreciate the amount of time the Senator has taken to educate my \ncolleagues on Connecticut's success in adding 200,000 people to the \nrolls of the insured. But the chart the Senator just had up next to him \nfor the majority of his remarks about Anthem's request to increase \nrates in Connecticut by 12 percent is, frankly, the best advertisement \nyou can make for the Affordable Care Act because under the Affordable \nCare Act, States are given the ability to review these rate increases \nand modify them. Connecticut has taken advantage of that, and had you \nread the papers from 2 days ago, rather than taking the headline from \nseveral months ago, you would have seen that the Connecticut insurance \ncommission rejected the 12-percent increase and actually approved a 1-\npercent increase.\n  Regardless of someone's claim that insurance premiums were going to \ngo down, my constituents in Connecticut will be very welcome to take a \n1-percent increase in premiums. Should you repeal the Affordable Care \nAct--parts or all of it--you would remove from many State the ability \nto offer these plans in the first place or to be able to monitor them. \nSo I appreciate the Senator putting a month's old headline on the floor \nof the Senate, but yesterday's headline actually tells us that because \nof the Affordable Care Act rates under the exchange for the people in \nConnecticut will be at historic lows in terms of premium increases. \nGiven the fact the Senator is putting up news about the State of \nConnecticut, I want to make sure that he is putting up the latest and \nmost accurate news about our State.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I didn't hear a question posed in \nthat, but I concur. And I mentioned in my remarks, as the Senator from \nConnecticut has said, that the rates were not allowed to go up to the \ndouble-digit request, although I also mentioned they are going up by \ndouble-digits in many other States. Yet the President of the United \nStates said the rates would go down by $2,500 per family per year. \nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi--who was Speaker when the Member from \nConnecticut was a Member of the House and voted for the health care \nlaw--said on ``Meet the Press'' that they would go down for everyone, \nand that is not the case. The case is, as I have continued to say on \nthe floor of this body, rates are going up across the country even \nthough the President promised something else. What people are seeing is \nhigher premium rates, higher deductibles, higher copays, and loss of \ndoctors. They feel Washington is taking control over their lives. We \nare also seeing lower paychecks in Connecticut as people try to comply \nwith the 30-hour workweek requirements, which are causing school \ndistricts to have to choose whether to hire reading teachers as a \nresult of the mandates of the health care law.\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I understand there will be 3 minutes for \nthe Senator from Alabama and then I will be able to deliver my full \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                          Veterans Health Care\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I just want to say how much I \nappreciate the work by all the Members who worked on the veterans bill. \nWe had some difficulties of a very serious nature, and all of us wanted \nto fix that. I was not able to support the bill that came out of the \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S5179]]\n\n  We learned minutes before the vote that the average cost in the out \nyears would be $50 billion a year if the program was funded, and there \nwas no money to pay for that. It would really just be adding to the \ndebt. It was sort of avoided by saying it would be a 3-year bill, but \nonce you start these kinds of motions rolling, they never seem to end, \nand in the end we would be faced with a difficult situation \nfinancially.\n  The conference committee went to work, and I salute all the people \nwho worked on this legislation. It has some good policy issues in it. \nSenator Tom Coburn, who spoke earlier, was engaged in that conference. \nHe is a doctor. He understands these matters, he cares about them, and \nhe was actively engaged, as we all know. In Tom Coburn we have one of \nthe Senate's finest, most committed Senators. He loves this country. \nEvery day he tries to save us money and make us more productive. There \nis nobody here who works harder or is more effective in addressing that \nissue than he is, and he says we need to do better. He is not able to \nsupport the conference report because it will add at least $10 billion \nto the debt in 3 years. I will acknowledge that it is better than \nbefore. As a result, he will raise a point of order against it, and I \nhave to say I will support that.\n  Our doctors there do not carry the kinds of patient caseloads private \ndoctors do.\n  While we have some policy changes that are good, more are needed. We \nare going to have a new Administrator, and I am very impressed with \nhim. He is a military academy graduate from West Point, spent 5 years \nin the military, and was a Procter & Gamble CEO. He has bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate. A lot of confidence and a lot of hope is being \nplaced in him.\n  I think the better action for us today is to not try to establish big \npolicy changes that continue indefinitely at great expense. The better \nchoice for us today is to wait a bit, see how effective this new leader \nis, and see how much he can save without reducing benefits. Maybe we \ncan get some ideas from this top-flight, world-class businessman, who \ncan help us develop policies that serve our veterans. We have an \nabsolute commitment to serve our veterans and fulfill our \nresponsibilities.\n  I will support the budget point of order, but if it were to be \nsustained--and it probably will not be sustained because people want to \ngo forward and do this--I am confident we would be able to work with \nthe new Administrator and develop an even better plan for securing the \nbenefits which our veterans have earned and to which they are entitled.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                            Standing Strong\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, in recent days I have twice spoken here \non the floor--not about a particular issue, bill, or nomination pending \nbefore the Senate, but about the Senate itself.\n  While issues, bills, nominations, and even partisan majorities come \nand go, the Senate as an institution must remain--and remain not only \nin some tattered form, some distorted shadow of its former self, but, \nrather, the Senate must remain as it was designed to be. The political \nwinds may blow, but the institution must stand strong.\n  Unfortunately, in my 38 years of service in this body I have never \nseen it weaker than it is today. There once was a consensus here not \nonly about the need to keep this institution strong but also about how \nto do it. That consensus evolved from how the Framers designed this \nbody so that it could play its unique role in the system of government \nthey inspirationally crafted.\n  James Madison, for example, remarked at the 1787 Constitutional \nConvention that the Senate's proceedings could have more coolness, more \nsystem, and more wisdom than the House of Representatives. He was not \ntalking about coolness in the way our teenagers talk about it today. \nThe House is designed for more or less direct expression of the popular \nwill and operates by simple majority. By contrast, the Senate is \ndesigned for deliberation. For more than two centuries it has operated \nby a supermajority and even unanimous consent. This fundamental \ndifference between the House and the Senate is by express design and \nnot historical accident. It is the conjunction of the two that makes \nthe legislative branch work in the manner the Framers intended. This \nbasic principle of bicameralism is above politics and above party.\n  This longstanding consensus about the importance of the Senate's \nunique design and how it must operate to fulfill its constitutional \nrole has all but fallen apart over the last few years. I began \naddressing this problem in earnest last week and will continue to do so \nin the weeks ahead and, I might add, in the months to come, urging my \ncolleagues to heed history's wisdom and change course.\n  I am not alone in this endeavor. My friend the senior Senator from \nTennessee has also spoken with great passion on this issue and \ndeveloped a thoughtful assessment of the Senate's institutional decay. \nTwo longtime colleagues in this body--one Democrat and one Republican--\noffered similar critiques when leaving the Senate in the last few \nyears.\n  For 30 years I served in this body with my friend from Connecticut, \nSenator Christopher Dodd. In his final speech on the Senate floor on \nNovember 30, 2010, he observed that the Senate was established as a \nplace where every Member's voice could be heard and where a \ndeliberation and even dissent would be valued and respected. Senator \nDodd explained that ``our Founders were concerned not only with what \nwas legislated, but, just as importantly, with how we legislated.'' He \nurged Senators to resist the temptation to abandon the Senate's \nlongstanding traditions to make it ``more like the House of \nRepresentatives, where the majority can essentially bend the minority \nto its will.''\n  Two years later Senator Olympia Snowe concluded her three terms in \nthe Senate representing the State of Maine in this body with a \nreflection on the state of the Senate. She observed that a commitment \nto the rights of the minority helped ensure that the Senate would be a \nbody where all voices are heard. Senator Snowe concluded, however, that \n``the Senate is not living up to what the Founding Fathers \nenvisioned,'' in large part by ignoring the minority's rights.\n  Senator Dodd concluded his Senate service in the majority while \nSenator Snowe concluded hers in the minority, but their assessment was \nthe same--a leading Democrat and a leading Republican. That is what a \nconsensus looks like. They shared an understanding of the unique role \nthe Senate was designed to play in our system of government, and they \nknew from experience that the Senate is not operating by that design \ntoday.\n  Diagnosing our current institutional ills and prescribing a path back \nto health must begin by recognizing the primacy of the Senate's \npurpose, design, and place in our system of government. Without the \nanchor of these principles, which have throughout the Senate's history \nbeen shared throughout this body, across all partisan and ideological \nlines, the gamesmanship of politics and the quest for power will \ndecimate our deliberate contribution to the legislative process. \nUnfortunately, that is exactly what is happening today.\n  In my previous remarks, I noted that many of the sage students of the \nSenate--from Vice President Adlai Stevenson in the 19th century to \nRobert C. Byrd of West Virginia in our time--all identified the same \ntwo features as critical to the Senate's proper functioning: the right \nof amendment and the right to debate. It is not difficult to see how \nthey serve the critical function of setting the Senate apart from the \nHouse. These rights temper majority rule. They emphasize individuals \nover parties and factions. They ensure that all voices can be heard. \nThey encourage deliberation and, yes, even beneficial compromise. These \nrights secure a substantive role for all Senators--even those in the \nminority--in how the Senate legislates, a feature that does not exist \nin how the House operates.\n  During my service throughout the past four decades, the Senate has \noften lived up to these ideals. For example, I worked with the junior \nSenator from Iowa on the Americans with Disabilities Act, which the \nSenate in 1989 passed by a vote of 76 to 8. At that time Democrats held \n55 Senate seats, just as they do today. This body addressed\n\n[[Page S5180]]\n\namendments on the floor offered by both Democrats and Republicans on \nissues ranging from tax credits for small businesses to accessibility \nof buses. On a single day in September of 1989, the Senate adopted \nnearly twice as many minority amendments to this single bill than the \nSenate today has adopted in more than a year.\n\n  Today the majority leader uses his right to priority recognition to \neliminate virtually all opportunities for amendments unless he agrees \nto them, and even then he generally stops amendments. He has used this \nprocedural maneuver--called filling the amendment tree--more than twice \nas often as the previous six majority leaders combined.\n  There is a time when you can fill the amendment tree, and that is \nafter there has been a full and fair debate on all the reasonable \namendments Members have brought to the floor and it is when a \nreasonable time has been given to a bill and there have been a number \nof votes.\n  Yet, when he was in the minority, even he condemned this tactic as \n``a very bad practice.'' He explained that ``it runs against the basic \nnature of the Senate.'' He was right then, but he is wrong now. Perhaps \nthe majority leader has reconsidered what he believes to be the basic \nnature of the Senate. Perhaps he now believes that denying the \nminority's right to offer amendments is a very good rather than a very \nbad practice. If he does, then I think he, of all people, owes the \nSenate an explanation. I don't think he believes that; otherwise, such \nan about-face is nothing more than a desire to rig the rules so he can \nwin all the games, and in the process he is destroying the Senate \nitself. When I say games, I don't really mean games. It is so he can \nwin all the votes. He can put the Senate on any motion he wants to \nwithout any real rights for the minority, and in the process he is \ndestroying the Senate itself, destroying the institutional \ncharacteristics the Founders thought critical to our government's \ndesign, and destroying precisely those practices and traditions that \nhave enabled the Senate to serve the common good throughout our \nNation's history.\n  The other defining feature of this body--the right to unlimited \ndebate--is also under attack. By empowering the minority, that right \nhas always annoyed the majority whether we have been in the minority or \nwhether we have been in the majority and vice versa. But a little \nhistory can provide a lot of perspective for us today.\n  For more than a century, ending debate on anything required unanimous \nconsent. A single Senator could prevent a final vote on a matter by \npreventing an end to debate. The Senate adopted a rule in 1917 that \nlowered the threshold to two-thirds. Not until 1975 was the threshold \nlowered to three-fifths, where it stands today.\n  It is easier to end debate today than ever before in the Senate's \nhistory, but that is not enough for the current majority. Urged on by \nmany of the 34 Senators who have not yet ever served in the minority, \nthe majority apparently does not want any obstacle whatsoever to stand \nin its way--not even full and fair debate.\n  Last November the majority leader used a parliamentary maneuver to \nlower the threshold for any debate on most nominations from a \nsupermajority to a simple majority. It took him only a few short \nminutes to end more than 200 years of Senate practice and effectively \neliminate the minority's role in the confirmation process.\n  As I have detailed here on the Senate floor and in print, the \nminority leader's reasons for this revolution amounted to filibuster \nfraud. At the time he invoked the so-called nuclear option, the Senate \nhad confirmed 98 percent of President Obama's nominations, and \nfilibusters, of course, were on the decline. But 98 percent was not \ngood enough for the majority.\n  I noted the current majority leader's about-face regarding the right \nto offer amendments. He defended that right when in the minority and \nactively suppressed it when in the majority. Similarly, when he was in \nthe minority, he voted more than two dozen times for filibusters of \nRepublican judicial nominees. The Democrats were the ones who started \nthat. Then, last November, once in the majority, he abolished the right \nto debate nominations.\n  While the majority leader effectively neutralized the Senate cloture \nrule to stop the minority from debating nominations, he has also used \nthat rule to stop the minority from debating legislation. He again uses \nhis right of priority recognition to bring up a bill and, at the very \nsame time, file a motion to end debate. But it makes no sense to speak \nof ending debate--ending what he wrongly characterizes as a Republican \nfilibuster--when such debate had no chance to begin with. The majority \nleader uses this cloture rule not to end debate but to prevent it \naltogether.\n  Just like the practice of filling the amendment tree, the majority \nleader is using his position to prevent debate far more often than any \nof his predecessors. Unlike the current majority leader, most Senators \non the other side of the aisle have never served in the minority. Most \nSenators in both parties--56, to be exact--have served here only under \nthe current leadership. Unfortunately, this means that most Senators \nserving today have only witnessed leadership that prefers power to \nprinciple and is rapidly dismantling the longstanding practices and \ntraditions of an institution that took centuries to build. The only \nleadership that most Senators serving today have experienced uses \nparliamentary maneuvers to deny senatorial rights so that the partisan \nends justify the procedural means.\n  The current Senate leadership is wrong. The road we are on today \nleads only to one destination. Just as maintaining the integrity and \nfoundation of the Senate's design and operation is essential to its \nproper role in our system of government, attacking that integrity and \ndismantling that foundation can only destroy that proper role. Since \nthe Senate's proper role is essential for protecting the liberties of \nthe American people, destroying those longstanding practices and \ntraditions puts our liberties at risk.\n  The minority leader spoke here in January about the state of the \nSenate and noted that what many call partisanship today is nothing new. \nBut what I have been addressing in recent days is not the result of \nthat ideological competition but how that competition is conducted.\n  At the beginning of my first term, there were only 38 Republican \nSenators--not even enough to end debate under Senate rules. Democrats \nhave not been in such a small minority in nearly 60 years.\n  According to the Brookings Institution and American Enterprise \nInstitute, 42 percent of all rollcall votes during my first 2 years \nhere were so-called party unity votes, in which a majority of each \nparty sticks together and votes in opposite ways. That means a majority \nof votes involve Senators reaching across the aisle.\n  In the last several years under the current leadership, however, even \nthough the margin between the parties is narrower, the percentage of \nsuch party unity votes has risen to 62 percent. This trend of \nretreating to partisan corners is yet another indication that this body \nis becoming like the House and, therefore, abandoning the tradition of \nunlimited debate and amendment at the core of the Senate's identity.\n  The way Senator Snowe described it, the great challenge is to create \nand maintain a system ``that gives our elected officials reasons to \nlook past their differences and find common ground if their initial \nparty positions fail to garner sufficient support.'' The Senate's \ndesign provided those reasons and those incentives, and undermining \nthat design destroys them.\n  Building is much harder and takes much longer than destroying. The \ncurrent leadership's recklessness in choosing power over principle is \ndismantling what took centuries to establish.\n  That does not, however, mean it cannot be changed. Senator Dodd \nsuggested a formula for a better course when he distinguished what we \nlegislate from how we legislate. Restoring the Senate as the world's \ngreatest deliberative body requires recommitting ourselves to the \nprinciples of how we legislate so that we can properly discuss and \ndebate what we should legislate.\n  We must first restore the longstanding consensus about the rules, \nprocedures, and traditions governing how the Senate is run. Only on \nthat firm footing can we discuss, deliberate, and legislate in a \nconstructive manner.\n\n[[Page S5181]]\n\n  In addition to restoring many of this body's fundamental rights for \namendment and debate, the minority leader spoke in January about \nrestoring a vigorous and meaningful committee process. These elements \nof our legislative process are related and they are complementary.\n\n  Increasingly, bills are drafted in the leader's office and taken \ndirectly to the full Senate for consideration where the majority leader \nwill immediately fill the amendment tree and file a motion to end \ndebate. In my 38 years in this body, I have never seen a consolidation \nof so much power in so few hands.\n  America's Founders were right in the principles of government they \nlaid out and in the institutional design they built on those \nprinciples. But they did so at the beginning of this journey, creating \nthe blueprint before anything had been built. I fear that returning to \nthe right path may be even harder than embarking on it.\n  The majority today has engaged in a hostile takeover of the Senate \nfor one simple reason: aggrandizing power. But remember the axiom that \npower tends to corrupt. It makes principle harder to see, fainter to \nhear, and tougher to grasp, and it makes principle very difficult to \nrestore. Restoration will require believing in something greater than \npower, something more important than the bill or nomination on the \ncalendar, something more significant than the latest polling numbers. \nIt will require holding fast to a system that can provide power today \nbut take that power away tomorrow.\n  Winston Churchill famously said, ``Democracy is the worst form of \ngovernment except for those other forms that have been tried from time \nto time.'' There is certainly wisdom in that, but consider when \nChurchill said it. He was speaking on the floor of the British House of \nCommons on November 11, 1947, 2 years after his party lost half its \nseats in Parliament and the Labor Party led its first majority \ngovernment. Churchill expressed his faith in the very form of \ngovernment that had turned his party into a small minority.\n  We continue on the path the current Senate leadership has charted at \nour peril, not just the peril of this institution but the peril of our \nsystem of government and the liberties it makes possible for the \nAmerican people. This may sound like a grand statement, but remember \nwhat Senator Byrd repeatedly told us--remember what he said: ``So long \nas the Senate's defining features such as the rights of amendments and \ndebate remain intact, the liberties of the people are secure.''\n  There is perhaps no greater statement of principle regarding this \nNation than our Declaration of Independence, which asserts that the \ngovernment exists to secure the inalienable rights of the people. That \nis why we are here, and that should be our reason to change course--not \nsimply partisan advantage or ideological superiority but liberty. The \nliberty we enjoy in America did not occur by chance. It will not \nsurvive by neglect, and it cannot thrive by preferring power over \nprinciple.\n  My staff and I recently visited the National Archives and saw the \nwords engraved beneath in one of the statues at the entrance: ``Eternal \nvigilance is the price of liberty.''\n  I hope we can turn this around. I hope the leadership of the majority \nwill wake up and realize that some day they may be in the minority. I \ndon't know when, but some day they will be. If they were treated as we \nare being treated, I can just hear the fulminations up and down in the \nSenate. All I can say is that these principles are more important than \neither party. They are more important than either party, and whether \nDemocrats or Republicans like them or not, the fact is, this is the \ngreatest deliberative body in the world that is no longer the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world, and that is because of what is going \non. I hope we can end that and begin anew.\n  I think everybody enjoyed the debate over the highway bill. For once, \nwe were able to have at least four amendments--on both sides, by the \nway. And I have to say it was kind of a thrill to vote again on \namendments. It was kind of a thrill to pass a piece of legislation the \nright way. Whether a person likes or doesn't like the legislation, it \nwas thrilling to be here. I would like to see more of that happening so \nthat everybody here will feel that not only are they a part of the \nSenate but they are helping to keep the Senate the vibrant place it \nalways has been up until now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I rise today to support S. 2648, the \nEmergency Supplemental Appropriations Act.\n  I recently led a congressional delegation to McAllen, TX, and to \nLackland Air Force Base to see firsthand what the administration was \ndoing to handle this border crisis. It was clear to me that the hard-\nworking men and women on the front lines of this crisis are doing the \nbest they can under very difficult circumstances.\n  We should pass this important bill to provide the necessary resources \nto fairly address this humanitarian crisis. We should provide Customs \nand Border Protection the resources they need to pay their agents \novertime when needed, and to provide the necessary food, water, and \nmedical supplies to these children.\n  My colleagues and I saw children in these CBP facilities as young as \n7. We learned that many of these children arrive severely malnourished \nand dehydrated. They are clearly desperate. They are not traveling here \nsimply because they want to. They are fleeing mortal danger at the \nhands of violent drug gangs. These gangs have rendered their home \ncountries some of the most dangerous places in the world to live. We \nshould be working together to make sure these children are given proper \ncare in our facilities and that our CBP agents have the support they \nneed.\n  It was also clear to me that these CBP facilities, meant to safely \nhold dangerous criminals, are no place for children to be held, even \nfor just a few days. This is a view also shared by CBP officers on the \nground who said this is no place for children.\n  That is why I believe it is so important to provide necessary funding \nto the Department of Health and Human Services so they can continue to \nmaintain shelter capacity at places such as Lackland Air Force Base \nwhere we visited. At Lackland, I was given hope. I saw children being \neducated, being taught English, praying if they chose to, and learning \nthe Pledge of Allegiance. I saw a place that reflected our values as a \ncountry.\n  This is why I strongly oppose altering the protections of the 2008 \nTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. The answer is not \nexpediting screenings and deporting these children as soon as possible \nat the border. All this will accomplish is to send these children back \ninto harm's way--indeed, into the murder capitals of the world--even \nmore quickly.\n  I have actually seen what these expedited screenings look like. \nDuring our trip we saw small children sitting on concrete blocks in a \nnoisy and overwhelming CBP facility. In this environment, these \nchildren struggle to answer questions from uniformed Customs and Border \nProtection officers. Let me be clear. That officer was doing the best \nhe could, but children arriving here after a dangerous journey are in \nno condition to quickly explain their reasons for coming to the United \nStates, much less understand the legal basis for their claim to relief \nunder U.S. law. When children are asked to provide that explanation in \nthe kind of harsh environment we saw in McAllen, they have little \nchance of making a compelling case for asylum or other protection. At \nthis facility children cannot access legal help to make their case. \nMany of these children have legitimate legal claims that they have been \nphysically abused, raped, or victimized by gangs or human traffickers. \nWe must give them a fair chance to tell their stories.\n  This bill, which I support, does not repeal these protections. \nInstead, it takes the important steps of funding our immigration courts \nto levels necessary to timely hear these children's claims.\n  This bill also helps with legal representation and orientation \nservices--something the faith communities and other advocates we met \nwith told us were necessary. This will help to speed up the legal \nprocess, while ensuring that the rights of these children are \nprotected.\n  Just as importantly, this bill funds our efforts to address the root \ncauses of\n\n[[Page S5182]]\n\nwhy these children are arriving in our country in the first place. It \nwill help us stop drug trafficking from this region and will help \nstabilize these economies that have been ravaged by the \nnarcotrafficking violence.\n  This past weekend, columnist and commentator George Will eloquently \nspoke on this issue. He said:\n\n       My view is that we have to say to these children welcome to \n     America. You're going to go to school and get a job and \n     become Americans.\n       We have 3,141 counties in this country. That would be 20 \n     per county. The idea that we can't assimilate these 8-year-\n     old criminals with their teddy bears is preposterous.\n       We can handle the problem is what I'm saying. We've handled \n     what Emma Lazarus famously called: ``the wretched refuse of \n     your teeming shores,'' a long time ago, and a lot more people \n     than this.\n\n  George Will is right. We are a country that welcomes refugees--as \nmany of these children are--from all around the world.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important supplemental \nappropriations measure.\n  I yield back my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3086\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I rise today to speak in favor of a \nprinciple that should unite us all--the principle of Internet tax \nfreedom. One of the great blessings of our modern economy is the \nproductivity, the entrepreneurial spirit the Internet has created, the \nability of anyone with an idea to jump online, to communicate, to \ncreate a business, to reach the world.\n  One of the reasons the Internet has been such an entrepreneurial \nhaven is that Congress has wisely decided to keep it free from \ntaxation, not to subject the Internet to taxation. Well, unfortunately, \nwe are at the precipice of that long tradition changing. If the Senate \nrefuses to take action, the Internet will be taxed this November.\n  For a decade and a half, Americans have been able to use the Internet \nall across the country free of taxes, and Republicans and Democrats \nhave agreed on this basic principle. There is not a lot of agreement in \nthis town on much of anything, including what time of day it is. Yet on \nInternet taxes--in 1998 President Bill Clinton signed the law banning \nInternet taxes. Congress has extended it three times--in 2001, 2004, \nand 2007.\n  Today there is a bipartisan coalition on the record to keep the \nInternet tax free. The senior Democratic Senator from New York and the \nsenior Democratic Senator from Wisconsin both publicly support keeping \nthe Internet free from taxation. Conservatives in the Senate, such as \nthe junior Republican Senator from Utah, the junior Republican Senator \nfrom Florida, and the senior Republican Senator from Louisiana, agree \nas well. There are 52 cosponsors in the Senate on the bill by the \nsenior Democratic Senator from Oregon, who is here with us, to keep the \nban on Internet taxes.\n  This should be easy. This should be a matter of easy agreement \nbecause rarely is there an issue that has united parties so broadly as \nkeeping the Internet tax free. Yet, unfortunately, this session of the \nSenate is also seeing politicians who want to extend sales taxes to the \nInternet, who want to subject small businesses, mom-and-pops, \nbusinesses started by people just wanting to build a business, to \ncrushing sales taxes from 9,600 jurisdictions nationwide.\n  I am passionate in saying we should fight against taxing the \nInternet, and we should not open the door to Internet taxes. The \naverage tax rate right now on telephone services and other voice \nservices is 17 percent. The average tax rate on cable and video \nservices is 12 percent. If this Senate does not act, you are going to \nsee consumers in States such as Montana and South Dakota and \nMassachusetts, on November 1, begin paying taxes for having basic \nInternet service. Those State laws are already in effect and will go \ninto effect on Internet services.\n  I would note for the Senators who represent Montana and South Dakota \nand Massachusetts that come November 2--which, I might note, is right \nbefore an election day--anyone in those States should be prepared to \nanswer questions from their citizens on why the Senate stood by and let \ntaxes be raised on their citizens just for having an Internet \nconnection.\n  Americans are struggling to pay their bills in the Obama economy. \nLife has gotten harder and harder for working men and women in this \ncountry. Life has gotten harder and harder for the most vulnerable \namong us--for young people, for Hispanics, for African Americans, for \nsingle moms. The last thing we should be doing is playing politics and \njacking up taxes on people accessing the Internet.\n  I would note that the U.S. House of Representatives has already \nacted. On July 15 the House voice voted H.R. 3086, the Permanent \nInternet Tax Freedom Act. It had 228 cosponsors. My friend Senator \nWyden has introduced the Senate version of it, S. 1431. It has 52 \ncosponsors, including 18 Democrats. This ought to be something where we \nstop playing games and say let's all come together and agree: Do not \ntax the Internet. Yet, unfortunately, we are not in that situation. \nUnfortunately, we are seeing an objection to the House-passed bill, to \na bill that has the support of a majority of Senators. Why? The only \nreason is because there is hope that by holding the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act hostage, it can become a vehicle to impose sales taxes on \ntransactions over the Internet, to impose sales taxes on every small \nbusiness.\n  I would note one of many wonderful things. It used to be that if you \nwere a single mom and you wanted to start a small business, you wanted \nto make something, you wanted to sit down and make something, whether \nit was a computer program or sweaters for dogs or anything else, it \nused to be that to create a small business took time, it took money, it \ntook infrastructure. You had to have in place warehouses and \ndistributors. You had to have a mechanism to sell your products.\n  Do you know the great thing about the Internet? If you are a single \nmom and you have an idea to start a business, you can put up a Web \nsite, and with FedEx you can deliver anywhere in the country.\n  Anyone all over the country can do it, if you have an idea. Let me \ntell you, my cousin had an idea to sell scarves. She thought she had \nsome good design ideas. My cousin Beatriz worked with her best friend \nto design scarves.\n  If you put up a Web site, suddenly you can sell all over the country. \nWell, what would the Internet sales tax do? It would say that when you \nstart your business, if you start getting customers, you have to \ncollect taxes in 9,600 jurisdictions all over the country. If the \nschool district across the country changes its tax rate from 4.5 \npercent to 4.75 percent, you have to know that and collect that \ndifferential tax. This does not make any sense.\n  We should stand together united in protecting the entrepreneurial \nhaven that is the Internet. We should stand united against taxing the \nInternet.\n  I would note that my friend the Senator from New Hampshire has a long \nand passionate record on this issue as well, and I am happy to yield to \nher for a question on this important topic.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Texas for \ncoming to the floor to talk about this incredibly important issue to \nthe American people.\n  I ask the Senator, isn't it true that for 16 years the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act has prevented politicians nationwide from using the Web as \na piggy bank and has helped commerce thrive by keeping it free from \nburdensome tax restrictions? And isn't it true that by making this \npermanent--the way the House bill does and the way the bill does that \nmy colleague from Oregon has offered that has 52 cosponsors in the \nSenate--we never have to allow the people of this country again to feel \nuncertainty that suddenly this great freedom we have on the Internet is \ngoing to be gone, where they are going to be taxed when they access the \nInternet or that somehow we are going to use the Internet as a way to \nraise money and a way to hurt e-commerce?\n  I would ask that of my colleague from the State of Texas. Is this all\n\n[[Page S5183]]\n\ntrue, that if we can pass the House bill right now--which is similar to \nthe bill offered by my colleague from Oregon--we can give the American \npeople certainty that we are not going to tax what they are doing on \nthe Internet?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from New Hampshire. I would note that she \nis exactly right. We have the ability to do something productive, \nsomething that does not happen in Washington an awful lot. We have the \nability right now to come together in a bipartisan way for the Senate \nto demonstrate that it can function productively to address the \neconomic challenges in this country the way the House has.\n  The House is doing its job. The House has passed this bill. It is the \nSenate that has refused to take it up for a vote. It is the Senate that \nis refusing to do its job. We have an ability not just to protect the \nInternet from taxes but also to honor our word. How many Members of \nthis body, on both sides of the aisle, go to the tech community and \nsay: We want to stand with tech. We want to stand for the \nentrepreneurial vibrancy of tech?\n  Yet I would note anyone objecting to this right now is setting the \nstage for a massive Internet tax. How many of us make the case to young \npeople that we are standing for the future for young people, we are \nstanding for greater opportunity, we are standing for the chance to \nhelp young people achieve the American dream? You know, young \nAmericans, 18 to 29 years old, oppose an Internet sales tax by 73 \npercent to 27 percent.\n  Yet if this body refuses to stand together in a bipartisan manner, we \nare telling young people: What we say on the campaign trial is not \nbacked by action on the floor.\n  We ought to come together on what should be an uncontroversial bill, \na bill that has passed three times before, a bill that was signed by \nPresident Bill Clinton, a bill that in this body is introduced by a \nsenior Democrat. We ought to come together in a bipartisan way to say: \nWe stand in unison protecting Internet tax freedom.\n  Accordingly, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 3086, which was received from the \nHouse. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time and \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Reserving the right to object, I want to first make a \ncouple of points, which as we talk about this, I think it is clear to \nidentify who is the taxing authority. The distinguished and very \nlearned constitutional scholar from the State of Texas knows well that \nthe imposition does not come from this body. The imposition comes from \nStates and local governments which have 10th Amendment sovereign \nrights. They have the ability to finance their own government. They \nhave the ability to make those decisions. Congress has the right to \nmake decisions on their ability, based on a concept that Congress \nultimately has the obligation to control and to deal with interstate \ncommerce. Only in the rarest of circumstances when interstate commerce \nis critically involved has Congress stepped up. It is very rare that \nthis body, or that any previous Congress, has actually dictated the \nconstraints of that sovereign right of States and local governments \nunder the 10th Amendment to impose their own taxes.\n  I can tell you the RRRR Act is probably one of the most glaring \nexamples. During a time in the 1970s when the railroads were struggling \nand different kinds of transportation organizations were struggling, we \nsaw this body step up with a unified approach to improving the \nrailroads. Guess what. The railroads got better. The States know now \nwhat the constraints are, established by this body, very limited on \ntheir ability to do centralized assessments on the railroads.\n  We saw it in something called Public Law 86-272, regarding income \ntaxes--a very narrow exemption to those sovereign rights. Yes, the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act is an exercise of this body's commerce clause \nresponsibility to take a look at what is in the best interests of \nmoving forward. But let's not forget, what we are doing is a very \ninteresting balance responsibility to improve interstate commerce.\n  So when my distinguished colleague suggests that this body is \nimposing any tax, that clearly is a misstatement of the facts today. \nThere is no locality, there is no organization, State organization or \nState body that is required to impose any tax on the Internet or \nrequired to impose any tax on sales tax. So, yes, I believe we too need \nto address the Internet tax moratorium which expires on November 1. But \nwe also need to have a discussion in this context of commerce clause \nresponsibility, to give the States the right to decide whether they \nare, in fact, going to collect State and local taxes and use taxes.\n  I would remind the Senator, the collection responsibility is on the \nuse tax for remote sales. Congress's responsibility and failure to meet \nthat responsibility, of creating an opportunity to level the playing \nfield for Main Street businesses--what do I say? I tell you if you are \nselling a widget in North Dakota and you have bricks and mortar and you \nparticipate in the society, you provide dollars for the schools, you \nprovide scholarship dollars, you collect a sales tax. But if you are a \nremote seller, taking advantage of the same marketplace and competing \ndirectly against that Main Street business, you no longer have that \nresponsibility.\n  So to suggest that this body, by doing any of this, would be imposing \nany taxes on mom and pop ignores the fact that the imposition of this \ntax comes from State and local governments, which all too often my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle say: Closer to the people, the \nmore responsive those State governments are. I would suggest that in \nthe great State of Texas, the current Governor, who is a Republican, \ncertainly has the ability to decide tax policy. The legislatures are \nRepublican and certainly can decide if they want to do any imposition \nof taxes.\n  So with all of that in mind, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2735\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I am going to be brief, having spoken on \nthis already once today. I simply want to highlight my sense of where \nall of this is. Back in 1998, along with Congressman Chris Cox, a \nRepublican Congressman from California, one of the most market-oriented \nindividuals I have ever seen in public service, he and I came together \nto write the original Internet Tax Freedom Act. The reason we did is we \nwere concerned about discrimination, which looked as though it could do \nenormous damage to innovation and the future of the Internet. For \nexample, we saw early on that if someone bought the newspaper in some \njurisdiction online, they would pay a hefty tax. But if they bought the \nsnail-mail edition, they would pay no tax.\n  So Congressman Cox and I, on a bipartisan basis, came together and \nsaid: ``We do not want to see that kind of discrimination against the \nfuture. We do not want to see that kind of discrimination against \ninnovation and technology.'' So that is what the Internet Tax Freedom \nAct was all about in 1998. The subsequent reauthorizations were all \nabout trying to build on that enormous success.\n  Congressman Cox and I thought the Internet tax freedom bill would be \na success back in 1998. It has far exceeded expectations in terms of \npromoting innovation and small business and many of the concerns that \nall three colleagues have touched on.\n  So then to fast forward to today, I am the author of the legislation, \nwith our colleague from South Dakota, Senator Thune, of the permanent \nInternet tax freedom extension. I will just say to colleagues: I would \nlike nothing more--nothing more--than to be able to stand here today to \nsee this enormously valuable piece of legislation made permanent now.\n  The reality, however, is--and we have seen it and heard about it--\nthere are objections on both sides at this point to seeing the bill I \nwrote with Senator Thune--and Senator Cruz correctly notes that more \nthan half of the Senate has co-sponsored--we have objections to seeing \nthat bill move today. So the best thing that can be done now, for the \nhundreds of millions of American Internet users and the economy for \nwhich the Internet is a lifeline, is to extend the current ban until it \nis\n\n[[Page S5184]]\n\npossible to lock in a path to pass a permanent extension.\n  This is not a political issue. That point has been made. There are a \nnumber of Democrats and Republicans who join myself and Senator Thune \nin supporting the permanent moratorium. There are a number of \nRepublicans and Democrats opposing the extension of that moratorium, \nreluctantly. We will have that debate. They seem to think it is okay to \nimpose discriminatory taxes on the Internet.\n  So it seems to me that no one who supports keeping the moratorium in \nplace ought to object to a short-term extension now. Doing so only \nmakes it more likely that Internet access and services would be subject \nto discriminatory taxation.\n  Let me now, in the interest of time, simply ask unanimous consent the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of S. 2735, a 2-month extension of \nthe Internet Tax Freedom Act, to December 31, 2014, the text of which \nis at the desk; that the bill be read three times and passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, reserving the right to object. First of \nall, let me say to my colleague from Oregon, I share what you have \ndescribed and the work that you did in bringing forth the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act. The success we have seen from keeping the Internet free \nfrom discriminatory taxes has been astounding. So I commend the Senator \nfor that.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of your permanent act that you have with the \nSenator from South Dakota. I appreciate that you recognize how \nimportant it is that we keep this freedom for our Internet that has \nbeen so productive for the American people and, frankly, giving people \nfrom all walks of life access to this great tool on the Internet. So I \nthank my colleague from Oregon for that.\n  Unfortunately, I object. I want to note today that I am reserving my \nright to object because to extend this only to December 31 is to invite \nuncertainty to the American people.\n  I think the American people have had enough of these dramatic New \nYear's Eve moments in this body where they are wondering: Are we going \nto act upon important things, like will we ensure that the Internet \nremains free from discriminatory taxes? I know my colleague from Oregon \nshares the same goals.\n  But to put this to December 31, the lameduck of this body, at a \nmoment where we can all be sitting here on New Year's Eve and the \nAmerican people again can be looking at us saying: Why do you all leave \nthis to the very last minute on something that has 52 cosponsors and is \nthe right thing to do for the American people? We should give them \ncertainty now by extending this law permanently.\n  I also note that if this is going to be extended into the lameduck \nsession, I am very worried about the shenanigans that are going to \nhappen. The shenanigans are on an issue that the Senator from Oregon \nand I are quite passionate about, and that is the so-called Marketplace \nFairness Act my colleague from North Dakota just referenced, which, \ninstead of the Marketplace Fairness Act, I like to call the Internet \nSales Tax Selection Act.\n  My colleague from North Dakota mentioned that this is about the State \nand local selecting taxes. I respect that State and localities should \nbe able to collect taxes. But for States such as Oregon and New \nHampshire which don't have a sales tax, why should our businesses or \nwhy should any Internet business in this country take on the \nresponsibility which has traditionally been the responsibility of State \nand local governments to collect taxes?\n  Under the so-called Market Fairness Act, what would happen is \nInternet businesses across this country--including in States such as \nOregon and New Hampshire--would become the sales tax collectors for \nalmost 10,000 tax jurisdictions in this country, which is a \nbureaucratic nightmare for so many thriving Internet businesses. It is \nan anathema to States such as ours--Oregon and New Hampshire--which \nhave chosen not to have a sales tax.\n  Most importantly, to subject our great online businesses to the \npotential that they could be subject to an audit in almost 10,000 \ntaxing jurisdictions to me is the opposite of what I know my colleague \nfrom Oregon is trying to accomplish with all the work he has done in \nthis body, not only on the Wyden-Thune Internet Tax Freedom Forever \nAct--which I fully support--but all the other work he has done to make \nsure the Internet remains free and prosperous in this country for the \nbenefit of all the American people.\n  So I object to what my colleague from Oregon has offered. I think a \nshort-term fix is no fix at all. In fact, it leaves the American people \nagain uncertain that we will protect their rights against \ndiscriminatory taxes that can be imposed on them over the Internet, and \nit also invites shenanigans with the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act \nthat can get attached.\n  I know some of my colleagues have talked about the potential of \nattaching this unfair act, which I would like to call the Internet \nSales Tax Collection Act, which makes our online businesses across this \ncountry the sales tax collectors for almost 10,000 tax jurisdictions in \nthis Nation.\n  So, for those reasons, I object. I would like to see what my \ncolleague from Oregon has put forth--which is excellent legislation, \nand I thank him for that--which is permanent tax freedom for the \nInternet.\n  With that, I believe the Senator from Texas would also like to be \nheard on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I wish to briefly explain to people \nwatching the back-and-forth that just occurred what is going on here, \nbecause it is easy to not understand everything that is happening. \nThere are three things going on here:\n  No. 1, what we are unfortunately seeing is the Senate holding one \nbill hostage in order to try to force through another unpopular bill.\n  There are two bills concerning the Internet. The first is the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act. That has been in place for over a decade. It \nhas had bipartisan support. It has been championed by the Senator from \nOregon who has been an outspoken and passionate advocate of making sure \nthat when you and I go and sign up for the Internet, we don't face \ntaxes for getting Internet service, and it has worked very well. That \nlaw has always been an area of bipartisan agreement.\n  But there is a second law that has been proposed in this body but not \npassed. The second law is the Internet sales tax, what its proponents \ncall the Marketplace Fairness Act. The Internet sales tax is not \nfocused on taxing someone just for signing up to the Internet. Rather, \nthe people being punished by the Internet sales tax are all the small \nbusinesses trying to sell their wares online, and there are a number of \nSenators who very much want to impose taxes on those small businesses \nin 9,600 jurisdictions nationwide.\n  What is happening here, right now, is even though no one has serious \nobjection to the Internet Tax Freedom Act, we are, unfortunately, \nseeing our colleagues from the Democratic side of the aisle hold that \nbill hostage in an effort to try to force through the Internet sales \ntax.\n  I would note the reason my friend from New Hampshire had no choice \nbut to object to the 2-month proposal is the 2-month time period was \nnot picked out of a hat. Two months means the Internet Tax Freedom Act \nwould expire during a lameduck session. And why is that? Because in a \nlameduck session there are a bunch of Members who have been defeated, \nwho aren't going to face voters ever again. A lameduck session is the \nsession most likely to raise taxes.\n  So why is it there is an effort to extend this just 2 months? So when \nthe Internet Tax Freedom Act expires in the lameduck, the Members of \nthis body who lost their election and are immune from democratic \naccountability will all come together and say: OK, now let's pass the \nInternet sales tax. We shouldn't be holding the Internet hostage to the \nrapacious desire of tax collectors.\n  A second point I want to make about what is going on here--this is \nabout discriminatory taxes, not about federalism. My friend, the \nSenator from North Dakota, was a learned attorney general who talked \nabout the 10th\n\n[[Page S5185]]\n\nAmendment and federalism. I welcome seeing friends of mine on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle embrace the 10th Amendment. I look forward \nand hope aspirationally that friends on the Democratic side of the \naisle will embrace the 10th Amendment on other issues.\n\n  I would note, however, that the constitutional history we were told \nwas a little bit off, because if we look at the history of our country, \noriginally we had the Articles of Confederation. The Articles of \nConfederation allowed States to enact discriminatory taxes against each \nother, and it led to chaos. It didn't work. One of the reasons our \nConstitution was adopted was to prevent discriminatory taxes, one State \npicking on another State.\n  So when Congress was given the authority to regulate interstate \ncommerce, it is precisely to prevent a little mom and pop selling \nonline from being forced by 9,600 jurisdictions nationwide to collect \nall of those taxes. If someone is living and working in the State of \nTexas, they shouldn't have to collect taxes for New York or \nCalifornia--for politicians they don't get to vote for. For politicians \nthey don't get any input on, they shouldn't be forced to collect their \ntaxes.\n  Indeed, for the approach of Members of this body who want to pass the \nInternet sales tax, recall President Reagan's famous admonition:\n\n       Government's view of the economy could be summed up in a \n     few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, \n     regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.\n\n  Why don't we stop it at the outset? The Internet is moving. It is \ngenerating entrepreneurial steam throughout this country. We haven't \nbeen taxing it. Let's not start now.\n  The third and final point I will make about what this exchange is \nabout is, more than anything, this exchange is about crony capitalism.\n  I would note the Presiding Officer today has been quite passionate \ndiscussing the corruption in Washington that favors big business. What \nwe just saw on this Senate floor illustrates that as powerfully as \nanything that has happened this year. Because what is the Internet \nsales tax all about? It is about a coalition of big businesses coming \ntogether, both big bricks-and-mortar retailers and big online retailers \ncoming to their elected officials, saying: You know what. We don't like \ncompetition. These little guys, these little upstarts, these single \nmoms who start businesses and compete with us, we don't like that. So \nlet's go to our friends in Washington--our friends, mind you, whom we \nhold campaign fundraisers for, whose campaigns we contribute to--and \nlet's get the Congress to come together and hammer every small online \nbusiness we can.\n  That is what we are seeing. This is crony capitalism. This is a law \ndesigned to benefit big companies and hurt small startups.\n  The beauty of our country is that anybody can come to this country \nwith nothing but a hope and a dream and a vision and achieve anything. \nIt is because the entrepreneurial vibrancy of this country gives the \nlittle guy a chance. Yet I am sorry to say Washington more and more \nbehaves as though it is for sale to the highest bidder.\n  Right now, today, the top 1 percent in our country earns a higher \nshare of our income than any year since 1928. We ought to come together \nin a bipartisan way and say: Stop being the handmaidens of big \nbusiness. Stop using government to make it harder for the little guy, \nfor young people, for single moms, for Hispanic and African-American \nentrepreneurs. Stop making it harder for them to achieve the American \ndream. Stop pulling up the ladder so the big companies can say: We have \ngot ours; nobody else gets theirs.\n  When big business comes to Washington and says: We want government's \nhelp stifling small business, both parties should stand together and \nsay: Sorry. That is not what the Congress is for. We work for the \nAmerican people. But, I am sorry to say, what we just saw was a \npowerful demonstration that this Senate right now is more interested in \npreserving crony capitalism than it is in protecting mom-and-pops, in \nprotecting opportunity, in protecting Internet tax freedom.\n  But the great thing about our system is at the end of the day, the \nAmerican people don't work for the 100 Members of this body. It is the \nother way around: All 100 of us work for the American people. And I \nwill tell you, the American people are getting fed up. They are getting \nfed up with Members of both parties who spend more time giving in to \nthe corruption of Washington and entrenching power than they do \nremoving barriers to people achieving the American dream.\n  I am hopeful and confident that the voters are waking up, are \nstanding up, and will hold every one of us accountable. Democrats and \nRepublicans, every one of us, will be held accountable: Have you fought \nto make it easier to achieve the American dream or have you simply \npreserved the corrupt crony capitalism of Washington?\n\n  I hope we can together aspire to our better angels. I hope we can \ncome together and keep and preserve in a bipartisan manner Internet tax \nfreedom.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, to briefly respond to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If the Senator would yield for a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of the \nSenator from Oregon, the Senator from Kansas be recognized, following \nthat I then be recognized, and then Senator Sanders from Vermont would \nbe following me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, just to be \nclear: Senator Cornyn would speak next, and then Senator Sanders would \nspeak after him?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the unanimous consent would be the \nSenator from Oregon, the Senator from Kansas, the Senator from Texas, \nand the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, very briefly to describe where I think \nthe Internet tax debate is, we have Republicans and Democrats objecting \nto what I happen to think is in the country's national interest, and \nthat is a permanent ban on Internet tax discrimination. So we have \nRepublicans and Democrats objecting to that.\n  Now my colleague from Texas comes forward and says: OK, let's not do \na 2-month extension because we don't want to consider this in the lame \nduck session. But, colleagues, if you don't do the 2-month extension, \nthe Internet Tax Freedom Act will have expired and you are still in the \nlame duck session. And by the time you get to the lame duck, millions \nof Americans will be vulnerable to discriminatory Internet taxes.\n\n  I am going to close this discussion by saying that in my view neither \nof the options is exactly ideal, because I think I made it very clear \nafter 16 years that I would like to make permanent the ban against \ndiscriminatory taxes. Neither situation is ideal from my standpoint \nbecause Republicans and Democrats both object to doing that today. But \nwhat we know is that one option we have in front of us today is worse \nthan the other, and the really bad option is to not do a short-term \nextension and leave millions of Americans vulnerable to discriminatory \ntaxes.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I wish to speak for a few moments this afternoon on the topic of \nveterans and veterans affairs, knowing, or at least expecting a vote \nlater today on a piece of legislation that has now been compromised \nbetween the House and Senate versions of the bill, and something that I \nlook forward to supporting.\n\n\n                       Honoring Herb Schwartzkopf\n\n  First of all, though, I wish to take a moment to honor a Kansas \nveteran, a veteran who dedicated much of his life to serving our \ncountry, whether that was on active duty in the Navy or advocating on \nbehalf of other veterans,\n\n[[Page S5186]]\n\nMr. Herb Schwartzkopf from Ransom, KS.\n  Mr. Schwartzkopf's many selfless acts began when he served in the \nNavy in Vietnam. After separating from the service, he returned to \nKansas and joined the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the VFW, which he has \nbeen a member of now for more than 35 years. He is considered a life \nmember of the VFW.\n  Last year the Hutchinson News asked Herb about his life and \ndedication to serving his fellow veterans. His response was, ``I will \ntalk about the `V,' but I am not going to talk about me.'' The V is \nHerb's beloved VFW Post, because he is a humble man who has \naccomplished much and his priorities in life have been taking care of \nhis country and taking care of the veterans who have served his \ncountry.\n  The countless contributions Herb Schwartzkopf has made over 35 years \nof advocacy for veterans has earned him the highest honor bestowed by \nthe VFW, the All-American Commander of Post 7972 in Ransom, KS. Herb's \nVFW post serves as a meeting place and a community service hub for the \nLions Club meetings and Thanksgiving feasts for the 296 residents of \nhis hometown. It is also a place for raising funds for local cancer \npatients and victims, helping fund annual Honor Flights to come see the \nWorld War II Memorial by Kansas veterans. The 160 members of Post 7972 \ncomplete more than 250 service projects and volunteer more than 4,000 \nhours a year.\n  His leadership at the VFW post has deservedly won the National \nCommunity Service Post of the Year award five times, including 3 years \nin a row for 2009, 2010, and 2011.\n  The Ransom VFW's success is a result of true selflessness. As Herb \nput it: ``If something comes up and somebody needs help, we just try to \nrise to the occasion.'' It seems only fitting that he has earned this \nprestigious award as All-American Post Commander.\n  I pay tribute to him, to his post, his service to our country, and \nhis service to other Kansans, and thank him for that care and concern \nfor other veterans across the country. So I say thank you for your \nselfless dedication. On behalf of all Kansans, we wish you well and we \nare fortunate to have you as a citizen of our State and a citizen of \nour Nation.\n\n\n                        Toxic Exposure Research\n\n  I also want to speak about legislation today that has been introduced \nby Senator Blumenthal and me. It is an issue that Senator Blumenthal \nbrought to my attention and today we have introduced the Toxic Exposure \nResearch Act of 2014.\n  We unfortunately live in a nation where men and women volunteer their \nservices to sacrifice and support us to have the strongest, freest, \ngreatest Nation in the world. When servicemembers raise their right \nhand and take the oath of enlistment or commissioning, they commit \ntheir lives to support and defend the Constitution of the United States \nand to protect the freedoms we hold dear.\n  Standing by their side through combat tours and multiple duty \nstations around the world is their family. We should and we must \nacknowledge that their family members are being called to sacrifice for \nour Nation as well.\n  The Toxic Exposure Research Act is about addressing the wounds of war \nthat might impact a servicemember's family--wounds that may not be \nevident for decades later when it is passed on to the next person of \ntheir family or the next generation. This legislation would provide for \nthe research on health conditions of dependents of veterans who were \nexposed to toxins during their service to our Nation such as Agent \nOrange in Vietnam, gulf war neurotoxins, burn pits in Iraq, or other \nchemicals from recent conflicts overseas.\n  I am not a veteran, but my life has been shaped by the fact that the \nVietnam war took place during my high school years. Many of my \nconversations in high school were spent talking to those who were a few \nyears older than I who were volunteering or being drafted, and for \nthose who returned home to my hometown after their service in Vietnam.\n  During Vietnam, many of our veterans were exposed to Agent Orange and \nyears later many veterans and their families are still struggling with \nthe side effects of that exposure. Agent Orange specifically has been \nshown to cause birth defects in children of military members who came \nin contact with the toxin during the Vietnam war. There are other \npoisons from wars since Vietnam that have led to life-altering health \nproblems and painful tragedies among veterans and their families.\n\n  A story of Herb Worthington and his daughter Karen is compelling. Mr. \nWorthington was drafted to serve in Vietnam and was exposed to Agent \nOrange. Years after his service came to an end he suffered from many \nconditions as a proven result of his exposure to Agent Orange. His \ndaughter has battled MS for more than 19 years and has been treated for \nother conditions such as melanoma and an extremely painful nerve \ncondition. Her life has been handicapped by health problems and various \nkinds of illnesses which must be studied in connection with the \nexposure of her father and what he experienced with Agent Orange.\n  Stories like Mr. Worthington's and his daughter Karen's have been \nshared all across the country in townhall meetings. I have heard them \nin stories at home in Kansas and they have been collected by the \nVietnam Veterans of America. This is an issue that is important to all \nveterans. It is important to all Americans that we live up to our \ncommitment to those who serve, and it is time we take necessary steps \nto help and protect their families now and for generations to come. \nMany people we will never know may be affected by the consequences of \ntheir mother, father, grandmother, or grandfather's service to their \ncountry. Clear evidence of unsettling conditions and those personal \nstories warrant the need to collect data to research and study the \nconsequences of these toxins.\n  I invite my colleagues to learn more about these conditions and the \nimpact they are having on family members of veterans by checking out a \nsocial media page, Faces of Agent Orange, through the Vietnam Veterans \nAssociation, VVA. The fact is many symptoms from toxic exposure are \nmisdiagnosed in descendants of veterans because of lack of \nunderstanding and lack of scientific proof.\n  I would ask my colleagues to join us in giving the authority to the \nSecretary--the new Secretary we confirmed earlier this week--a tool he \nneeds so he can designate a VA medical center as a national center for \nresearch on the diagnosis and treatment of health conditions of \ndescendants of individuals or soldiers exposed to toxic substances \nduring their service to our country, during their time as military \nmembers.\n  This legislation would establish an advisory board of experts to \nadvise the national center and the VA Secretary with determining the \nhealth conditions studied and those that are a result of toxic \nexposure.\n  The Department of Defense has a role to play here in this research, \nsharing incidents of military members who were exposed to substances, \nto enhance the studies and outcomes conducted by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. Ultimately our hope is this medical research would \ndetermine those conditions that are the result of debilitating toxins \nand lead to appropriate support and benefits, cures and treatments for \nfamily members.\n  Military families support our Nation in their love and commitment to \nthose who served in the Armed Forces, and they should not inherit the \npainful residual wounds of war that put their lives at risk long after \nthe military operation is over. Toxic exposure research is a necessary \nstep toward making certain our military men and women and their \ndescendants will be properly cared for. It is also a step toward making \ncertain that those toxins are not used in a way that causes this to be \nrepeated again in any future war.\n  We must keep our promises to our veterans and to their families who \nhave made the greatest sacrifice for the sake of our country, our \nsecurity, our freedom, and our country's future.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                             Border Crisis\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, later on today I expect we would be \nvoting on the emergency supplemental appropriation that the President \nhad requested to deal with the humanitarian crisis on the Texas border. \nOver the past few weeks I have spoken about\n\n[[Page S5187]]\n\nthis and made several trips down to the valley. I will be leaving \ntonight along with colleagues. There is a bipartisan congressional \ndelegation going down again to the valley and to Lackland Air Force \nBase where about 1200 children are currently being housed by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services pending their placement with \ntheir relatives in the country.\n  As part of this discussion we have been having in the search for \nsolutions to this unexpected flood of humanity in the form of \nunaccompanied children coming across the southwestern border, many of \nus are trying to figure out exactly what the cause of this flood is. In \nfact, I think it is probably more than one cause. I think perhaps it is \nthe President's statements that he is going to defer action or refuse \nto enforce our current immigration laws against a certain class of \nimmigrants that is known as the President's deferred executive action \norder of 2012.\n  But there is also another cause that has been recognized on a \nbipartisan basis, and this is a 2008 human trafficking law that passed \nessentially unanimously in 2008, because we were focused on one \nproblem; that is, human trafficking, but the unexpected consequences or \nunintended consequences of that created a business model that is being \nexploited by the transnational criminal organizations, or cartels, as \nthey traffic in human beings coming from Central America through Mexico \nup to the Texas border.\n  Together with my colleague in the House, Henry Cuellar, a Democrat, \nwe have introduced a bipartisan, bicameral reform, something we call \nthe HUMANE Act, and it has been cosponsored by people who have \nsupported the so-called Gang of 8 bill in the Senate and people who \nopposed the Gang of 8 bill.\n  I raise that point to note that this isn't about comprehensive \nimmigration reform. We have a lot of work to be done. But this is \nactually intended to solve this immediate problem right in front of our \neyes and to stop this hemorrhaging on our southwestern border. My hope \nis once we address that problem, we can come together in a bipartisan \nway and address the larger defects in our immigration system, of which \nthere are many. This is, simply put, an attempt to tackle a national \nemergency.\n  Let me briefly recapitulate what I am talking about. Since October of \nlast year 57,000 unaccompanied children have been detained on the \nsouthwestern border. Under current law--this 2008 law I mentioned--\nthese children are processed by the Border Patrol and they are placed \nwith the Department of Health and Human Services, as it turns out an \naverage of 35 days, and then placed with a family member in the United \nStates or, if not a family member, some sponsor.\n  Part of the problem is that they are given a notice to appear at a \nfuture court hearing and very few of them appear. Thus, they are \nsuccessful in making their way from Honduras, El Salvador, or Guatemala \nup through Mexico into the United States, and end up successfully \nimmigrating to the United States illegally, outside of our broken \nimmigration system.\n  What we need to do in order to fix that gap in the law, that loophole \nwhich was unintended by those of us who voted to pass the 2008 law, is \nto require that these children be held in protective custody and given \na speedy hearing in front of an immigration judge for those who want to \nmake the claim for asylum or some other relief. But the truth is the \nvast majority of these children, like the adults, will not have a claim \nto stay under existing law and our bill doesn't change that existing \nlaw. But for those who do, they have a speedy opportunity to appear in \nfront of a judge and make that claim. Those who do not have a valid \nclaim will simply be returned to their home country, to their family.\n  This morning I was invited, along with Members of the House and the \nSenate, to visit with the President about national security matters. He \ntalked about Ukraine, he talked about Syria, he talked about Gaza, and \nall of the hot spots around the world. I used the opportunity to ask \nthe President what he proposed that we do when this emergency \nsupplemental bill goes down this afternoon.\n  The reason this bill will fail is because the majority leader simply \nis asking us to appropriate money and do nothing to fix the problem we \nhave attempted to address in the HUMANE Act with Congressman Cuellar \nthat I mentioned a moment ago.\n  In essence, the President asked for a blank check, when he himself \nacknowledged this morning in my presence and the presence of a \nbipartisan group of Senators and Congressmen that he knows we need to \naddress this problem or it will just get worse if we don't address it.\n  It is quite remarkable to me that the President of the United States \nacknowledges we have a problem we need to address. When the Secretary \nof Homeland Security, who is trying to use the tools available to him \nto solve this crisis but knows he needs more tools and more authority, \nat the same time the President makes that acknowledgment, and at the \nsame time his Secretary of Homeland Security identifies the need for \nadditional authority in order to address the problem, the President has \nreported he wants to actually expand this deferred action Executive \norder he issued in 2012 and say to the people who are coming to our \ncountry outside of our immigration laws: It is OK. You can stay here. \nThere are no consequences associated with that.\n  The problem with that is the message that is being sent to the \ncartels who traffic in human beings and make a lot of money off of it--\nlike I said a moment ago, this is part of their business model--by \nexploiting this loophole in the law.\n  What sort of message does this send to the families who would send \ntheir children on this horrific journey from Central America through \nMexico on the back of a train called The Beast? They are willing to \nsend their children on this journey even though they could be injured, \nsexually assaulted, kidnapped or held for ransom. We don't know how \nmany of them start the journey but don't make it because of the \nhorrific conditions by the criminal organizations, not to mention the \nexposure to the hot weather and difficult environmental circumstances.\n  By failing to address the root cause of the problem, what we are \nsaying is: That is OK. Keep coming. Indeed, that is why it is projected \nthat of the 57,000 unaccompanied children who have made it here so far \nand have been detained--by the way, they are not trying to evade \ndetection by Border Patrol. They are turning themselves in because they \nrealize they will be processed and placed with Health and Human \nServices, and essentially, by and large, they will be able to stay. \nThat is what we need to address.\n  Unfortunately, the House tried to work together today to pass a bill \nthat would, I believe, have provided more money, as the President \nrequested--not as much as he requested, but an emergency appropriation, \ntogether with the reforms to that 2008 law which would have addressed \nthis problem.\n  Unfortunately, because the House of Representatives could not get any \nDemocratic support, that bill failed and so the Speaker of the House \npulled the bill from the floor. As a result, they will not be able to \npass any legislation to send over to the Senate. That should not cause \nany of our colleagues here in the Senate much joy because the fact of \nthe matter is the House has its independent duty to act and we have our \nown duty to act, and we can and should do that this afternoon.\n  We should do what the House attempted to do, which is to pass a \nslimmed-down appropriations bill on an emergency basis to help surge \nresources to the border but at the same time find a way to come \ntogether and plug the hole in this 2008 law, which is necessary to stop \nthe problem--at least on this surgical basis.\n  What is so confusing is to listen to the President talk in his \nconference room at the White House about this and acknowledge the \nnature of the problem, and then to see that the White House threatened \nto veto the legislation that the House was considering. There are a lot \nof mixed messages, to say the least, with regard to the President's \ncommitment to actually enforce the law. We know that in too many \ninstances he has simply refused to enforce the law, and our immigration \nlaw is just one of those. But to hear such mixed messages out of the \nWhite House and the administration that yes, we need to act--we should \nnot\n\n[[Page S5188]]\n\njust write a blank check. We ought to do the policy reforms with it \nthat would solve the problem.\n  I will just add that in talking to Secretary Johnson--I don't think I \nam disclosing any confidence he himself wouldn't repeat--there is \nactually an earlier experience we had in 2005 and 2006 which I think is \nvery instructive and which we have discussed.\n  Secretary Chertoff was Secretary of Homeland Security when President \nBush was in the White House and we had a surge of people coming from \ncountries other than Mexico, so-called OTMs--in this case Brazilians. \nIn 2005, we saw a surge of 30,000 Brazilian immigrants at the \nsouthwestern border. Upon investigation, they realized the reason we \nsaw a surge in these numbers was because of a policy known as catch and \nrelease--colloquially.\n  In other words, people came to the country, were caught, given notice \nto appear at a future court hearing, and they simply disappeared and \nmelted into the great American landscape, knowing they would \nsuccessfully immigrate illegally into the United States.\n  It is the same policy of catch and release that is causing this surge \nof unaccompanied minors, not to mention single adults with young \nchildren. We don't have adequate detention facilities for them, so they \nare released, given a bus ticket, and told to come back for their court \nhearing a year or more later. And they simply never show up.\n\n  We have all been noticing with great concern this humanitarian crisis \nat the border and the conflicting and contradictory messages and \nactions coming out of Washington, DC. So it was not really all that \nsurprising to me to see a new poll that was reported this morning where \n68 percent of the respondents disapproved of the President's handling \nof the immigration issue--68 percent. According to the Washington Post \nthis morning, no other single issue trumps immigration in terms of \nPresidential disapproval. That is a shocking number.\n\n       Unfortunately, when I asked the President today: What \n     happens, Mr. President, when we leave for the August recess \n     and nothing happens to address this problem? He said: Well, \n     one thing we are going to have to do is reprogram money from \n     other programs and use that money to address this hole and \n     this surge needed at the southwestern border.\n\n  I was disappointed the President didn't say what I was hoping he \nwould say, and that is: I am going to call majority leader Harry Reid, \nand I am going to tell him he needs to allow a vote on some of the \namendments we are going to offer, such as the Humane Act, on this \nemergency supplemental, and give the Senate an opportunity to vote for \na solution and not just another blank check. Unfortunately, I didn't \nhear that commitment from the President.\n  As a result, this afternoon we are going to leave this city and go \nback home without doing anything to address what the President himself \nhas called a humanitarian crisis. The problem is just going to get \nworse. As long as the magnet exists, as long as this business model \nthat the cartels have figured out continues to be lucrative and they \ncontinue to make money exploiting it and we don't do anything to fix \nit, the numbers will get worse and worse. And as we see children being \nplaced in literally warehouse-type settings around the country, we are \ngoing to continue to see more and more backlash from the American \npeople as they realize the Federal Government is failing in its most \nbasic function, which is to secure our border and enforce our laws.\n  Unfortunately, this is what Presidential abdication of duty looks \nlike. The President identified a national emergency, but has done \nvirtually nothing to address it. Indeed, he said: We have a problem, \nand we need to fix it. He then threatened to veto the very legislation \nthe House proposed would fix it.\n  This is what happens when a President openly and proudly is \ncontemptuous of his obligation to faithfully enforce the law of the \nland by not only issuing an Executive order in 2012 that is beyond his \nlegal authority to do but also by saying that because Congress has not \ndone what I want them to do as far as reforming our immigration laws, I \nam going to further expand my Executive order and refuse to enforce the \nlaw with regard to more and more people. That is not a secret. It is \nwell reported in the newspapers and on television, and it is not lost \non the people who make money exploiting this system nor the people who \nwant to come to the United States outside of our immigration laws.\n  Sadly, I can only conclude that although the President plainly knows \nwhat we need to do, as do his cabinet members, and although prominent \nDemocrats have plainly identified what we need to do to fix the \nproblem, when he doesn't demand that the majority leader allow a vote \nand a solution to that problem, I can only conclude that he is \nlistening to his political advisers and not making the best judgment \nthat is in the best interest of the American people. I can't explain it \nany other way.\n  So on in one last attempt this afternoon to address this crisis, I, \nalong with several of my colleagues, am introducing an alternative to \nthis blank check that the President has requested and Majority Leader \nReid will set for a vote. It will include many of the reforms I \nmentioned earlier in the Humane Act, but specifically our legislation \nwould treat all unaccompanied minors the same under the law. It would \ncorrect that loophole in the 2008 law that treats unaccompanied minors \nfrom Mexico differently from unaccompanied children from noncontiguous \ncountries. It would give Federal, State, and local authorities the \nresources they need in order to manage the crisis. It would improve our \ndetention capacity so we would end this catch and release which is \nbeing exploited, and it would ensure safe repatriation by filing for \nprotective custody for all those children who don't qualify for an \nimmigration benefit under current law.\n\n  Our bill would prevent the Obama administration also from \nunilaterally creating yet another deferred action program that would \nfurther add gasoline to this fire and cause these numbers to continue \nto grow and the humanitarian crisis to expand. In other words, our bill \nwould help resolve the current crisis and would help prevent a similar \ncrisis from occurring in the future.\n  Under the Senate procedures, the only person who can make the \ndecision whether the Senate will have an opportunity to vote on such a \nreform is the majority leader, and he has already announced that he \nintends not to allow us to offer that reform. So I expect we will end \nup leaving here today having done nothing, in spite of the fact there \nis bipartisan and bicameral recognition that we are experiencing a \ncrisis and the President and his own cabinet have identified the causes \nbut refuse to do anything about them. To me that is the very definition \nof dysfunction and the very reason that the American people are \nabsolutely disgusted with the refusal of Congress and the executive \nbranch to do what we know needs to be done--and it is a tragedy.\n  I hope the majority leader will reconsider and give us a chance to \nvote on this reform to help solve the problem, and then we can move on \nand address other important problems that face our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                          VA Conference Report\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the VA \nconference committee report, which I expect and hope will be on the \nfloor here in a couple of hours. That conference committee report was \npassed yesterday by the House with an overwhelming vote of 420 to 5, \nand I hope very much our vote here in the Senate will be as strong as \nthe vote in the House.\n  The conference committee legislation that we will be voting on, \nfrankly, is certainly not the legislation I would have written. I think \nit is fair to say it is not the legislation that the chairman of the \nHouse Veterans' Affairs Committee, Jeff Miller, would have written; it \nis, in fact, a compromise, but it is a compromise I can strongly \nsupport, and I hope all of my Senate colleagues will support it as \nwell.\n\n  This bill does a number of very important things to address the \nproblems facing the veterans of our country. Right now veterans in many \nparts of this country are on very long waiting lists before they get VA \nhealth care. I think in the last month or so the VA has made a \nconcerted effort to reach out to those veterans and to get them\n\n[[Page S5189]]\n\ncare when necessary in the private sector, and I think Acting Secretary \nSloan Gibson did a good job in jump-starting that process and saying to \nveterans we are going to do everything we can to get them quality care \nin a timely manner. Obviously, this is an expensive proposition, but it \nis one we have to address.\n  This legislation we will be voting on in a few hours provides $10 \nbillion to make sure every eligible veteran in this country will get \ntimely health care, quality health care, and they will do that through \nthe private sector, through community health centers, through \nDepartment of Defense facilities, and Indian Health Service Clinics \nwhen those facilities work for veterans. If there is a community health \ncenter in a community, the veteran can go in there and the VA will pay \nthat bill. That is the effort we are making to significantly reduce \nthese long waiting lines.\n  This bill also provides a remedy for a condition many of us consider \nto be terribly important, and that is it gets to the root of why it is \nthat we have long waiting periods in many VA facilities around the \ncountry. The reality is that in the last 4 or 5 years we have seen, as \na result of the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan, some 2 million more \nveterans coming into the VA, a net increase of about 1.5 million \npatients. That is a lot of people. There is not the slightest doubt in \nmy mind or in the mind of the VA that if we are going to do justice to \nour veterans, we are going to need more doctors, more mental health \ncounselors, more nurses, more medical personnel in general, so that \nwhen a veteran walks into a VA facility, that veteran will get quality \ncare in a timely manner.\n  I have heard testimony in the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \nwhich was very clear, and what virtually every major veterans \norganization has said is that when veterans get into the system, the \nquality of care they receive is good. It is good. That is not just what \nveterans are saying and what veterans organizations are saying; that is \nwhat a number of independent surveys and studies show us. The problem \nis access, and if we are going to on a long-term basis address that \naccess problem, it is important to make sure we have the doctors, the \nnurses, and the medical personnel we should have. This bill provides $5 \nbillion to make sure we get that personnel.\n  In addition to that, there are many facilities all over the country \nwhere there are very serious space problems. There are not the \nexamination rooms doctors need in order to work efficiently, and this \nlegislation addresses that with a $5 billion appropriation.\n  In addition, there has been legislation passed in the House \noverwhelmingly that says, quite correctly, we need to fund 27 major \nmedical facilities all over this country in 18 States and in Puerto \nRico, and this legislation does that as well.\n  In addition, what this legislation says--and this is mostly \napplicable to our rural States--is that if someone is a veteran living \nhundreds of miles away from a VA facility, when they are sick in the \nmiddle of winter or in the middle of summer, they are not going to have \nto travel hundreds of miles to get their physical therapy or to get the \nhealth care they need. If a veteran is living 40 miles away from a VA \nfacility, they will be able to get their care in their community, again \nthrough a private doctor, through a community health center, through an \nIndian Health Service facility, through a Department of Defense \nfacility.\n  This is a big step forward for many veterans in rural communities who \nwill now be able to get care in the area they live rather than having \nto travel long distances to get health care.\n  This legislation also addresses some other very important issues that \nhave not gotten a whole lot of attention but they are important, and I \nwill mention what they are. All of us know that one of the outrages we \nhave seen in recent years within the military is the very high level of \nsexual assault against women and against men as well. This legislation \nprovides funding for the VA to increase their capability so women and \nmen who are sexually assaulted will be able to come into the VA and get \nthe care they need to address the problems associated with that \nassault, and I think that is a very important step forward.\n  This legislation also takes action we should have taken some years \nago. The post-9/11 GI bill has been enormously successful in providing \neducational opportunities for the men and women who have served in Iraq \nand Afghanistan and people who have served since 9/11. There was a gap \nin that legislation, and that gap was that a spouse of someone who died \nin Iraq or in Afghanistan was not eligible for all of the educational \nbenefits of that post-9/11 GI bill. This legislation remedies that \nomission. It expands the John David Fry Scholarship Program to include \nsurviving spouses of members of the Armed Forces who died in the line \nof duty. That means many young women out there will now have the \nopportunity to get a college education who otherwise would not have, \nand I think we owe that to all of those people who have already \nsuffered so much.\n  This legislation also allows for veterans--all veterans eligible for \nthe post-9/11 GI bill--to qualify for instate tuition under that \nlegislation. This was part of a bill previously passed in the House, \nand we are going to pass it in the Senate.\n  There is another provision in here which is very important. A program \nwhich provides housing for veterans with traumatic brain injury was \nabout to expire. This legislation extends that program for a number of \nyears, which will be a real relief for people who were worried they \nwould be out on the street and not have adequate housing.\n  It has been from day one--from my first day as chairman of the \nveterans committee--my belief that the cost of war in terms of what it \ndoes to the men and women who fight our battles is a lot greater than \nmost Americans fully understand. We all mourn the 6,700-plus men and \nwomen who died in Iraq and in Afghanistan, but we should understand the \ncost of war is much greater than that tragedy. The cost of war is the \nmen and women who came home without legs, came home without arms, \nwithout eyesight, loss of hearing; the cost of war is the 500,000 men \nand women who came home from Iraq and Afghanistan with the signature \nillnesses of this war, which are post-traumatic stress disorder and \ntraumatic brain injury. Those are the signature injuries of this war, \nand we are talking about 500,000 men and women coming home with those \nvery serious problems. In fact, today--just today--and every day close \nto 50,000 veterans are going to get outpatient mental health care in VA \nfacilities all over this country--close to 50,000.\n\n  It has also been my view that when we fully understand the costs of \nwar and the needs of the veterans and their families, it is absolutely \nimperative that we do not make veterans into political pawns. We do not \nsay, yes, we are going to fund veterans' needs, but we are going to cut \nHead Start, we are going to cut the National Institutes of Health or we \nare going to cut education. That is absolutely unfair to our veterans. \nA cost of war is the cost of planes and guns and tanks and aircraft \ncarriers--those are a cost of war. An equally significant cost of war \nis the needs of men and women who fought our battles and who used those \nweapons. What this legislation says and what the House just passed by a \n420-to-5 vote is that taking care of veterans is in fact a cost of war.\n  The CBO has come up with some recent estimates which lower the costs \na little bit. But this bill will put close to--a little bit less than \n$17 billion into VA health care over the next several years. There is \n$5 billion in offsets from within the VA that I was comfortable with \nthat will bring the total cost of this package down to somewhere around \nperhaps $11 billion. Is that a lot of money? It is a lot of money. But \nthat is the cost of war, and that is what happens when millions of \nveterans come home and need the care they are entitled to receive.\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, the House passed this legislation by an \noverwhelming vote of 420 to 5. I wish to thank Chairman Miller in the \nHouse for the work he has done in getting that result. My understanding \nis that in a few hours we will be voting on that bill, and I hope we \ncan pass this legislation with a very strong bipartisan vote.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n[[Page S5190]]\n\n                                 Israel\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, early this week I joined with Senator Boxer \nto introduce the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of \n2014. This is an updated version of bipartisan legislation we \nintroduced in March of last year. It is designed to help the economic \nstrength, the security cooperation between our two countries.\n  As of right now, Senator Boxer and I and 79 of our colleagues, \nincluding the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator \nMenendez, are cosponsors, so 81 Members have cosponsored this \nlegislation at a very important time. I think it sends a message to the \nworld and it sends a message to Israel that our partnership is strong. \nIt sends the message that the Congress, starting with the Senate, is \ncommitted to that partnership. It says that not only do we want to have \nthe kind of defensive understanding we have had so we have joint \ndefense agreements, so we have the kind of equipment and supplies \nstationed in Israel that we need and use in a time of crisis or they \ncould borrow from us in times of crisis, but also the economic \npartnerships in water, energy, in cybersecurity and other information. \nCertainly looking at what is happening in Gaza, looking at the unique \nrelationship between our two countries, where at least two of the \nmembers of the Israeli Defense Forces who have been killed in the last \nfew weeks have also been American citizens. Those two individuals, \nalong with a number of others serving in the defense forces for Israel, \nbacked up and supported by other Americans who go to Israel to support \nthe defense of their country--this is a particularly important time to \nsend this message. It is a message that there is broad agreement on in \na bipartisan way, with virtually 81 Senators agreeing.\n  I will turn to my friend with whom I have worked on this for 2 years \nnow, Senator Boxer, to make a unanimous consent request so our bill can \nbe done and this message sent to Israel and the world before we leave \nthis week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2673\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Israel faces 100 rocket attacks a day from \na terrorist organization called Hamas. Israel is trying to cope with \ngetting rid of tunnels that have been built by this terrorist \norganization, with one purpose: to send terrorists through those \ntunnels so they can kidnap, torture, and kill Israeli citizens.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 492, S. 2673; that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I just want \nto say the partnership Senator Blunt and Senator Boxer have on this \nissue is one that I think is spectacular. I have talked to both of them \nad nauseam about this issue. Senator Blunt and I have had multiple \nconversations this week. He is one of our great leaders in this body \nand is always trying to find a way to come to a solution. Senator Boxer \nand I have worked on another issue this week, and I cannot tell you how \nmuch I have enjoyed working with her office.\n  This is an actual bill. This is not a resolution. In order to try to \nexpedite this being able to come to the floor before we go to the \nAugust recess, we had scheduled a committee meeting here today, one \nimpromptu, but to go through the normal committee process. I thank \nChairman Menendez for his cooperation and willingness to do that.\n  As it was scheduled, it is my understanding that a number of Members \nhad amendments to this bill. I know for that reason--and I understand \nthis fully--the business meeting to actually have a markup in committee \nwas then canceled. I know the chairman of EPW has committee protocol, \nand when committee members want to amend things they try to go through \nthat protocol. I know Senator Blunt, being the leader he has been in \nthe House and here, understands that process.\n  I am going to, over the next hour or so--I have a little time here--\ncheck with committee members and see, relative to the normal protocols, \nhow they might feel about this coming directly to the floor. I just \ntried to do that a minute ago, but knowing this is not the typical way \nof doing things and knowing that people actually had some amendments--I \nknow there were some reservations about the visa waiver process and \nother things--I am going to have to object. I do so with total respect \nfor these two Senators but also for respect for the committee process \nwe all try to work through together. So with that, I object.\n  I do not know how long we are going to be in this evening but----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if you sense some emotion and anger in my \nvoice, I have it. I am shocked and deeply saddened that my friend would \ncome here and object, when for days and days and days he told me--he \ntold me--he would not do this. My friend told me he would not object.\n  This bill has the support of 81 Senators. To come here and object \nthat his committee, which I am so proud to be--as a matter of fact, I \nam a senior person on that committee. My chairman is one of the great \nchairmen of the U.S. Senate. We bent over backward. I wanted to offer \nthis on Monday with Senator Blunt. He was disappointed. I said: I am \ntalking to Senator Corker. We are trying to work together. Eighty one \nSenators support this, and 1 Senator comes and says: Oh, it is a little \nbit--we need to go to the committee. There is a war going on. Hamas has \nput on its channel proudly showing terrorists going through tunnels.\n  This bill is absolutely critical. It is an updated version of the \nbipartisan legislation we introduced last March. We worked for 16 \nmonths. We had issues with the visa waiver. We tried to take it through \nthe committee in May. They tried to attach amendments on Iran. We need \nto work hard with the administration on the Iran issue. It is critical. \nBut there is a war going on. This bill is critical, and I am so \ngrateful to Senator Blunt and all of my cosponsors.\n\n  In passing this bill today, the Senate would send a clear and \nunequivocal message. Let's be clear. We are leaving town. I do not want \nto leave town, but we are leaving town, and we are not going to have a \nchance, with all due respect to my friend, to take a look at this for a \nlong time. This is the time, on the way out the door, to send an \nunequivocal message to our ally.\n  Hamas continues to escalate through those tunnels. We all mourn every \ncivilian life lost--every life lost on either side. Think about it. If \nin our country we had rockets coming over here from Canada or from \nMexico or from the sea into our Nation, what would we do? What would we \ndo?\n  Concrete that was meant to build up Gaza--and I stood at that line \nwhen Israel gave up Gaza, gave it up. I was proud they did it, and I \nthought: What a chance for the Palestinians. I feel for them because \nHamas has taken over and they use that concrete that was meant to \nrebuild for tunnels. I watched the video. I saw the terrorists go \nthrough, proudly bearing their weapons, sneaking up on a post and \nkilling five Israelis. They tried to kidnap their bodies but they were \nunable to do it.\n  So if not now, when is the time to pass this legislation? To say it \nis bipartisan is an understatement. Almost the entire Senate is on it. \nWe all know there are a lot of important issues. My goodness. I am \ngoing to be standing here and talking about a lot of them.\n  This is an emergency. That is why this United States-Israel Strategic \nPartnership Act is so critical, including our assistance for the Iron \nDome missile defense system.\n  What is important in our bill is we increase by $200 million the \nvalue of U.S. weapons we hold, we stockpile in Israel to a total of \n$1.8 billion. At the rate these rockets are coming over, at the rate \nthese tunnels need to be destroyed, we need to act. We need to act. We \nneed to send a clear message to our friend Israel, and it sends a \nmessage to Hamas.\n  I have to say, yes, we have a visa waiver program in here. Guess what \nit does. It treats Israel the same way we treat other countries. I will \nread the names of those countries: Lithuania, Latvia, Hungary, \nSlovakia, Estonia,\n\n[[Page S5191]]\n\nand the Czech Republic. Why shouldn't Israel have that same \nopportunity? We worked on this provision. I know my friend has \nproblems, but we fixed those provisions. We have given maximum \nflexibility on those provisions.\n  So I am sad--that is an understatement--I am distressed, I am shocked \nand stunned that this afternoon, before we go out the door, with 81 \nSenators on a bill--a bill we actually passed a couple years ago, a \nsimilar bill, and the House passed a similar bill--that I have a \nfriend, who is my friend--he is my friend--treating this Senator and \nthe chairman in a way that I think is so unfair and to me betrays all \nthe days that we talked about this, the weeks we talked about this, the \nway we have fixed this legislation.\n  Most of all, I think it is a dark moment--a dark moment--when we \nwould walk away from this opportunity to take a stand against \nterrorism.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I would just like to say that, look, I do \nnot know what happened. We had a committee meeting scheduled today. The \nSenator is right that I agreed not to object to this and also not to \noffer any amendments in committee, and if it came through committee I \nwas perfectly fine with it being unanimously consented to.\n  For some reason, the Senator caused the committee hearing to be \ncalled off. So she is exactly right, I would not be down here objecting \nto something being discharged from committee had the committee meeting \nnot been called off.\n  I say to the chairman--I talked to him late last night. I thank him \nfor trying to make this process work in the right way, and I thank his \nstaff for being willing to set up a committee meeting today. But for \nsome reason, the Senator from California decided she did not want to \nhave the committee meeting.\n  I am sorry she is sad. I am a little emotional now that she would \nsuggest that I would agree to UC something, when I--yes, I will if it \ncomes through committee. I do not understand why the committee was \ncalled off. But apparently the committee--the person sponsoring this \nbill apparently does not want to vote on amendments other members want \nto offer. Not me. I had no idea any members wanted to offer amendments, \nby the way, but they did, and I am sorry this has not worked out \neither. But that is the way it is. I have no idea why the committee \nmeeting was called off. I would love for the Senator to tell me that.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think my colleague knows absolutely the \nreason why. All this is just disingenuous. My friend knows--we \ndiscussed it--that if we load down this bill with extraneous amendments \non other subjects it would never pass. We know that. I have been around \nhere a long time. I know how a bill becomes a law, and thank God I \nlearned it.\n  One thing I know. When you start loading down a very important piece \nof legislation that is emergency legislation with unrelated amendments, \nit is not going to be able to be done on the way out the door, and my \nfriend knows it. We have----\n  Mr. CORKER. Well----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Excuse me. I have the time.\n  My friend can get emotional about process. Be my guest. I am not \nemotional about process. I am emotional about results. How would the \nSenator feel if he had a terrorist group digging tunnels under his \ncities? That is an issue separate and apart from our agreement we have \nto have a good agreement on Iran. But you know when you start amending \nthese bills like that, they are not going to go through on unanimous \nconsent.\n  So I am disheartened, disappointed, saddened, and I think everybody \nknows what has happened here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, let me say one more time, I have no \namendments to offer to this bill. I was in no way going to load down \nthis bill with any amendments. I just asked that it go through a \ncommittee process. By the way, if amendments should not be added to a \nbill, typically what happens is people vote them down. I would assume \nthat had we had a committee meeting today--I know we had one scheduled \nearlier today--extraneous amendments would have been voted down. But \nwith that, I am certainly, I can tell you at this point, ready to \ndismiss this issue. I have no desire to try to call members of the \ncommittee at this moment to try to resolve this. I am very disappointed \nthat the Senator from California would take liberties to say such \nthings that this Senator would come down and agree to a unanimous \nconsent without it going through committee.\n  I thank the chairman again for agreeing to do that. But it was called \noff because there were amendments. I understand that. I really do. But \nthat is the prerogative. I think the Senator from Wyoming--standing in \nthe well--had an amendment he wanted to have heard. I have not even \nseen the amendment. But that is what people do in a committee process. \nAgain, if they do not want it attached to a bill, what they typically \ndo is vote down the amendment.\n  But I am very disappointed in the comments by the Senator from \nCalifornia. It looks as if this will not be heard. I am sorry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I came to the floor in the first \ninstance to support Senator Boxer's unanimous consent request on the \nU.S.-Israel strategic partnership, which, as she has pointed out, has--\nin this institution we do not very often get 81 Members to agree that \nthere is a course of action we want to take. She and Senator Blunt have \nacquired 81 cosponsors--including me and a majority of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee--to do exactly that.\n  Given the current situation in the region, I think the legislation \nsends the right message at the right time. Israel clearly has a right \nto self-defense. No country should stand by while thousands of rockets \nare being launched at it and a terrorist organization next door digs \ntunnels to funnel fighters into its country to kill its citizens. That \nis what is happening.\n  Part of the effort of this legislation, the U.S.-Israel cooperation--\nwell, one example is an antimissile system called Iron Dome, which is \nan example of what our two countries can do together--save lives \nthrough technological advancement and defense cooperation. I think \nthese are incredibly important opportunities.\n  Beyond that, given the advances in shared achievement that have \nresulted from this U.S.-Israel partnership, this bill authorizes the \nPresident to further enhance cooperation in the fields of water, \nenergy, homeland security, agriculture, and alternative-fuel \ntechnology.\n  But the U.S.-Israel partnership extends far beyond our excellent \nsecurity partnership. Senator Boxer's legislation does just that. It \nauthorizes increased, enhanced, and enriched cooperation that reflects \nthe critical importance of our bilateral relationship. It goes into \nIsrael's energy security.\n  Not long ago Israel was completely dependent on energy imports, but \ngiven recent discoveries they may soon be energy independent. But they \nneed help. Thanks in part to work by Senator Landrieu, this bill would \nhelp provide the technical know-how on how to regulate a responsible \nnatural gas extraction industry, how to charge and collect royalties, \nand how to plan for distribution and export networks. In other words, \nthis bill can help make Israel an energy provider for the region and \nfor Europe, greatly enhancing Israel's energy security and forming \nimportant economic ties with its neighbors.\n  There are a lot of reasons for the Senate to pass this legislation \nand particularly to do so now.\n  Let me address the process question. The ranking member did ask me \nlate yesterday to have a markup. When we talk about process, we called \nfor a markup in short order, without the regular timeframe, but also \nwith what was, for me, an understanding that there were going to be no \namendments. It was going to be an up-or-down vote on the legislation. \nIf I had understood there were going to be amendments offered, then we \nwould have had to have\n\n[[Page S5192]]\n\na timeframe to know what amendments they were going to be so Members \ncould consider what those amendments are and could judge them--not at \nthe spur of the moment when we sat down and convened a meeting but so \nthey could make an informed judgment.\n  Because it was a truncated process, which I was trying to accommodate \nthe ranking member on, and because I felt we were going to go through \nbasically an up-or-down vote, I called for the meeting. But then, \nunbeknownst to us, all of a sudden we were told there were going to be \na series of amendments--amendments which were not even filed and for \nwhich there was no timeframe and therefore would come at a moment's \nnotice when the meeting was convened and with no one having had the \nopportunity to understand the nature, substance, or consequences of \nthose amendments. In my mind, that is not regular order.\n  So maybe there was a misunderstanding, but because there was a clear \nunderstanding, from my perspective, to do it in an irregular fashion--\nvery short notice, with no amendment filing deadlines--but in order to \naccommodate the concern that legislation should not come but through \nthe committee and onto the floor, I agreed to a special session, a \nspecial business meeting. Unfortunately, I do not know whether there is \na misunderstanding of agreements here, but that is the nature under \nwhich I agreed.\n  When I found out there were going to be all types of amendments, \nincluding amendments that are extraneous to the subject matter, I \ndecided we could not do that in good order and in reasonable \nconscience, so we pulled down the business meeting.\n  Let me say that I understand we have two concurrent resolutions \npending before the Senate on the use of human shields by Hamas and \nsupporting Israel's security. I support the substance of both of those \nRepublican resolutions. However, I am not willing to allow them to move \nand provide lipservice to Israel's security when Members of the same \nparty are preventing us from taking real action to support Israel's \nsecurity by objecting to this bill, even though I do not question my \ndistinguished colleague, who has worked incredibly well with me over \nthe last year and a half, about what his concerns are about process. \nBut we can't have Members want to offer all types of amendments, \nincluding extraneous amendments to this bill, and then say ``But we are \nasking the chairman to release the resolutions on human shields''--\nwhich I in substance support--``from the committee,'' but when we can \nreally do something for Israel, which is to pass this legislation, to \nsay ``No, we cannot go through this process because it is not regular \norder.'' It is also not regular order to allow resolutions not to come \nthrough the committee as well. I hope that maybe in the timeframe there \nmight be a way to consult with Members on both sides of the aisle to \nsee if there can be a resolution.\n\n  I do not judge anybody's purposes. But let me make it clear for the \nrecord that, yes, we did have a special business meeting. It was out of \nthe regular order as to how we would call such a meeting and the \nprocedures we would have for such a meeting. But it was done in good \nfaith in order to accommodate the ultimate goal, which is passing an \nincredible piece of legislation at an incredibly important period of \ntime.\n  I see my colleague wants to say something. I have something else to \nsay that is not related.\n  I will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I want to say that everything the chairman \nhas said is absolutely correct. Of course, the committee can meet with \nthe consent of everyone willing to do so. I appreciate him and his \nwillingness to do that.\n  I will say one of the members--I am actually speaking through the \nChair to the chairman, if I could. I just had one of the members on the \nfloor walk by and share with me that he really was not going to ask for \na vote on amendments; he just wanted to share some thoughts but was \ngoing to pull them.\n  I understand how the chairman would want to pull down a committee \nmeeting if there were going to be lots of amendments, and I assure you \nI had no idea there would be any amendments. But I know some people \nbrought some forward. My sense is that there may not have been a desire \nto have a vote on those, especially based on one of the Senators on our \ncommittee just walking by and sharing that with me. So what I might do \nin the interim is get on the phone and see if the committee members who \nhad amendments actually wanted a vote on those or just wanted to \nexpress concerns. Maybe it is possible, within the time left, to handle \nthis in a way that works for all.\n  But I very much appreciate the chairman's willingness. I want to say \nto him again that I had no idea people had amendments to offer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. If I may through the Chair--I appreciate that.\n  Let me just say we were told there were amendments for the purposes \nof votes. Maybe that did not end up being the ultimate intention of \nsome; others may have wanted votes. But I will say to the distinguished \nranking member that if there are colleagues who want to express a \nreservation but are not seeking a vote, they would have the opportunity \nto come to the floor. I am sure we could carve out some time under \nwhich we could talk about what those reservations are. They would be \nfully on the record, and we might find a pathway forward to being able \nto cast a vote on this bill. But I will leave that for my colleague and \nhis conversations with his colleagues on the Republican side of the \naisle.\n  Mr. CORKER. I will close by saying that I think it is perfectly fair \nfor the chairman to say that if we can't have a bill like this \ndischarged on the floor, then other resolutions which sometimes do come \nto the floor without going through committee because they do not have a \nbinding effect--I can understand why he would take that position.\n  But I really do appreciate the way the chairman has worked with me on \nso many occasions. Again, I am disappointed in the comments that were \nmade earlier. But this is the understanding we have had. I think had \nthe committee process gone forward, we probably would not have had \nvotes. But we will just see.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before Senator Corker leaves the floor, I \nwant to make sure I understand because maybe there is a window of \nopportunity to revisit this. I want to make sure I heard what he said.\n  It was my clear understanding--and the Senator said he does not know \nwhy I thought this--that my friend would not object to this if it came \nto the floor. I had staff conversations. I know the Senator is saying \nafter it came out of committee, but there were other conversations I am \nprivy to staff to staff. So let me say that.\n  Is it my friend's interest to go and talk to Senator Barrasso in \nparticular--a friend of mine--and see whether he was just going to use \nthese amendments as talking points? If, in fact, he was not going to do \nthat, call for a vote, and he stands down, would my friend allow us to \nget this done tonight just given the moment in time in which we find \nourselves at this late hour?\n  Mr. CORKER. Well, I would say that every time I get a sense I want to \ndo that, the Senator from California says something that challenges the \nintegrity of another Senator, so it makes me not wish to do that. So I \ndon't know.\n  I will say that I am going to leave here and take into account--I \nhave always understood that if it went through the committee, even \nthough there are some issues I have with this legislation, because of \nthe fact that we have so many cosponsorss, I do not want to be one \nSenator who holds up a piece of legislation. I want the will of the \nbody to work. I always have. But I did want it to go through the \ncommittee process, and it was called off.\n  I wish the Senator from California would quit saying things that I do \nnot believe to be the case. We tried to make it go through the right \nway today. I really did. I appreciate so much the chairman and the way \nhe works with me in that regard. But we\n\n[[Page S5193]]\n\nwill see. I get disappointed every time another word is said about \nthis, and sort of characterizing not the way I understand we were going \nto do this. But we will see. I appreciate everybody's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I would say to my dear friend and distinguished ranking \nmember that I know how he feels about his integrity and the process. I \nrespect that. Only because the stakes are so high are the passions so \nstrong with what is going on with Israel right now. So I would urge my \ndistinguished ranking member to maybe have that informal survey with \nmembers and see if there is a way in which reservations could be \nexpressed, and we might be able to move this legislation on the floor.\n  I have worked with the Senator other times and on other issues and we \nhave worked with each other, and I hope this might be a moment in which \nwe could actually achieve that as well. I have nothing but the greatest \nadmiration for the Senator's work and cooperation.\n\n\n                      Supplemental Appropriations\n\n  I wish to move to another equally important topic and in part respond \nto my colleague from Texas. That is the question of the supplemental \nand the comments made that we are unwilling to do what the House has \nbeen incapable of doing so far--at least the last time I checked. I do \nnot know if something has happened since I came to the floor, but the \nHouse has been incapable of even sending what they viewed as their \nsupplemental.\n  I do not know exactly why we would be blamed for not voting on \nsomething the House has not even passed, No. 1.\n  Yes, there are many of us who will oppose what the House is sending \nbecause, No. 1, it doesn't even provide the resources necessary for an \nemergency--an emergency of unforeseen dimension: a refugee crisis and a \nhumanitarian crisis that needs to be dealt with.\n  When we look at the proposals that are contemplated in the House, not \nonly do they not fund appropriately to meet the challenge, they \nmisappropriate how they are going to do funding to meet this crisis.\n  I don't know that we need to militarize the border, because no one is \nthreatening the border so far as the consequences of any violence. I \ndon't know that a National Guardsman with a rifle is necessary against \nan 8-year-old. I really don't. We heard our colleague from Texas say: \nWell, these children are actually submitting themselves to the Border \nPatrol, not trying to flee them.\n  So part of what the House of Representatives wants is to spend \nmillions of dollars for the National Guard. I would rather spend it on \nthe Border Patrol, not the National Guard. We don't need to militarize \nour border.\n  I would like to make sure that when a child does come over, having \nfled 2,000 miles because they were raped or a child was told by the \ngang to join us or die or a child who saw their father or mother killed \nbefore them and thought they would be the next one--that if that \nhappens to be the case for that child, that they would have the \nopportunity to make their case, and they can't do that in 72 hours.\n  I was at the same meeting earlier today with the President, which was \nreally about national security. But the Senator from Texas raised this \nquestion--and it is a legitimate question to raise--and I didn't hear \nthe same response in the context that the Senator from Texas \ncharacterized that response.\n  The President said there has to be due process; but yet we need to \nfind a way to try to accelerate that process but within the context of \ndue process, and not to strip away the law that was passed in a \nbipartisan process and signed by a Republican President because he \nunderstood, as did the Congress at the time, that if you flee 2,000 \nmiles and actually get here, it must be a lot more than an economic \nrefugee. It must be because you have a credible fear of the loss of \nyour life or your safety. That is what is at stake here.\n  Now, it boggles my mind that we cannot get a successful vote. I don't \nknow if we will or we won't, but I get a sense from what I hear from my \nRepublican colleagues that they won't cast a positive vote for the type \nof supplemental that would give the resources to meet the challenge. To \ndo what? To put more people on the border in terms of Border Patrol. To \ndo what? To create more immigration judges, to create more prosecutors.\n  What are they going to all do, coddle the child? No. They are going \nto be enforcing the border--the border in States where some of my \ncolleagues seem to be the biggest opponents of the supplemental. I \ndon't get it.\n  Now, I have never voted for a supplemental that is enforcement only, \nbut I am ready to do it because this is an emergency. I understand the \ngravity of the situation, both on the human side as well as the \nnational security question. But I can't fathom, for the life of me, the \nviews that say: No, let's vote against the money and create a crisis \nwhich basically is going to leave us in a situation in which, if we do \nnot pass the supplemental prior to leaving on this recess, monies for \nthe Department of Homeland Security and Department of Health and Human \nServices for these purposes will run out. The crisis won't have been \nabated, but the situation will continue to exist and the monies will \nhave run out, which means what the President said: Well, I am going to \nhave to reallocate resources from within those Departments for other \npurposes; which means that other national security, homeland security, \nand other health issues are not going to have the resources to meet the \nchallenges they are presently meeting. That is not in the collective \ninterests of the country.\n  So I am strongly going to support a supplemental that I would have \nnever voted for because of the emergent nature of what we have. But at \nthe same time we can't be about putting the National Guard at the \nborder. It can't be about militarizing the border when there is no \nmilitary threat, and it cannot be about stripping a law that was passed \nin a strong bipartisan vote and signed by a Republican President \nbecause they understood the nature of the potential challenge and they \nunderstood the very essence of a child fleeing 2,000 miles and having a \nshot--only a shot, no guarantee--that they in fact make their case.\n  That would send a message across the globe, as we are telling other \ncountries in the world--in Africa; in Jordan, where we tell them to \nhandle the Syrian refugees; in Turkey, where we tell them to handle the \nSyrian refugees; in the Dominican Republic, when there was the \nhurricane and we said let the Haitians come on over--we can't handle \nthe humanitarian needs of children who have a credible sense and a \ncredible case about fear for their life. Not every child will have that \ncase, and those will be deported. But not every child should be \nautomatically denied either.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wish to engage with my friend in a bit of a colloquy \nhere.\n  I listened to the Senator from Texas, Senator Cornyn--who is working \nto try to solve these problems--lament the fact that Democrats in the \nHouse would not go along with the Republican version of this emergency \nappropriation. So I went back and I asked my staff to detail--and my \nfriend did that.\n  I want to make sure that he agrees with what I think basically was in \nthere: First of all, a change in the 2008 law that President George W. \nBush signed, written by Senator Feinstein and others--quite \nbipartisan--to treat these children with human dignity and ascertain \nthat in fact they had a real problem. If they didn't have a real \nproblem, send them back home; and if they did have a real problem, make \nsure they were safe here. So that was in there. Then, as my friend \nsaid, the National Guard piece was in there.\n  Now, what is really interesting is these children are coming over, \nand they are saying to the Border Patrol: Take me.\n  So I don't mind having the National Guard at the border if we really \nhave to defend, et cetera. I have come after that in the past.\n  But it just seems to me--and my friend made the point--it is one \nthing to put Border Patrol on and it is another thing to send down the \nmilitary to face off with these children.\n  The other thing is, of course, they strip down the money dramatically \nso that these kids may well have to remain in some of the worst \nconditions in these customs facilities.\n  Now, the question I really want to talk to my friend about is this. I \nresearched this today and asked to find\n\n[[Page S5194]]\n\nout, every year, how many foreign nationals become legal residents \nunder current law even without changing our law. We know the \nimmigration bill didn't pass over there. It is 1 million a year. Every \nyear, we take 1 million foreign nationals, and they become legal \nresidents in America.\n  Doesn't my friend believe that since we take 1 million people a year \nin legally, we can deal with 56,000 children, that we can do that, that \nwe have the capacity to do that? We know, if it follows trends, that \nmost of them will be placed with relatives or caring friends, a few may \nnot be, and some will be sent back.\n  But doesn't my friend believe, in this great Nation of immigrants--I \nam a first-generation American on my mother's side. My mother was born \nin Europe and her whole family escaped before the Holocaust. I don't \nthink there is anyone in this Chamber, unless they are Native American, \nwho can say truly at one time their relatives weren't immigrants.\n  My friend is so eloquent on the point. We handle 1 million foreign \nnationals becoming permanent legal residents every year. Don't we think \nAmerica has the capacity to handle 56,000 children?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I appreciate my colleague's point. I would say America \ncertainly has the capacity to give the legal opportunity for those \nchildren to make the case that they have asylum. And when we fail to do \nso, I think we undermine our own principles. We undermine our own \nhistory, we undermine our own legal obligation under existing law, and \nwe also undermine our standing in the world when we ask others to take \nin refugees but we say in our case that we cannot.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, before I get on to my remarks regarding \nimmigration, I wish to echo briefly the sentiments expressed by my \nfriends, Senators Ayotte and Cruz, who spoke on the floor earlier this \nafternoon.\n  I believe the Senate should immediately take up and pass the \nPermanent Internet Tax Freedom Act--a bill that cleared the House with \na bipartisan voice vote and 228 House cosponsors--instead of \nmanufacturing a crisis with a short-term extension that will let this \nvery popular, very bipartisan policy be taken hostage.\n  The situation at the border is indeed heartbreaking. Tens of \nthousands of single adults, families, and children have made an \nincredibly dangerous journey north from countries such as Guatemala, \nHonduras, and El Salvador. They are leaving these countries because \nthey offer too little opportunity and are mired in poverty and \nviolence. No one begrudges them for wanting to find a better place to \nlive.\n  Americans are compassionate and they are generous. The American \npeople have always extended and always will extend a helping hand to \nevery other corner of the world. And even as the number of illegal \nborder crossings has exploded over the past year, we have treated these \nindividuals with dignity and respect.\n  Today we have on our southern border a multifaceted crisis that faces \nthe entire country. But President Obama is not interested in solving \nthe humanitarian problem or the security problem or the legal problem \nor the fiscal problem. He is interested only in solving a personal \npolitical problem--avoiding blame for this crisis which he himself has \ncreated.\n  For years the President's clear message to the world has been that he \nis not interested in enforcing or fixing America's immigration laws. He \nis unconcerned about strengthening our border, improving our entry-exit \nsystem or bolstering the workplace verification. He has made no effort \nto fix our visa system so that we have an efficient process to serve \nimmigrants trying in good faith to obey the law. He has ignored serious \nimmigration reforms that would solve these problems.\n  So what has the President been doing on immigration? Systematically \nundermining the rule of law by ignoring the laws that are already on \nthe books, taking action he has no authority to take, and blaming \nothers for the consequent failures.\n  That is what has led us here today, considering what hypothetical \nactions Congress can take to address the real crisis the President has \ncreated.\n  But the solutions to this immediate crisis and our longer term \nimmigration needs as well begin with the President finally enforcing \nthe law. There is no amount of money that Congress can spend. There is \nno new law that can solve this crisis if the President and the \nleadership of his party continue down their current path.\n  There are several steps the President can take immediately that do \nnot require any action by Congress or another dime from the American \npeople.\n  He can stop abusing what he refers to as ``prosecutorial \ndiscretion.'' He can end the DACA program, which provides \nadministrative amnesty and work permits to those who enter the United \nStates illegally as minors. He can close the door to any further \nexpansion of DACA to millions of additional adults. And he can signal \nhis commitment to this solution by quickly returning those who entered \nthe United States illegally to their home countries.\n\n  But by announcing to the world--the entire world--that he will not \nenforce laws requiring DHS to process and return those who come here \nunlawfully, the President is encouraging hundreds of thousands of \nchildren and adults to make this very dangerous journey to come to the \nUnited States illegally. He is encouraging families to pay coyotes \ncontrolled by drug cartels thousands of dollars to smuggle their \nchildren into the United States. That is truly the humanitarian crisis.\n  The President's threats to widen the scope of DACA are only going to \nmake this crisis worse. That is why I agree with my friends Ted Cruz, \nJeff Sessions, David Vitter, Jim Inhofe, and Mike Johanns that at the \nvery least we must take steps to prevent the President from providing \nany more Executive amnesty.\n  I understand the desire for Members of Congress to want to pass some \nkind of legislation. Members want to be able to go home to their \nconstituents over the August recess armed with talking points that \nsuggest they have done something about the border crisis. But I would \nargue that the bill before the Senate today is just a distraction from \nthe true cause of and true solution to the crisis.\n  Congress could send the President a bill with billions of dollars in \naid and multiple policy changes, but none of these will work unless the \nPresident makes a commitment to enforce our laws and secure our \nsouthern border. Congress could do that, but none of it will work \nunless Congress does what needs to be done.\n  As with so many bills Congress takes up these days, this legislation \ndoes not solve the American people's problems; it only solves \nWashington's problems.\n  President Obama already has the authority to correct the failed \npolicy, to restore the rule of law to our immigration system and solve \nthe crisis on the border. He just doesn't want to, and the American \npeople are paying the price.\n  One of the reasons we have a constitution of separated powers is that \nwhen Presidents try to be legislators too, they tend to be bad at both \njobs. The crisis on the border is of the President's own making, and \nits solution is already in his own power.\n  I stand ready to work with the President and members of his party to \ncraft solutions to these problems--we all do--but until President Obama \nenforces the laws he is sworn to administer, those solutions will \nremain out of reach.\n  For all the good intentions, all the good will, with all the \ncompromises in the world, Congress cannot do its job until the \nPresident finally does his.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that once I \nfinish speaking--I will talk for less than 10 minutes, and I ask that \nthe senior Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, be recognized next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I would like to say to the Senator from \nUtah, who is a dear friend and the ranking Republican on the Finance \nCommittee, that something magical happened here about 48 hours ago \nright here in this Chamber. What happened is we saw the Senate evolve \nin a very good way. We saw Senators bringing amendments to the floor, \nDemocratic\n\n[[Page S5195]]\n\nand Republican. We saw them having a chance to offer amendments, debate \nthe amendments, and get votes on the amendments. And it was on an \nimportant issue. The issue was how we were going to provide and fund \nthe transportation system for our country, which includes roads, \nhighways, bridges, tunnels, transit systems, and more.\n  At the end of the day, 79 Senators, Democratic and Republican, a \nmajority of Republicans and Democrats, voted to say we would like to \nmake sure we don't run out of money in the Federal transportation trust \nfund this year. We are going to replenish that trust fund but not for a \nyear or a year and a half but for a relatively short period of time--\nuntil the end of the year, really until the end of December. Why would \nwe stop there? It is because we believe that if we keep on going--for \nexample, one of the proposals coming over from the House was to fund \nthe transportation program until maybe next May or next June. Our fear \nand the fear of 79 Senators who voted--I think with their conscience--\nour fear was that we will get to next May 31 and say: Well, we can't \nmake these votes. It is too tough to pass a 6-year transportation \nprogram for our country. Let's just cobble together enough revenues \nfrom disparate sources that have nothing to do with transportation, do \nwhat my friend Senator Bob Corker calls generational theft and steal 10 \nyears' of revenues and use it to fix highways and bridge problems for 3 \nor 4 or 5 months. That is what we have been doing for the last 5 years. \nWe have done it 11 times.\n  What we have done is we said to Governors and State departments of \ntransportation and others who are trying to build highways, roads, and \ntransportation highway systems: We are going to give you a little bit \nof money, and you can count on it for a couple of months. If it runs \nout, we will try to do it some more.\n  Stop and go. It is hugely inefficient. It is hugely inefficient. I \nspeak as on old Governor--not that old--as a recovering Governor, a \nformer Governor, and have some idea of all the work put into these \nprojects. Take, for example, when you plan your highway, bridge, or \ntransit system. You have to plan the project, you have to fund the \nproject, you have to contract the project, and you have to get permits \nfor the project. It takes years. And providing that we have the \nrevenues--or won't we--will the Federal Government be there as a \npartner? The kind of system we have is wasteful--or at least the kind \nof system we have shown in recent years.\n  A bunch of us say: Why don't we Senators--Democratic and Republican--\ndo our job and fund a 6-year transportation program for our country?\n  For the most part, I think for myself and for many, why don't we stop \nusing sources of revenue that have absolutely nothing to do with \ntransportation? Why don't we just stop taking money from the general \nfund, which borrows money from China and all kinds of other places \naround the world? Why don't we fund it ourselves? For projects that are \nworth having, we ought to pay for them.\n  Last Tuesday night, 2 nights ago, this Senate worked, and it was a \njoy to behold. At the end of the day we passed and sent over to the \nHouse of Representatives legislation that said we are going to not let \nthe transportation trust fund run out of money this year. We are not \ngoing to kick the can down the road. We will keep this on a short leash \nand make sure that when we come back after the election, we will be \nlikely to actually fund a 6-year transportation program.\n  It is a smart approach and a principled approach.\n  I want to say a big thank-you to a couple of people. I want to say to \nSenator Bob Corker, the Republican from Tennessee, and Senator Barbara \nBoxer, Democrat from California, who chairs the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee on which I serve as the chairman of the Transportation \nand Infrastructure Subcommittee, I thank you for your leadership. Thank \nyou for standing up for doing the right thing.\n  Andrew Jackson used to say, ``One man with courage makes a \nmajority.'' Mr. Jackson, I would like to say said one woman with \ncourage makes a majority. But in this case we had a courageous \nRepublican from Tennessee and a courageous Democrat from California, \nand they let me draft it. The three of us put together this proposal. \nWe worked with Senator Ron Wyden, who chairs the Finance Committee. We \nappreciate very much his support for our proposal as well.\n  At the end of the day, 79 Senators said it was the right thing to do. \nIt went over to the House. The House, to my disappointment--not to my \nsurprise but to my disappointment--said: No, we are going to strip off \nwhat the Senate has done in a bipartisan way, and we are just going to \ngo back to what we sent to you some time ago--which, I must say, is not \nlikely to get a 6-year transportation program funded anytime soon--not \nthis year and probably not anytime soon. They said that to us.\n  But there is good news. There is good news. Seventy-nine Senators--\nagain, over half of the Republicans and almost all the Democrats--said: \nWe want to do our job and we want to do it this year. We want to fully \nfund the transportation plan for the next 6 years.\n  That is what the people want us to do. That is what State and local \ngovernments want us to do, what mayors and Governors want us to do. \nPeople who work and build roads, highways, bridges, transit systems--\nthat is what they want us to do. Contractors, the business community, \nlabor unions--that is what they want us to do. Do our job. And we are \nprepared to do it.\n\n  The good news out of all of this is 79 of us are prepared to do that, \nand I suspect some others who may have voted the other way Tuesday \nnight are prepared as well.\n  I thank Bob Corker and Barbara Boxer and Ron Wyden and others who are \npart of this vote of 79 for the leadership they provided.\n  I want to say to my friend Senator Orrin Hatch, whom I love and love \nworking with and with whom I am pleased to serve on the Finance \nCommittee--I have admired him forever--that when we come back into \nsession after the election, the lameduck session, my hope and prayer is \nthat we will all be able to work together and get this job done. I know \nSenator Hatch, and I think he is the kind of person who will help get \nit done.\n  Let me close with this thought, if I could, and then I will yield to \nthe Senator from Utah. To my pleasure, one of the things that happened \nduring the last several weeks and months was the establishment of a \nbroad-based coalition of business, labor, State and local governments, \nall kinds of organizations and people who came together and said: Do \nthe right thing. They told us to do the right thing. They have been \nterrific supporters and have encouraged our colleagues, Democratic and \nRepublican, to join with Senators Corker, Boxer, Wyden, and me to do \nwhat we did Tuesday night.\n  That coalition is not going away. They worked the House of \nRepresentatives very hard in the last 2 days,--the last 48 hours--and \nthey are not going away. When we come back here after the election, \nthey will come back strong, and we will too. We are not going to go \naway on this issue.\n  One of the most important things we do as Senators and \nRepresentatives is to provide a transportation system that is worthy of \nthis country. It helps with the movement of people and goods that we \nneed to be a strong and efficient economy and nation.\n  I will close with the words of Mark Twain. I used them the other \nnight, and Senator Hatch has heard these words before. The words of \nMark Twain all those years ago: When in doubt, do what is right. You \nwill confound your enemies and astound your friends.\n  Seventy-nine of us the other night did what we thought was right and \nwhat I am sure was right, and we are going to come back in a couple of \nmonths and we will have a chance to have our colleagues join us and \nreally, as a whole body--hopefully with the House of Representatives \nand the President too--do our job, make sure we have the roads, \nhighways, bridges, and transportation systems we need in this country.\n  Again, my thanks to the Senator from Utah for letting me ramble on a \nbit, and I want to express once again my admiration for him. I look \nforward to working with him not just on this issue but on many others \nin the years to come.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5196]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my dear friend for his kind remarks, and I \nunderstand how much zeal he has for the things he does here on the \nfloor. He is a fine man, and I really appreciate it.\n  Madam President, earlier today--just a little while ago, in fact--the \nHouse of Representatives once again passed legislation extending \nfunding for the Federal highway trust fund. This is the latest step in \nthe process for which the final outcome has been known for some time. \nThe bill the House passed today is virtually identical to the one they \npassed last week. It is basically the very same bill.\n  Earlier this week the Senate passed its own version of the highway \nbill and sent it to the House. Of course, we did so knowing full well \nthe House would not accept the Senate bill. I don't think there was \never any real doubt in this Chamber as to what was going to happen, but \nin my view it is good that the Senate acted.\n  I was particularly pleased to see that the version of the highway \nbill reported by the Senate Finance Committee received such strong \nbipartisan support when it came up for a vote. Senator Wyden and I \nworked hard on that bill. The effort was bipartisan from the outset, \nand in the end we produced a product that both parties could support. \nOf course, I was a little less pleased that the Senate on the very next \nvote opted to strike the Finance Committee's language and replace it \nwith what is, in my view, a less viable vehicle for funding the highway \ntrust fund, but in the end that is the direction a majority of the \nSenators decided to go, and I accepted it and am proud of everybody who \nparticipated.\n  As I said, it is good that the Senate acted. But now the House has \nacted again. It is good that the Senate had some amendments for a \nchange, and I think we all felt good about that. I felt a renewed \nspirit in the Senate because of this since it had been a year without \nhaving real amendments in a real process. Of course there were only \nfour of them, but compared to what we have had over the last year, that \nstill was an amazing occurrence. But now the House has acted again, and \nalthough there are likely to be a number of Senators who do not like \nthe House bill, there doesn't appear to be enough time for the Senate \nto try once again to go in a different direction.\n  As we all know, we are on the verge of a crisis with regard to \nfunding for the highway trust fund. Congress needs to act immediately \nto prevent a shortfall in the trust fund and to ensure that the States \ncan continue to plan and implement their highway projects. Thousands of \njobs are at stake. If Congress doesn't pass a bill and get it to the \nPresident before we leave for recess, we will be doing a great \ndisservice to a lot of people. We all know this. It is not a secret. It \nis not a surprise.\n  As far as I can see, the only viable solution before the Senate today \nis to take up the House bill and pass it as is. Once again, we have all \nknown this was the most likely outcome for some time now. It is time we \naccept it and move on. That is not to say that I am disappointed that \nwe have to pass the House bill. As I said a number of times, if you \ncompare the House bill with the one reported by the Senate Finance \nCommittee--which, once again, received broad bipartisan support when it \nwas voted on in the Senate earlier this week--you will see that the \nbills are not all that far apart in terms of policy. The core funding \nmechanisms are the same.\n\n  The principal difference is that the Senate bill raises some revenue \nthrough some tax compliance provisions that are not in the House bill. \nThe House bill goes a little further on pension smoothing than the \nFinance Committee bill does, and this has brought heartburn to a number \nof us in both bodies.\n  These are not fundamental differences. Any Senator who supported the \nFinance Committee's bill should be able to support the House bill, \nwhich is a good thing, because as I said we don't have many other \noptions if we want to get this done before the recess.\n  I plan to support the House-passed highway bill. I urge all of my \ncolleagues in the Senate to do the same.\n  Finally, I wish to take a moment to address a major setback we \nencountered with regard to the temporary highway extension that passed \nin the Senate earlier this week. As we learned yesterday, the Senate-\npassed bill has a shortfall of about $2.4 billion due to a drafting \nerror. Some have suggested that this error originated in the Finance \nCommittee's version of the legislation. However, anyone who takes the \ntime to compare our language with that of the subsequently passed \nsubstitute amendment will find this is not the case.\n  I am not here to point fingers or try to embarrass anyone, but I will \nsay these are the types of mistakes that happen when tax policy is \nwritten outside of the tax-writing committee, and we should all be \ncareful of that.\n  The Finance Committee has an open and transparent process that allows \nfor all of our numbers to be scrutinized well in advance. The committee \nhas all the necessary expertise at its disposal to prevent these types \nof mishaps.\n  I am well aware that mistakes happen. I would just like to suggest \nthat fewer of these types of mistakes will happen in the future if the \nFinance Committee is allowed to do its work when it comes to writing \ntax policy. That is all I have to say on that matter.\n  Once again, we are at a critical juncture. We need to get a temporary \nhighway bill over the finish line. As far as I can see, the only way to \ndo that is for us to take up and pass the House bill. As I stated \nearlier, this should not be a difficult lift. I think we can get this \ndone in short order.\n  It was a lot of fun to be on the floor--for the first time in about a \nyear--where anybody who wanted to at least had a shot at being able to \nbring up an amendment for a vote. Four of our colleagues did get \namendments up, and they were thrilled. Isn't it amazing we were \nthrilled about something the Senate ought to be doing every time we \nbring up a bill? We can get both sides together on a limited number of \namendments, but we should not have either side demanding to approve or \ndisapprove the amendments in advance, and that has been happening all \ntoo often in the Senate with the way it is being run.\n  I love all of my colleagues. I love my friends on the other side. \nThere is no use trying to kid about it, I care for everybody in this \nbody, and I cared for everybody I have served with. I admit that \noccasionally there have been Members whom I cared a little less for \nthan most of the others, but the fact is this is a great body. We have \nhad some great people on both sides of the aisle over the 38 years I \nhave been in the Senate.\n  We need to allow our committees to work. Let's allow our individual \nSenators to work too. Let's understand that we don't all come from the \nsame State or the same jurisdiction. Each of us has a desire to \nrepresent his or her jurisdiction in the best possible manner. Frankly, \nwe need to get this Senate back to where it is the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world rather than just something that is run \nfor the benefit of the majority. I don't want it to run for the benefit \nof the minority either.\n  We can get together--just as we did on this bill--and do much better \naround here than we have been doing. I hope that as we go into the \nfuture, everybody in this body will want to work better together and \nquit playing politics with everything.\n  We understand this is a political body, and we understand there will \nbe politics played from time to time. It is kind of fun sometimes but \nnot on everything, and especially not when it prevents what the Senate \nis truly all about, which is wide-open debates and wide-open \namendments, and we certainly need to find a bipartisan way of working \ntogether.\n  I particularly enjoyed working with Senator Wyden. He has made a \ndistinguished effort to try to make things as bipartisan as he can, and \nthat is hard to do around here anymore in both the House and Senate. \nThe House is supposed to be a body that fights over everything, I \nguess, because it is a majoritarian body. But even then the House has \nhad many Democratic amendments they could have stopped. While they have \nhad many amendments, we have basically been stopped from being able to \nact as the Senate should act, which is to allow people the right to \nbring up their amendments and try to make points that maybe all of us \nwould do well to consider from time to time.\n\n[[Page S5197]]\n\n  I am grateful I am a Member of this body, and I am grateful for the \npeople I have served with all these years on both sides of the aisle. \nIn all the time I have been here, there were only two people whom I \nthought had no redeeming value. I should not have said that, I guess, \nbut there were two people whom I thought truly didn't have the Senate \nat heart and truly didn't do what I thought they should do. I have \nloved all the rest and appreciated them very much.\n  I appreciate the leadership on both sides, but I just hope we can get \npast all of this bickering and start running the Senate as it has \nalways been run. A lot of it started when you break the rules to change \nthe rules, and this is what happens. It was a real mistake on the part \nof the majority to do that. They might not think so because they are \npacking the Federal courts with judges--most of whom would have gotten \nthrough. About 98 percent of the President's nominees were getting \nthrough and very few were even contested. The fact is that some have \ngotten through and others should never have gotten through to the \nFederal bench, and it is because of breaking the rules to change the \nrules. It is not right for either side to do that, but it has been \ndone. Let's overcome it, and let's be the most deliberative body in the \nworld today, and I think we can do it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are now in the closing hours of this \nsession of the Congress. We are getting ready to take our break. I am \nrising to exhort our Members to vote for the urgent supplemental. I \nappreciate the fact that we have adopted the motion to proceed.\n  I remind our colleagues what is in the urgent supplemental. First, it \nis to fight wildfires in our own country: $615 million to fight 27 \nlarge fires that are sending homes and communities up in smoke in eight \nWestern States.\n  Second, it fortifies Israel's antimissile defense system, Iron Dome, \nby providing $225 million to enable Israel to purchase interceptor \nrockets that they have utilized in their own self-defense. It is \nlifesaving technology. It is defensive technology.\n  Third, and not at all least, it is to deal with issues on the border, \nproviding $2.7 billion to deal with the surge of children coming \nthrough Central America, through a treacherous route through Mexico, \npresenting themselves to our border, asking that we consider their \npetition for refugee or asylum status. This bill is a reduction by $1 \nbillion of what the President asked for. The President originally asked \nfor $3.7 billion for the surge of the children all by itself and then \nadditional funds for Iron Dome and the wildfires.\n  When we looked at the request for the surge at the border, we felt we \ncould reduce that by $1 billion, and to ensure the taxpayers that we \nare doing rigorous and vigorous oversight, we have money in there for \nthe inspector general.\n\n  This is an emergency spending bill, which means no offsets are \nrequired.\n  Also, it is meant to deal with humanitarian crises, both in our own \ncountry with firefighting and then a crisis a treasured ally is dealing \nwith and then a crisis in Central America, where the violence is so \nsevere that children are on the march to be able to escape it. These \nfunds will pay for additional law enforcement for our Border Patrol, \nhumanitarian assistance for HHS to house, clothe, and feed the children \non a temporary basis while we find a relative and their legal status is \ndetermined; that is, do they qualify for asylum or refugee status.\n  Much has been said about the backlog and even a mockery--some States \nmocked the current system because they said there were so many awaiting \nthese types of hearings. Maybe if we passed regular appropriations, \nwhich we haven't done in 3 years, we wouldn't be in this crisis. But \nthis supplemental includes money for additional immigration judges to \nbe able to expedite the determination of these children's legal status.\n  Also, it goes after the drug smugglers, the human smugglers, the drug \ntraffickers, the human traffickers, and the coyotes who are exploiting, \ncreating the misery and violence in Central America, and also, while \nthey are doing that, exploiting these children who are on the move and \non the march.\n  I understand there is a great deal of reluctance to either vote for \nthe money or to weaken our asylum laws. I would caution us in weakening \nour asylum refugee laws, particularly as it affects children. I hope we \ncan pass this bill and begin to move forward with it.\n  I want everyone to be aware we are talking about a surge of \nchildren--approximately 60,000 children, not 600,000 children--just \nbarely enough to fill Ravens stadium. We are a country of 300 million; \nwe are talking only about this.\n  I hope we can move on this bill, meet our responsibilities to our \nneighbors in the West facing wildfires and an ally who is running out \nof interceptor rockets to protect itself and not only deal with the \nchildren and their request to determine asylum status, but at the same \ntime we put the money in the Federal checkbook to go where the crime \nand the criminals are, which is the narcotraffickers in Central \nAmerica.\n  I will have more to say before we wrap up, but I now yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the distinguished Senator from Maryland \nhas described the President's request and what she has proposed, the \nAppropriations Committee has proposed in response. The problem with the \nresponse is it does not solve the underlying problem, which is a \nloophole in a 2008 law, which is now being exploited as part of the \nbusiness model of the cartels that smuggle children and other \nimmigrants illegally from Central America through Mexico into South \nTexas.\n  It makes no sense to me just to write a check for this surge, which I \nagree that there is money needed for additional judges, additional \ndetention facilities, and the like in some dollar figure. But if you do \nnot solve the underlying problem, we are going to be back here months \nlater and doing this all over again. This, of course, is an emergency \nsupplemental. We will be doing this emergency every 2 or 3 months \nbecause what we have seen over the last couple years is that the \nnumbers of children coming into the country because of this loophole in \nthe 2008 law I described a moment ago--the numbers have nearly doubled \nover the last couple of years, and there are projections that there \nwill be not just the 57,000\n\n[[Page S5199]]\n\nunaccompanied children who have been detained so far this year but that \nthe number could grow as high as 90,000 by the end of this year and \n145,000 next year. We are going to be in deep trouble, not to mention \nthe crisis for these children. Our capacity to deal with them at the \nborder and in local communities there is overtaxed, and there is the \nfact that the Border Patrol is diverted from interdicting illegal drug \ntraffic and other necessary activities because they are taking care of \nthese children, who deserve to be taken care of, at least while they \nare in our protective custody. So this is not a solution to the \nproblem.\n  I know from meeting with the President--I see the distinguished \nmajority leader and the majority whip here. We all were invited over to \nthe White House this morning to talk to the President about national \nsecurity matters. My distinct impression was the President understands \nthe nature of the problem, and he conceded that we cannot endlessly \naccept people who want to come to the United States from troubled \nregions of the world because it would simply overtax and overwhelm our \ncapacity to deal with it. That is why it is so important to have legal \nimmigration. I agree that we need immigration reform. I do not agree \nthat we need the Gang of 8 bill. But I am committed to trying to fix \nour broken immigration system on a step-by-step basis when we next have \nan opportunity to do so.\n  But right now we have an emergency that is disproportionately \naffecting my State, the State of Texas, and our local communities and \nour State are being overwhelmed. It is the Federal Government's \nresponsibility and the Federal Government needs to step up. That is why \nI agree some amount of money--I do not agree it is $2.7 billion, as an \nemergency, but at some level we do need to come up with the money to \ndeal with this emergency. But we cannot just write a check because, as \nI said, we will continue to come back. This crisis will be unabated \nand, in fact, it will get worse.\n  I mentioned earlier today the polling that I saw that miraculously \nsaid 68 percent of the American people disapprove of the way the \nPresident is handling this immigration crisis, which is a rather \ndramatic development. I think all that the American people expect and \ndeserve from us is that we try to work together to solve this problem. \nCongressman Henry Cuellar, my friend from Laredo, TX, a Democrat, a \nself-described blue dog Democrat, and I have come up with one \nsuggestion: The HUMANE Act. It is our proposal, and if anybody has a \nbetter idea, we are all ears and all willing to consider it. But so far \nwe have heard no alternative proposals and only a request to write a \ncheck for $2.7 billion. I think it would be irresponsible for us to \nonly appropriate money and not deal with the underlying cause.\n  So, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set aside \nthe pending amendment so I may call up my amendment No. 3747, which is \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President----\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, if I may, I hold the floor, if I am not \nmistaken. I just have a couple concluding comments and then I will turn \nit back over.\n  What we need to do is learn the lesson that we learned in 2005 and \n2006. In talking with Secretary Johnson, he understands this problem \nvery well. I know the Senator from Arizona remembers this. In 2005, we \nsaw a surge of what were at the time called OTMs, immigrants from \ncountries other than Mexico. Strangely enough, we saw a surge of 30,000 \nBrazilians who were detained at our southwestern border.\n  What Secretary Chertoff came to learn is that a loophole they were \nexporting was the so-called catch and release at the time. They did not \nhave detention facilities. What would be done is they would be \nreleased, essentially based on their own recognizance, and we would \nnever hear from them again. They would escape into the great American \nlandscape.\n  Well, the same phenomenon is happening now with these unaccompanied \nchildren because of that 2008 law that needs to be addressed so that \nthey will remain in protective custody pending any court hearing, which \nwe would give on an expedited basis. If they have a legal claim to \nstay, an asylum claim, a victim of human trafficking and the like, then \nthe judge would determine that. And those who do not would have to be \nreturned to their home country. I think I heard the President say as \nmuch today. I certainly have heard Secretary Johnson and others say the \nsame thing.\n  That is what my amendment would do. I am sorry the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland has seen fit to object to it. I think this \nvirtually guarantees that we will leave here today without having \nsolved the problem, and that is a tragic circumstance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, if I could respond to the Senator from \nTexas, first of all, I do not want my objection to be interpreted by \nhim or by the Senate or those watching as a pugnacious dismissal of the \nSenator's request. The distinguished Senator from Texas has always \nstood for Texas and he has also stood for the protection of the border. \nHe comes with an incredible background where he was a judge, a former \njudge of the highest court in Texas. So I understand. And I have also \nheard him speak repeatedly about the plight of these children, and he \nhas spoken with great compassion. He and I both agree that we should \nnot have open borders and open wallets, that we have to deal with this.\n  But I say to my colleague, this bill is a money bill. It is an \nappropriations bill. We do not legislate on appropriations. There is no \nlegislative language in this bill. What the Senator is proposing, \nworking with the administration, with the Judiciary Committee, on a \nbipartisan basis--because I think there is a sentiment perhaps we could \narrive at some other language, but on this bill I objected because this \nwould be legislating on appropriations. The type of pragmatic approach \nthe Senator from Texas is proposing--and we have perhaps some ideas--\ncannot be done on this bill tonight with the urgent nature of it.\n  So I want the Senator from Texas to know my great respect for him and \nhis advocacy on this issue, and I know of his heartfelt compassion for \nthe children and his desire to have a broader immigration policy. I \nlook forward to working with him on legislative matters in a different \nforum.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator will yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, here is the conundrum I think we find \nourselves in. The President has made a request for the money. The \nSecretary of Homeland Security has said he needs more authority in \norder to deal with the problem, and what my proposal would do is to \ngive him that authority necessary to solve the problem.\n  The Senator from Maryland has always been very kind and gracious, and \nI appreciate her response, and I know of her compassion, given her \nbackground, particularly in social work, that she has great compassion \nfor these children, as we all do. But we have a problem and we need to \nsolve the problem.\n  What is so confusing to me is, when the House was considering a \nproposal which would combine both policy changes together with some \nmoney to deal with them, the White House issued a notice the President \nwould veto it if it were passed. So it seems to me that--well, it is \nconfusing, to say the least. I am not sure how we get out of this place \nwe are in.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Is that the Senator's question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. The fact is, we are dysfunctional. But if the Senator has \na suggestion for how we get out of this dysfunction, I would love to \nhear it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. First I would like to respond----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much. We are eager to engage in \nconversation with each other.\n  It is the belief of the members of the Judiciary Committee--at least \nthe Democrats on the Judiciary Committee--that the President has enough\n\n[[Page S5200]]\n\ncurrent authority to provide what Secretary Johnson is asking. I too \nhave heard what Secretary Johnson has. So there is a dispute about \nwhether he needs more authority or whether the President can exercise \nthe authority he has. We believe he already has enough authority.\n  Then there are two large issues. The two large issues are: \nimmigration reform, commonsense, sensible, along the lines that passed \nthe Senate--Senator McCain of Arizona and others have worked on this, \nSenator Durbin--and then the other is what is going on in Central \nAmerica with these drug traffickers.\n  Quite frankly, the fact is we need to start to pay attention to our \nown hemisphere. I note that when everybody talks about how much money \nthis is, it is less money than we are going to spend to give to the \nAfghan security force. OK. We give $4 billion to the Afghan security \nforce. Let's hope they are going to use it and shoot in the right \ndirection.\n  I am looking at making sure our country goes in the right direction, \nand I am going to work on a bipartisan basis. I say pass this bill. \nLet's put together a bipartisan task force and see if we can deal with \nthese two problems of both immigration reform--to move it through both \nbodies--and also bring our focus back to our own hemisphere and deal \nwith the issues in Central America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, as I was watching the back and forth \nhere on the floor of the Senate, I could not help but notice that my \nthree colleagues on the other side of the aisle there and I have \nroughly the same amount of time here in the Senate. In fact, the \ndistinguished majority leader and my friend from Illinois and I came to \nthe House together way back more than 30 years ago.\n  When I came to this body, and when they came to this body, we had \nleaders. We had leaders. Do you know what those leaders used to do? \nThey would say at the beginning of the week: We are going to take up a \ncertain piece of legislation, and we are going to work through it. We \nare going to do what the Senate does. We are going to have amendments \nproposed, and we are going to have votes on those amendments, and we \nare going to have the Senate be a deliberative and debating \norganization, praised as the greatest debating institution in the \nworld, although that probably is not true--and Senator Byrd, a \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Mitchell, a distinguished \nmajority leader--do you know what they would say--Senator Lott, Senator \nDole--do you know what they would say They would say: We are going to \ntake up a bill and we are going to have amendments and we are going to \nhave debate and we are going to have votes, and then we are going to \nvote on final passage. For 30 years that is how I have watched the \nSenate function.\n  Now we have a humanitarian crisis on our border, a humanitarian \ncrisis of incredible proportion, where thousands of young people--while \nthey are being transported by these coyotes, young women are being \nraped, they are falling off trains, terrible things are happening--and \nwhat are we presented here in the Senate? I say shame on you. I say \nshame on you for not allowing those of us who represent the States that \nare most affected by this to have an amendment, an amendment voted on. \nThat is unbelievable to me. We put together--and I say with great \nrespect to the Senator from Maryland, saying that we do not legislate \non appropriations--excuse me. Excuse me.\n  We have legislated a lot on appropriations, mostly to my dismay. Year \nafter year I have watched legislating on appropriations. On the Defense \nauthorization bill, it has caused me heartburn time after time. So \nplease don't--please. I have been around here too long for you to tell \nme we do not legislate on appropriations.\n  I want to have some amendments debated. I want to be able to tell the \npeople of my State that are being flooded by immigrants--I want to be \nable to tell them that I had a proposal representing them here in the \nSenate and I wanted it debated and I wanted it voted on. Is that a hell \nof a lot to ask? I do not think so. I do not think so.\n  This is a crisis of proportions that we have seldom seen the likes \nof. I am sure the majority leader will come over and talk about \nRepublican obstructionism and how we cannot get anything done around \nhere. We have now compiled a record, according to the experts, as the \nleast productive Congress in history--in history. So I am supposed to \ngo back to my home State of Arizona, which is experiencing terrific \nproblems, horrific problems--my constituents are really angry. They \nexpect me to come here and represent them in the Senate and debate and \nhave their views and their desires and their ambitions and their \nreputation here in the Senate.\n  What have we done? The parliamentary situation is that there will be \nno amendments that will be allowed to be debated or voted on no matter \nwhat.\n  The Senator from Maryland said: Well, we do not legislate on \nappropriations.\n  We have some amendments on money that would either reduce or increase \nthe amount of funding. Are we going to be able to have that amendment \nvoted on? Hell no. We are not going to be able to have a single thing \nvoted on. Everyone wants to get out of town. So sometime tonight or \nmaybe tomorrow we are going to close up shop and we are going to go \nhome. The humanitarian crisis goes on. It goes on.\n  What about these children? Are they going to be enticed by coyotes \nfor their families to give a year's salary to transport them from one \nof these countries to the United States of America? Are an untold \nnumber of young women going to be raped along the way? Are there going \nto be kids who fall off these trains? Is that what is going to happen? \nWe are going to go for 5 weeks without debate on a single amendment, \nnot a single one. What kind of an institution is this? What has \nhappened since the days when the Senator from Nevada and the Senator \nfrom Illinois and the Senator from Maryland and I came to this body \nproud--proud to be a Member of this institution?\n  I can remember time after time the junior Senator being able to come \ndown here, propose an amendment, have it disposed of--usually losing \nbut at least I was representing the people of my State. Now I cannot \nrepresent them. I cannot give them what they believe they deserve here \nin the Senate.\n  In a second I will stop and I will ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment so that the amendment Senator Flake, my colleague \nfrom Arizona, and I have put together after visiting our border, after \ntalking to all of our constituents, after discussing the issue with our \nGovernor--we came here to represent them. How can I represent them if I \nam not allowed to express their beliefs and their ambitions and their \ndesires to help solve this problem?\n  How do I go down to the ranchers in the southern part of my State and \nsay: I am sorry there are people crossing your property every night. \nWhat do I say to the families of those people who are being separated? \nWhat am I supposed to tell my citizens whom I represent--that I came \nhere to ask for something that I know is going to be objected to? What \nhas happened to this body? What has happened to the Senate, I ask my \ncolleagues?\n  The approval rating of Congress, the last time I checked, was either \na single digit or low double digits. Everybody kind of thinks, well, \nthat is normal. It is not normal. I hearken back again to the days when \nwe first came here. Our approval rating with the people of our country \nwas 70 percent, 80 percent, maybe even a little lower. Is all the fault \non that side of the aisle? No. But I would say that the people in \ncharge here have an obligation to allow all of us to represent the \npeople who sent us here. That is not happening today. It has not \nhappened all year. It may not happen until next January, where I am \ncommitted and I believe the majority of my conference is committed to \nbringing up legislation and having debate and having votes. That is the \nway the Senate was supposed to function.\n  I know what is going to happen here in about 30 seconds. I say to my \ncolleagues, this is not right. This is not right. This is not the way \nwe are supposed to represent the people we asked to send us here and \nlet us represent them.\n\n  Senator Flake and I have pretty simple legislation. It has to do with \nthe\n\n[[Page S5201]]\n\nfact that, as the President said, it would modify the Trafficking \nVictims Protection Reauthorization Act. It would do some other things. \nIt would provide for funds--and I will not go through all of the \ndetails of it except to say that I know what is going to happen, but it \nis not right. It is not the right way for this institution to function. \nWe all should be a bit embarrassed.\n  I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set aside the pending \namendment so that I may call up amendment No. 3742, which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, let me \nsay at the outset that I have the highest respect for my colleague from \nArizona. We are friends. We came to Congress at the same time, as has \nmentioned on the floor, and spent month after month together on the \ncomprehensive immigration bill. I believe there were 130 amendments \nthat were considered to that bill. I thought that was an orderly, \nthoughtful process. I hope we can return to it.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this is what we are facing: The \nPresident has come to us facing a crisis at the border. He has asked us \nfor the resources for the Border Patrol that has to process these \nchildren coming in and for Health and Human Services so that once these \nchildren--some of whom are toddlers and infants--are in our country, \nthey can be treated humanely. He has asked us for the resources for \nthat purpose.\n  He has also asked us initially for some resources to get to the heart \nof the problem, which Senator Cornyn of Texas has acknowledged. The \nheart of the problem is not in the United States; the problem is in \nHonduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. There is clearly a crisis \nsituation there.\n  What Senator Mikulski, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, has done is reduced the President's budget request by $1 \nbillion, if I am not mistaken, and said: We will respond to this \nemergency request with these resources and realize that more is going \nto be done.\n  On the other side of the aisle, the senior Senator from Texas has \ncome in and talked about changing immigration law. He was kind enough \nto acknowledge that we made an effort to change the immigration law \nright here on the floor of the Senate over a year ago with 68 votes. \nFourteen Republicans joined the Democrats in a comprehensive \nimmigration bill. The Senator from Texas acknowledged he did not vote \nfor it. Had he voted for it, he would have voted for the most dramatic \nincrease in border security in American history. But he voted against \nit. That is his choice. I respect his judgment. But to come to us today \nand say: Now we have to vote again on border security--we had a chance. \nThe Senate passed it. What happened to the comprehensive immigration \nreform bill? It made it over to the House of Representatives and \ndisappeared into vapor. It was never called for consideration.\n  So it is not as if we have ignored the problems of immigration. We \naddressed them forthrightly in a bipartisan fashion, in a comprehensive \nfashion, and the House of Representatives refused to even call the \nbill.\n  Let's go to this particular issue. The heart of the problem is \nclearly in three Central American countries that are so lawless that \npeople are desperately sending their children to the United States of \nAmerica. We have to deal with that issue. We are. The President has \ndealt with it. The Vice President has visited those countries. Last \nweek the Presidents of all three countries came here. So to say the \nPresident is doing nothing about the cause of the crisis is not \naccurate. The President is addressing it directly to discourage any \nmore children from making this dangerous, deadly journey, No. 1.\n  No. 2, I hope we all agree: No mercy for these smugglers. No mercy \nfor those coyotes who are exploiting these families and sadly abusing \nmany of these children.\n  No. 3--and the President has made this point--we have an obligation. \nWhen a child is entrusted to you, people stand in judgment of how you \ntreat that child. We have many children now entrusted to us on a \ntemporary basis. The President has asked for money so that they can be \ntreated humanely on a temporary basis. Not an unreasonable request.\n\n  Time and again America has responded to crises around the world--\nfamilies and children who are victims of war, earthquakes, tsunamis. \nFor virtually every natural disaster, we have been there. America has a \nreputation for being there. Now that children are at our border, will \nwe do anything less?\n  What we are doing with the bill before us, the supplemental bill, is \nproviding enough money for humanitarian care and still working on the \nroot causes of the problem. I think that is responsible.\n  I hope we do not leave here this week having failed to come up with \nthis money. I hope we provide the resources to this administration. I \nhope my colleagues on a bipartisan basis will do two things: Vote for \nthis emergency appropriation and, secondly, let's join in a thoughtful \ndiscussion about how to pass a comprehensive immigration bill which \nincludes this aspect--asylees and refugees.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I think I have said enough with enough \nemotion. But I will say to my friend from Illinois that the way you \nhave a thoughtful discussion is to have debate and amendments and \nvotes. That is generally the accepted way. You want a thoughtful \ndiscussion; I want a thoughtful discussion. Why can't we just accept \nthe fact that we should go forward with our amendments and have debate? \nThat way we can best serve the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans have 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the problem we have at the border \ntoday is a direct result of the actions of the President of the United \nStates. In 2011 we had 6,000 young people coming to America unlawfully. \nThey were apprehended. Now we have 60,000. It was because of his DACA \nprogram and his open statement that was heard throughout the world as: \nIf you come to America as a young person, you will be able to stay.\n  That was exactly and I think to some degree remains the situation.\n  If you come to America as a young person from Central America, not \nMexico, and you turn yourself in, you will be released on a permiso or \nbond or promise to reappear.\n  People come and pick up the children and they stay.\n  This is no way to run a lawful system of immigration. You know, it \nwas said: Well, we offered a comprehensive bill to fix it.\n  That bill was flawed. I opposed that bill. It was rejected by the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I would say with great confidence that because the House of \nRepresentatives rejected the bill that Members of this Senate supported \nand that the President of the United States supported does not thereby \nmean the President of the United States can do what the bill says when \nit was rejected and did not become law. It takes both Houses to pass a \npiece of legislation.\n  The bill would not have worked. It would not have been effective. The \npeople of the United States, through their elected representatives, did \nnot allow it to become law.\n  I would point out that this administration amazingly has announced \nits intention to bypass Congress and to implement an executive amnesty \nby fiat. This would include, as has been widely reported, 5 million to \n6 million work permits and legal status for illegal immigrants into \nAmerica.\n  This is contrary to Congress's decision. Congress has not approved \nthat. But Congress has approved a law that says it is unlawful for \nsomebody in the country, for example, to work if they are not here \nlawfully. They can't work in the United States. They are not approved \nfor work.\n  The President is saying he is going to give them legal status and \npermission to work contrary to plain law. This is\n\n[[Page S5202]]\n\nvery serious. This action would be in violation of the Immigration and \nNationality Act. It would be an executive nullification of our laws and \nthe protections that American workers are entitled to. Congress must \nnot surrender to such lawlessness.\n  It has been in half a dozen papers. The Wall Street Journal 2 days \nago: Millions of people by executive action of the President--it is \nunbelievable to be so open and bold about this, as if he thinks maybe \nthis would intimidate Congress to force us to adopt legislation \nCongress has rejected.\n  We have the power--the power of the purse--to stop it. That is the \nappropriate response of Congress. When the President proposes something \nthat is improper and outside of law, when we have powers as coequal \nbranches of government, we can respond, and we should use the power of \nthe purse.\n  Senator Cruz has filed an amendment to this bill that would prohibit \nthe executive expenditures by the President of any funds for \nadministrative amnesty or work authorization for unlawful immigrants. \nHowever, the majority leader, with the support of his conference, has \nblocked all amendments to this border supplemental. If we do not stop \nthis Presidential action, we will ensure that the border crisis \ncontinues a catastrophe.\n  The President's planned action would also represent a total breach of \nour constitutional system, and it would be a hammer blow to millions of \nunemployed American citizens. We do have the power to stop this. We \nought to stop it. We have a duty to Congress, we have a duty to the \nrule of law, and we have a duty to the Constitution.\n  What we can do today by voting yes on my motion to clear the \namendment tree and to consider and pass Senator Cruz's amendment would \nfix this problem. It would say: Mr. President, you are not authorized \nto utilize any money of the U.S. Government to spend on a program to \ngrant amnesty and work permits to millions.\n  The vote we are about to have will be a vote on whether to support \nthe President's illegal amnesty or to block it. It will be a vote to \nallow us to vote on it, because right now the tree is filled and we \ncan't vote.\n  I am going to be asking to table what is on the tree and clear that \namendment out so we can vote on this amendment, and we will have a vote \non it. Everyone in this Chamber will cast a vote before this whole \nNation and reveal whether they stand for our laws, for our border \nsovereignty or whether they stand in support of the President's illegal \nactivities, in truth.\n  A number of cosponsors support this amendment. I think it is the \nright thing to do, and we will be asking for that later today.\n  Colleagues, in addition, the administration has announced its \nintention to bypass Congress, according to the Associated Press, the \nWall Street Journal, Time Magazine, and others, with as many as 5 \nmillion to 6 million of these work permits.\n  Unfortunately, the bill before us is merely a blank check to \nperpetuate the failure of this administration to fix the problems at \nthe border. This can be done, colleagues. It is not impossible. It is \nnot hopeless. We simply need a President who wants it to happen.\n  He has been sued by his own ICE officers, saying that they are being \nblocked from doing their duty. They asked a court to give them relief \nand tell their supervisors to quit telling them to violate the law and \nnot enforce the law. That is amazing. Their morale is in the tank.\n  The current crisis on the border can be attributed to specific \nactions taken unilaterally by the President. After his 2012 Executive \norder, the number of unaccompanied minors apprehended at the border \njumped from 7,100 in 2011 to nearly 15,000 in 2012, and now we have \nalready hit more than 57,000 heading to 90,000. Estimates suggest \napproximately 32,000 unaccompanied minors are projected to cross the \nborder in the remaining months of this fiscal year.\n  We have this egregious funding supplemental before us that would \nequal more than $110,000 per child who is coming into the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank my colleagues. We do have good colleagues here, \nand we have great robust debate, and I appreciate the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Mikulski.\n  Moreover, this border supplemental provides the Department with \nunlimited transfer authority of $1.1 billion--an unlimited ability of \nup to $1 billion. It becomes, really, a slush fund in that sense. They \ncan use it for anything. Finally, the border supplemental would provide \nan additional $1.2 billion to the Department of Homeland Security.\n  So I am raising a point of order. And I am sure a motion to waive \nwill be heard. But make no mistake. A vote to suspend the budget rules \nand to block our point of order is a vote for the President's amnesty; \nit is a vote for continued chaos. I urge my colleagues to sustain it.\n\n  The bill before us today is in clear violation of the budget. All the \nmoney is borrowed money, it violates the budget, and I raise that point \nof order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, a parliamentary question: Did the \nSenator from Alabama raise a budget point of order? Did the Senator \nfrom Alabama raise a budget point of order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I have not raised it at this point, \nbut I do intend to. I thought we had an understanding so we could make \nthe votes occur at the agreed-upon time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I say to the Senator from Alabama, do you want to raise \nit now or do you want to raise it later?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would raise it later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I note that the Senator from Maryland \nwishes to respond.\n  How much time do the Democrats have in this debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats have 9 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Illinois \nhave 4 minutes to offer a rebuttal and I have 5 minutes for the wrapup \ndebate before we move to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the Senator from Alabama now joins the \nSenator from Texas, coming to the floor of the Senate complaining about \nthe state of immigration laws in America. They have in common the fact \nthat they both voted against comprehensive immigration reform.\n  When we had a chance in committee--which the Senator from Alabama and \nthe Senator from Texas serve on--and on the floor to offer amendments \nand change the bill accordingly, both of them at the end of the day \nvoted against comprehensive immigration reform. Now, over a year later, \nthey come and complain about the state of law when it comes to \nimmigration in America. They can't have it both ways.\n  They could have participated with us in changing the law in a \npositive fashion. They chose not to. They wanted to wait until a year \nlater and complain about President Obama not meeting his obligation.\n  When it comes to comprehensive immigration reform, the Senate met its \nobligation, and those who voted for it did as well. It was the House of \nRepresentatives that failed to call the bill.\n  Now the Senator from Alabama says, well, the reason these children \nare coming to our border is because President Obama signed an Executive \norder which said that if you were a child brought to the United States \nby August 15, 2007, you could qualify to be benefited by this order and \nnot deported, under DACA on a temporary basis.\n  Now, that has nothing to do with any child that comes after that \ndate. They are not covered by that order. They are not protected by \nthat order. To blame President Obama for the children coming to the \nborder is to ignore the obvious. The law that brings these children to \nthe border was a law signed by President George W. Bush in 2008. That \nis the law that governs the treatment of these children. Everything has \nto be blamed on President Obama from that side of the aisle. In this \ncase, the law was signed by President George W. Bush.\n\n[[Page S5203]]\n\n  I happen to believe that this DACA Executive order by the President \nwas thoughtful and humane. Here is what it said: If you were brought to \nthe United States before the age of 16, as a child, you lived in the \nUnited States and finished high school, with no criminal record of any \nmagnitude, you would be allowed to stay in the United States on a \ntemporary basis and not deported.\n  I have met these children. There are many of them who are growing \ninto magnificent contributors to America--doctors, engineers, teachers. \nThey beg to join our military. They are not what they are characterized \nto be. These are young people who believe this is their homeland, this \nis their country, and all they are asking for is a chance.\n  President Obama gave them that chance, and the Republicans time and \nagain--Senator Sessions now, later Senator Cruz--can't wait to deport \nall these children who have gone through high school, gone through \ncollege, and only aspire to be contributors to the future of America. \nThat is the Republican party position for some: Deport these children; \nwe don't want them in our country any longer. That is their position. \nThat is not the position of a majority of Americans. They deserve a \nchance to prove themselves and earn their way to legal status. And to \nblame them for this border crisis is unfair.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the majority leader has brought a $3.5 \nbillion emergency supplemental spending bill to the floor at the \nrequest of President Obama. This bill, while it shaves off $1 billion \nfrom the President's original request, is still a blank check that does \nnot solve the crisis along our southern border.\n  This Democratic spending bill isn't a solution, and it is not a \nreasonable or responsible request. The majority in the Senate want \ntaxpayers to fund a bandaid that is needed because of the President's \nown policies and practices.\n  Not only does the President want a blank check, but he wants \nunfettered authority to keep people unlawfully in the country from \nbeing returned to their home country. While we are facing a crisis, \nPresident Obama is looking at ways to weaken our immigration laws.\n  I understand that there are a variety of reasons that people come \nhere--to be with family, to find work, and to have a better life. We \nare a compassionate country, and we provide a safe haven for people who \nneed it. But we are also a country based on the rule of law.\n  That rule of law has been a principle of our country since its \nfounding. This principle means that the government will enforce the \nlaws it writes. People need to be able to trust their government and \ntrust that it will be fair.\n  Today, people don't trust the government to enforce the laws. They \nsee lawlessness at the border. Individuals--including both children and \nadults--are crossing the border without repercussions, and instead of \ntaking responsibility for it, the President wants to fuel the fire and \nprovide them with more benefits.\n  Instead of providing a blank check, Republicans have come forward \nwith solutions. Today, Senators Cornyn, McConnell, Flake and I are \nintroducing a humanitarian solution to the problem. We provide funding \nwhile changing the law to ensure speedy repatriation of unaccompanied \nminors to their home country.\n  We provide equal treatment to young children of noncontiguous \ncountries to voluntarily return to their home country when apprehended \nby a border agent. Today, these young people can't voluntarily return. \nThey wait 6 or 12 months until they go before an immigration judge. \nThey are released, and we can only hope that they will show up for \ntheir court date.\n  Our bill provides a new and special process for unaccompanied \nchildren to have an immediate court proceeding. This new process would \nbe conducted within 7 days, and children would remain in protective \ncustody.\n  We also require expedited removal--meaning, no opportunity for formal \nremoval proceedings--of criminals, gang members, those who have \npreviously violated our immigration laws, and those who have \nfraudulently claimed to be an unaccompanied alien child. Expedited \nremoval is a tool that will help border agents return people who don't \nhave a right to be here, and it will avoid an influx of individuals \ngoing through our lengthy court system.\n  Our efforts, unfortunately, are only worthwhile if the home countries \ncooperate. We would require the President to certify that the \nGovernments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras are cooperating in \ntaking back their nationals. Moreover, we tie taxpayer dollars to their \ncooperation.\n  In addition to fixing the immigration court system for children, our \nalternative approach requires information sharing between Federal \npartners, including the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and \nHuman Services.\n  It requires information sharing between the Federal Government and \nStates, providing transparency and notice to States about individuals \nreleased. This administration has an abysmal record with transparency, \nand many States are left wondering how they are going to deal with the \ninflux of undocumented children in their schools and health systems.\n  By the end of this fiscal year, up to 90,000 children will have \nentered the country. People are rightly concerned that they are being \nreleased into our communities. They are also being released to \nnonrelatives and people without lawful immigration status. Our bill \nfixes that. It requires children to be in the government's protective \ncustody unless their parent is in legal status and undergoes a criminal \nbackground check.\n  Our bill prohibits the government from placing children with sex \noffenders or traffickers. Doesn't that just make sense. We are talking \nabout vulnerable young people, and we need to be careful about who is \ntaking custody of them.\n  Why are these young people coming? Aside from President Obama's weak \npolicies, there is reason to believe that they are being trafficked and \nused as a commodity by drug traffickers. There are serious gang issues \nin some of these countries. And these issues are seeping into our \ncountry.\n  Our bill ensures that alien gang members are not provided a safe \nhaven in the United States by rendering them inadmissible and \ndeportable, requiring the government to detain them, and it prohibits \nalien gang members from gaining U.S. immigration benefits such as \nasylum or temporary protected status.\n  Border Patrol agents are being strained during this crisis. They are \nbeing taken off the line to care for children and adults. States along \nthe border are stepping up and paying the price. Our bill supports \nState and local governments by reimbursing the costs they have had to \nbear.\n  Our bill ensures that Customs and Border Protection agents are \nprovided access to Federal lands along the border. It also increases \nthe penalties for smuggling offenses.\n  Finally, our bill deals with the lawless policies of this President \nand his administration. Over the last few years, the President has \nshown an astonishing disregard for the Constitution, the rule of law, \nand the rights of American citizens and legal residents. He has made \npromises and threats to go around Congress by using his phone and pen.\n  Well, today we are exercising our constitutional right in cutting off \nfunding for the President to expand his administrative amnesties. Our \nbill would stop him from expanding the deferred action for childhood \narrivals. It would stop other legalization programs that President \nObama is contemplating. Congress has a role to play in reforming our \nimmigration system. He should not circumvent the process and go against \nthe will of the American people.\n  Again, our bill is a reasonable alternative to a blank check. We have \na solution that provides due process for minors who illegally enter our \ncountry. We are being responsible and showing leadership on this issue, \nand I encourage my fellow colleagues to seriously consider our proposal \nso that we can humanely deal with this crisis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, as we begin to close out this part of \nthe debate, I would just say that the issues I am advocating are deeply \npersonal to me and, I believe, deeply personal to all Senators.\n\n[[Page S5204]]\n\n  When I talk about the fact that we have to fund help for wildfires in \nseveral States and help them be able to help themselves by replenishing \nthe money for the Forest Service, I am reminded of the fact that a \ngreat writer by the name of de Tocqueville came to the United States to \nhear: What is this thing called democracy? He wrote that famous book, \n``Democracy in America.'' In it he called for something that he \nobserved. He said what sets America apart is its habits of the heart, \nthat it helps neighbor helping neighbor.\n  Now, we used to do that through barn raising and pancake suppers. \nBut, my gosh, these issues have gotten too big, too horrific. We now \nhave thousands of acres burning, homes being destroyed, businesses \nbeing destroyed. We need to be able to help our neighbors in the West.\n  And I say to my colleagues from the West: I appreciate all the \nsupport you have given us on the East Coast who faced hurricanes. We \ndidn't say we practice ZIP Code politics, that we only help one part of \nthe country when they are facing a disaster.\n  Habits of the heart, de Tocqueville said that is what defines us. We \nnow need to help that.\n  This issue now in terms of the Israelis and Iron Dome began for me \nright after I was elected to the Congress. When I traveled to Poland I \nwent to Auschwitz and saw forever and a day--6 million Jews \nexterminated--why they needed a homeland, forever--a homeland safe and \nsecure. Now they are asking for help to replenish their interceptor \nrockets on the eve of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, where people fought \nwith sticks and stones and children crawled through sewers to defend \nthemselves.\n  We are not going to fool around here. We are not going to delay until \nwe come back from the 5-week break. Israel is the homeland for the \nJews. We need to help them defend themselves.\n\n  My journey in Central America began as a brand new Member of \nCongress, with four Maryknoll nuns and a woman named Jean Donovan, who \nwere raped and killed by the death squads in El Salvador. I watched a \ngallant, brilliant, charismatic bishop named Oscar Romero killed, \ngunned down in his own cathedral. Then we finally got around to looking \nat Central America and what was going on. We were worried more about \ncommunism than the rise of violence. For 30 years we have been up and \ndown in Central America. We have inherited the winds. Our way of \nignoring these three countries is by turning a blind eye, by always \nlooking elsewhere in the world. If we have $4 billion to arm the Afghan \nsecurity forces, I think we ought to back our Border Patrol, back our \nFBI, back our law enforcement to go after organized crime in Central \nAmerica, because if we don't, it will be an additional threat and it \nwill not only be the children--and now we have 60,000 children crossing \nthe border.\n  I understand Texas and Arizona, the border States, are facing these \nproblems. We do want to work together. But could we in the final \nminutes of this Congress get ourselves together enough to meet the \nurgent supplemental request to do this? This is what America is. This \nis who we are, helping our neighbors in the West, helping the country \nfighting for its survival, and also helping our own country dealing \nwith the crisis in Central America facing our border.\n  I think it is time we pass this legislation, move forward, and come \nback and deal with the crisis there and also at the same time take a \ngood look at immigration reform and do it in the way I think we can do \nit.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). The Senator has 10 seconds \nremaining.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. With that I urge the adoption of this bill and hope we \ncould move forward as a united bipartisan Congress.\n  I yield the floor. I yield what time I would have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is a $2 billion bill, all the money \nborrowed as a result of a crisis the President has created at the \nborder, money this country does not have, and there are zero policy \nchanges in it.\n  Republicans on the floor today have filed and argued for a number of \namendments and attempted to offer those that are focused on critical \npolicy changes to strengthen this legislation and make it more \neffective.\n  Unfortunately, the parliamentary maneuvering has been executed, the \namendment tree is filled, and we have been prevented from offering any \namendments at all that are necessary to establish a lawful system of \nimmigration that works and that we can be proud of.\n  So I move to table the Reid amendment on the tree, 3751, for the \npurpose of offering the Cruz amendment. That amendment would prohibit \nthe President of the United States from expending any funds to \nunilaterally provide amnesty and work authorizations for millions of \npeople as has been reported in the press. The Cruz amendment is No. \n3720.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from the Senator from Iowa \n(Mr. Harkin), and the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander), the Senator from Mississippi \n(Mr. Cochran), and the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Roberts).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the pending measure, S. 2648--a bill \nproviding emergency supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2014--\ncontains a number of provisions in violation of the Budget Act and \nspends in violation of the Budget Act. Specifically, it contains matter \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee that was not reported \nor discharged from the Budget Committee. Therefore, I raise a point of \norder against the measure pursuant to section 306 of the Congressional \nBudget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive all applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending bill, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n[[Page S5205]]\n\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, first of all, the Senate is not in \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 3 minutes in \nsupport of my motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The bill that is before the Senate contains $3.57 \nbillion of emergency spending, a reduction of $1 billion, to help fund \nand care for the children who seek refuge and to fight the criminal \ntraffickers at the border. We fund fighting wildfires for our States \nand we also help Israel replenish its interceptor rockets.\n  What happens if the motion to waive fails? If the Senate fails to \nwaive the point of order, the bill will go back to the Appropriations \nCommittee, but the urgent need will remain. If the Senate fails to \nwaive the point of order, agencies will take from other programs to \nfund this compelling need. What does that mean?\n  It means that HHS, which has already cut $138 million from the \nNational Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control, and \nothers--we could have an ebola crisis in the world, and maybe even come \nto our border, and we are fooling around cutting HHS and CDC and other \nagencies. Please, let's look at what we are doing.\n  Homeland Security is also spending resources that would otherwise be \nused to secure the border, such as FEMA disaster relief money has to be \nthere if we have a hurricane.\n  Simply put, failing to act is irresponsible. Let's waive the Budget \nAct, let's get on with the bill, and let's do our job.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I respect the remarks of the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, but I would note that every penny of this \nbill is borrowed. None of it is funded through any offsets or other \nsources of income. This country has to be more careful. The bill needs \nto go through the Budget Committee. It did not get approved properly \nthere. I would note, again, it is all borrowed. It does not make any \npolicy changes. I think we all should stand firm to reject this bill, \nand to sustain the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive.\n  The yeas and nays were previously ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mrs. \nHagan), the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), and the Senator from Hawaii \n(Mr. Schatz) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander), the Senator from Mississippi \n(Mr. Cochran), and the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Roberts).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander) would have voted ``nay.''\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 50, nays 44, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 252 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Baldwin\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Booker\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Coons\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Hirono\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Klobuchar\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Markey\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Walsh\n     Warner\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--44\n\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Enzi\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kirk\n     Landrieu\n     Lee\n     Manchin\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Rubio\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--6\n\n     Alexander\n     Cochran\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Roberts\n     Schatz\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote the yeas are 50, the nays are 44. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is rejected and the point of order is \nsustained.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is regretful that the Republicans have \nblocked the Senate from addressing urgent needs.\n  Senator Mikulski has worked very hard on this urgent supplemental. It \nis very regrettable that we are not able to move forward on it. I would \nlike to address at least two of what I believe are urgent needs. I \nunderstand that Republican Senators are unwilling to fund a proposed \nresponse to the crisis we have at the border. But certainly could we \nnot agree that we have situation in the western part of the United \nStates that is very difficult.\n  We responded when we had problems in the South with the hurricanes, \nin the East with the hurricanes. We have a problem in the West. We have \nfires that are raging all over the West. We have a fire in Washington \nthat has been burning for weeks. Hundreds of homes have been burned. In \nOregon, we have 400,000 acres that are burning. California has a couple \nof big fires. Nevada has a fire. A fire started, I understand, in Idaho \na day or two ago. Thousands and thousands of firefighters are there. \nWith temperatures rising, we have a drought all over the western part \nof the United States. Fires have gotten more and more difficult to \nfight and more expensive. They have been easier and easier to start.\n  We are in dire need of additional funds. That is why this is part of \nthe emergency supplemental. This is an emergency. The West is burning. \nThe funds we seek would ensure that we protect life and property in the \nWest without draining funds from other programs that help us stop this \ndestructive wildfire cycle.\n  Another urgent need. We have all watched as the tiny state of Israel, \nour friend who is with us on everything, they have had in the last 3 \nweeks 3,000 rockets fired into their country--3,000. Iron Dome, as I \nhave spoken here on the floor, has done a good job, but it does not \ncover Israel. They are mobile units. They move them around as well as \nthey can. They depend on Iron Dome. The system works 90 percent of the \ntime, not all of the time.\n  Last week Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel asked for $225 million in \nemergency funding so that Israel's arsenal as it relates to the Iron \nDome could be replenished. It is clear this is an emergency. We should \nbe able to agree on that. That is why I make the following unanimous \nconsent request.\n  First of all, so everyone understands, I am going to make a request \nthat we have emergency funding for the wildfires in the West and the \nmoney I have talked about for Israel and Iron Dome.\n\n\n                Unanimous Consent Requests--H.J. Res. 76\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to Calendar No. 220, \nH.J. Res. 76; that a Mikulski substitute amendment at the desk \nproviding emergency appropriations for the Iron Dome defense system in \nIsrael and combating wildfires in the Western States be agreed to; that \nthe joint resolution, as amended, be read a third time and passed, and \nthe motion to reconsider be considered made and laid on the table with \nno intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the \nPresident has called the crisis at the border a humanitarian crisis. If \nthat is not an emergency, I do not know what is. But as a result of the \nmajority leader's refusal to allow us to offer any constructive \nsuggestions to reform the law to\n\n[[Page S5206]]\n\nstop this flow of humanity across our borders and actually solve the \nproblem, the supplemental has now fallen to a budget point of order.\n  Likewise, this unanimous consent request to fund Iron Dome and \nwildfires exceeds the budget caps and the Budget Control Act. It is \nsubject to a budget point of offer. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am frankly not surprised that this \nobjection has been made. It is too bad. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senate now proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 220, H.J. \nRes. 76; that a Mikulski substitute amendment at the desk providing \nemergency appropriations for combating wildfires in the Western States \nbe agreed to; that the joint resolution, as amended, be read a third \ntime and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid on the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  This relates just to the wildfires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I agree, \nlike the crisis at the border, the wildfires in the Western States \nrepresent a genuine emergency and something we should address. But \ninasmuch as this consent asks for money that would break the budget \ncaps and the Budget Control Act, it is subject to a budget point of \norder. I must object.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is an emergency. There are no budget \ncaps involved with an emergency. Everyone knows that. I am shocked that \nanyone in this Chamber would stop us from getting these critical funds \nto fight these fires that I have outlined on a very preliminary basis, \nand, of course, to help defend Israel.\n  By requesting this amendment, I am disappointed that it has been \nrejected. I have one more and then we can go on to something else.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to Calendar No. 220, that \na Reid-McConnell-Mikulski substitute amendment at the desk providing \nemergency funding for the Iron Dome defense system in Israel be agreed \nto; that the joint resolution, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid on the \ntable with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, would the \nSenator from Nevada, the majority leader, consider an amendment that \nwould modify his request that would provide an offset for this bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the majority leader agree to modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this is an \nemergency. Our No. 1 ally, at least in my mind, is under attack. If \nthis is not an emergency, I do not know anything that is. So I refuse \nto modify my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator's amendment would cut the United \nStates assessed contribution to NATO and the World Health Organization. \nNow as we speak, they are fighting to control an Ebola outbreak in \nCentral Africa. Peace Corps volunteers have been called home from three \ndifferent countries.\n  The amendment of the Senator, my friend from Oklahoma, would cut the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization, which is now investigating \nwhat took place in Ukraine, killing 298 people. So even if you do not \nlike the U.N., the Senator's amendment would cut UNICEF funds to help \nthe world's poorest children. The Senator's amendment would cut the \nU.N. Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture.\n  Now, that says it all. I have no more to say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would note--everybody should know that \nthe U.N. gets well over $7 billion of money every year from this \nCongress, the American people, with absolutely no accountability. There \nis no transparency on how it is spent. There is no accountability. They \nare not held accountable for how it is spent. The oversight that we \nhave done over the past 6 or 7 years shows that the waste associated \nwith the money that is sent to the U.N. is at least 30 percent--at \nleast 30 percent when you do the actual oversight of it.\n  So we can talk about specifics. We can take a small portion from \neverywhere. I do not care. Or I will offer another pay-for. But the \nfact is, we do not get any accountability of the money this country \nsends to the U.N. today. Go see if you can find it. You cannot. You \nwill not be able to find it. I want to fund Israel. I want to supply \nthem. I also want to make sure our children have a future. It is not \nhard to find $225 million out of $4 trillion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under the previous order, I call for the \nSenate to proceed to the veterans conference report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5206-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5206-S5209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  VETERANS ACCESS, CHOICE, AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2014--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair lays before the Senate the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 3230, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the House to the amendment of \n     the Senate to the bill H.R. 3230, making continuing \n     appropriations during a Government shutdown to provide pay \n     and allowances to members of the reserve components of the \n     Armed Forces who perform inactive-duty training during such \n     period, having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     Houses as follows:\n       That the Senate recede from its disagreement to the \n     amendment of the House and agree to the same with an \n     amendment and the House agree to the same, signed by a \n     majority of the conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of July 28, 2014.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is to be recognized \nto raise a budget point of order.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, let me say, first of all, I voted for the \nbill when it left here with the hope that we could accomplish \nsomething. We did accomplish some things. But it came back with $12 \nbillion unpaid for. Because of that, I raise a point of order against \nthe emergency designation provision contained in section 8803(b) of the \nconference report for H.R. 3230, the Veterans' Access to Care Through \nChoice, Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 pursuant to section \n403(e)(1) of the fiscal year 2010 budget resolution, S. Con. Res. 13.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, the waiver provisions of applicable \nbudget resolutions, and section 4(g)(3) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go \nAct of 2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of those acts and \napplicable budget resolutions for purposes of the pending conference \nreport.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will speak very briefly. Mainly, I come \nhere on the floor to thank the Senator from Vermont and my good friend \nfrom North Carolina on the hard work they and members of the Veterans \nAffairs' Committee have done on this issue. I greatly respect my dear \nfriend from Oklahoma and his concern. But I would have to say to my \ncolleagues: If there was ever a definition of an emergency, that \nemergency faces us today because our veterans are not receiving the \ncare we owe them as a nation.\n  There are veterans who are dying as we speak for lack of care. There \nis gross mismanagement. There are problems that will take our new \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs literally years to\n\n[[Page S5207]]\n\nfix. I am proud that in this legislation there is choice, and there is \nthe ability of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to fire people who are \nnot doing their job.\n  Those are the important aspects, most important to me, because I \nthink we can change the Veterans Administration. But the present \nsituation cries out for immediate action. Obviously there were parts of \nthis legislation that I did not agree with. Obviously there were parts \nthat the Senator from Vermont did not agree with. But the hard work put \ntogether by the Senator from North Carolina and the Senator from \nVermont--I am very proud to say we bring before you a way to put a \nfinal stamp on beginning to end. This is not the beginning of the end. \nThis is the beginning of the beginning of our effort to help those men \nand women who have defended our Nation with honor and dignity. We owe \nthem that.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the waiver of the Budget Act \nand to vote in favor of this legislation.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, yesterday the House voted 420 to 5 for \nthis conference report. They understood that taking care of veterans, \nas Senator McCain just indicated--the men and women who have put their \nlives on the line to defend us, who have sacrificed so much--is a cost \nof war, and in fact what we are talking about is an emergency. That is \nwhat the House said overwhelmingly yesterday.\n  On June 11, 2014, 6 or so weeks ago, by a vote of 93 to 3, the Senate \nsupported the Sanders-McCain bill and it was emergency funded as a cost \nof war.\n  This bill, as Senator Coburn indicated, is about one-third of the \ncost of what we voted on in the original Sanders-McCain bill.\n  Let us defeat this point of order. Let us stand with the veterans of \nthis country, let us reform the VA, and let us go forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will be very quick.\n  What our colleagues should know is, since 2009, the VA budget has \nincreased 58.7 percent, a 40-percent increase in the number of \nproviders, with a 17-percent increase in the number of veterans using \nthose providers. The problem is not money at the VA. The problem is \nmanagement, accountability, and culture. So we are going to borrow $12 \nbillion from our children and reward the poor behavior and charge it to \nour children.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say in response to my dear friend from Oklahoma, \nI agree with every single thing that he has said. But we must embark on \nfixing this problem. The choice and the ability to give the Secretary \nof Veterans Affairs the authority to hire and fire people is important \nto me that I believe they deserve our support.\n  I would also ask my friend from Oklahoma, can we leave here for 5 \nweeks and not address this issue? There are 50 veterans in my State \nthat have probably died--at least allegations are such. Can we leave \nhere and not act?\n  If I had written this bill with only you and me, I would say to my \nfriend from Oklahoma, it would probably be $10 billion less and all of \nit paid for. But we had to negotiate, not only with the other side of \nthe aisle but with the other side of the Capitol.\n  So this is not perfect legislation. But for us not to pass it at this \ntime would send a message to the men and women who have served this \ncountry that we have abandoned them. We can't do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I first thank everybody who worked on \nthis. I know there are a lot of political conundrums that people find \nthemselves in. We have an August recess. This issue has come up. But I \nwonder if I could ask a question of the Senator from Oklahoma, who \nknows so much about these issues.\n  Our staff has looked at the CBO report, and people keep talking about \n$10 billion on the floor, but the Choice Program is only funded for 3 \nyears. It looks to me as if this bill is really creating an unfunded \nliability. It is a $250 billion cost over the next decade. I can't \nverify that based on the CBO numbers that have come out. But as we look \nat them, it looks as if the Choice Program continues and grows, and the \nnumber we are talking about is massive.\n  So I do wish we had more detailed information from CBO, the kind of \ninformation we got on the first bill after the fact. For some reason, \nwe are not getting it on this.\n  But it appears to me that if this choice concept continues and we \ndon't do those things to actually wind down and backfill--wind down VA \nfor not providing services to these people because they are seeking it \nelsewhere--the cost of this could well be $250 billion over the next 10 \nyears unpaid for.\n  I would like for somebody to answer that. I don't know if Senator \nCoburn or someone else could. But we are not talking about $10 billion \nis all I am saying.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. What we are talking about is an errant CBO score that \ndoesn't fit with reality or the information given to them by the VA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, what we are talking about, really, is \nrather than get in a car or van and drive for 40 miles and hours and \nhave that all reimbursed and paid for, a person will go to the local \ncare provider. Common sense shows that costs one heck of a lot less, I \nwould say to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, Senator Coburn forgot to mention one \npoint when talking about the increase in VA funding. He forgot to \nmention that we were in two wars.\n  He forgot to mention that 500,000 men and women came back from Iraq \nand Afghanistan with posttraumatic stress disorder and TBI, not to \nmention the loss of legs, the loss of arms, eyesight and hearing.\n  He forgot to mention that many of the veterans from World War II, \nKorea, and Vietnam are getting older and need more detailed care.\n  So I think it is important that we put $5 billion into the VA to \nprovide the doctors, the nurses, the personnel they need, so that the \nveterans can get into the VA and have quality and timely care. That is \nwhat this legislation is about.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive.\n  The yeas and nays have been previously ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mrs. \nHagan), the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), and the Senator from Hawaii \n(Mr. Schatz) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander), the Senator from Mississippi \n(Mr. Cochran), and the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Roberts).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander) would have voted ``yes.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On the motion to waive, the yeas are 86, the \nnays are 8. The motion to waive is agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this week, the Senate confirmed Bob \nMcDonald as the new Secretary of the VA and today we passed a \ncompromise veterans bill that will help repair the overwhelmed Veterans \nHealth Administration. These are two steps in the right direction to \nhelp the men and women who serve in our military receive the care they \nneed when they come home.\n  Bob McDonald is an excellent choice to head the VA. I met with \nMcDonald soon after he was nominated for this position and there is no \ndoubt he is eager to take on the task of seeing that the VA honors its \npromise to the men and women of our armed services. McDonald ran \nProctor and Gamble for several years and knows what it means to put the \ncustomer first. At the VA, veterans are the customers and we have to \nprovide them with the best service possible. McDonald is a veteran, a \nWest Point grad, and best of all, he is from Arlington Heights, IL. I \nam confident he is the right person for this difficult job.\n  After an internal audit, the VA confirmed whistleblower assertions \nthat many VA employees manipulated waitlists to make wait times look \nbetter than they really were. The agency found that in some cases, \nstaff intimidated schedulers into falsifying data. This is \nunacceptable.\n  I visited the Hines VA Hospital near Chicago last Friday where I met \nwith Joan Ricard, director of the facility, and Rob Nabors, President \nObama's Deputy Chief of Staff, who is overseeing the investigation into \nproblems at the VA. We discussed some problems identified by \nwhistleblowers at Hines pertaining to waitlists and other issues.\n  I am pleased that the Senate adopted the Veterans bill conference \nreport. The House passed the bill 420-to-5 yesterday. VA Committee \nChairman Sanders worked very hard both with Members across the aisle \nand in the House to put this bill together. It will begin to fix some \nof the problems identified by the various investigations into \nmisconduct at VA medical facilities.\n  This bill will allow the Secretary to fire senior staff who are not \ndoing their job or who lied about secret waitlists. It will create 27 \nnew VA health facilities to expand capacity, including a new research \nlab at Hines in Chicago. That research lab is 100-years-old and in dire \nneed of repair. The new lease will help make it usable again.\n  This legislation will make it easier for veterans to get the care \nthey need outside the VA system if necessary. Now, any enrolled veteran \nwho lives more than 40-miles from the nearest VA facility or who would \nhave to wait too long for an appointment will be able to go to a \nprivate doctor. We need to get those waitlists down, and this is one \nway to make sure veterans are seen.\n  The IG investigation has cited a shortage of doctors, nurses, and \nother staff as being partly to blame for the waitlist problem. There \nsimply is not enough staff to see all the veterans who need treatment. \nThe bill also provides $5 billion to hire new staff.\n  These are improvements we can all agree on.\n  Some have expressed concern about the cost of this bill but caring \nfor veterans is part of the cost of going to war. We spent $1.7 \ntrillion in the Iraq War alone. We can spend $12 billion to honor the \npromise we made to our servicemembers.\n  When we talk about war, we are not just talking about the thousands \nof people who died in Iraq and Afghanistan. We're talking about 200,000 \nmen and women who came home with major injuries, both those we can see \nand some we cannot. We are talking about people with post-traumatic \nstress and traumatic brain injury, people missing limbs and those who \nlost hearing or eyesight. Veterans who are entitled to healthcare \nservices should get the best healthcare they can, and they should get \nit in a timely manner.\n  There is no question that we need to fix this health care system. \nWhere misconduct has been identified, those responsible should face the \nconsequences, criminal or otherwise. The Sanders-Miller compromise is a \ngood step in that direction. Secret waitlists and failures to provide \ncare do not reflect the promise we made to the men and women who serve \nthis country. Wars create veterans and veterans need medical care. \nCaring for servicemembers is part of the cost of going to war.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on adoption of the \nconference report.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, before we vote, I wish to take this \nopportunity to thank Senator McCain for his intervention and making \nsure that we had serious negotiations.\n  I thank the staff of the Veterans' Affairs Committee: Steve \nRobertson, Dahlia Melendrez, Travis Murphy, Jason Dean, Carlos Fuentes, \nBecky Thowman, Ann Vallandingham, Janet Gehring, Elizabeth Austin-\nMackenzie, Kathryn Monet, Katie Van Haste, Shanna Lawrie, Raphael \nAnderson, and Shannon Jackson. These guys worked really hard for \nmonths, and I very much appreciate what they did.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it is no secret that this Transportation \nbill is not the Senate's first choice. However, the alternative to \nacting tonight on transportation is to put at risk America's economy, \nour communities, and our quality of life. As Senator Hatch noted \nearlier tonight, the Senate had a real transportation debate this week \nwith amendments, alternatives, and bipartisan initiatives. This will \nserve us well as we begin to work as soon as the Senate returns to \ndevelop a long-term, bipartisan transportation plan that ensures that \nour big-league economy is not plagued by little-league infrastructure.\n  I urge the Senate to support the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Senators, I will be brief. It is so unfortunate that the \nHouse walked away from the work we did, the bipartisan work we did \ntogether--79 votes. My goodness. We can't get that these days for \nMother's Day. So it was fantastic what we did: the work of Senator \nWyden and Senator Hatch, the work of Senator Carper and Senator Corker, \nthe work of Senator Vitter in our committee that I as chair. It is very \nsad because what we wanted to do was to take care of this problem this \nyear, in this Congress, on our watch, not kick the can down the road. \nThat is what they chose to do in the House. It is most unfortunate, and \ntheir pay-fors were just a lot of smoke and mirrors.\n  Having said all of that, we all know--and colleagues have asked me \nhow am I going to vote--that we can't walk away from the highway trust \nfund. We can't let it stagger and fall. Millions of jobs and thousands \nof businesses depend on it.\n  So I will be voting aye, and I will be working with Senator Wyden and \nthe rest of my friends and colleagues to make sure we get a multiyear \nbill as soon as possible.\n  Thank you.

Madam President, for the fifth year in a row, more than a \ndozen qualified, consensus judicial nominees pending before the full \nSenate will remain on the Executive Calendar during the August recess. \nEach year, I have come before the Senate to remind my fellow Senators \nthat their refusal to take action on these nominations prior to the \nAugust recess is an unfortunate departure from Senate tradition and to \nurge them to stop their obstructive practices and delay tactics. Again, \nI am disappointed to see partisanship and senseless obstruction\n\n[[Page S5210]]\n\ncontinue to keep the Senate from fulfilling its constitutional duty of \nadvice and consent.\n  We could be voting today to confirm 13 nominees to serve on our \nFederal courts, 12 of whom were reported favorably by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote. Instead, we are voting to \ninvoke cloture on only one nomination, that of Jill Pryor, to fill a \njudicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nEleventh Circuit. She has received the American Bar Association's \nhighest rating of unanimously ``well qualified'' and has the support of \nboth of her Republican home State Senators. She will no doubt be \nconfirmed unanimously, or near unanimously, when we return in \nSeptember. As the senior Senator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, noted at \nher confirmation hearing, ``Jill Pryor has been in private practice in \nAtlanta for nearly 25 years. During that time she has played a pivotal \nrole in some of the largest and most complex cases in Georgia \nhistory.'' We have before us an outstanding candidate to serve on the \nFederal bench. Yet her nomination is being filibustered by Senate \nRepublicans who are delaying her vote for the sake of obstruction.\n  Despite this unyielding and irrational partisan strategy, the Senate \nhas made great strides to fill vacancies on courts around the Nation by \nconfirming 61 circuit and district court nominees this year. I have \nheard some Republican Senators point to these confirmations to claim \nthat today's Senate is treating judicial nominees fairly. These \nSenators overlook an important truth: This progress was made because of \nthe persistent dedication of the majority leader and Democratic \nSenators to confront vacancies on the Federal bench and despite the \nunprecedented levels of opposition and obstruction from Republican \nSenators.\n  Because of our Democratic leadership in the Senate, there are now \nfewer vacancies on the Federal courts than at any time since January \n2009. Since the beginning of this year, we have reduced the vacancies \non our Federal courts by over a third, from 92 to 57, and reduced the \nnumber of judicial emergency vacancies by nearly half, from 37 to 19. \nThere are now only eight vacancies on the U.S. courts of appeals. Not \nsince December 1990--over 23 years ago--have there been so few. This is \nreal progress for the millions of Americans who depend on our courts \nfor justice.\n  Many of these confirmations were of nominees to courts that began the \nyear with record-high numbers of vacancies. In Arizona, I worked with \nSenator McCain and Senator Flake to confirm six nominees to fill \njudicial emergency vacancies on their district court. In Florida, I \nworked with Senator Nelson and Senator Rubio to confirm seven nominees \nto fill judicial emergency vacancies in the Southern and Middle \nDistricts of Florida as well as on the Eleventh Circuit. These States \nare success stories, and the people of Arizona and Florida are better \nserved for having trial and appellate judges ready to hear their cases.\n  No Senator should believe, however, that our work is done. There are \n13 judicial nominees pending on the Senate floor who should be \nconfirmed without delay. Yet, even if the Senate were to confirm these \nnominees today, the Federal judiciary would remain understaffed. In \naddition to the 57 current vacancies, the Judicial Conference has \nidentified the need for 91 new judgeships in some of America's judicial \ndistricts and circuits with the most burdensome caseloads. Last year, \nSenator Coons and I introduced the Federal Judgeship Act of 2013 to \nenact these recommendations into law. The timely administration of \njustice should not be a partisan issue. It is an issue that affects all \nAmericans and the Senate should take it seriously by passing this bill.\n  The recommendations of the Judicial Conference only underscore how, \ndespite the 61 judicial confirmations so far in 2014, the Senate \ncontinues to fall short of its obligations to the Federal judiciary and \nthe American people. I have heard some Republican Senators claim the \nopposite by citing the total judicial confirmation figures of current \nand former Presidents. It is true that the Senate has now confirmed 277 \nof President Obama's circuit, district, and U.S. Court of International \nTrade nominees, compared to 253 confirmations at the same point in the \nlast administration. Yet these numbers are meaningless without \nproviding their proper context. These confirmations were sorely needed. \nThere remain 57 vacancies on the Federal bench--far more than the 42 \nvacancies at this point during the Bush administration. There are an \nadditional 24 announced future vacancies on our Federal courts that \nwill also need to be filled in the coming months.\n  Vacancies remain high not because of a failure of Senate Democrats or \nPresident Obama to make judicial confirmations a priority; Americans \nseeking justice around the country face delays because of the endless \nobstruction of partisan Republicans who take every opportunity they can \nto shut down the important work of the Senate. Last year, no longer \ncontent to block individual judges, Senate Republicans attempted a \nwholesale filibuster of three nominees to the DC Circuit, without even \nconsidering their qualifications. Then, instead of confirming the \nconsensus judicial nominees pending on the Executive Calendar prior to \nthe end of the congressional session, Republicans forced the President \nto renominate each nominee and the Senate Judiciary Committee to report \nthem again this year.\n  This year, Senate Republicans have proceeded to filibuster each and \nevery judicial nominee. After today, the Senate will have taken 62 \ncloture votes on judicial nominations so far this year, amounting to \nwell over 400 wasted hours the Senate should have spent considering \nlegislation to help the American people. Never before has the Senate \nseen the systematic filibuster of every judicial nominee, or such \nunfair treatment of qualified, consensus nominees.\n  The result of these tactics has been high vacancy levels on the \nFederal courts. The implications of these vacancies were made clear by \na recent Brennan Center for Justice paper titled ``The Impact of \nJudicial Vacancies on Federal Trial Courts.'' In it, judges and \nattorneys in districts with high levels of vacancies describe the way \nempty court rooms slow the administration of justice, ``raise the cost \nof litigation, cause evidence to go stale, make it harder to settle \ncivil cases, and even put pressure on criminal defendants to plead \nguilty.'' Chief Judge Leonard Davis in the Eastern District of Texas \nsaid the impact of vacancies comes down to ``simple math.'' Vacancies \nlead to heavier caseloads and judges ``have less time to give to [an \nindividual] case . . . It affects the quality of justice that's being \ndispensed and the quantity of work you can complete.''\n  The incredible burden facing Federal courts in Texas is \nunderstandable with its nine current district court vacancies--more \nthan any other State. Therefore, I hope that Republicans on the \nJudiciary Committee, including both Senators from Texas, will be ready \nto proceed with a hearing on the three pending Texas district court \nnominees as soon as the Senate returns to session in September. I also \nhope that the Texas Senators will continue to work with the \nadministration on nominees to fill the six other current district \nvacancies in their State as well as the four known future district \ncourt vacancies.\n  The continued high number of vacancies across our Federal courts is \nunacceptable to me and should be unacceptable to every Member of this \nbody. The Senate should act quickly to confirm the consensus nominees \npending on the Senate floor. The Senate should also pass the Federal \nJudgeship Act of 2013 to ensure that our coequal branch of government \nhas the resources it needs to serve its constitutionally mandated \nfunction.\n  I am glad that we are voting to overcome the Republican filibuster of \nthe nomination of Jill Pryor, and I thank the majority leader for \ntaking action on her nomination. If the Senate were operating as it \nonce did, without this partisan treatment of judicial nominations, she \nwould have been confirmed weeks ago.\n  I hope that in the weeks following the August recess Senators will \nstart working together to continue the progress we have made so far in \n2014. The American people deserve courts capable of providing access to \nswift justice, not empty courtrooms and delays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n\n[[Page S5211]]\n\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nnomination of Jill A. Pryor, of Georgia, to be United States Circuit \nJudge for the Eleventh Circuit, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN, I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mrs. \nHagan), the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), and the Senator from Hawaii \n(Mr. Schatz) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. THUNE.

Madam President, I rise in support of all of the career \nForeign Service officers whose nominations have been held up in the \nChamber until there is a crisis somewhere in the world, until there is \na Presidential or Vice Presidential trip to some part of the world that \nsuddenly demands our attention, and then miraculously holds are lifted \nand nominees are approved.\n  On a Thursday, Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 crashed in eastern \nUkraine. On the following Monday, the Senate confirmed Michael Lawson \nas the U.S. Ambassador to the International Civil Aviation \nOrganization. He had been pending before the Senate. His first day on \nthe job, his first time meeting his colleagues, he was forced to \ngrapple with this crisis.\n  In the last week or 10 days, two more plane crashes have occurred in \nTaiwan and in Mali, an Algerian plane. Random events around the world \ncannot determine when the Senate acts on nominees. We cannot continue \nto follow a policy of confirmation by crisis. It took the President to \ntravel to Saudi Arabia--an important ally--and the Vice President to \ntravel to Chile for the Senate to confirm the nominees to those \ncountries. In the case of Chile, Ambassador Hammer was taken to his new \noffice in Santiago for his first day on the job on Air Force Two \nbecause the Senate approved his nomination just before the Vice \nPresident was to visit Chile. It should not require flying on Air Force \nTwo to get to your posting for your first day of work as a U.S. \nAmbassador. Take the case of our Ambassador to Qatar. She waited for \nmonths, and then Bergdahl was exchanged for five Guantanamo detainees \nreleased to Qatar, and suddenly she was approved. It almost required \nthe President to be ``wheels up'' on Air Force One on his way to Riyadh \nbefore we confirmed an Ambassador to Saudi Arabia.\n  I repeat, the criteria for confirming nominees should not be \ndetermined by a sudden just-breaking crisis, with the urgent need to \nfill a vacant post. Confirmation-by-crisis is not a strategy. It is not \nin the national security interests of the United States.\n  Now the Foreign Relations Committee has moved judiciously--in some \ncases with record-setting speed--to confirm nominees. In the face of \nobstructionism on the floor of the Senate, the committee has proven \nthat bipartisanship is not only possible but it can thrive when \nAmerican national security interests are put first.\n  It is my view that we must lift up our Ambassadors and their \nfamilies, not put them down. These individuals are serving our Nation. \nTheir families are sacrificing for our Nation. They deserve better. Our \ncareer Foreign Service officers serve Democratic and Republican \nPresidents. They should not, must not be treated as political pawns.\n  We cannot continue to allow the pulpits where we preach American \nvalues to remain vacant. No Nation can listen to us if we are not \npresent to speak for ourselves. American leadership can only occur if \nAmerican leaders are present on the international stage.\n  The Senate standoff that has left so many career Foreign Service \nnominees in political and personal limbo is damaging our credibility, \nundermining our national security, and it has to end now.\n  I rise today for the career ambassadors who have not gotten the \ndecency of a vote in the Senate, career ambassadors who are waiting, \nalong with their families, for months, some more than a year, to take \ntheir posts. They are trapped on the Executive Calendar, unable to \nassume their appointed posts because the leadership on the Republican \nside has chosen to hold them hostage as a political tool. They have \nconsciously chosen a strategy to do nothing, pass nothing, approve \nnothing, and leave key diplomatic posts unfilled for months, \nthreatening national security and our ability to conduct foreign \npolicy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nto consider the following nominees: Calendar No. 524, Adam M. Scheinman \nto be Special Representative of the President for Nuclear \nNonproliferation, with the rank of Ambassador; Calendar No. 533, Karen \nStanton to be the Ambassador to the Republic of Timor-Leste; Calendar \nNo. 536, Eric Schultz to be Ambassador to the Republic of Zambia; \nCalendar No. 540, Donald Lu to be the Ambassador to the Republic of \nAlbania; Calendar No. 542, Amy Hyatt to be Ambassador to the Republic \nof Palau; Calendar No. 544, John Hoover to be the Ambassador to the \nRepublic of Sierra Leone; Calendar No. 546, Matthew Harrington to be \nthe Ambassador to the Kingdom of Lesotho; Calendar No. 548, Thomas \nDaughton to be the Ambassador to Namibia; Calendar No. 637, Arnold \nChacon to be Director General of the Foreign Service; Calendar No. 696, \nLuis Moreno to be Ambassador to Jamaica; Calendar No. 699, Maureen\n\n[[Page S5212]]\n\nCormack to be the Ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina; Calendar No. \n707, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, an Assistant Secretary of State of \nAfrican Affairs, to be a Member of the Board of Directors of the \nAfrican Development Foundation; Calendar No. 898, Ted Osius to be \nAmbassador to the Republic of Vietnam; Calendar No. 902, Gentry O. \nSmith to be Director of the Office of Foreign Missions and have the \nrank of Ambassador during his tenure; Calendar No. 927, Leslie Bassett \nto be Ambassador to Paraguay; Calendar No. 953, George Albert Krol to \nbe Ambassador to the Republic of Kazakhstan; Calendar No. 954, Marcia \nStephens Bloom Bernicat to be Ambassador to the People's Republic of \nBangladesh; Calendar No. 955, James D.

Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I don't think he is finished with his \nunanimous consent request.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I appreciate that.\n  Further, that their nominations be confirmed en bloc, the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to \nany of the nominations; that any related statements be printed in the \nRecord; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction and the Senate resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, reserving the right to object, we used to \npass ambassadors and all kinds of people en bloc like that. But we have \nthis nuclear option that the majority chose, so it takes a little \nlonger to do the whole process.\n  On that basis, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I don't know about nuclear options, \nbut I do know about national security.\n  When we have objections to some career ambassadors--I am not even \ntalking about other nominees who are equally as important to places in \nthe world where we face a challenge. But when I extract those out of \nthe list that are also pending before the Senate in critical places in \nthe world and just say, my God, if a career ambassador--someone who \nserves under Democratic and Republican administrations and has \ncommitted their life to the service of our country in the foreign \nservice--cannot get to their places, I don't understand.\n  I don't understand how we can actually object to places like \nGuatemala where we are having the crisis that we just debated right \nnow. Wouldn't it be great to have a U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala to \ndirect the Guatemalan Government as to our concerns about how children \nare coming here? Wouldn't it be great to have the Ambassador to Turkey \nat a time when we have all of these challenges in the region, where \nTurkey has a huge number of Syrian refugees. And we say we object to \nthose? Or Vietnam, where we are looking at a 123 nuclear agreement and \nwhere we are concerned about what China is doing in the South China Sea \nas it ultimately challenges Vietnam in international waters for \ndrilling purposes? And the list goes on and on.\n  So let me at least try some. If I can't do them as a bloc, let's see \nif we can get somebody confirmed here at the end of the day to critical \npositions.\n  So let me ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive \nsession to consider this following nomination: Calendar No. 968, John \nTefft to be Ambassador to Russia, a career ambassador.\n  Now, imagine if we cannot send a United States Ambassador to Russia \nin the midst of the enormous challenges.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive \nsession to consider nomination Calendar No. 968, John Tefft, Ambassador \nto Russia; that the nomination be confirmed; that the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that there be no \nintervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to \nthat nomination; that any related statements be printed in the Record; \nthat the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and \nthe Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, this is the procedure the majority set up. \nAnd the majority is going to be stuck with their decision to delay \npeople, thinking they could speed them up and take away some of the \nminority rights.\n  So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, this is not a procedure the majority \nset up. The procedure that is being set up is one where career nominees \nand critical nominees are being held on the floor as a procedure that \nthe Republicans have decided to do.\n  Let me try once again. Let's see whether there is a more important \nplace than Russia.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nto consider the following nomination: Mark Lippert to be Ambassador to \nSouth Korea, Calendar No. 893; that the nomination be confirmed; that \nthe motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table \nwith no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be made \nin order to that nomination; that any related statements be printed in \nthe Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and the Senate then resume legislative business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, this is a political appointment, not a \ncareer appointment. If I objected to a career appointment, I certainly \nobject to a political appointment.\n  So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. It is true it is a political appointment, but to the \nRepublic of South Korea. At a time when we are facing challenges in the \nSouth China Sea, where there is a dispute between China and Korea, \nwhere we have critical interests, where we are dealing with North \nKorea, we can't have an Ambassador to South Korea?\n  Let me just say that I could go through a list of critical countries. \nAnd it is pretty amazing to me. I have some of my colleagues who have \ncome to the floor to talk about national security. Well, national \nsecurity isn't only about having a trigger and a gun. National security \nis also about having an ambassador in a country to ultimately press our \ncase and our concerns as it relates to our bilateral relationship with \nthat country.\n  So places like Russia, which was objected to, places like South \nKorea, places like Guatemala, where we are having the crisis, and a \nwhole bunch of African countries that were in the career list--we are \ngoing to have the African leader come here next Monday and Tuesday, but \nwe are not going to have ambassadors to a whole bunch of their \ncountries--career ambassadors to a whole bunch of their countries. That \nis not in the national interests and security of the United States.\n  I hope that after having waited quite some time in order to finally \nget to this point where I felt the necessity to come to the floor and \nask for unanimous consent, that instead of the trickle that we \noccasionally get because there is a crisis and therefore there is a \nresponse to the crisis, that\n\n[[Page S5213]]\n\nwe can avoid responding by crisis and having people in places that \nmaybe would help us to ensure that the crisis doesn't take place.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARPER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CARPER. Would the chairman tell us again the name of the \nambassador nominated by the President to be Ambassador to Guatemala?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. The gentleman who is nominated, a career nominee to be \nthe Ambassador to Guatemala is Todd D. Robinson.\n  Mr. CARPER. I would say to my colleagues, as chairman of the homeland \nsecurity committee, I have been down to a number of Central American \ncountries--Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, El Salvador. If there is \nanybody that needs a U.S. ambassador down there, it is Guatemala. We \nsee all these young people, not so young people, coming to this \ncountry, trying to get in this country. The reason they are coming up \nhere is there is no hope--no economic hope, crime, lack of \nopportunity--and we have no ambassador there. We haven't had an \nambassador there for months.\n  I would just make a plea for the chairman to make a unanimous consent \nif only for the Ambassador to Guatemala. And I would just plead with my \ncolleague, my friend from Wyoming, not to object.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I say to my distinguished colleague from Delaware that \nI already included the Ambassador to Guatemala in my list and there was \nobjection. If the Senator from Wyoming, who I believe is not doing this \nin his own course but on behalf of his leadership, has an indication \nthat he would accept that, I would be happy to do it; otherwise, I \nthink we would further not be able to achieve it.\n  Mr. CARPER. I would ask, would the Senator one more time make the \nunanimous consent request for Todd Robinson.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following nomination: Calendar No. \n958, Todd D. Robinson to be the Ambassador to Guatemala; that the \nnomination be confirmed; that the motion to reconsider be made and laid \nupon the table; that no intervening action or debate or further motions \nbe in order to that nomination; that any related statements be printed \nin the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. We have been through this nomination and the others before. \nThere is a procedure that was set up that is recognized now by both \nsides but that our side feels forced into because of the nuclear option \nwhere the other side broke the rules in order to change the rules. And \nthe way that works, the majority leader is still the one that has every \npower within this body--except the Congressional Review Act--and he \nhasn't chosen to bring these up in the normal order, instead asking to \nbring them up en bloc.\n  My college roommate was a career ambassador, and I helped him get \nassignments and brought a lot of people through en bloc at the same \ntime. But that was before we had the nuclear option.\n  So on that basis, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I will close on this. Look, the \nreality is that if each of these ambassadors was going to be brought up \nand had to go through cloture and go through the whole process of time \nor the debate time that would be attributed to each one of them, we \nwould spend the rest of this congressional session doing exactly that. \nThat would not help our national security interests in terms of getting \nthese people in place.\n  I want to get these people in place. I have limited the requests to \ncountries that have career individuals and to countries that also are \ncritical for our national security. I just hope that, in the national \ninterest of the United States, we can come to a better position at some \nother time.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5213-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NOMINATION OF JILL A.

A bill to clarify the definition of nonadmitted insurer \nunder the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I introduce the Captive Insurers \nClarification Act. This simple, commonsense legislation will clarify \nterms included in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \nProtection Act that stand to threaten the viability of the captive \ninsurance industry in Vermont, South Carolina, and across the country. \nI am glad to have Senator Graham's support in this effort.\n  Vermont is one of the leading onshore captive insurance domiciles in \nthe country, with over 1000 licensed captive insurance companies. I \nhave heard from the captive industry in Vermont, understandably \nconcerned that language included in the Dodd-Frank Act may result in \nthe double taxation of captives that operate in states where their \nheadquarters are not domiciled. The Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform \nAct, NRRA, as included in Dodd-Frank, intended to facilitate the proper \ncollection and allocation of self-procurement taxes. Captives are taxed \nand regulated in the state in which they are domiciled, not necessarily \nwhere their corporate headquarters are located. However, due to the \nambiguity of the NRRA, captive insurers are concerned that both the \nstate in which a captive is headquartered, and the state in which the \ncaptive is domiciled, may claim the premium tax.\n  The Captive Insurers Clarification Act would simply clarify that such \ncompanies were never intended to be included under the Nonadmitted and \nReinsurance Reform Act. Applying the NRRA to captives would eliminate \nthe specialized regulation of the captive industry that states like \nVermont have worked to cultivate.\n  This is commonsense legislation to clarify the intention of Congress \nin passing the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act, and I hope \nMembers of Congress will support its enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 2736.

A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nestablish a voluntary national directory of veterans to support \noutreach to veterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nhelp new veterans get information about the programs, benefits and \nservices available to them as they transition back to civilian life. \nThe Connect with Veterans Act will make it easier for cities, counties \nand tribes, as well as the State Departments of Veterans Affairs, to \ninteract directly with new veterans.\n  Since I joined the Senate in January 2013, I have traveled all across \nNorth Dakota, listening to our veterans. One thing I heard, time and \ntime again, was the need for more information about programs and \nservices. Recently, I hosted my first Native American Veterans Summit \nin Bismarck, ND. One of the things which struck me at the Summit was \nhow the Department of Veterans Affairs and other agencies simply \nweren't connecting with the veterans who wanted information about \nhealth care options and other benefits. It is clear that we, as a \nsociety, must do better.\n  In June 2013, I was proud to form the Senate Defense Communities \nCaucus along with my co-chair, Senator Johnny Isakson. We found that \npeople and communities all across the nation are passionate about \nhelping our military perform its mission. Through my work with the \nCaucus, I found these communities are equally passionate about helping \nour veterans as well. I heard, through a close partnership with the \nAssociation of Defense Communities, that folks wanted to do more, at \nthe local level, to help veterans.\n  From those ideas, the Connect with Veterans Act was created. It is a \nsimple bill, and one that is entirely voluntary. Separating \nservicemembers can choose to share their contact information with the \ncommunities they are moving to after their military service. Interested \ncities, counties and tribes can request the contact information for the \nnew veterans moving to their area and then provide them with \ninformation about services and benefits. Throughout this process, the \nveterans contact information will be kept secure.\n  It is critical that we provide veterans with access to the benefits \nand services they have earned once they leave the military and--knowing \nwhat services and benefits are available to them is the first step. \nThis bill will expand the sources of information available to veterans. \nIt is not just the VA that has the responsibility to help veterans. We \nall share that responsibility.\n  I have heard from North Dakotans, in particular, about how this bill \nwould be incredibly beneficial as many communities in my state have \nunmet employment needs. Veterans have proven to be great employees. \nAnd, with good-paying jobs in North Dakota, this program can provide a \nway to bring veterans into these open positions. But this bill gives \nlocal control of what information is provided to veterans. Communities \nthroughout the nation will be able to make this program fit their \nneeds.\n  Our Nation must do a better job of taking care of our veterans. A \ngreat first step is figuring out how best to welcome new veterans into \nour communities. I know my bill will help that critical process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. McConnell, Mr. \n        Flake, Mr. Coats, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Chambliss, \n        Mr. Barrasso, and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 2743.

IN-COUNTRY REFUGEE PROCESSING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Consistent with section 101(a)(42)(B) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42)(B)) and \n     section 207(e) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1157(e)), special \n     circumstances currently exist due to grave humanitarian \n     concerns throughout the travel, and attempts to travel, to \n     the United States by unaccompanied children sufficient to \n     justify and require, for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, the \n     allowance of processing of in-country refugee applications in \n     El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras in order to prevent such \n     children from undertaking the long and dangerous journey \n     across Central America and Mexico.\n       (2) Grave humanitarian concerns exist due to--\n       (A) at least 60,000 unaccompanied children having \n     undertaken the long and dangerous journey to the United \n     States from Central America in fiscal year 2014 alone;\n       (B) substantial reports of unaccompanied children becoming, \n     during the course of their journey intended for the United \n     States, victims of--\n       (i) significant injury, including loss of limbs;\n       (ii) severe forms of violence;\n       (iii) death due to accident and intentional killing;\n       (iv) severe forms of human trafficking;\n       (v) kidnap for ransom; and\n       (vi) sexual assault and rape; and\n       (C) the likelihood that the vast majority of the \n     unaccompanied children seeking admission or immigration \n     relief, including through application as a refugee or claims \n     of asylum, do not qualify for such admission or relief, and \n     therefore will be repatriated.\n       (3) While special circumstances currently exist to justify \n     in-country refugee application processing for El Salvador, \n     Guatemala, and Honduras, it is appropriate to determine the \n     admissibility of individuals applying for refugee status from \n     those countries according to current law and granting \n     administrative relief in instances in which refugee or asylum \n     applications are denied, or are expected to be denied, would \n     exacerbate the grave humanitarian concerns described in \n     paragraph (2) by further encouraging attempts at migration.\n       (b) Authority for In-country Refugee Processing.--\n     Notwithstanding section 101(a)(42)(B) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42)(B)), for fiscal years \n     2014 and 2015, the Secretary of State, in consultation with \n     the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of the \n     Office of Refugee Resettlement of the Department of Health \n     and Human Services, shall process an application for refugee \n     status--\n       (1) for an alien who is a national of El Salvador, \n     Guatemala, or Honduras and is located in such country; or\n       (2) in the case of an alien having no nationality, for an \n     alien who is habitually residing in such country and is \n     located in such country.\n       (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be \n     construed as a grant of immigration benefit or relief, nor as \n     a change to existing law regarding the eligibility for any \n     individual for such benefit or relief, other than to the \n     extent refugee applications shall be permitted in-country in \n     accordance with this section.\n\n     SEC. 1022. REFUGEE ADMISSIONS FROM CERTAIN COUNTRIES.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the President, \n     in determining the number of refugees who may be admitted \n     under section 207(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1157(a))--\n       (1) for fiscal year 2014, may --\n       (A) allocate the unallocated reserve refugee number set out \n     in the Presidential Memorandum on Refugee Admissions for \n     Fiscal Year 2014 issued on October 2, 2013 to admit refugees \n     from Central America; and\n       (B) allocate any unused admissions allocated to a \n     particular region for Central American refugee admissions; \n     and\n       (2) for fiscal year 2015, shall include Central America \n     among the regional allocations included in the Presidential \n     determination for refugee admissions that fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. 1023.

A bill to prevent deaths occurring from drug overdoses; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, in an effort to decrease the rate of \ndrug overdose deaths, I am pleased to be joined by Senators Durbin, \nMarkey, Whitehouse, and Leahy in introducing the Overdose Prevention \nAct. Representative Donna Edwards has introduced a similar bill in the \nHouse.\n  Throughout the country, the death rate from drug overdoses has been \nrapidly climbing. According to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, CDC, drug overdose death rates have more than tripled since \n1990, and more than 110 Americans died each day from drug overdoses in \n2011. More than half of these deaths are attributable to opioids, like \nprescription pain relievers or heroin. Indeed, this tragic epidemic has \nhit particularly hard in my home State of Rhode Island, where already \nin 2014, more than 100 individuals have died from apparent and \nconfirmed drug overdoses.\n  Americans aged 25 to 64 are now more likely to die as a result of a \ndrug overdose than from injuries sustained in motor vehicle traffic \ncrashes. While overdoses from illegal drugs persist as a major public \nhealth problem, fatal overdoses from prescribed opioid pain medications \nsuch as oxycodone account for more than 40 percent of all overdose \ndeaths.\n  It is clear that we must do more to stop these often preventable \ndeaths. Fortunately, the drug naloxone, which has no side effects and \nno potential for abuse, is widely recognized as an important tool to \nhelp prevent drug overdose deaths. Naloxone can rapidly reverse an \noverdose from heroin and opioid medications if provided in a timely \nmanner. Overdose prevention programs, including those that utilize \nnaloxone, have been credited with saving more than 10,000 lives since \n1996, according to the CDC.\n  Opioid abuse and overdose is not an abstract threat found in far-off \ncorners. It is a national public health crisis and it's taking place \nright here at home in our communities and our neighborhoods.\n  Rhode Island is taking steps to combat this scourge and is leading \nthe way in adopting innovative solutions. Through a ``collaborative \npractice agreement,'' some Rhode Island pharmacies are dispensing \nnaloxone, along with training about its proper use, to anyone who walks \nin and requests the treatment, no prescription necessary. In addition, \nthe Rhode Island State Police now carry naloxone in every cruiser. \nHowever, there's more work to be done at the federal level.\n  The Overdose Prevention Act, which I am introducing today, would \ncomplement Rhode Island's efforts and take important steps towards \naddressing this issue and increasing access to naloxone in our \ncommunities. The legislation aims to establish a comprehensive national \nresponse to this epidemic that emphasizes collaboration between State \nand Federal officials and employs best practices from the medical \ncommunity, as well as programs and treatments that have been proven \neffective to combat this startling national trend. This is an emergency \nand it requires a coordinated and comprehensive response.\n  Specifically, the bill would authorize the U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services, HHS, to award funding through cooperative \nagreements to eligible entities--like public health agencies or \ncommunity-based organizations with expertise in preventing overdose \ndeaths. As a condition of participation, an entity would use the grant \nto purchase and distribute naloxone, and carry out overdose prevention \nactivities, such as educating and training prescribers, pharmacists, \nand first responders on how to recognize the signs of an overdose, seek \nemergency medical help, and administer naloxone and other first aid.\n  As rates of overdose deaths continue to spike, public health \nagencies, law enforcement, and others are struggling to keep up without \naccurate and timely information about the epidemic. Therefore, the \nOverdose Prevention Act would also require HHS to take\n\n[[Page S5234]]\n\nsteps to improve surveillance and research of drug overdose deaths, so \nthat public health agencies, law enforcement, and community \norganizations have an accurate picture of the problem.\n  It would also establish a coordinated federal plan of action to \naddress this epidemic. The Overdose Prevention Act brings together \nfirst responders, medical personnel, addiction treatment specialists, \nsocial service providers, and families to help save lives and get at \nthe root of this problem.\n  I am pleased that the Overdose Prevention Act has the support of the \nAmerican Association of Poison Control Centers, the Drug Policy \nAlliance, the Harm Reduction Coalition, and the Trust for America's \nHealth. I look forward to working with these and other stakeholders, as \nwell as Representative Edwards and the rest of our colleagues in \npassing this crucial legislation. Many of these overdose deaths are \npreventable, and it is time for Congress to act to give communities the \nhelp they need to stop this epidemic.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOOKER:\n  S. 2761. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to permit the \nconsolidation of metropolitan planning organizations, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise to talk about our Nation's \ninfrastructure and how Congress needs a long-term transportation bill \nthat empowers local and regional planning authorities.\n  Infrastructure drives our economy. New Jersey alone has more than \n38,000 miles of public roads, and nearly 1,000 miles of rail freight \nlines, connecting every corner of my State to consumers and networks \nthroughout the region.\n  This means jobs. It means quality of life. It means investment in our \ncommunities and moving us forward.\n  Currently, just 8 percent of our Federal highway dollars are \ncontrolled by regional and local interests.\n  In order to increase the role of local communities in our \ntransportation policy decisions, I introduced today The Local \nEmpowerment Act, which would reward high-performing Metropolitan \nPlanning Organizations, MPO's, with additional, directly-allocated \nfunds.\n  MPO's that coordinate well with other MPOs in the region, consider \nperformance goals as part of their planning, have equitable approaches \nto decision making, and demonstrate high technical capacity would be \nrewarded with additional resources to support their local priorities.\n  Consider the fact that \\3/4\\ of GDP is generated from within metro \nareas, 65 percent of the population resides in metro areas, and 95 \npercent of all public transportation passenger miles traveled take \nplace in metro areas.\n  As the mayor of Newark, NJ, I learned through first-hand experience \nhow important it is that the federal government partner with local \ncommunities to make substantial, long-term investments in our \ntransportation infrastructure.\n  Federal transportation policy must provide local and regional \nstakeholders with resources and decision-making power, and take into \naccount how local communities are being impacted by congestion, air \npollution and our broader investment decisions.\n  At all levels of government, there is a dire need for additional, \ncreative policy options that will rind more projects, create more jobs, \nand rehabilitate and rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.\n  I would like to highlight the leadership of Anthony Foxx, Secretary \nof Transportation, for proposing a program along the lines of this \nlegislation.\n  Secretary Foxx, like me a former mayor, understands how important it \nis that Federal programs empower local entities and I urge my \ncolleagues to join in supporting this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5234-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 531--HONORING THE LIFE, ACCOMPLISHMENTS, AND LEGACY \n      OF LOUIS ZAMPERINI AND EXPRESSING CONDOLENCES ON HIS PASSING\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. McCain) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

REQUIREMENT FOR PHYSICAL BORDER FENCE \n                   CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) Construction of Border Fencing.--Using funds made \n     available to the Secretary under this Act, and except as \n     provided under subsection (d), the Secretary shall construct \n     not fewer than 140 miles of double-layer fencing on the \n     Southern border during each 1-year period beginning on the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Certification.--Except as provided in subsection (d), \n     not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall submit a \n     written certification that construction of not fewer than 140 \n     miles of double-layer fencing has been completed in the \n     preceding year to--\n       (1) the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate;\n       (2) the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n     Affairs of the Senate;\n       (3) the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (4) the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (c) Determination of Miles of Fencing Constructed.--\n       (1) Included items.--In determining the number of fencing \n     miles constructed in the preceding year, the Secretary may \n     apply, toward the requirement under subsection (a), the \n     number of miles of--\n       (A) new double-layer fencing that have been completed; and\n       (B) a second fencing layer that has been added to an \n     existing, single-layered fence.\n       (2) Excluded items.--In determining the number of fencing \n     miles constructed in the preceding year, the Secretary may \n     not apply, toward the requirement in subsection (a)--\n       (A) vehicle barriers;\n       (B) ground sensors;\n       (C) motion detectors;\n       (D) radar-based surveillance;\n       (E) thermal imaging;\n       (F) aerial surveillance platforms;\n       (G) observation towers;\n       (H) motorized or nonmotorized ground patrols;\n       (I) existing single-layer fencing; or\n       (J) new construction of single-layer fencing.\n       (d) Sunset.--The Secretary shall no longer be required to \n     comply with the requirements under subsection (a) and (b) on \n     the earliest of--\n       (1) the date on which the Secretary submits the 5th \n     affirmative certification pursuant to subsection (b); or\n       (2) the date on which the Secretary certifies the \n     completion of not fewer than 700 miles of double-layer \n     fencing on the Southern border.\n       (e) Conforming Amendment.--Section 102(b)(1) of the Illegal \n     Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \n     (8 U.S.C. 1103 note) is amended by striking subparagraph (D).\n\n     SEC. 1604. ONE HUNDRED PERCENT EXIT TRACKING FOR ALL UNITED \n                   STATES VISITORS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Consistent with the Illegal Immigration Reform and \n     Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, the United States will \n     continue its progress toward full biometric entry-exit \n     capture capability at land, air, and sea points of entry.\n       (2) No capability exits to fully track whether non-United \n     States persons in the United States on a temporary basis have \n     exited the country consistent with the terms of their visa, \n     whether by land, sea, or air.\n       (3) No program exists along the Southwest border to track \n     land exits from the United States into Mexico.\n       (4) Without the ability to capture the full cycle of a \n     visitor's trip to and from the United States, it is possible \n     for persons to remain in the United States unlawfully for \n     years without detection by U.S. Immigration and Customs \n     Enforcement.\n       (5) Because there is no exit tracking capability, there is \n     insufficient data for an official assessment of the number of \n     persons who have overstayed a visa and that remain in the \n     United States. Studies have estimated that as many as 40 \n     percent of all persons in the United States without lawful \n     immigration status entered the country legally and did not \n     return to their country of origin or follow the terms of \n     their entry.\n       (6) Despite a legal mandate to track visitor exits, more \n     than a decade without any significant capability to do so \n     has--\n       (A) degraded the Federal Government's ability to enforce \n     immigration laws;\n       (B) placed a greater strain on law enforcement resources; \n     and\n       (C) undermined the legal immigration process in the United \n     States.\n       (b) Requirement for Outbound Travel Document Capture at \n     Land Points of Entry.--\n       (1) Outbound travel document capture at foot crossings.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall establish a \n     mandatory exit data system for all outbound lanes at each \n     land point of entry along the Southern border that is only \n     accessible to individuals on foot or by nonmotorized means.\n       (B) Data collection requirements.--The system established \n     under subparagraph (A) shall require the collection of data \n     from machine-readable visas, passports, and other travel and \n     entry documents for all categories of aliens who are exiting \n     the United States through an outbound lane described in \n     subparagraph (A).\n       (2) Outbound travel document capture at all other land \n     points of entry.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall establish a \n     mandatory exit data system at all outbound lanes not subject \n     to paragraph (1) at each land point of entry along the \n     Southern border.\n       (B) Data collection requirements.--The system established \n     under subparagraph (A) shall require the collection of data \n     from machine-readable visas, passports, and other travel and \n     entry documents for all categories of aliens who are exiting \n     the United States through an outbound lane described in \n     subparagraph (A).\n       (3) Information required for collection.--While collecting \n     information under paragraphs (1) and (2), the Secretary shall \n     collect identity-theft resistant departure information from \n     the machine-readable visas, passports, and other travel and \n     entry documents.\n       (4) Recording of exits and correlation to entry data.--The \n     Secretary shall integrate the records collected under \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) into any database necessary to \n     correlate an alien's entry and exit data.\n       (5) Processing of records.--Before the departure of \n     outbound aliens at each point of entry, the Secretary shall \n     provide for cross-reference capability between databases \n     designated by the Secretary under paragraph (4) to determine \n     and record whether an outbound alien has been in the United \n     States without lawful immigration status.\n       (6) Records inclusion requirements.--The Secretary shall \n     maintain readily accessible entry-exit data records for \n     immigration and other law enforcement and improve immigration \n     control and enforcement by including information necessary to \n     determine whether an outbound alien without lawful presence \n     in the United States entered the country through--\n       (A) unauthorized entry between points of entry;\n       (B) visa or other temporary authorized status;\n       (C) fraudulent travel documents;\n       (D) misrepresentation of identity; or\n       (E) any other method of entry.\n       (7) Prohibition on collecting exit records for united \n     states citizens.--\n       (A) Prohibition.--While documenting the departure of \n     outbound individuals at each point of entry along the \n     Southern border, the Secretary may not--\n\n[[Page S5244]]\n\n       (i) process travel documents of United States citizens;\n       (ii) log, store, or transfer exit data for United States \n     citizens;\n       (iii) create, maintain, operate, access, or support any \n     database containing information collected through outbound \n     processing at a point of entry under paragraph (1) or (2) \n     that contains records identifiable to an individual United \n     States citizen.\n       (B) Exception.--The prohibition set forth in subparagraph \n     (A) does not apply to the records of an individual if an \n     officer processing travel documentation in the outbound lanes \n     at a point of entry along the Southern border--\n       (i) has a strong suspicion that the individual has engaged \n     in criminal or other prohibited activities; or\n       (ii) needs to verify an individual's identity because the \n     individual is attempting to exit the United States without \n     approved travel documentation.\n       (C) Verification of travel documents.--Subject to the \n     prohibition set forth in subparagraph (A), the Secretary may \n     provide for the confirmation of a United States citizen's \n     approved travel documentation validity in the outbound lanes \n     at a point of entry along the Southern border.\n       (c) Infrastructure Improvements at Land Points of Entry.--\n       (1) Facilitation of land exit tracking.--The Secretary may \n     improve the infrastructure at, or adjacent to, land points of \n     entry, as necessary, to implement the requirements under \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b), by--\n       (A) expanding or reconfiguring outbound road or bridge \n     lanes within a point of entry;\n       (B) improving or reconfiguring public roads or other \n     transportation infrastructure leading into, or adjacent to, \n     the outbound lanes at a point of entry if--\n       (i) there has been a demonstrated negative impact on \n     transportation in the area adjacent to a point of entry as a \n     result of projects carried out under this section; or\n       (ii) the Secretary, in consultation with State, local, or \n     tribal officials responsible for transportation adjacent to a \n     point of entry, has submitted a report to the Committee on \n     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate and \n     the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \n     Representatives that projects proposed under this section \n     will have a significant negative impact on transportation \n     adjacent to a point of entry without such transportation \n     infrastructure improvements; and\n       (iii) the total of funds obligated in any year to meet the \n     requirements of subsection (b)(1)(B) shall not exceed 25 \n     percent of the total funds obligated to meet the requirements \n     under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b) in the same \n     year;\n       (C) where possible, construction of, expansion of, or \n     improvement of access to secondary inspection areas;\n       (D) physical structures to accommodate inspections and \n     processing travel documents described in subsection (b)(3) \n     for outbound aliens, including booths or kiosks at exit \n     lanes;\n       (E) transfer, installation, use, and maintenance of \n     computers, software or other network infrastructure to \n     facilitate capture and processing of travel documents \n     described in subsection (b)(3) for all outbound aliens; and\n       (F) performance of outbound inspections outside of \n     secondary inspection areas at a point of entry to detect \n     suspicious activity or contraband.\n       (2) Report on infrastructure requirements to carry out 100 \n     percent land exit tracking.--Not later than 45 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall \n     submit, to the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Homeland Security of the House of Representatives, a report \n     that assesses the infrastructure needs for each point of \n     entry along the Southern border to fulfill the requirements \n     under subsection (b), including--\n       (A) a description of anticipated infrastructure needs \n     within each point of entry;\n       (B) a description of anticipated infrastructure needs \n     adjacent to each point of entry;\n       (C) an assessment of the availability of secondary \n     inspection areas at each point of entry;\n       (D) an assessment of space available at or adjacent to a \n     point of entry to perform processing of outbound aliens; and\n       (E) an assessment of the infrastructure demands relative to \n     the volume of outbound crossings for each point of entry.\n       (d) Procedures for Exit Processing and Inspection.--\n       (1) Individuals subject to outbound secondary inspection.--\n     Officers performing outbound inspection or processing travel \n     documents may send an outbound individual to a secondary \n     inspection area for further inspection and processing if the \n     individual is--\n       (A) determined or suspected to have been in the United \n     States without lawful status during processing under \n     subsection (b) or at another point during the exit process;\n       (B) found to be subject to an outstanding arrest warrant;\n       (C) suspected of engaging in prohibited activities at the \n     point of entry;\n       (D) traveling without approved travel documentation;

IN-COUNTRY REFUGEE PROCESSING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Consistent with section 101(a)(42)(B) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42)(B)) and \n     section 207(e) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1157(e)), special \n     circumstances currently exist due to grave humanitarian \n     concerns throughout the travel, and attempts to travel, to \n     the United States by unaccompanied children sufficient to \n     justify and require, for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, the \n     allowance of processing of in-country refugee applications in \n     El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras in order to prevent such \n     children from undertaking the long and dangerous journey \n     across Central America and Mexico.\n       (2) Grave humanitarian concerns exist due to--\n       (A) at least 60,000 unaccompanied children having \n     undertaken the long and dangerous journey to the United \n     States from Central America in fiscal year 2014 alone;\n       (B) substantial reports of unaccompanied children becoming, \n     during the course of their journey intended for the United \n     States, victims of--\n       (i) significant injury, including loss of limbs;\n       (ii) severe forms of violence;\n       (iii) death due to accident and intentional killing;\n       (iv) severe forms of human trafficking;\n       (v) kidnap for ransom; and\n       (vi) sexual assault and rape; and\n       (C) the likelihood that the vast majority of the \n     unaccompanied children seeking admission or immigration \n     relief, including through application as a refugee or claims \n     of asylum, do not qualify for such admission or relief, and \n     therefore will be repatriated.\n       (3) While special circumstances currently exist to justify \n     in-country refugee application processing for El Salvador, \n     Guatemala, and Honduras, it is appropriate to determine the \n     admissibility of individuals applying for refugee status from \n     those countries according to current law and granting \n     administrative relief in instances in which refugee or asylum \n     applications are denied, or are expected to be denied, would \n     exacerbate the grave humanitarian concerns described in \n     paragraph (2) by further encouraging attempts at migration.\n       (b) Authority for In-country Refugee Processing.--\n     Notwithstanding section 101(a)(42)(B) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42)(B)), for fiscal years \n     2014 and 2015, the Secretary of State, in consultation with \n     the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of the \n     Office of Refugee Resettlement of the Department of Health \n     and Human Services, shall process an application for refugee \n     status--\n       (1) for an alien who is a national of El Salvador, \n     Guatemala, or Honduras and is located in such country; or\n       (2) in the case of an alien having no nationality, for an \n     alien who is habitually residing in such country and is \n     located in such country.\n       (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be \n     construed as a grant of immigration benefit or relief, nor as \n     a change to existing law regarding the eligibility for any \n     individual for such benefit or relief, other than to the \n     extent refugee applications shall be permitted in-country in \n     accordance with this section.\n\n     SEC. 1022.

NATIONAL GUARD DRUG INTERDICTION AND COUNTER-DRUG \n                   ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1989, the National Guard has worked with law \n     enforcement agencies and community-based organizations \n     through the National Guard Counterdrug Program to address the \n     gap between Department of Defense and State and local \n     institutions to perform interdiction and anti-drug activities \n     that contribute to the defense of the United States against \n     narco-trafficking and transnational organized crime threats.\n       (2) The link between drug trafficking organizations and \n     criminal networks is well documented, as drug traffickers \n     have diversified their activities to include trafficking in \n     weapons, humans, cash, and counterfeit goods. These criminal \n     networks have grown in size and influence posing a \n     significant threat to national security.\n       (3) According to the National Guard Association of the \n     United States, the five National Guard Counterdrug Training \n     Centers located throughout the United States have provided \n     essential training to over 680,000 law enforcement officials, \n     military personnel, and coalition forces since their \n     inception.\n       (4) The Department of Defense has continually reduced the \n     funding for the National Guard Counterdrug Program since its \n     fiscal year 2013 request and has eliminated funding for the \n     National Guard Counterdrug Training Centers in the fiscal \n     year 2015 request.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the National Guard Counterdrug Training Centers' \n     mission of providing combatant commands, law enforcement \n     agencies, community-based organizations, and military \n     personnel with training and support to enhance their \n     capabilities to detect, interdict, disrupt, and curtail drug \n     trafficking plays a role in United States efforts to combat \n     narcotics trafficking and transnational organized crime;\n       (2) a sustainable funding solution that keeps the National \n     Guard Counterdrug Training Centers operational and that meets \n     the requirement for training and support for law enforcement \n     agencies, community-based organizations, and military \n     personnel to combat narcotics trafficking and transnational \n     organized crime is needed;\n       (3) the Secretary of Defense should consult with the Chief \n     of the National Guard Bureau, and as appropriate, with the \n     Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, on--\n       (A) how best to meet the requirement for training and \n     support for law enforcement agencies, community-based \n     organizations, and military personnel to combat narcotics \n     trafficking and transnational organized crime;\n       (B) what role the National Guard Counterdrug Training \n     Centers should play; and\n       (C) whether a partnership between the Office of the \n     Secretary of Defense, the National Guard Bureau, the \n     Department of Justice, and the Department of Homeland \n     Security is appropriate;\n       (4) efforts should be made to align National Guard \n     Counterdrug Training Centers' activities with key United \n     States counternarcotics policies and programs, including the \n     Department of Defense Counternarcotics and Global Threats \n     strategy, the President's National Drug Control Strategy, and \n     the President's Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized \n     Crime; and\n       (5) the Secretary of Defense should ensure that the \n     existing National Guard Counterdrug Training Centers continue \n     operations to achieve their full mission until a sustainable \n     funding solution is developed and implemented.\n       (c) Activities.--Section 112 of title 32, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a) by adding at the end the following \n     new paragraph:\n       ``(4) The operation of five regionally located National \n     Guard Counter-drug Training\n\n[[Page S5261]]\n\n     Centers within the United States for the purposes of \n     providing counter-drug related training to Federal, State, \n     and local law enforcement personnel, as well as for foreign \n     law enforcement personnel participating in the National Guard \n     State Partnership Program.''; and\n       (2) in subsection (h)(1), by inserting ``and activities \n     that counter threats posed by local, State, and transnational \n     criminal organizations engaged in drug smuggling and \n     associated illicit activities within and on their borders, \n     as'' after ``drug demand reduction activities''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3758.

I was fortunate to have the original \non my team since I first came to Washington to represent the people of \nthe State of Wyoming in the Senate.\n  Robin's story and her service in the Senate began in 1977 in \nCheyenne. She heard there was an opening on Malcolm Wallop's staff. It \nsounded like an interesting job. It would give her a chance to work on \nbehalf of the people of Wyoming. She submitted an application for the \nposition of office manager. Fortunately, Malcolm made the perfect \nchoice and added her to his staff. He was fortunate Robin was there to \nmake sure everything was done and done well.\n  After serving on Malcolm Wallop's staff for a few years, Robin's \nhusband Ron accepted a job in Rock Springs. They packed their bags and \nmoved there. That was not to be the end of Robin's Senate career. In \n1984, Senator Al Simpson chose her to take the challenges of his office \nin Rock Springs. Later, the Baileys moved to Gillette, my hometown, and \nSenator Simpson just changed where she worked.\n  Here is where I come in. I will never forget 1996 and the decision my \nwife Diana and I made to run for the Senate. Things came together for \nus and soon after the victory parties were over it became apparent I \nhad a bigger issue to contend with--putting my staff together. Now that \nthe campaign had ended I had to make sure we continued to provide the \npeople of Wyoming the support and assistance to which they had come to \nrely on over the years.\n  I started to go through the stacks of rsums and then visited with my \npredecessor Al Simpson. Over the years he put together a remarkable \nstaff. Some of them were willing to stay on. I was delighted Robin \nBailey was willing to continue to serve the people of Wyoming out of \nthe Gillette office.\n  Over the years my staff and I have noticed that Robin has two \nresponses to most questions. Either she knows the answer or she knows \nhow to find the answer. I don't think anyone has a better or more \nextensive system of resources and contacts than she does. Having her on \nmy staff came in handy when in 2000 I had to find a new State director. \nDee Rodekohr, who was Senator Simpson's State director and then my \nState director, decided to retire and enjoy all she earned with her \nservice to the people of the State. Fortunately, she and I and all my \nstaff knew we had someone already prepared who would be a perfect fit \nand it was Robin Bailey.\n  We extended her duties and we put her in charge of all the State \noffices. She not only exceeded our expectations, she took everything to \nthe next level. She was a constant source of support, guidance, and \ndirection for the people in my State offices, and she was always there \nwith a word of good advice or suggestion about how to take on a \nproblem. She was a great mentor to my staff--the new ones and the more \nseasoned veterans because of her great love of and knowledge about \nWyoming. She is the kind of resource every office needs to have if we \nare to do the best possible job of taking care of the people of our \nhome State.\n  My chief of staff has often said that Robin is the best and most \nnatural supervisor he had ever met, and every day she has been on our \nstaff she has proven the truth of those words and her value as one of \nmy team leaders. Robin is one of the people who stands out from all the \nrest. She is known and respected by all. She has a talent for not only \nknowing what is going on in Wyoming but also understanding what it \nmeans in the short and long term. Robin has never worked for me. She \nhas always worked with me. That is part of what made her a great asset \nfor Senator Malcolm Wallop, Senator Al Simpson, and me. That makes \nthree generations of Wyoming congressional delegation and family.\n  She could write a book about being an effective State director. It \nwould be the how-to manual of all time. It would help a person to learn \nhow to be an effective leader, help others, be the eyes and ears of \nwhat is happening, and enjoy the job--all at the same time.\n  A big part of the job has been traveling around the State to see what \nis going on and how people feel about it. In my office I relied on \nRobin to travel around Wyoming and represent me at a long list of \nmeetings, hearings, and presentations. We wanted her there because she \nis a good listener. She not only hears what the people have to say, she \nhas an uncanny sense of understanding what they are driving at and how \nto best address that. She would let me know what she saw and heard and \nit was the next best thing to being there myself. You have heard the \nexpression, ``You cannot be everywhere at once.'' Robin has been my \nsolution to that problem.\n  Her travels allowed her to get to know people in every corner of the \nState. She not only enjoys meeting people but welcomes the chance to \nget to know them and to help them with their problems. That is why she \nhas been able to make a difference over the years in more ways than we \nwill ever know.\n  Her life has not been without challenges, however. One such challenge \ncame about when her husband Ron began to have serious issues with his \nheart and then Alzheimer's. It was a difficult time for her, but she \nnever complained about what she had to do. She just did it. She honored \nher commitment to her husband and she continued to provide him with the \nsupport, care, and attention that had always been a hallmark of their \nrelationship. When he passed away and she lost this great love of her \nlife, she thought it might be time to consider making changes in the \nrest of her life as well. When Robin told Diana and me that she felt it \nwas time for her to retire\n\n[[Page S5288]]\n\nand follow a different path in life, we did what most every one of us \nwould do. We told her to take a few years to make up her mind. \nUnfortunately, that didn't work and now she is making plans for the \nnext chapter of her life.\n  She will be spending more time with her family, especially her \ngrandchildren. She has already shown she is a very special--in fact, a \nspectacular--grandmother. I know her family will enjoy having her take \na more active role in their lives.\n  I know she will continue to make a difference helping others and she \nwill continue to be a great gift for all who know her and for all those \nshe is soon to meet. I don't think Diana and I have ever met someone \nwho is more focused or determined to help others. For Robin every day \nthat is spent making life easier for someone else is a good day.\n\n  We are all sorry to see Robin close this chapter of her life, but we \nknow she is doing it for all the right reasons. She said she had \nreached a point in her life when it seemed to be a time to try \nsomething new. We will miss her wealth of resources, knowledge, skills, \nand abilities that cannot be replaced. Over the years she has set such \na high mark of excellence. Her achievements, the milestones she \nestablished in my office for outstanding effort and accomplishment, and \nher determination to make Wyoming a better place to live from one \ncorner to the other will be the legacy of her service to the Senate, to \nthe people, the State of Wyoming, and to our Nation.\n  In the years to come, each member of my staff will take away a \ndifferent favorite memory of working with Robin. For my chief of staff \nit will always be the way in which she brought a solution with her to \nany discussion of any problem. For others it will be the way she would \nalways find a way to handle an issue no matter how difficult or \nperplexing or how she seemed to not only be familiar with someone's \nissue, she also seemed to know almost everyone who was involved. For my \npart, I will always remember how much it meant to me to know I could \nask her to take on an assignment and leave it with her knowing it would \nbe done well. She always found a way to do what was needed and expected \nand then some more.\n  Perhaps her greatest gift is her ability to effectively manage time \nand resources. For Robin it is not a problem if there is only 24 hours \nin a day because she makes the best use of every minute of every hour.\n  Good luck, Robin, and may God continue to bless you and all those who \ncome into your life in the years to come. You will be missed, but we \nwill know where to find you. It is good to know you will never be more \nthan a phone call away. We hope you fully enjoy your retirement.\n  You have earned it and then some.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO.

Thank you, and I know Senator Menendez is going to speak \non this topic as well. We intended to come to the Senate floor and \noffer a unanimous consent agreement to pass sanctions in Venezuela. \nFirst of all, let me thank the White House for what they announced \nyesterday: sanctions against human rights violators and corrupt \ngovernment officials in Venezuela who have been involved for a very \nlong time--but especially since the 4th of February--in grotesque human \nrights violations against young people and all people in Venezuela.\n  It is a topic that is not often talked about unfortunately these \ndays, given all the issues that are going on around the world. What is \nhappening in Venezuela in our own hemisphere is startling.\n  First, you have the complete erosion of democracy which has been \ngoing on since the reign of Hugo Chavez and now with Nicolas Maduro it \nhas gotten progressively worse. We have been seeing this and talking \nabout this since earlier this year, when thousands of young people in \nVenezuela took to the streets to protest what was happening and they \nwere met with some of the most brutal attacks we have seen in this \nhemisphere for quite a while. We documented that on the floor \nconsistently.\n  So beginning from that moment forward, we have worked in this body to \nseek sanctions against those individuals, against the people \nresponsible for those human rights violations who also happened to be, \nby the way, incredibly corrupt. I would go so far as to say that almost \nevery major political figure in Venezuela today in the ruling party is \ncorrupt. It is absolutely amazing how these individuals in charge of \ngovernment in that country are systemically stealing the funds of the \nVenezuelan people, and the cases are extraordinary.\n  There are times, for example, when the President of that country--\nwho, by the way, was elected in an illegitimate election--is benefiting \nfrom the currency exchange rate and manipulating that, top-level \nmembers of his Cabinet are skimming off the top of the country's oil \ncompany and pocketing money, and what is even more outrageous about \nthat is that they and the people who surround them in the private \nsector are taking those funds and investing them and enjoying them here \nin the United States of America.\n  So I felt for a very long time--as have my colleagues--that this was \nan important issue that needed to be addressed, and it needed to be \naddressed by sanctioning those individuals and we have named many of \nthem. So yesterday the White House announced that many of these \nindividuals will now be denied visas to travel to the United States. In \nfact, just yesterday a government official from Venezuela who was \nheaded here toward America was not able to come because of these visa \nsanctions.\n  So we are grateful for that, and we are grateful for the \nadministrations's implementation of this. But while we are grateful for \nthe denial of visas, it does not go far enough. We also need to \nsanction their assets. That is why earlier this year I, in conjunction \nwith the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and Senators \nNelson, McCain, and Kirk proposed legislation to authorize both visa \nrestrictions and also financial sanctions against these individuals, \nand we have been extraordinarily patient in working through the process \nto ensure that happens.\n  The ranking member of the committee, the Senator of Tennessee Mr. \nCorker had initial reservations about it, and they were legitimate \nreservations, and as a result the chairman was kind and wise enough to \nhold a hearing where we heard testimony about the reality on the ground \nin Venezuela.\n  We then proceeded to vote on this in the committee, and the committee \nvoted and approved it by a vote of 13 to 2, if I recall correctly, and \nthat happened on May 22.\n\n  Then we patiently worked with our colleagues to try to bring this to \nthe floor, understanding that with all the issues going on it would be \ndifficult to schedule a rollcall vote on it, but we would try to pass \nit by a process in the Senate we call unanimous consent, where we ask \nall of our colleagues to approve it and we worked patiently to do that. \nWhile he had initial reservations earlier this week, Senator Corker \nlifted those reservations and I thank him for that and the way he has \ntaken this so seriously and his cooperation in that matter.\n  My intention this evening was to come to the Senate floor and ask for \nunanimous consent of this body to pass this resolution, but some of my \ncolleagues expressed concern about some of the costs that are \npotentially embedded in this. Let me explain those costs for point of \nclarification. There were two, in general.\n  The first was a $15 million funding for a democracy program in \nVenezuela, which I believe is a worthy endeavor. But for purposes of \novercoming those objections and getting this done, I agreed, and I \nthink the other sponsors did as well, that we would be willing to \nsuspend that in an effort to get this accomplished.\n  The second is a little bit more nebulous. The second describes \nadministrative costs basically for identifying these assets and \nimplementing the sanctions. The costs are not unique to this. They are \nnot real costs in the way you and I would think of costs. You\n\n[[Page S5289]]\n\ndon't have to write an additional check or borrow money from China to \npay for it. It is the same thing that you would have to do if the \nPresident had announced these sanctions, which he has the power to do.\n  What we did as a result of that is we looked at it. The total cost of \nit is between $6 and $8 million, even though that number is probably \nnot that high, but it would basically involve identifying the \nindividuals and identifying the assets they have that we could \nsanction. There was concern about that. We were willing to find an \nadditional measure to sunset the implementation of these sanctions in \n2016 to lower the costs even further, and yet we still heard there \nmight be some objections. Over the last few minutes, however, and in \nconsultation with the Senator from Oklahoma, we have tried to craft \nwhat I believe we hope we can arrive at in the next hours, a solution \nto this problem that assuages his concern and allows us to get this \ndone.\n  So in the interest of trying to achieve it in that manner, I am going \nto withhold asking unanimous consent today for purposes of hopefully \narriving at that agreement over the next few hours or early tomorrow \nmorning so we can attempt to get this done in a way that achieves what \nwe are trying to do.\n  This is critically important.\n  I point out for purposes of my point of comparison, the Senate in \nApril approved a bill which I supported--and I am glad we did--that \nauthorized virtually identical sanctions against human rights violators \nin Ukraine. That bill authorized $50 million for funds for the \nDemocracy Program. That bill authorized $100 million in security \nassistance and visa and financial sanctions on human rights violators. \nIn implementing the sanctions in the Ukrainian human rights bill, the \ncost was $10 million. None of those funds, by the way, were offset in \nthe way that term is used here. There was no objection to that. There \nwas no objection to that. By the way, the total cost of that bill was \n$160 million. This bill that is before us is much more modest in its \nimplications, and I would argue that the costs--at the end of the day, \nwhile it has what we call around here a CBO score, the costs are not \nreal. It is basically what they would have to do anyway.\n\n  We are looking for language that assures our colleagues who are \nrightfully concerned about the debt and deficit but also addresses the \ngrotesque human rights violations occurring in Venezuela today.\n  I will yield to the Senator from New Jersey in a moment, who has \nshown extraordinary leadership on this and every single issue involving \ndemocracy and human rights issues in this region and around the world.\n  I know there are things going on in the Middle East that are of \ncritical importance to our country. I know there are things going on \nvis-a-vis Russia and Ukraine that are of extraordinary importance to \nour country. But I hope people understand that what is happening in \nVenezuela matters too because even as we speak, there are millions of \npeople in that country whose rights are being systematically violated.\n  Just this week the majority regime began a show trial against Mr. \nLeopoldo Lopez, a popular opposition leader, a mayor of one of the \nmunicipalities there. Do you know what his only crime was? Urging \nVenezuelans to demand a constitutional and peaceful solution to \nPresident Maduro's violent repression of demonstrations.\n  In case anyone needs to understand the true nature of the Venezuelan \nregime, it is not just human rights violations or corruption or the \nfact that the cronies of the Maduro administration parade up and down \nthe streets of South Florida bragging about their ill-earned gains \nwithout consequence. Venezuela projects itself as a defender of every \nsingle human rights-violating country on the planet. Anytime there is a \nvote on Iran or Assad in Syria or on any human rights violation, you \ncan count on Venezuela's Government being on the side of the human \nrights violator--every single time. Just recently we have seen them \nagain repeatedly pronounce themselves in opposition to Israel and \nIsrael's right to defend itself.\n  On top of everything else, we are not just sanctioning corruption and \nhuman rights violations; we are sanctioning individuals who at every \nopportunity they get seek to undermine the national security and the \nnational interests of our country.\n  So I think this is a worthy endeavor, and my hope is that tomorrow \nwhen the Senate gets into session we can reach a conclusion on this \nitem and achieve it. I think it would be critically important as we go \ninto August to show that the Senate made progress in this endeavor. The \nHouse has its own version of sanctions that are different from ours. \nThat will have to be reconciled. But I think passage of this in the \nnext few hours will send a powerful message to the people of Venezuela \nthat the people of America, speaking through our Senate, are firmly on \ntheir side and for their aspirations for freedom and liberty and on the \nside of human rights.\n  Madam President, I will yield the floor now for the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague \nfrom Oregon for his courtesy in allowing me to do so.\n  I agree with everything my colleague from Florida Senator Rubio has \nsaid about this issue, and I appreciate his leadership alongside with \nus. He has been following Venezuela intimately. So many people in the \nState of Florida have exiled there, and so he personally understands \nthis issue and he has been a tremendous champion.\n  Since February of this year, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan \ncitizens have protested about the lack of security from rampant crime \nand violence and an inflation rate that is the highest in the world and \na scarcity of food and basic consumer goods that has become part of \ntheir daily lives. But instead of listening to the legitimate concerns \nof its people, the Government of Venezuela has responded with a \ndeplorable display of force and brutality that was seen around the \nworld. To date there have been more than 40 deaths, more than 50 \ndocumented cases of torture, and more than 2,000 unlawful detentions.\n  In May of this year Human Rights Watch released a report on these \nhuman rights violations. The report documented how Venezuelan security \nforces systematically violated the rights of students, women, men, \nmembers of the political opposition, and journalists. They said they \ndid so ``to punish people for their political views.''\n  Last week the Venezuelan Government opened its show trial against \nopposition leader and prisoner of conscience Leopoldo Lopez. After \nspending 5 months in a military prison just for speaking his mind, Mr. \nLopez and his attorney were barred from presenting any evidence in his \ndefense--none. No defense allowed.\n  If that were not enough, we saw that recent events showed that the \nVenezuelan Government is even willing to threaten regional stability to \nget its way.\n  Last week law enforcement officials in Aruba picked up Hugo Carvajal, \nthe former head of the Venezuelan military intelligence and an \nindividual who was designated as a drug kingpin by the U.S. Department \nof Treasury back in 2008. When indictments were unsealed last week, the \nworld saw evidence of how a senior Venezuelan Government official was \ndeeply involved in the international drug trade, allowing traffickers \nto operate freely in Venezuelan territory and even coordinating drug \nshipments himself.\n  When this official was arrested, what did the Venezuelan Government \ndo? It threatened to cut off flights from Venezuela to Aruba and \nCuracao. It threatened to end a contract with Curacao's oil refinery, \nand it moved naval vessels into the waters surrounding these islands. \nIn short, it resorted to every form of blackmail and coercion at its \ndisposition until the Dutch Government released Mr. Carvajal.\n  We should be clear that democracy has had its opportunity. In recent \nmonths foreign ministers from across South America and the Vatican have \nattempted to mediate dialogue between\n\n[[Page S5290]]\n\nPresident Maduro and his allies and the political opposition, and they \nhave not been able to accomplish it.\n  It is time to move more vigorously forward with the types of \nsanctions and other efforts envisioned in the other legislation I and \nSenator Rubio have offered, and if we do that tomorrow we will send a \nmessage to the hemisphere and to the people of Venezuela that, in fact, \nthey have a real opportunity to have their voices heard, and we will \nstand on the right side of human rights and democracy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5290-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            OREGON WILDFIRES\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, at this moment in my home State of \nOregon 500,000 acres are ablaze. Sometimes it is hard to get your hands \naround numbers, particularly large numbers, so I will give a sense of \nthis. If you were to add up all of the fires in Oregon and if they were \nin one place, it would cover an area roughly 20 miles by 40 miles. That \nis an enormous section of a State to be aflame.\n  Because there are so many devastating fires at once, crews are coming \nfrom all over to help with all kinds of aircraft and all kinds of \nhotshot crews. They are doing all they can, but it is not just Oregon \nthat has fires; other States have fires too. There are over 250,000 \nacres ablaze in Washington State to the north in a single fire. I \nbelieve it is the largest single fire in Washington State's history.\n  As a result of fires in Oregon and fires in Washington and other \nfires, we are draining our fire funds at an expansive rate, and thus we \nhave a big problem: We are running out of funds to pay for fighting \nthese fires.\n  Tonight we had before our Chamber an emergency supplemental bill to \nprovide 615 million more dollars to fight fires this season across the \nUnited States of America. A procedural tactic was used to kill this \nbill. Quite frankly, that is enormously shortsighted.\n  Here is what has been happening in the past: The fires are being \nfought, and then the funds run out, and then the Forest Service has to \npull the funds from every other department--from departments involving \nforest health, from departments providing efforts to prevent fires and \ncreate conditions in which they will not happen in the future. We are \ncontinuing a vicious cycle of robbing fire prevention and forest \nmanagement funds to fight emergency fires, and that cycle will go \nforward now that we have failed to pass this emergency supplemental up \nfront.\n  I will give a little flavor of what I am talking about across our \nState. We have the Ochoco complex east of Post, 10,000 acres aflame. \nThe Logging Unit complex northwest of Warm Springs, 6,600 acres; the \nKitten Canyon complex west of Vale, 23,000 acres; the Bridge 99 complex \nnorth of Sisters, 5,700 acres; the Hurricane Creek fire southwest of \nJoseph, 900 acres; we have the Buzzard complex in southeast Oregon, \nnearly 400,000 acres; the Reeves Creek complex southwest of Grants \nPass, 200 acres; the China Cap fire east of La Grande, 200 acres--by \nthe way, zero percent contained--the Black Rock fire east of Antelope, \n36,000 acres; the Sniption fire north of Fossil, 12,000 acres; and the \nBingham complex east of Marion Forks, 450 acres. We also have two more \nfires that have just arisen, and those are the Haystack complex, 1,700 \nacres, and the Salt Creek fire northwest of Medford 100 acres.\n  Here is the thing. We have the conditions for more fires to come--\nmore lightning, a forecast of more hot weather, and we have incredibly \ndry timber on the floor of the forest.\n  This situation in which these fires are going to be fought--by \npulling funds from every other part of the Forest Service--is \nunacceptable. It is not good stewardship of the complex operations that \noccur within the Interior Department and within the Forest Service.\n  Think about the need to plan the timber harvest to sustain the lumber \nindustry. That is a complex process. It involves a lot of folks who \nhave to go out and evaluate the forests and work it out so those timber \nsales can occur on schedule. All of that gets stopped when you have to \nrob the fund in order to pay for fighting these fires.\n  Let's think about the millions of acres of second-growth forest that \nare overgrown. It is very good for disease, it is very good for fires, \nand it needs to be thinned, but how do you plan for the thinning if you \nrob the funds to do so? The list goes on and on and on.\n  I am deeply disappointed and frustrated with what happened tonight, \nand I urge my colleagues to exercise a little thoughtfulness, a little \nwisdom, and a little stewardship regarding our national forest. The \nnext time this comes up, let's pass it unanimously so we can provide \nthe funds that are needed to fight this national emergency.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5290-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5290-S5291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  JUSTICE FOR ALL REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, last week I came to the floor to talk \nabout the FBI's extensive use of flawed evidence in thousands of cases. \nIt is tragic just days later there is yet another scandal involving bad \nscience used to send people to jail and some to death row.\n  According to an internal investigation by the FBI and the Department \nof Justice, nearly 2,600 convictions and 45 death row cases from the \n1980s and 1990s may have involved flawed forensic evidence. \nSpecifically, these cases involved microscopic hair matches, a form of \nforensic science that has been discredited. The scope of this scandal, \nwhich is the focus of a front-page article in the Washington Post \nyesterday, goes well beyond the problems we have previously seen when \nit comes to forensic evidence. Even more troubling than the statistics \noutlined in the Post's story is that the FBI, after recognizing these \negregious mistakes, stopped their full review after examining just a \nsmall fraction of these cases. The Department of Justice has rightly \nordered the FBI to resume its internal review, but the FBI's conduct is \ninexcusable.\n  Once again, we are reminded that our criminal justice system is not \ninfallible and that we are all less safe when the system fails. FBI \ninvestigators should have redoubled their efforts to uncover these \nmistakes and rushed to tell those affected defendants. Instead it \nappears they dragged their feet and stopped their review. I intend to \nget to the bottom of this. I have a lot of questions for the Bureau, \nand I will not stop until they are answered.\n  When we have evidence that could prove that someone is innocent, we \nmust get it processed immediately. It is not only the right thing to do \nfor that person wrongfully accused but it is the right thing to do to \nkeep our communities safe. That is why I again urge the Senate to take \nup and pass the Justice for All Reauthorization Act, a bill I \nintroduced with Senator Cornyn last year. This bipartisan legislation \nincludes the Kirk Bloodsworth Post Conviction DNA Testing Grant \nProgram, named for the first person exonerated from a death row crime \nthrough the use of DNA evidence. This program seeks to correct these \nmost grievous mistakes. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell is a \ncosponsor of the bill. All Senate Democrats support passage of this \nlegislation. There is no reason why the Senate should not take up and \npass this important bill without further delay.\n  I also will continue my efforts to pass commonsense forensic science \nreform legislation. The Criminal Justice and Forensic Science Reform \nAct that I introduced earlier this year with Senator Cornyn would \nimprove the use of forensic science in criminal cases and ensure that \nlabs throughout the Nation are operating according to the highest \nscientific standards.\n  I thank the many law enforcement, victim services, and criminal \njustice organizations that continue to highlight the need for reform to \nensure the proper application of forensic evidence in criminal cases, \nand who have urged the Senate to pass the Justice for All \nReauthorization Act.\n  I ask that the Washington Post article by Spencer Hsu be printed in \nthe Record, and I urge all Senators to join me in getting to the \nserious business of providing justice to the wrongfully convicted and \npassing the Justice for All Reauthorization Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5291]]\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 30, 2014]\n\n           Review Finds Two Decades of Forensic Errors by FBI\n\n                          (By Spencer S. Hsu)\n\n       Nearly every criminal case reviewed by the FBI and the \n     Justice Department as part of a massive investigation started \n     in 2012 of problems at the FBI lab has included flawed \n     forensic testimony from the agency, government officials \n     said.\n       The findings troubled the bureau, and it stopped the review \n     of convictions last August. Case reviews resumed this month \n     at the order of the Justice Department, the officials said.\n       U.S. officials began the inquiry after The Washington Post \n     reported two years ago that flawed forensic evidence \n     involving microscopic hair matches might have led to the \n     convictions of hundreds of potentially innocent people. Most \n     of those defendants never were told of the problems in their \n     cases.\n       The inquiry includes 2,600 convictions and 45 death-row \n     cases from the 1980s and 1990s in which the FBI's hair and \n     fiber unit reported a match to a crime-scene sample before \n     DNA testing of hair became common. The FBI had reviewed about \n     160 cases before it stopped, officials said.\n       The investigation resumed after the Justice Department's \n     inspector general excoriated the department and the FBI for \n     unacceptable delays and inadequate investigation in a \n     separate inquiry from the mid-1990s. The inspector general \n     found in that probe that three defendants were executed and a \n     fourth died on death row in the five years it took officials \n     to reexamine 60 death-row convictions that were potentially \n     tainted by agent misconduct, mostly involving the same FBI \n     hair and fiber analysis unit now under scrutiny. ``I don't \n     know whether history is repeating itself, but clearly the \n     [latest] report doesn't give anyone a sense of confidence \n     that the work of the examiners whose conduct was first \n     publicly questioned in 1997 was reviewed as diligently and \n     promptly as it needed to be,'' said Michael R. Bromwich, who \n     was inspector general from 1994 to 1999 and is now a partner \n     at the Goodwin Procter law firm.\n       Bromwich would not discuss any aspect of the current review \n     because he is a pro bono adviser to the Innocence Project, \n     which along with the National Association of Criminal Defense \n     Lawyers is assisting the government effort under an agreement \n     not to talk about the review. Still, he added, ``Now we are \n     left 18 years [later] with a very unhappy, unsatisfying and \n     disquieting situation, which is far harder to remedy than if \n     the problems had been addressed promptly.''\n       Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole this month ordered \n     that reviews resume under the original terms, officials said.\n       According to the FBI, the delay resulted, in part, ``from a \n     vigorous debate that occurred within the FBI and DOJ about \n     the appropriate scientific standards we should apply when \n     reviewing FBI lab examiner testimony--many years after the \n     fact.''\n       ``Working closely with DOJ, we have resolved those issues \n     and are moving forward with the transcript review for the \n     remaining cases,'' the FBI said.\n       Emily Pierce, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said: ``The \n     Department of Justice never signed off on the FBI's decision \n     to change the way they reviewed the hair analysis. We are \n     pleased that the review has resumed and that notification \n     letters will be going out in the next few weeks.''\n       During the review's 11-month hiatus, Florida's Supreme \n     Court denied an appeal by a death-row inmate who challenged \n     his 1988 conviction based on an FBI hair match. James Aren \n     Duckett's results were caught up in the delay, and his legal \n     options are now more limited.\n       Revelations that the government's largest post-conviction \n     review of forensic evidence has found widespread problems \n     counter earlier FBI claims that a single rogue examiner was \n     at fault. Instead, they feed a growing debate over how the \n     U.S. justice system addresses systematic weaknesses in past \n     forensic testimony and methods.\n       ``I see this as a tip-of-the-iceberg problem,'' said Erin \n     Murphy, a New York University law professor and expert on \n     modern scientific evidence.\n       ``It's not as though this is one bad apple or even that \n     this is one bad-apple discipline,'' she said. ``There is a \n     long list of disciplines that have exhibited problems, where \n     if you opened up cases you'd see the same kinds of overstated \n     claims and unfounded statements.''\n       Worries about the limitations and presentation of \n     scientific evidence are ``coming out of the dark shadows of \n     the legal system,'' said David H. Kaye, a law professor at \n     Penn State who helped lead a Justice Department-funded study \n     of fingerprint analysis and testimony in 2012. ``The question \n     is: What can you do about it?''\n       Courts and law enforcement authorities have been reluctant \n     to allow defendants to retroactively challenge old evidence \n     using newer, more accurate scientific methods.\n       The Justice Department and FBI inquiry, which examines \n     convictions before 2000, could provide a way for defendants \n     to make that challenge. Because the government is dropping \n     procedural objections to appeals and offering new DNA testing \n     in flawed cases if sought by a judge or prosecutor, results \n     could provide a measure of the frequency of wrongful \n     convictions.\n       Responding to the FBI review, the accreditation arm of the \n     American Society of Crime Lab Directors last year recommended \n     that labs determine whether they needed to conduct similar \n     reviews, and New York, North Carolina and Texas are doing so.\n       According to a Justice Department spokesman, officials last \n     August completed reviews and notified a first wave of \n     defendants in 23 cases, including 14 death-penalty cases, \n     that FBI examiners ``exceeded the limits of science'' when \n     they linked hair to crime-scene evidence.\n       However, concerned that errors were found in the ``vast \n     majority'' of cases, the FBI restarted the review, grinding \n     the process to a halt, said a government official who was \n     briefed on the process. The Justice Department objected in \n     January, but a standoff went unresolved until this month.\n       After more than two years, the review will have addressed \n     about 10 percent of the 2,600 questioned convictions and \n     perhaps two-thirds of questioned death-row cases.\n       The department is notifying defendants about errors in two \n     more death-penalty cases and in 134 non-capital cases over \n     the next month, and will complete evaluations of 98 other \n     cases by early October, including 14 more death-penalty \n     cases.\n       No crime lab performed more hair examinations for federal \n     and state agencies than the 10-member FBI unit, which \n     testified in cases nationwide involving murder, rape and \n     other violent felonies.\n       Although FBI policy has stated since at least the 1970s \n     that a hair association cannot be used as positive \n     identification, like fingerprints, agents regularly testified \n     to the near-certainty of matches.\n       In reality, there is no accepted research on how often hair \n     from different people may appear the same. The FBI now uses \n     visual hair comparison to rule out someone as a possible \n     source of hair or as a screening step before more accurate \n     DNA testing.\n       This month, the inspector general reported that inattention \n     and foot-dragging by the Justice Department and the FBI led \n     them to ignore warnings 15 years ago that scientifically \n     unsupported and misleading testimony could have come from \n     more than a single hair examiner among agents discredited in \n     a 1997 inspector general's report on misconduct at the FBI \n     lab.\n       The report said that as of 1999, Justice Department \n     officials had enough information to review all hair unit \n     cases--not just those of former agent Michael P. Malone, who \n     was identified as the agent making the most frequent \n     exaggerated testimony.\n       By 2002, Maureen Killion, then director of enforcement \n     operations, had alerted senior criminal division officials to \n     ``the specter that the other examiners in the unit'' were as \n     sloppy as Malone, the inspector general said.\n       ``This issue has been raised with the FBI but not resolved \n     to date,'' Killion wrote to then-Assistant Attorney General \n     Michael Chertoff and his principal deputy, John C. Keeney, in \n     July 2002, the report said.\n       Twelve years later, the Florida case shows the continued \n     inadequacy of officials' response.\n       Duckett, then a rookie police officer in Mascotte, Fla., \n     was convicted of raping and strangling Teresa McAbee, 11, and \n     dumping her into a lake in 1987.\n       After a state police examiner was unable to match pubic \n     hair found in the victim's underwear, prosecutors went to \n     Malone, who testified at trial that there was a ``high degree \n     of probability'' that the hair came from Duckett.\n       Such testimony is scientifically invalid, according to the \n     parameters of the current FBI review, because it claims to \n     associate a hair with a single person ``to the exclusion of \n     all others.''\n       The Florida court denied Duckett's request for a new \n     hearing on Malone's hair match. The court noted that there \n     was other evidence of Duckett's guilt and that the FBI had \n     not entirely abandoned visual hair comparison.\n       Duckett attorney Mary Elizabeth Wells confirmed this week \n     that Duckett's case was under the FBI's review. Both Wells \n     and Whitney Ray, a spokeswoman for Florida Attorney General \n     Pam Bondi, said Thursday that parties had not been notified \n     of results, but they otherwise declined to comment.\n       Duckett's case was eligible for the 1996 review as a Malone \n     case but was omitted, even though the inspector general \n     stated that ``it was important to the integrity of the \n     justice system'' that all of Malone's death-penalty cases be \n     immediately reviewed.\n       The Justice Department declined to comment on the omission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5291-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5291-S5293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING HOARD'S DAIRYMAN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I would like to applaud Hoard's Dairyman \nfor shining a light on an important and sometimes overlooked problem in \nrural America.\n  The article in their July 2014 issue, ``When Life Turned Ugly,'' \nwritten by Andrea Stoltzfus, focused on the unique challenges that \nrural victims of domestic violence face in overcoming their abusers. \nThey are often geographically isolated and unaware of the resources \navailable to them or they lack the ability to reach a crisis center due \nto a lack of public transportation. There also may not be a local \nshelter to help them or they may not have the\n\n[[Page S5292]]\n\nfinancial means to set out on their own. These obstacles can make it \nparticularly difficult for women in rural areas, like the dairy farm \nwives cited in the article, to escape abusive relationships.\n  From my days as a prosecutor in Vermont, I still vividly remember \nseeing the aftermath of this type of violence firsthand. I will never \nforget arriving on the scenes of domestic violence crimes. These \nexperiences have spurred me in my roles as the chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and as a senior member of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee to work to prevent domestic violence and sexual assault. Most \nrecently I was proud to sponsor the reauthorization of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, VAWA, which the President signed into law in March \n2013. Since VAWA was first enacted in 1994, it has helped to lower the \nannual incidence of domestic violence by more than half, it has raised \nawareness, and it has increased reporting of these crimes. VAWA has \nalso improved the criminal justice system's ability to keep victims \nsafe and hold perpetrators accountable. But there is still more that we \ncan and should do.\n  One in every four women will experience domestic violence in her \nlifetime. That rate is even higher in rural areas. That is why I have \nworked to ensure that the domestic violence programs are adequately \nfunded. In particular, I have pushed for increased funding for the \nRural Domestic Violence Program. This program was established by the \nfirst VAWA to address the unique challenges faced by victims of \ndomestic violence and dating violence in rural jurisdictions. This \nprogram supports the safety of rural victims of sexual assault, \ndomestic violence, dating violence and stalking by funding projects \nuniquely designed to address and prevent rural crimes. It encourages \ncooperation among law enforcement and victim service providers, among \nothers, to investigate criminal incidents and to offer treatment, \neducation and prevention strategies.\n  As a husband, father, grandfather, and as a former prosecutor, I know \nwe can and must do everything we can to combat domestic violence. I \nhope that the Hoard's Dairyman article will help raise awareness. No \nwoman should feel trapped in an abusive relationship, and we must all \nwork to ensure they are not.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Hoard's Dairyman, July 2014]\n\n                         When Life Turned Ugly\n\n\n   Domestic violence is an all too common occurrence in rural America\n\n                         (By Andrea Stoltzfus)\n\n       From the road, the farm looks well kept, the fields \n     prosperous. The animals are content, the garden is \n     flourishing. But behind the closed doors, away from the \n     curious onlookers, the helpful neighbors, a different scene \n     unfolds--that of domestic violence among rural farm women.\n       What follows is a real-life conversation with a dairy farm \n     wife who was a victim of domestic violence. As we move \n     through the article, we will discuss the multiple layers of \n     the issue and how women can find help.\n       ``I ended up with this man because I wanted my dreams to \n     come true of being married to a farmer, enjoying the farm and \n     quality of life I had growing up on a dairy farm. I was after \n     the same relationship my parents had. In my mind, it was all \n     going to be so blissful. We would do chores together and \n     share life together, enjoy being together and live happily \n     ever after. I could not have been more wrong. I have learned \n     that chasing dreams can be very costly, and I don't \n     necessarily mean money.''\n\n\n                          Behind closed doors\n\n       Domestic abuse in rural areas is just as likely to happen \n     as in other communities, but women living in remote areas \n     face other barriers to reporting the abuse or escaping the \n     situation. The isolation of farms or ranches from towns can \n     make it hard for emergency services to respond in a timely \n     manner. Phone service may be spotty or even obsolete. ``Going \n     to town'' could mean hours, not minutes, of travel time.\n       According to the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic \n     Violence website, the rural culture plays a role in making \n     abuse reporting difficult.\n       ``A `rural culture' often includes everyone working \n     together and knowing what is going on in each other's lives. \n     It is likely that law enforcement, judges, social services \n     and health care workers, faith leaders, and others know both \n     the victim and the abuser. As a result, it may be more \n     uncomfortable to share what is happening behind closed doors. \n     Victims may feel that people won't take their situation \n     seriously. In addition, there may be strong ties among \n     extended families that mean breaking up the family is frowned \n     upon.''\n       ``The people I got most of my help from were strangers. \n     Neighbors, friends, family acted like I had the plague. How \n     could this happen in our family, in our neighborhood, in our \n     safe small town?''\n       Additionally, women may be partners in the farm, not only \n     in the marriage, but in the daily workload and the financial \n     end of the business. The farm or ranch may be the only source \n     of family income, and the victim may be reluctant to leave as \n     she has no other economic resources available.\n       Rural women have strong emotional ties to the land and \n     livestock. Leaving could mean neglect or harm for the animals \n     she cares for. Living on farms means more access to things \n     that could be used as weapons--axes, chains, pitchforks, \n     guns--working with farm equipment can be a ready excuse for \n     injuries.\n       ``I even ended up driving myself to the ER the morning of \n     my daughter's 8th birthday getting five staples placed in my \n     scalp where I got hit with a pipe for some stupid reason, \n     then returned home to finish milking cows. There were several \n     events like this. I had a bruise all down my arm, and I told \n     people at work that the milk tank cover fell on my arm, and \n     that's why it was all black.''\n       Domestic abuse isn't always about physical abuse--it can \n     also mean sexual abuse, emotional abuse or financial abuse. \n     According to the Nebraska Domestic Violence Sexual Assault \n     Coalition, it is important to know there is not ``one way'' \n     an individual is abusive. When one abuse tactic no longer \n     provides the abuser the results he/she wants, they will \n     change to another to get the desired results.\n       ``The milk price had nothing to do with it--he hit before \n     we had our own herd. The crops, the weather, nothing had a \n     thing to do with it. My husband loved the control, the power \n     he had over me.\n       ``It started basically the day after I married him. At that \n     point, I became property. I remember the chute to the gutter \n     cleaner breaking into many pieces and me not being able to \n     shut the gutter cleaner off fast enough.\n       The memory of being screamed at, called vulgar names, made \n     to feel totally worthless and brought down to tears for the \n     first time are etched in my mind. It seemed like whenever \n     stressful events such as this happened, he would transfer his \n     anger at the situation to me. I would frequently get pushed \n     and kicked.\n       He gradually progressed from just name calling, screaming \n     and physical abuse to making threats of killing me, pointing \n     his finger at my forehead and saying `bang.' ''\n\n\n                            Options seem few\n\n       Why don't victims leave the situation?\n       The reasons are many--including the inability to actually \n     leave the farm--as they may not have access to a vehicle or \n     public transportation. A shelter or services could be miles \n     away, with no advocates or access to legal aid. Even if a \n     victim decides to pursue legal assistance, it may not be as \n     easy as it seems.\n       ``I know it seems like this is a black and white issue, but \n     it's really not. There were lots of things to think about--I \n     knew I could not run this farm without him here, and most of \n     all I never wanted at any point to see the farm fail. Many \n     thoughts raced through my mind:\n       Do I call the police? No. If he gets arrested, when he gets \n     out, it will only be worse.\n       Do I tell people? No. That only means embarrassment and \n     people knowing that I am not as strong as I seem to be.\n       When I threatened to divorce him and tell him he would have \n     to sell out to get my name off loans, he would threaten to \n     kill me and kill my family.''\n       Most victims' services groups recommend having an ``escape \n     plan'' in place, which includes the actions to get to a safe \n     place and the items to take with them. Making a primary care \n     provider aware of the home situation can be part of the plan.\n       ``I must also add that, through it all, when I had doctor \n     appointments, the doctor and I always discussed the issues, \n     but I always told the doctor that I felt safe and always had \n     an escape plan. The doctor recommended I go see a \n     psychiatrist, which helped me through a lot of it and gave me \n     the inner strength to actually leave.\n       I realized that, when it got to the point of me saying that \n     the day he died would be the happiest day in my life, this \n     was no place to be mentally or physically. I also went to the \n     county resources for domestic abuse, but all it seemed they \n     wanted to do was rush me in front of a judge to get a \n     restraining order, which was not the route I wanted to take. \n     I was also told that I should go to the police from the \n     threats of death he would constantly make, but once again I \n     knew I could not run the farm, and I knew the consequences \n     would be far worse.''\n       Phone hotlines, internet sites and local community members \n     can be a lifeline to an abuse victim. However, limited phone \n     coverage, the threat of the abuser finding the sites viewed \n     or neighbors who ``don't want to get involved'' can all be \n     barriers to finding help.\n       ``Even though resources are out there, it's not as simple \n     as just utilizing them, as every situation is different, the \n     fears are different and at different intensities, the degree \n     of abuse is different, the inner strength of the victim is \n     different, the family support is different, the family \n     dynamics are different, so\n\n[[Page S5293]]\n\n     sometimes it's just not that simple as seeking out \n     resources.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5293-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CRISIS IN GAZA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the crisis in Gaza is extremely \ndistressing, particularly to those who had hope for Secretary of State \nKerry's years of shuttle diplomacy between the Government of Israel and \nthe Palestinian Authority.\n  After seeing several similar attempts fail in the past, we know that \nfor such diplomacy to succeed over the long term it will require the \nparticipation not only of representatives of the Israeli and \nPalestinian parties to the conflict but also the active support of \nEgypt, Jordan, Turkey, and the other Arab states.\n  Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas are not able to reach an \nagreement to end the conflict themselves. Also, any agreement that \nlacks the support of Hamas or that cannot withstand the active \nopposition of Hamas will almost certainly fail.\n  According to the Government of Israel, at least 2,600 Hamas rockets \nand mortars have been fired indiscriminately toward Israel, forcing \nthousands of Israelis into basements and bomb shelters. Fortunately, \nmost have landed harmlessly, and the U.S.-supplied Iron Dome missile \ndefense system has intercepted many others.\n  The latest report of the United Nations Office for the Coordination \nof Humanitarian Affairs paints a chilling picture of death and \ndestruction in Gaza.\n  Hamas has placed rocket launchers, ammunition, and tunnels in the \nmidst of densely populated residential areas, even in mosques and U.N. \nfacilities, and they are being targeted by Israeli bombs, missiles, and \ntank shells. Of course, civilians are literally trapped in the \ncrossfire. As of today, at least 1,118 Palestinians have been killed, \n6,233 injured, and 240,000 displaced from their homes, many of which \nhave been damaged or destroyed. The overwhelming majority of the \nvictims have been civilians.\n  It is clear that Hamas's leaders, who specialize in terrorist \ntactics, care far more about their fighters than the safety of Gaza's \ncivilian population. Yet even safe havens, such as clearly marked \nUnited Nations schools and hospitals, have been hit by Israeli bombs or \nmissiles, and at least one may have been hit by a Hamas rocket. Many \npeople, including children, seeking shelter have been killed and \ninjured as a result.\n  During this same period, 56 Israeli soldiers have been killed, 400 \nhave been wounded, and 3 Israeli civilians have died.\n  I sympathize with the argument that Israel had little choice but to \nrespond forcefully to Hamas's rocket attacks. It is hard to imagine any \ngovernment faced with a similar threat to its citizens not responding.\n  I also support, as we all do, the Israeli Government's goal of \neliminating Hamas's heavy weapons and destroying the dozens of tunnels \nthat are used to smuggle them into Gaza and to enable Hamas fighters to \nsneak into Israel to kill Israelis.\n  But this is not the first time Israel has sought to achieve these \ngoals only to fall short, at great human cost. Operation Cast Lead in \n2008 resulted in 1,400 Palestinian deaths and the deaths of 3 Israeli \ncivilians and 6 Israeli soldiers. Then in 2012 there was Operation \nPillar of Defense. Each time, despite the destruction of Hamas's \nweapons, launchers, and command posts, Hamas remained in control of \nGaza.\n  After each of these operations, Hamas rearmed and is as determined \ntoday as it was 2 years ago. It does not appear that either goal, even \nif justified and laudable, can be achieved for the long term--if at \nall--without inflicting unacceptable civilian casualties.\n  Israeli authorities stress that its army tries its best to avoid \ncivilian casualties. They know the impact each innocent death has on \nworld opinion and on the Palestinian people. Thousands of Palestinians \nin the West Bank, many of whom despise Hamas, have joined in \ndemonstrations against Israel because of the loss of civilian lives in \nGaza.\n  But what is often ignored in the impassioned debate over this issue, \nincluding by those who rightly point out that the Israeli military at \ntimes provides prior warning to civilians of an imminent attack, is \nthat Gaza is not like anywhere else. Its residents cannot flee to \nsafety in a neighboring country, as millions of Syrians have done. They \ncannot even escape by boat. Shelters in Gaza that should be safe are \nnot safe. The people of Gaza are, for all practical purposes, \ndefenseless, trapped, and unable to avoid the violence.\n  Hamas has insisted that it will not cease its attacks until Israel \nends its export, import, and border restrictions on Gaza, which the \npeople of Gaza, who lack safe water, sanitation, reliable electricity, \nand other basic necessities, say have made their daily lives nearly \nimpossible. With each passing day, condemnation of the violence has \nintensified. Yet the death toll has continued to rise.\n  I commend Secretary Kerry for his efforts to broker a humanitarian \nceasefire. There never has been a military solution to the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict, and there is not one today. He deserves our \nstrong support.\n  If the ceasefire announced today holds and if the United States \ncontinues to serve as the principle diplomatic intermediary, there \nneeds to be some new thinking regarding our negotiating strategy. We \ncannot afford another dozen years with nothing to show for it, with the \nchasm between Israelis and Palestinians even deeper, with radical \nextremists further emboldened, and yet another calamity like the one we \nare witnessing today.\n  It is difficult to see how that will be prevented if Hamas continues \nto reject Israel's right to exist and refuses to renounce terrorism, \nwhich is fundamental to any solution that brings lasting peace and \nsecurity to both Israelis and Palestinians, nor is it likely to be \nprevented absent a decision by Israel to substantially ease its \neconomic restrictions on Gaza. That may be the only way to eliminate \nHamas's excuse for its rocket attacks, to bring desperately needed \neconomic development to Gaza, and to create the necessary conditions \nfor the disarming of Hamas.\n  With each passing day, the grave consequences for the people of Gaza \nand Israel, for stability in the region, and for the security of the \nUnited States have become more apparent. The White House should use \nevery ounce of its influence to help bring this tragic chapter of \nhistory finally to an end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5293-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 CYPRUS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Rivas said he also joined \n     because he wanted to travel, which the Marines have allowed \n     him to do, serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as all \n     over the U.S.\n       On the same day he enlisted, Rivas left for recruit \n     training in Parris Island, South Carolina, and in July went \n     to a school of infantry\n\n[[Page S5295]]\n\n     in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, for basic training.\n       ``We dug man holes and stayed in them for 24 hours,'' Rivas \n     remembers. ``This was one of my favorite parts of being a \n     Marine.''\n       In September 2004 he was sent to Camp Johnson, North \n     Carolina, for Personal Administration School to learn basic \n     administration procedures of the Marines. Then in November \n     the same year he went to the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force \n     Headquarters Group, in Camp Pendleton, California, where \n     Rivas worked on a daily basis in administration.\n       Rivas was deployed to Camp Fallujah, Iraq, in January 2006 \n     with the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force Headquarters Group. \n     While there, he held administrative support duties, as well \n     as tower duty, where they would stand for 16-hour shifts in \n     the tower, watching to make sure no one entered the base from \n     their positions. He worked at a gate on the base, scanning \n     all the eyes of the Local Nationals that would enter the base \n     to work.\n       ``The living conditions were not so bad,'' Rivas said. ``We \n     had hard-standing buildings to sleep in at night and then we \n     had trailers that had showers and bathrooms. We had a chow \n     facility to eat so we didn't have to eat the MRE's unless we \n     were out on patrols for a few days. So, overall, the living \n     conditions were okay.''\n       After returning from Iraq, he held multiple administrative \n     and supervisory positions at Camp Pendleton, California, \n     Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Yuma, Arizona.\n       In November 2012, Rivas was deployed for his second tour, \n     this time sent to Kabul, Afghanistan, with the United States \n     Forces Afghanistan, working with the Navy and Air Force to \n     make sure every servicemember received their awards before \n     departing to the U.S.\n       Also in Afghanistan, Rivas was on the drive team, \n     responsible for safely transporting civilian military \n     employees, servicemembers and high-ranking officers around to \n     different bases in Afghanistan.\n       Living in a five-story building that included everything \n     inside, such as a gym, their rooms (with a restroom in each \n     one), and Wi-Fi connections, Rivas said this was the best \n     living conditions he had ever had.\n       Rivas is married to Elizabeth Chaves Rivas and they have \n     four kids, Lizette Marie Arizmendi, Ruben Fernando Arizmendi, \n     Antonio Miguel Rivas and Kaylani Aziana Rivas.\n       ``I want everyone to know she is the reason that I had a \n     long successful Marine Corps career,'' Rivas said. ``My kids \n     are my life and the greatest joy in the world is being a \n     father.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5295-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JAMES P. SIMONS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to U.S. \nArmy veteran and former CPT James P. Simons, one of our Nation's and \nthe Commonwealth of Kentucky's brave heroes from the Vietnam war.\n  From June 1966 to June 1967, Mr. Simons served as a lieutenant in \nTroop A, 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry, 1st Cavalry Division, Airmobile, in \nSouth Vietnam. During the first 9\\1/2\\ months of his deployment, then-\nLieutenant Simons flew unarmed OH-13 helicopters as a scout pilot, \nflying deep into enemy territory, above the jungle, to search for \ninsurgents below. Lieutenant Simons would radio back enemy locations to \nhis post, and American forces would move in.\n  Lieutenant Simons logged an incredible 1,430 flight hours during the \nfirst 9\\1/2\\ months of his deployment. He often flew four and five \nmissions per day, landing every few hours to refuel and returning to \nthe air a short time later. Ten- and 12-hour days spent flying in enemy \nterritory were not uncommon. During a period in which scout pilots were \nscarce, Lieutenant Simons remarkably flew missions on 27 consecutive \ndays.\n  Captain Simons has received numerous medals for his heroism and \nservice during the Vietnam war. They include: the Vietnam Campaign \nMedal, the Vietnam Service Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, \nand two Air Medals--a rarity--which were needed to appropriately \nrepresent the 625 combat missions Lieutenant Simons flew in Vietnam. In \naddition to these medals, former Captain Simons has received three \nPurple Hearts, the Bronze Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the \nDistinguished Service Cross.\n  Mr. Simons received Purple Hearts for each of the combat wounds he \nsustained; he was injured twice when the helicopters he was piloting \nwere shot down by enemy fire. The third injury occurred when the enemy \nlaunched a nighttime mortar attack and a mortar exploded in Lieutenant \nSimons' tent. Following the attack, Lieutenant Simons was transported \nto a field hospital where he had 26 pieces of shrapnel removed. After \nsustaining his third combat injury, Lieutenant Simons was no longer \npermitted to fly due to the number of times he had been wounded. He \nspent the remaining 10 weeks of his tour in Vietnam serving our \nmilitary and our country in other capacities.\n  Mr. Simons received the prestigious Distinguished Flying Cross due to \nhis valiant action on November 24, 1966, during a search-and-destroy \nmission near Bong Son, Vietnam. Lieutenant Simons was flying ahead of \nU.S. ground forces to locate areas concentrated with enemies when he \ntook on machine gun fire. In the face of this attack, Lieutenant Simons \nconducted reconnaissance of the area to assist with the ground mission. \nAs he took on heavy enemy fire his helicopter eventually was shot down. \nLieutenant Simons fortunately was not wounded, and he bravely assisted \nan injured crewmember in seeking cover before the two were evacuated.\n  Less than 1 month later, on December 17, 1966, Lieutenant Simons \ncarried out acts of bravery for which he ultimately was awarded the \nDistinguished Service Cross, the military's second-highest decoration \nfor a member of the U.S. Army. He received this award for his \n``extraordinary heroism'' during yet another ground search-and-destroy \nmission near Bong Son, Vietnam.\n  Lieutenant Simons was leading a helicopter scout group screening \nahead for U.S. forces on the ground. During heavy exchanges of ground \nfire, Lieutenant Simons flew low and in harm's way to mark enemy \npositions with smoke grenades. As the battle continued, Lieutenant \nSimons saw that U.S. troops below him had become stranded. In response, \nhe dropped grenades on enemy bunkers and continued to fly low to \nattract enemy fire so his fellow American servicemembers could be \nrescued. Lieutenant Simons took a number of actions at tremendous \npersonal risk, and his heroism and selflessness ultimately saved the \nlives of three of his fellow comrades.\n  Former Captain Simons' courageous military service on behalf of the \nUnited States during the Vietnam war deserves the recognition of this \nbody. Thus, I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in honoring Mr. \nJames P. Simons today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5295-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5295-S5296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NANCY OLKEWICZ\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, today, I want to talk about the worst \nkept secret in the Senate. Nancy Olkewicz is really great at her job. I \nhave depended on her many times as have many others in this Chamber. \nShe has had many roles in the Senate, and she has been spectacular with \nall of them. She has served under chairmen like the late Senator Robert \nC. Byrd, Senator Harry Reid, and me. Over the years, she has been given \nmany challenging assignments, and she has never failed to deliver. It \nis with great pride and some sadness that Nancy has announced her plans \nto leave the Senate Sergeant at Arms and retire from the Senate this \nsummer. We celebrate her 36 years with us. She will be very much \nmissed.\n  Many people in Washington see their professions as just jobs. For \nNancy, her work has meant much more than that. The agencies she helped \nfund and the people she has worked with are her second family. She has \nbeen working in the Senate since she was 19 and an aide to Senator Paul \nSarbanes. Nancy practically grew up in the Senate. Her countless \nfriends and the respect she has earned from both sides of the aisle are \na testament to her accomplishments and her demeanor.\n  If you want to see a monument to Nancy's work here, look no further \nthan the Senate rain garden. This innovation has been capturing and \nfiltering runoff from parking lots to reduce storm water flooding and \nkeep pollutants from entering local streams and rivers for 10 years \nnow. This remarkable project could not have happened without Nancy's \nwork for the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee. Thanks to \nher tenacity and pleasant--but stern--oversight, the Senate rain garden \nwas completed on time and under budget. Today, the Senate rain garden \nstands as a constant reminder of sustainability and stewardship every \nday for the visitors and staffers on Capitol Hill.\n  I could go on much longer talking about Nancy. She is accomplished, \nhumble, and kind. Many of us in the\n\n[[Page S5296]]\n\nSenate, from the men and women responsible for maintaining these \nhallowed halls to the most senior Senators, have been on the receiving \nend of her bright smile and cheerful greetings. Three million annual \nvisitors and thousands of staffers are unknowing beneficiaries of years \nof work she contributed quietly behind the scenes, playing a pivotal \nrole in the construction of Capitol Visitor Center.\n  So what is Nancy going to do now? She is excited about joining the \nNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation, where she will contribute her \nconsiderable skills to conservation efforts across the country.\n  While I wish her continued success in her new job, I have a suspicion \nher future also will involve a certain baseball team not too far from \nhere, the Washington Nationals. Nancy is a fourth generation \nWashingtonian, and she is all in for the Nats. I hope Bryce Harper and \nJayson Werth understand that they will have to up their game. Because \nNancy will be there, coaching them from the stands.\n  It is with great pride that I ask my colleagues to join me in \nthanking Nancy for her long career in the Senate and celebrating the \nmany contributions she has made here. Her extraordinary work will be \nremembered by many. Thank you, Nancy Olkewicz.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5296-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                UKRAINE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the world was united in horror at the \ndowning of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine. Subsequent events \nhave only intensified that horror, as we have learned the airliner and \nits nearly 300 passengers and crew were shot out of the sky by a \nsophisticated missile and radar system, a system operated from \nterritory that rebels occupy in eastern Ukraine. We do not know if \nRussia played any direct role in downing the jetliner, but we do know \nthat Russia supplied the equipment, and that it fomented the unlawful \ninsurrection that led to this horrific event.\n  The world has been unified in its condemnation of this atrocity. \nThere is strengthened support, both in the United States and among our \nallies, for stronger action to confront Russian aggression, restore \nstability in Ukraine, reassure our friends in the region, and allow the \nUkrainian people a future they choose, rather than one dictated from \nMoscow. I commend President Obama's action this week to lead a \ncoalition that has further strengthened sanctions against Russia and \nthose who seek to destabilize Ukraine.\n  But we need to do more. We need to do more because so far, every time \nPresident Putin has had the opportunity to veer off his destructive \ncourse, he has chosen instead obfuscation, denial and further \naggression. The United States has already provided some nonlethal \nmilitary support to Ukraine. But I believe it is time for us and our \nallies to intensify that support, and to help Ukraine exercise \nsovereignty and maintain its territorial integrity while dissuading \nRussia from further intervening.\n  The Ukrainian military has achieved important successes in recent \nweeks against the rebels who would dismantle Ukraine, significantly \nshrinking rebel-controlled territory. Left on its own, it appears the \nUkrainian government will be able to reassert control over eastern \nUkraine. But this job has been more difficult because of the backing of \nRussia for the rebels, including its provision of heavy weapons. It \nwill become all but impossible if Russia decided to cross the border \nwith its own troops. We should take additional steps to help Ukraine \nreclaim sovereignty in eastern Ukraine and try to deter Russia from \ncrossing the border.\n  As part of this effort we should provide Ukraine with defensive \nweapons--such as anti-tank weapons--that can help Ukraine reclaim its \nterritory and deter Russian aggression, without being needlessly \nprovocative to the Russians. These are defensive weapons, not \nprovocative weapons.\n  There is a clear path out of this violence, violence whose impact we \nnow tragically know is not limited to Ukraine's borders. Russia can end \nits backing for rebels whose fighting capabilities are wholly dependent \non Russian support. Russia can join the world in calling on those \nrebels to participate in the Ukrainian's government's good-faith \nefforts to resolve political disputes by peaceful means. Russia can \nallow Ukraine to exercise sovereignty over territory it lawfully \ncontrols.\n  Russia can choose that path. But we may not know its choice until it \nis too late. We should provide the military assistance that can help \nUkraine defend itself, reclaim its sovereign territory and hopefully \ndeter further Russian intervention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5296-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CLOSING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LOOPHOLES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, studies have estimated that over one in \nthree American women will face some form of domestic abuse in their \nlifetime, and that when guns are present during incidents of domestic \nviolence, the risk of homicide escalates over 500 percent.\n  As the statistics suggest, the combination of domestic violence and \nfirearms can lead to horrific tragedies. Like in May 2014, when Lori \nJackson of Oxford, CT filed for a restraining order against her \nabusive, estranged husband. The court granted her a temporary \nrestraining order while she waited 2 weeks for a hearing to obtain a \npermanent restraining order. In the meantime, fearful of her husband, \nMs. Jackson took her twin 18-month-olds and fled. But before Ms. \nJackson could obtain a permanent order, her husband found her, stormed \nthe house where she was staying, fatally shot her and wounded her \nmother.\n  This is a tragedy that could have been prevented. The Violence \nAgainst Women Act, which Congress first passed in 1994, included a \ncommon-sense provision to prevent people subject to a permanent \nrestraining order from buying or possessing a gun. Since 1994, this \nprovision has saved countless lives.\n  But there is a critical loophole in this law: while people subject to \na permanent restraining order are prohibited from having a weapon, this \nsafeguard does not apply to those subject to a temporary restraining \norder. This loophole left Ms. Jackson, who had obtained a temporary \nrestraining order against her husband and was awaiting a permanent \norder, perilously vulnerable in the dangerous days immediately after \nshe left her spouse.\n  It is long past time to close this loophole. That is why I am a \ncosponsor of the Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act \nof 2014. This bill would prevent individuals subject to temporary \nrestraining orders--like Ms. Jackson's husband--from buying or \npossessing a gun for the duration of that temporary order. It also \nwould expand the legal definition of `intimate partner' to include \nindividuals who are simply dating partners.\n  But closing the temporary restraining order loophole is just the \nfirst step. Sadly, a patchwork of inadequate State and local resources \nhamstrings the effectiveness of these lifesaving laws. In reality, just \nissuing a permanent restraining order that legally disqualifies a \nperson from purchasing a firearm does not necessarily mean the person's \nname will be added to the National Instant Criminal Background Check, \nNICS system. Nor does it mean that law enforcement will be notified of \nthe urgent need to remove firearms from that dangerous person's \npossession.\n  That is why I am also a cosponsor of the Domestic Violence Gun \nHomicide Prevention Act. This bill would establish new grants to assist \nStates in carrying out policies that, among other things, encourage \nState and local courts to account for whether a domestic abuser \npossesses a gun that they may use against their victims and to order \nthe recovery of those guns, when appropriate. The grants created by \nthis bill would provide vital assistance to the law enforcement \nprofessionals we trust with the safety of our communities, and would go \na long way toward better enforcement of the gun safety laws we already \nhave on the books.\n  The decision to flee from an abusive partner or spouse is \nextraordinarily difficult and courageous. Congress should honor the \npeople who have taken this step by passing common-sense legislation to \nprotect those who may need to do it in the future. I urge my colleagues \nto move quickly to pass these urgently-needed measures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5296-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5296-S5299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGETARY REVISIONS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Madam President, I previously filed budgetary aggregates \nand committee allocations for budget years 2014 and 2015 pursuant to \nsection 116 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. In addition, earlier \ntoday, I filed revisions to those levels for S. 2648, the Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations Act, 2014. Those adjustments were made as a \nresult of funding designated as emergency requirements in S. 2648 \npursuant to section\n\n[[Page S5298]]\n\n251(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \nAct of 1985. Because the Senate did not pass S. 2648, I am now \nreversing the adjustments I filed earlier today.\n  Consequently, I am revising the budgetary aggregates for 2014 by a \ntotal of -$3.571 billion in budget authority and -$25 million in \noutlays. I am also revising the budgetary aggregates for 2015 by a \ntotal of -$2.888 billion in outlays. In addition, I am revising the \nbudget authority and outlay allocations to the Appropriations Committee \nfor 2014 by -$3.346 billion in nonsecurity budget authority, -$225 \nmillion in security budget authority and -$25 million in total outlays. \nI am revising the outlay allocations to the appropriations committee \nfor 2015 by -$2.888 billion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing the \nchanges to the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations and the \nbudgetary aggregates be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be

VIETNAM\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, today I honor a superb leader, intrepid \nwarrior, and outstanding role model. Fifty years ago on August 4, then-\nLTJG Everett ``Ev'' Alvarez, was shot down in his A-4 Skyhawk during a \nbombing mission in the Gulf of Tonkin. Everett was the first U.S. pilot \nshot down over North Vietnam and served 8\\1/2\\ years--the second-\nlongest tenure of any U.S. prisoner of war. Over the years, hundreds of \nother American prisoners joined him in Hoa Lo prison and similar \ndetention centers around the country. Despite starvation and other \nsignificant health challenges, Everett had the physical, mental, \nemotional, and spiritual strength to endure the harshest conditions \nimaginable until his release on February 12, 1973.\n  Mr. Alvarez went on to complete a 20-year career in the Navy, \nretiring as a Commander in 1980. His service to our Nation, however, \ndid not end there. Upon retirement, Everett earned a law degree and in \n1981 was appointed by President Reagan to be the Deputy Director of the \nPeace Corps. Quickly proving his ability to lead outside of the \nmilitary, a year later President Reagan nominated him in 1982 to be the \nDeputy Administrator of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, \nserving 6 years. Everett went on to serve on several boards, including \nthe board of regents of the Uniformed Services University of the Health \nSciences, is a lifetime member on the board of fellows of his alma \nmater, Santa Clara University, and earlier this year was asked by \nSecretary Hagel to be a member of the Vietnam War Commemoration \nAdvisory Council.\n  His performance in and out of uniform has been widely recognized, to \ninclude the Silver Star, two Legions of Merit, two Bronze Stars, the \nDistinguished Flying Cross, as well as the Lone Sailor Award, an honor \nbestowed to sea service veterans for exceptional civilian leadership. \nEverett has made an indelible impact on his fellow prisoners, service \nmembers, and organizations he has been associated with over his \nlifetime. He is the co-author of two seminal works on the experience of \nliving in captivity--``Chained Eagle'' and ``Code of Conduct.''\n  Committing a lifetime of service to our Nation, Ev personifies the \nindomitable American spirit and is a shining example of strength \nthrough adversity. In an interview he once famously said, ``Together we \nstepped into the dungeons and we faced the dragon, and we came out of \nit.''

The U.S. Customs Service was created \nby the 5th Act of the 1st Congress.\n  The U.S. Customs Service placed controls on imports and exports and \non shipping and trade, which were deemed essential by the founders of \nthe Republic, and would have been impossible without implementation by \nan honest, resourceful, and efficient Customs Service. The original \nCustoms collectors, the Customs houses, and today's CBP officers have \nstood for 225 years as the embodiment of Federal authority at our ports \nof entry.\n  After 225 years, the ever more complex demands of our economy and our \nsociety require CBP officers to remain alert and ready to perform on \nshort notice a widening variety of tasks. Today's dedicated CBP \npersonnel, and their predecessor Customs inspectors, have been the \nfirst line of defense against the entry into the United States of \nterrorists, terrorist weapons, illicit drugs and other contraband \ngoods, while protecting the economic well-being of the Nation, and \nsupporting American jobs, by facilitating legitimate trade and travel, \nand protecting this country's intellectual property rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5299-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ISRAEL\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I come to the floor today in support \nof the State of Israel, our closest and most critical ally in the \nMiddle East. The escalating violence between Israel and Hamas is \nextremely disheartening. At this time of extreme instability and \nconflict in the region, the clear and unyielding support of the United \nStates for Israel is more critical than ever. While we all hope for a \npeaceful ceasefire and a return to negotiations between Israel and the \nPalestinian Authority, we cannot ignore the current situation.\n  For weeks now, Israel has been responding to Hamas militants in Gaza \nwhose clear mission is to exact a civilian death toll. It is an often-\nused tactic of Hamas, a designated foreign terrorist organization, to \nlaunch rockets into Israel at civilian targets. In doing so, they not \nonly harm innocent Israelis but put Palestinian civilians in danger as \nwell. Hamas's exposure of their own population to danger is made worse \nwhen they use civilians in Gaza as human shields. When Hamas used \ncement for the construction of tunnels to attack and kidnap civilians \ninstead of using it for the construction of peaceful infrastructure \nprojects, they literally chose the path of conflict over the path of \npeace. Israel has the undeniable right to defend itself against these \nthreats to their civilians, and we must stand by our friend and help \nprotect innocent lives in any way we can.\n  One thing we can do to continue to support Israel is to continue to \nsupport the Iron Dome missile defense system. The United States has \nprovided financial support for this state-of-the-art defense system for \nyears, and I, and many of my colleagues from both parties have been \nstrong and continual supporters since its inception. The technology is \nextraordinarily effective at stopping rockets fired at civilian targets \nin Israel from Gaza; according to some estimates, it has intercepted \nabout 90 percent of rockets which otherwise could have hit major \npopulation centers in Israel. Ultimately, the Iron Dome protects \ninnocent lives, and I shudder to think of what this conflict's death \ntoll in Israel might be without it. I am reassured that the Senate \nAppropriations Defense Subcommittee doubled the administration's \nfunding request for the Iron Dome recently, and I commend my colleagues \nfor this tangible show of support for Israel.\n  I, along with many of my colleagues, am deeply committed to the \nsecurity of Israel, and I am saddened by the loss of civilian lives on \nboth sides of the current conflict. Too much innocent blood has been \nshed already.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5299-4", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5299-S5300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CHINESE DRYWALL\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I wish to join my colleague, Senator \nNelson, in expressing frustration over the Chinese Government's failure \nto remedy the damages to homeowners, businesses, and contractors caused \nby Chinese drywall companies.\n  Beginning some 10 years ago, drywall manufactured by Chinese \ncompanies was imported to the United States. A significant amount of \nthe imported Chinese drywall proved to be defective. In my State, this \ndrywall was mostly used in homes and businesses that had suffered \nsubstantial damages from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In total, there \nwere thousands of cases in the gulf coast area.\n  The drywall emitted sulfur gases, which caused physical damage to the \nhomes and significant health problems for the residents. The sulfur gas \nseverely corroded metals found in plumbing, electrical wiring, air-\nconditioning systems, and household appliances. Health issues included \nskin irritation, persistent cough, bloody noses, and asthma attacks. \nFor many families who lived through these hurricanes, having to \ncompletely rebuild a home again was yet another obstacle to their \nrecovery.\n  I have maintained that the Consumer Product Safety Commission should \nhave served as the first line of defense in preventing this inferior \nproduct from entering the U.S. market. Nevertheless, manufacturers, no \nmatter where they are located, have a responsibility to consumers \nharmed by defective products.\n  The homeowners sought relief in court, and most of the cases were \nconsolidated in the Eastern District of\n\n[[Page S5300]]\n\nLouisiana, where the court identified two companies as the primary \nperpetrators; Knauf Entities and Taishan Entities. Knauf Entities \nparticipated in litigation and paid damages. Unfortunately, Taishan \nEntities has refused to appear to defend lawsuits in U.S. courts and \nwill not negotiate with those harmed by the defective sheetrock.\n  The Honorable Judge Eldon Fallon of the Eastern District of Louisiana \nissued an order holding Taishan in both civil and criminal contempt on \nJuly 17, 2014. The order also enjoined Taishan and its affiliates from \nconducting business in the United States until it participates in the \njudicial process. Although this is a win for Taishan's victims, they \ndeserve and require tangible compensation for their losses.\n  The Chinese Government has shown no willingness to hold this company \naccountable. Meanwhile, thousands of families are still waiting for \njustice. We cannot allow Taishan Entities to hide from the United \nStates judicial process and further injure those who have suffered.\n  I urge this body to call on Taishan Entities to do the right thing \nand respect international law. Additionally, we should continue to \npressure the Chinese Government to hold companies within its borders \naccountable for their actions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5300-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5300-S5301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I wish to reiterate my longstanding \nsupport for employee stock ownership plans or ESOPs. During my time in \nthe Senate, I have been dedicated to building on the lasting \ncontributions of my Louisiana predecessors, including Senator Russell \nB. Long, who, as Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, championed tax \nprovisions to encourage corporations to adopt ESOPs. Senator Long \nadvocated for employee stock ownership as an ``issue that cuts across \nparty lines in an attempt to bring out the best in our free enterprise \nsystem.'' He believed that ``it is only fair and right that those who \nwork to make this economy succeed should have an opportunity to share \nin that success . . . [i]t is a matter of simple common sense and basic \nequity.'' I couldn't agree more.\n  Designed to expand employee ownership of firms through stock \ndistribution to employees, over time, ESOPs have a proven track record \nof encouraging capital expansion and economic equality for American \nworkers. The National Center for Employee Ownership estimates that 11 \nmillion people are employed by the roughly 12,000 companies that have \nadopted ESOP and ESOP-like plans and estimates that ESOP participants \nhave about 2.5 times the retirement assets of individuals who do not \nparticipate.\n  Last year, as chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I convened a roundtable to provide small business \nowners, policy experts and other stakeholders an opportunity to express \ntheir views and to solicit their ideas on making tax reform work for \nsmall businesses. Participants argued in favor of a Tax Code that \nrewards employer and employee ownership as a means of providing \ncontinuity of business ownership and opportunities for employees of \nbusinesses to build wealth. Specifically, participants favored \nretaining the current Tax Code's ESOP provisions, noting that during \nthe most recent economic downturn, ESOPs, which are predominately small \nbusinesses, were able to retain more employees as they weathered the \ncrisis than conventionally owned companies.\n  Companies in Louisiana have embraced ESOPs and as a result have seen \nboth businesses and their employees realize the benefits. One prime \nexample is Acadian Ambulance, a Lafayette, Louisiana-based company, and \nthe Nation's largest private, employee-owned ambulance service. Acadian \nAmbulance became a 30 percent-employee-owned company in 1993 and \nsubsequently became a majority employee-owned company in 1998. Today, \nAcadian Ambulance is a thriving business whose employee owners have \nretirement security because of Acadian Ambulance's employee stock \nownership plan. Its ESOP Committee has been recognized as one of the \nbest in the Nation, having won 25 regional and national awards since \n2001. Acadian Ambulance has grown to over 200 ambulances, a $180 \nmillion budget, and 2,000 employees who have retirement security.\n  Earlier this year, the New York Times published an article describing \nthe research of three labor economists who have focused their work on \npromoting ESOPs as a ``new perspective on how to resolve the \ndisparities in wealth and income.'' I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the New York Times article, dated February 11, \n2014, and titled, ``Whatever Happened to `Every Man a King'?''. These \nexperts, Dr. Joseph Blasi and Dr. Richard Kruse of Rutgers University, \nand Dr. Douglas Freeman of Harvard University, argue in their book, \n``The Citizen's Share'', that policies promoting employee ownership \ndate back to the era of the Founding Fathers and have garnered support \nfrom politicians and stakeholders across the political spectrum--from \nRonald Reagan to Senator Bernie Sanders.\n  Quite simply, policies that promote ESOPs are policies that merit \nthis Chamber's bipartisan support and I will continue the work of my \nLouisiana predecessors to ensure retirement security for working \nAmericans.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 11, 2014]\n\n               Whatever Happened to ``Every Man A King''?\n\n                         (By Thomas B. Edsall)\n\n       A passionate group of labor economists has taken up a cause \n     championed 40 years ago by Senator Russell Long of Louisiana: \n     to turn every worker into a capitalist. Long, the chairman of \n     the Senate Finance Committee from 1966 to 1981, inherited a \n     populist commitment from his father, Huey Long, the Louisiana \n     governor who famously campaigned on the slogan ``Every Man a \n     King.''\n       In 1973, Long became intrigued by the idea of granting \n     corporations generous tax incentives to distribute stock to \n     employees through Employee Stock Ownership Plans, or ESOPs. \n     Long's question was, could ESOPs ``make haves out of the \n     have-nots without taking it away from the haves?'' Working on \n     assurances that this was indeed the case, Long said, ``That's \n     the kind of populism I can buy.''\n       Beginning in 1974, Long won enactment of a series of bills \n     establishing tax incentives favorable to corporations that \n     transferred company stock into ESOPs. In 2012, the National \n     Center for Employee Ownership estimated that the number of \n     ESOPs had grown to 12,000, covering 11 million workers with \n     $858 billion in assets. Companies employing at least 10,000 \n     workers with ESOPs include Publix Supermarkets; WAWA; WinCo \n     Foods; and the employee-owned private equity firm, Alliance \n     Holdings.\n       After Long retired in 1987, however, some of the tax breaks \n     he sponsored were eliminated or weakened as Democratic and \n     Republican administrations sought new federal revenues to \n     reduce the deficit.\n       Robert Hockett, a law professor at Cornell, wrote in 2006 \n     that ESOPs had expanded employee ownership of firms, but that \n     ``there is indeed a gap to be filled--that firm ownership \n     remains nowhere near as widespread as home and human capital \n     ownership.''\n       Now three prominent labor policy experts have taken up \n     Long's cause. They are convinced that a major expansion of \n     employee ownership is the most effective tool available to \n     remediate inequality. The three experts--Richard B. Freeman \n     of the economics department at Harvard, and Douglas L. Kruse \n     and Joseph R. Blasi, both professors at the School of \n     Management and Labor Relations at Rutgers--have been \n     promoting worker capitalism in numerous papers and books. \n     Together they edited ``Shared Capitalism at Work: Employee \n     Ownership, Profit and Gain Sharing and Broad-Based Stock \n     Options'' and last year they released ``The Citizen's Share: \n     Putting Ownership Back into Democracy.''\n       In ``The Citizen's Share,'' Blasi, Freeman and Kruse make a \n     broad, ideologically cross-cutting case on behalf of profit \n     sharing and employee ownership: ``It offers a new way to \n     address the concentration of both economic and political \n     power that many citizens believe is distorting the country. \n     It offers a new perspective on how to fight the links between \n     the Washington politicians, K Street lobbyists, big \n     corporations, and political donors that fuel many Tea Party \n     members' opposition to government. It offers a new \n     perspective on how to resolve the huge disparities in wealth \n     and income.''\n       They make the following specific arguments.\n       First, they contend that policies promoting employee \n     ownership have strong public support and that these policies \n     reflect the convictions of the founders, including Thomas \n     Jefferson and James Madison.\n       Politicans on both sides of the partisan divide support \n     ESOP proposals.\n       Senators from the left, including Democrats Ben Cardin of \n     Maryland, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Mary L. Landrieu of\n\n[[Page S5301]]\n\n     Louisiana and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, and senators from \n     the right, including Republicans Roy Blunt of Missouri, Pat \n     Roberts of Kansas and John Thune of South Dakota, are, for \n     example, co-sponsors of the Promotion and Expansion of \n     Private Employee Ownership Act of 2013.\n       As far back as 1974, Ronald Reagan, then governor of \n     California, strongly endorsed the concept, telling Young \n     Americans for Freedom that ``capitalism can work to make \n     everybody a `have.' '' In an analysis reminiscent of Russell \n     Long's, Reagan said:\n       ``Income, you know, results from only two things. It can \n     result from capital or it can result from labor. If the \n     worker begins getting his income from both sources at once, \n     he has a real stake in increasing production and increasing \n     output. One such plan is based on financing future expansion \n     in such a way as to create stock ownership for employees. It \n     does not reduce the holdings of the present owners, nor does \n     it require the employees to divert their own savings into \n     stock purchases.''\n       Second, Blasi, Freeman and Kruse point out that there are \n     already extensive mechanisms in place for employee ownership, \n     not only formal ESOPs but also a variety of profit-sharing \n     plans. Because of this, they argue, major innovations are \n     unlikely to be needed; improvements in existing laws and \n     practices should suffice.\n       The authors cite responses to a question on employee \n     ownership asked in a 2006 General Social Survey. The survey \n     found that 47 percent of private-sector, full-time wage and \n     salary workers now have access to some form of sharing in the \n     firm where they work--cash profit sharing, cash gain sharing, \n     employee stock ownership, employee stock options or ESOPs.\n       Third, and most important, is the authors' claim that it is \n     economically advantageous to give employees an ownership \n     stake in the firm for which they work. Blasi, Freeman and \n     Kruse provide evidence that employees with some form of \n     worker ownership accumulate more savings than employees in \n     nonparticipating firms and that firms with some form of \n     capital sharing perform better in the competitive marketplace \n     than those that do not.\n       They write that ``workers with profit sharing or employee \n     stock ownership are higher paid and have more benefits than \n     other workers. This means that the substantial profit sharing \n     and gain sharing and ownership stakes for the typical worker \n     in these plans tend to come on top of, not in place of, fair \n     fixed wages and benefits.''\n       In addition, the authors cite studies showing sharp \n     increases in productivity, higher employee morale, lessened \n     turnover and fewer bankruptcies in corporations that adopt \n     ESOPs.\n       These findings raise a series of questions.\n       If the various forms of worker capitalism or profit sharing \n     produce such benefits, why hasn't the free market itself \n     forced every company to adopt similar plans?\n       Asked about worker ownership, Robert Frank, an economist at \n     Cornell and a specialist on issues concerning inequality, \n     wrote in an email that he is ``skeptical,'' and cites his \n     analysis of employee ownership in his book, ``The Darwinian \n     Economy,'' in which he argues that if a worker-owned firm has \n     all the advantages its proponents claim:\n       ``It would enjoy a prodigious competitive advantage. Since \n     wages account for about 70 percent of a typical firm's total \n     cost, increasing productivity by 15 percent would reduce \n     total cost by more than 10 percent. The firm could cut its \n     prices by almost that amount and still remain profitable, \n     which would enable it to peel off most of its rivals' \n     customers.''\n       Frank pointed out that ``any firm that enjoyed these \n     advantages should sweep the market like a prairie fire, \n     reaping enormous profits in the process.''\n       Freeman addressed this question in a series of email \n     exchanges with me. He began by noting that there is \n     management opposition to profit sharing with rank and file \n     employees ``because the people who control the firm may have \n     to take lower profits--if I am in charge of the firm and \n     sharing profits with you raises productivity, but it means \n     that I take less in profits, I will not favor going to a more \n     shared system.''\n       In addition, Freeman argued, ``magnitudes are important.'' \n     The gains from employee share programs are modest, a \n     ``productivity edge of about 2 percent or so on average,'' \n     which may be trumped by other marketplace factors, including \n     ``some small monopoly advantage'' held by competitors.\n       Freeman emphasized that many liberal-left economists and \n     policy makers are locked into the view that labor and capital \n     are intractably adversarial. Consequently they ``favor a \n     European style big government/strong union solution to \n     inequality'' rather than solutions of a more cooperative \n     nature such as ESOPs.\n       Blasi, in a more detailed response, emailed that ``both \n     Democrats and Republicans until recently really believed that \n     inflation-adjusted wage income growth or lowering taxes alone \n     could maintain and grow the middle class.'' In fact, Blasi \n     argues, changing economic conditions dictate that ``the \n     sustaining of a middle class and mobility requires a capital \n     ownership and a capital income policy.''\n       In addition, Blasi writes, the ``economic share policy \n     tradition in American history has been sidelined by scholars \n     in the modern and post-modern era. Until now, if you argued \n     for ESOPs you were using `small ball' ideas.''\n       Liberal opposition to ESOPs is based in part on the view \n     that the program amounts to a collection of tax subsidies for \n     corporations and the wealthy. The tax breaks for ESOPs \n     originally included a tax credit for company contributions: a \n     deferral of taxes on shareholders who sell stock to an ESOP; \n     deductibility of corporate dividends on ESOP-held shares; the \n     exclusion from tax liability of 50 percent of the interest \n     income from loans to an ESOP; and a 50 percent estate tax \n     exclusion on the gain from the sale of shares to an ESOP.\n       Blasi, Freeman and Kruse acknowledge that some critics see \n     ESOPs as pioneering ``a form of special-interest tax \n     incentives from the Treasury.'' Their counterargument: ``We \n     see the ESOP as the continuation of the Founders' desire to \n     reduce inequality and preserve democratic practices by \n     extending property ownership to more Americans.''\n       The Blasi-Freeman-Kruse proposal has the crucial political \n     advantage of appealing to some on the political right because \n     it would, in fact, make employee share programs more \n     attractive by boosting tax subsidies--a form of cutting \n     taxes.\n       Most significantly, the Blasi-Freeman-Kruse proposal stands \n     apart from alternate policy initiatives designed to address \n     growing inequality because it directly addresses the \n     concentration of wealth and political power at the top.\n       For that reason alone, the idea of expanding employee \n     ownership deserves serious consideration. The proposal does \n     not resolve the question of how to give workers a \n     sufficiently large share of capital to materially impact \n     their economic status. Still, there are not that many viable \n     options available to those who are committed to improving the \n     disadvantaged position of labor versus capital. Politicians \n     and policy makers cannot afford to disregard a proposal with \n     demonstrable potential.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5301-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DOWN EAST MAGAZINE 60TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the 60th \nanniversary of Down East: The Magazine of Maine. From the inaugural \nAugust, 1954, edition of 5,000 copies assembled around a kitchen table \nin Camden, ME, Down East has grown to become one of America's most \nsuccessful regional publications with a circulation that exceeds 90,000 \nand a devoted readership of people around the country who love the \nbeauty and culture of the State of Maine.\n  Down East was founded by Duane Doolittle, a native Mainer who left a \nsecure teaching position at Syracuse University at the age of 42 to \nreturn home in pursuit of his dream to publish a magazine dedicated to, \nas he wrote in his first message to readers, ``honestly reflecting the \nbeauty, the spirit, the unique and special qualities that make this \ncorner of the world like no other place under the sun.'' For six \ndecades, that statement of purpose has been fulfilled by talented \nphotographers and engaging writers, today under the leadership of \npublisher Bob Fernald.\n  The name of the magazine was taken from the historic practice of \nsailing downwind to head east along the coast of Maine, and Down East \ncontinues to celebrate the heritage of Maine. At the same time, the \nmagazine has expanded its scope to cover with expertise and insight \ncontemporary trends in the arts, food, fashion, business, and politics. \nIn addition to its award-winning print publication, Down East has a \nstrong digital presence with a global readership of more than 900,000 \nand a popular interactive kiosk at the Portland Jetport that offers the \nbest in Maine-made products.\n  Down East goes beyond recording life in Maine to enhancing it. From \ncharities and land conservation to the arts and festivals, the company \nis a generous supporter of efforts that strengthen our communities.\n  Capturing the essence of Maine in print is no easy task. Duane \nDoolittle put it this way: ``To attempt to crack the mystery of what \nthose things are that make a Downeaster different from a Texan or a \nHoosier would be as unavailing as pondering the imponderables. All we \ncan honestly say is that we are tuned to this particular parcel of \nearth and we like its music.''\n  That mystery may never be cracked, but for 60 years Down East: The \nMagazine of Maine has made the attempt entertaining and enlightening. I \ncongratulate the leadership and staff of Down East on this milestone \nanniversary and wish them continued success for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5301-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5301-S5302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING MARY ``MICKEY'' THOMAN\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I appreciate having this opportunity to \nshare\n\n[[Page S5302]]\n\nwith the Senate some of the accomplishments and achievements of one of \nmy constituents, Mary ``Mickey'' Thoman. Mickey will soon--and most \ndeservedly--be inducted into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame. It \nwill be another honor for her, a recognition that is fully and richly \ndeserved.\n  Mickey is well known for her knowledge, experience, and dedication to \nthe agriculture industry of Wyoming, a sector of our economy that is so \nimportant it is listed on our State seal. No one knows how much we \ndepend on our farmers and ranchers more than Mickey, and that is why \nshe has been such a strong and effective force in the agriculture \ncommunity of Wyoming for so many years.\n  The record shows that Mickey has been tending to her family's \nranching business and keeping everything running as it should for quite \nsome time. In fact, her ranch can now boast of its status as a fifth-\ngeneration family ranch. I have no doubt she draws her strength and her \nenergy from the work she does and her heartfelt connection to her ranch \nand her family. At the wise, experienced, and youthful age of 84, \nMickey continues to prove the wisdom of the old adage that the best way \nto lead is by example.\n  Mickey's is a truly remarkable story. It begins with her marriage to \nher late husband Bill and their decision to begin ranching together in \nthe Green River Valley after they were married in 1948. It is now more \nthan six decades later. Through the years Mickey has seen some tough \ntimes and faced some difficult challenges, but she has always been able \nto handle each obstacle that tried to block her way because of her \ngreat love of her life as a rancher.\n  Mickey is well known throughout the ranching community because of her \nties to the industry and to those who farm and ranch for a living. That \nis why, in an effort to help the next generation of farmers and \nranchers, she served as a 4-H leader for many years and helped to found \nthe Green River Valley CattleWomen and Sweetwater County Cowbelles. \nToday, her ranch raises Hereford cattle, Rambouillet sheep, and \nthoroughbred quarter horses.\n  Over the years Mickey has passed on her love of ranching and her \ncommitment to the Wyoming values that made her such a success to her \nchildren, her grandchildren, and her great-grandchildren. As they \ncontinue to put the lessons Mickey has taught them into practice they \nwill always remember that Mickey was the one who taught them how to do \nso many things on the ranch.\n  When Mickey is inducted into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame she \nwill be in good company. She will be among those who pursued their \ncommitment to serving their community by working to support the growth \nand strength of our agriculture industry and our state economy. Mickey \nwill fit right in because she has been an outstanding leader in that \nregard, serving with agriculture organizations and groups on both the \nState and the national level. They were fortunate she was willing to \nserve and to bring her knowledge of the industry to their work so that \nshe might help them to make a difference. Over the years the \ncontribution she made of her time and her talents helped to advance the \ninterests of the agriculture community as she served with the Wyoming \nStock Growers Association, the Guardians of the Grasslands, the Wyoming \nFarm Bureau, the American Quarter Horse Association, the National \nCattlemen's Beef Association, the American Sheep Industry Association, \nWyoming CattleWomen, and the Wyoming Woolgrowers Association. Clearly, \nMickey has never been one to sit idle when there was work to be done.\n  Mickey's upcoming induction into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame \nwon't be the first time she has been honored for her commitment to \nranching, farming, and our Wyoming way of life. She has also been \nrecognized with the Green River Valley Ranch Woman of the Year award in \n2012, the Farm Family Today Award from the Sweetwater County Fair in \n2013, a Partnership Appreciation Award from the Wyoming Landscape \nConservation Initiative in 2012, and, with her husband Bill, the \nSweetwater County Ranch of Couple of the Year Award in 1988 and the \nUpper Green River Valley Cattlemen's Lifetime Honorary Member Award in \n1997.\n  Mickey Thoman has shown she has what it takes to not only survive but \nto thrive in what can be a truly demanding business. Through it all, \nshe has been a role model for others to learn from and an example not \nonly of the best of Wyoming's traditions and values but proof of their \npower and strength. In a short while, I will be proud to join with \nSenator Barrasso as Mickey Thoman is officially inducted into the \nWyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame. It is another honor she has truly \nearned with her hard work, her leadership, her friendship with so many \nmembers of Wyoming's agricultural community, and her active interest \nand involvement in every aspect of the industry she has been a part of \nsince she and her husband first began to work their ranch more than 60 \nyears ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5302-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING FRANK MOORE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, at the 102nd Wyoming State Fair, I, \nalong with Senator Enzi, will have the honor of introducing Frank Moore \nas he is inducted into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame for 2014. \nFrank has spent his lifetime working for positive changes in \nagriculture, and he has undoubtedly earned this honor through his \nimpact both in Wyoming and nationwide.\n  Frank Moore's ancestors came to the Wyoming Territory in 1876 and \nstarted a ranching legacy. A century later in 1978, Frank and his wife \nElaine began raising their own cattle and sheep at the Spearhead Ranch \nnorth of Douglas, WY. They also started a successful outfitting \nbusiness which further diversified their ranching operation.\n  Frank has been iconic in his efforts to promote and build the sheep \nindustry. He is currently serving as chairman of the Mountain States \nLamb Cooperative, an organization he helped establish in 2001. The \nfounders of the Mountain States Lamb Cooperative knew that strategic \nvertical integration of the sheep industry was the only way to save it, \nand they led the charge in making it happen. Brad Boner, another \nfounder of the Mountain States Lamb Cooperative and Wyoming rancher, \nobserved: ``Without Frank's outstanding leadership and strong passion \nfor Wyoming's sheep industry, I am not sure we would have been \nsuccessful in our efforts to form the Mountain States Lamb \nCooperative.''\n  For almost three decades Frank has dedicated a great deal of time and \nenergy by volunteering and serving on boards and committees at both the \nState and national levels. In addition to serving on the Mountain \nStates Lamb Cooperative board since its inception, Frank has been the \npresident of the Wyoming Wool Growers Association, served on the board \nof directors of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Board, and he served in \nthe Wyoming House of Representatives from 1993 to 1996. He personally \nworked to establish the Scrapie Eradication Program, National Wool Act, \nGuard Dog Program, and many other initiatives that have influenced the \nsheep industry nationally.\n  Peter Orwick of the American Sheep Industry has said the industry is \nin a better place because of Frank's leadership and willingness to make \nhard decisions. The undying passion and determination of citizens like \nFrank and his wife Elaine keep the agriculture industry in both Wyoming \nand America thriving.\n  My wife Bobbi joins me in extending our congratulations to Frank and \nthanking him for his dedication to the Wyoming way of life. I will be \nhonored to share this special day with Frank and his family as he is \ninducted into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5302-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5302-S5303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MUDDYING THE WATERS\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a column written by Mr. Dennis Sun, Publisher of \nthe Wyoming Livestock Roundup, entitled ``Muddying the Waters.'' The \narticle was published on June 21 of this year.\n  Through this recently proposed Clean Water Act jurisdictional rule, \nFederal agencies are attempting to expand the definition of ``waters of \nthe United States'' to include ditches and other dry areas where water \nflows only for a\n\n[[Page S5303]]\n\nshort duration after rainfall. Federal regulations have never defined \nditches and other upland drainage features as waters of the United \nStates. But this proposed rule does, and it will have a huge impact on \nfarmers, ranchers and small businesses that need to put a shovel in the \nground to make a living.\n  Dennis knows what the true impact of this rule will be to rural \ncommunities. He is a fourth-generation rancher from Central, WY. Mr. \nSun stated in his column that ``according to the EPA, the proposed \ndefinition of waters of the U.S. would increase predictability and \nconsistency for CWA programs, and as a lot of folks see it--that's \nright--we know we would go out of business instead of just maybe.' ''\n  Dennis goes on to say that ``our government has run amuck, and we \nshouldn't like it. . .'' He is right. This proposed rule by the \nadministration is circumventing Congress by effectively writing \nnavigable out of the Clean Water Act, thus allowing the EPA and Army \nCorps of Engineers to seize all wet areas of the States. Just as \ntroubling as ignoring congressional intent, the proposed rule \ndisregards the fundamental tenet embodied in two landmark cases decided \nby the U.S. Supreme Court that there are limits to Federal \njurisdiction.\n  This unprecedented exercise of power will allow Environmental \nProtection Agency to trump States' rights and wipe out the authority of \nState and local governments to make local land and water use decisions. \nThis is particularly troubling when we have seen no evidence that the \nStates are misusing or otherwise failing to meet their \nresponsibilities.\n  The uncertainty this rule creates only delays economic investment and \njob creation. It defies logic to think this proposed rule will benefit \nanybody but bureaucrats in Washington who are far removed from the \ncommunities between the coasts.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to stand with ranchers like \nDennis Sun. Stand with those who understand the land best and not with \nextremists outside and within this administration who do not know how \nto run a farm, a ranch, or a small business.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Wyoming Livestock Roundup, June 21, 2014]\n\n                          Muddying the Waters\n\n                            (By Dennis Sun)\n\n       As we all realized on April 21, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \n     posted their proposed definition for ``waters of the U.S.'' \n     protected under the Clean Water Act (CWA) in the Federal \n     Register, and that triggered a 90-day public comment period.\n       EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said during a Senate \n     Appropriations Subcommittee hearing that current exemptions \n     for the CWA permitting for normal farming, ranching and \n     agricultural practices are kept intact in the proposal.\n       She added, ``If a farmer was not legally required to have a \n     permit before, this rule does not change that status. The \n     proposal does not add or expand the scope of waters protected \n     under the CWA.''\n       Well, after those words, the fight was on by those in the \n     farming and ranching industry, along with local governments \n     and the nation's business community. According to the EPA, \n     the proposed definition of waters of the U.S. would increase \n     predictability and consistency for CWA programs, and as a lot \n     of folks see it--that's right--we know we would go out of \n     business instead of just ``maybe.''\n       At the same time, 231 U.S. Representatives sent a letter to \n     the EPA and Corp of Engineers asking them to back off this \n     proposed rule to expand federal control under the CWA. They \n     said the proposed rule would redefine waters of the U.S. \n     under the CWA based on a narrow opinion by Justice Anthony \n     Kennedy in a 2006 Supreme Court decision that said an \n     isolated water, like a stock pond or a ditch, doesn't have to \n     have a surface water connection to a downstream navigable \n     water to be considered a ``waters of the United States.''\n       Justice Antonin Scalia wrote the plurality opinion on the \n     case, and his opinion differed from Kennedy's by saying that \n     waters of the U.S. include only those relatively permanent, \n     standing or continuously flowing bodies of water like \n     streams, rivers and lakes. Justice Scalia specifically noted \n     that waters of the U.S. do not include channels that only \n     hold water periodically and are only wetlands with a \n     continuous surface connection to bodies of water that are \n     waters of the U.S.\n       The EPA and Corps chose to base the final rule on the \n     Kennedy opinion. That was a concern that the Congressmen \n     raised in their letter, which read, ``Contrary to your \n     agencies' claims this would directly contract prior U.S. \n     Supreme Court decisions which imposed limits on the extent of \n     federal CWA authority. Based on legally and scientifically \n     unsound view of the significant nexus concept espoused by \n     Justice Kennedy, the rule would place features such as \n     ditches, ephemeral drainages, ponds, natural and manmade, \n     seeps, prairie potholes, flood plains and other occasionally \n     or seasonally wet areas under federal control.''\n       There lies the fight. Congressman Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) \n     said, ``Enough is enough with regard to federal overreach on \n     U.S. farms and ranches. When the bureaucrats at the EPA \n     decide to call a divot in the ground that fills with rain a \n     navigable waterway under the CWA, we know that our federal \n     government has run amuck.''\n       Well, our government has run amuck, and we shouldn't like \n     it--that is all the reason to get your comments in before the \n     Oct. 20 deadline. This deadline extension gives us a valuable \n     opportunity so take advantage of it. If you're wondering just \n     how to submit your comments, read more in this week's \n     Roundup.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5303-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MEDICARE'S 49TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, this week Medicare is turning 49 years \nold. Since July 1965, Medicare has provided critical access to health \ncare benefits for older Americans and people with disabilities. Florida \nalone is home to over 3.5 million Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Medicare has become a landmark program based on its popularity among \nbeneficiaries and the comprehensive benefits offered. In 1959, almost 4 \nout of 10 Americans over age 65 were living below the poverty line, as \ncompared with about 1 in 10 seniors living in poverty in 2000. Prior to \nMedicare, seniors paid almost half of the cost of their health; in \n1997, seniors paid only 18 percent of their health care costs. Medicare \npulled millions of Americans out of poverty by not only providing them \nwith important health benefits, but also by enabling seniors to use \ntheir hard-earned retirement savings for needs other than their health \ncare.\n  As chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, I understand that Medicare \nis essential to the Nation, particularly as the baby boom generation \nenters retirement. Those served by Medicare often have modest incomes \nand complex health conditions that depend on these lifesaving benefits. \nAs a committee, we have looked at Medicare's prescription drug benefit, \nresearched ways to eradicate fraud and waste in the program, and \nensured that seniors have access to quality, affordable care. In fact, \njust yesterday, the committee convened a hearing about how to improve \nMedicare beneficiaries' access to skilled nursing care.\n  The Affordable Care Act has helped to reduce costs, increase \nbenefits, and improve health care delivery for Medicare beneficiaries. \nEarlier this year, Derrick in Tampa wrote to me about how much the ACA \nhas meant to his family in providing care for his mother. His mother \nwas the victim of gun violence and will need extensive medical care for \nthe rest of her life. So Derrick wrote that when Congress passed the \nACA, ``I was excited for my mother and the many others'' who will \nbenefit from the improvements in providing health care to America's \nseniors. For example, thanks to a provision I fought for in the ACA, \nFloridians have saved more than $756 million on their prescription \ndrugs.\n  While we can still make improvements, the Medicare trustees report, \nreleased earlier this week, reported that the Medicare hospital \ninsurance trust fund solvency has been extended by 4 additional years \nfrom last year's estimate and 13 years longer than it was prior to the \npassage of the Affordable Care Act. Today, Medicare is more solvent \nthan it was in 1965.\n  It is our job, in Congress, to ensure that Medicare is available for \nall Americans when they need it and, as was the case for Derrick's \nmother, when they are impacted by ``circumstances not of their own \ndoing.'' Though the new projections are encouraging, we must continue \nto work to preserve Medicare for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5303-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5303-S5304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WAINWRIGHT DEW LINE LAND ACQUISITION ACT\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I have introduced legislation to \nauthorize the Federal Government to dispose of a piece of property on \nAlaska's North Slope that it no longer needs or wants but is of great \nimportance to the Inupiat residents of the North Slope.\n  Specifically, I am introducing a companion bill to legislation that \nhas also\n\n[[Page S5304]]\n\nbeen introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by my friend and \nfellow Alaskan, Congressman Don Young. This legislation would enable \nthe Olgoonik Native Village Corp. of Wainwright, AK to purchase at fair \nmarket value the 1,518-acre Wainwright Short Range Radar Site, SRRS, \nlocated in northern Alaska.\n  Originally deployed as the location for a Distant Early-Warning, DEW, \nLine radar station in northern Alaska, President Harry Truman withdrew \nthe site for use as a military radar station during the Cold War in \n1952. That station expanded in 1957 to enable the Air Force to track \naircraft or rockets entering U.S. air space from the polar region. The \nstation at Wainwright actually had a rather short lifespan, as its \nradars were replaced by more powerful systems in other locations \nstarting in 1963.\n  In the years since then, the buildings and a fuel tank farm near an \nairstrip at the site--located several miles southeast of the village of \nWainwright on Wainwright Inlet--have been abandoned by the U.S. Air \nForce. In 1974, the site was given to the Federal Bureau of Land \nManagement, BLM, to manage. In 1976, the lands, then located in the \nNaval Petroleum Reserve No. 4, were formally transferred from the Air \nForce to Department of the Interior's control when the area was renamed \nas part of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. While the site over \nthe years was used by the National Weather Service as a short range \nradar site, the land is no longer in Federal use and has undergone \nenvironmental cleanup and restoration efforts. Those efforts began in \n1998 and were completed in August 2013, with final testing and removal \nof contaminated soils expected to be finished by the end of summer \n2014.\n  Management of the lands around the site has changed significantly \nwith time. With passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in \n1971, the Wainwright Native Village Corporation, Olgoonik, received \ntitle to the surface estate of about 175,000 acres surrounding the \nvillage. The subsurface of the lands were owned by the Arctic Slope \nRegional Corp., ASRC, part of the nearly 5 million acres that ASRC \nreceived from the lands claims settlement for the benefit of its nearly \n8,000 Native shareholders who live in Arctic Alaska.\n  Olgoonik Corp., which has a variety of subcompanies, won the Air \nForce contract through its Specialty Contractors subsidiary, to \ndemolish, clean up, and remediate the DEW Line site. Its development \ncorporation has also acquired a lease on 27.5 acres of the site to \nallow its use for economic activities of benefit to the villagers. The \ncompany is now seeking to pay fair market value to buy the entire site, \nwhich would allow use of the existing fuel tank farm near the site's \n6,000-foot runway. The site could well be used in the future to support \nactivities in the Arctic Ocean, a northern port becoming an issue of \ngreat interest in Alaska given the reduction in the Arctic ice pack and \nconcerns about greater maritime transit of the Northwest Passage.\n  Normally, legislation would not be needed to permit the sale of a \nsurplus tract because BLM could use its existing authority to surplus \nthe site and dispose of it. However, in passage of the National \nPetroleum Reserve-Alaska Act, NPR-A, in 1976 Congress included a \nprovision that does not permit the BLM to dispose of property inside \nthe NPR-A without congressional approval. Thus, legislation in this \ncase is needed simply to permit disposition of the surplus tract.\n  Under my legislation, Olgoonik will be allowed to purchase the site \nbut only after the corporation pays for a required land survey and pays \nfor an appraisal, based on fair market value for the property. I should \nadd that this legislation is only being introduced after talks among \nthe village and regional Native corporations, the city of Wainwright, \nand the Wainwright Traditional--tribal--Council resulted in signed \nresolutions of support for Olgoonik's acquisition of the site. All \nNative entities supported the legislation during a formal BLM tribal \nconsultation effort that occurred on June 23, 2014, reaffirming a \nNovember 2013 resolution that supported the legislation and land sale/\npurchase. All parties agreed to support the land acquisition after \ncareful consideration of the environmental issues involved with future \nmanagement of the tract.\n  Clearly, the legislation is best for the BLM as it will relieve the \nagency of the cumbersome effort to manage the isolated parcel, which is \nlocated far away from other BLM land holdings inside NPR-A. It is best \nfor the environment as the agreement among the corporation, city, and \ntribe will guarantee that no activities occur on the land that are not \nacceptable to village residents--the land's need for subsistence \nhunting being best protected by ownership by the Native Corporation. \nAnd the land sale will be best for the citizens of Wainwright and the \nentire North Slope as it will guarantee that any development activities \nwill be controlled by residents of the village and not outside \ninterests.\n  This is the best outcome for all concerned, and I hope this \nlegislation will be given swift consideration and passage by Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5304-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               VIETNAM WAR COMMEMORATIVE PARTNER PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY.

Madam President, I am pleased the President signed the \nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, WIOA, into law last week to \nimprove job training in the United States. WIOA is the result of a \ncommitment in both parties and both Chambers to modernize our workforce \ndevelopment system to ensure American competitiveness. The last time a \nWorkforce Investment Act reauthorization was signed into law was in \n1998, far too long ago, and the significant skills gap we face as a \nnation is evidence that our fragmented system simply is not working.\n  Despite the billions of taxpayer dollars we invest annually on \nFederal job training programs, there are 4.5 million unfilled jobs and \na staggering 10 million unemployed Americans. We need to bridge this \ngap, and WIOA helps get us there by reducing bureaucracy and providing \nAmerican workers with a more flexible and effective workforce training \nsystem. Over the past year, I have heard from businesses, elected State \nand local leaders, and families back home about the critical need for \nreforms to our job training system, and I am glad to have had the \nchance to work on this bill and be a part of this process in the \nSenate.\n  This legislation incorporates many reforms contained in the SKILLS \nAct, which I introduced in the Senate earlier this year, including the \nelimination of 15 programs identified as duplicative or ineffective and \ncountless Federal mandates on States and local boards. In addition, \nWIOA establishes common performance metrics and requires independent \nevaluations every 4 years of all workforce programs to ensure \neffectiveness and accountability to taxpayers. By reducing bureaucracy \nand enhancing flexibility, WIOA eliminates delays that hinder job \nseekers from immediately accessing job training services and reentering \nthe workforce.\n  I thank Senators Alexander, Harkin, Isakson, and Murray and \nRepresentative Foxx for their leadership on this issue and am pleased \nto see this\n\n[[Page S5305]]\n\nimportant legislation was signed into law without delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5305-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                                 SOCCER\n\n Mr. WYDEN.

Major League Soccer, MLS, has rightly chosen Providence Park \nand the Portland Timbers as host for their annual All Star event, which \nthis year pits the MLS All Stars against European giants, Bayern \nMunich.\n  Soccer City, USA--as Portland fans have dubbed it--rightly deserves \nto host such a high-profile match. Portland is home to the most \npassionate fan base in the league for both the Timbers and the \ninaugural champions of the National Women's Soccer League, the Portland \nThorns. Timbers games drew more than 20,000 fans per game last season, \nand the Thorns averaged over 13,000 for home games. And, of course, I \nhave to mention the awesome banners displayed by Portland fans at \nProvidence Park, which are second to none.\n  This year, the Timbers' head coach, Caleb Porter, along with players \nDiego Valeri and Will Johnson, will represent our hometown team for the \nMLS All Stars. Congratulations to them for making all Oregonians proud. \nSpecial thanks should also go to team owner Merritt Paulson, whose hard \nwork getting a team to Portland paid off when he was awarded this great \nevent.\n  I commend the Portland Timbers, the Portland Thorns, the Timbers \nArmy, and the Rose City Riveters for their stellar community outreach \nand charity work in Oregon. Whether it is partnering with the Make-A-\nWish Foundation, building soccer fields for youth, or collecting school \nsupplies for local schools, the Portland Timbers show they are a first-\nclass organization through their outstanding civic engagement.\n  I send my congratulations to the MLS players who have made the All \nStar team and who will represent the league against an international \nopponent.

Madam President, I wish to ask my colleagues to \njoin me in recognizing the illustrious life of Mrs. Irma Gene Hall \nDeTiege, who passed on July 1, 2014, after more than five decades of \nservice in the Louisiana community.\n  Mrs. DeTiege was born in 1931 in Riverton, LA, which had a total \npopulation of 40, including livestock. From these humble beginnings, \nshe learned lessons of humility and hard work that were embodied \nthroughout her entire life. After moving to Monroe, LA and meeting the \nlove of her life, Frank G. DeTiege, a graduate of Southern University \nwho taught Industrial Arts at Carroll High School, Mrs. DeTiege rode \nthe bus to Grambling College every morning. There she received a \nbachelor's of science degree in elementary education, which she would \nlater use to become a teacher at Lincoln Elementary School. During her \ntenure, she created enduring changes in a wide breadth of programs that \nimpacted and improved the lives of almost every individual who attended \nthe school.\n  In addition to her efforts as a teacher, Mrs. DeTiege worked \ntirelessly as a newspaper editor, publisher, and columnist for the \nMonroe News Leader and the Monroe News Weekly before she and Mr. \nDeTiege founded the Monroe Dispatch in 1975. Mrs. DeTiege had a vision \nof providing the citizens of Monroe with access to accurate reporting \nat a time when important information in this community was too often \noverlooked. Throughout her career, she remained dedicated to ensuring \nthat those in crisis and most in need always had an advocate in the \ncommunity. In this and in all of her tasks, Irma fought for a community \nwhere people are taken care of, no matter their situation in life. She \nalso worked continuously to provide for the prosperity of Louisiana \ncitizens for generations to come. This level of devotion to her craft, \nthe people of Monroe, and the State of Louisiana is indicative of her \nstoried career of service.\n  Irma was a wonderful friend to me and my family. She was also an \ninspiration to all those who were impacted by her tireless efforts. It \nis with my heartfelt and greatest sincerity that I ask my colleagues to \njoin me along with her son Frank and other family members in \nrecognizing the life and many accomplishments of this incredible leader \nand her impact on so many people throughout Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5305-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5305-S5306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING THE DELAWARE 87ERS\n\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I wish to recognize the National \nBasketball Association's Developmental League team, the Delaware 87ers \nand their impact on my community.\n  In April 2013, Delaware sports fans rejoiced when the Philadelphia \n76ers acquired an NBA Development League team, the Utah Flash, and \nchose to relocate the franchise to Delaware. The Delaware 87ers are \nnamed in recognition of Delaware's place in United States history as \nthe first state to ratify the United States Constitution on December 7, \n1787, as well as in a nod to the franchise's parent team, the \nPhiladelphia 76ers.\n  The Sevens promised and delivered a fast-paced, high-scoring NBA \nbrand of action with the fan-friendliness and affordability for which \nthe NBA Development League is known.\n  During their inaugural season, the Sevens' success grew, drawing a \nsteady and passionate fan base to the Bob Carpenter Center as they \nsquared off against D-League teams from around the country. Rivalries \nwere built with the Canton Charge, Erie BayHawks, Fort Wayne Mad Ants \nand the Maine Red Claws.\n  The passion of the players and coaches, their connection to the \ncommunity, affordable ticket prices and family-friendly amenities drew \nthousands of fans to Newark. Head coach Rod Baker and his team, led by \nfan favorites Thanasis Antetokounmpo, Kendall Marshall, Lorenzo Brown \nand Vander Blue, finished their first season displaying flashes of \nbrilliance and leaving fans with high hopes for greatness to come.\n  Even more important than their on-court accomplishments was the \nteam's off-court impact on the community. Prior to their inaugural \nseason, the Sevens unveiled their SEVENS STRONG community initiative, \nwhich included revitalizing seven basketball courts in seven days, as \nwell as each of their employees pledging 87 hours of community service \nthroughout the year. Basketball courts that received makeovers included \nAdams Court, Fraim Boys & Girls Club, Kosciuszko Park, Helen Chambers \nPark, Tatnall Park, Woodlawn Park and Judy Johnson Park.\n  Throughout the 2013-14 season, the Sevens attracted more than 38,000 \nfans and averaged over 2,100 fans for the last eight contests. The \nattendance increase can undoubtedly be traced back to their commitment \nto the community and their tireless grassroots presence in Newark, \nWilmington, Christiana, Hockessin, Newport, Elsmere and Elkton. Players \nand the front office staff participated in countless community-based \nactivities including visiting Christiana Care and AI Dupont/Nemours \nHospital for Children monthly, partnering with Stubbs Elementary School \nfor a Green Week Challenge, volunteering at the Delaware Food Bank, \nhosting four non-profit promotions at games: Lyme Disease Awareness \nNight, B+ Foundation Night, Christiana Care NICU Night and USO Night, \nparticipating in more than a dozen community events, and donating over \n8,000 tickets to Delaware-based community organizations and charities. \nThe team truly embraced the meaning of community and civic engagement.\n  We congratulate the Delaware 87ers on a successful season, both on \nand off the court, and wish them continued success in their second \nseason. We look forward to supporting them as they work to inspire \ntheir fans and better our community.\n\n[[Page S5306]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5306-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING MARIA MATOS AND THE LATIN AMERICAN COMMUNITY CENTER\n\n Mr. COONS. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Tom Carper \nand myself, I wish to recognize two special occasions in Wilmington, DE \nhappening on September 5, 2014: the 45th anniversary of the Latin \nAmerican Community Center, LACC, serving the Hispanic community of \nDelaware as well as to honor the service, dedication and passion of a \nname synonymous with the service to Delaware's vibrant Hispanic \ncommunity: Maria Matos.\n  The LACC's continuum of care promotes education, life skills, and an \nenhanced quality of life while celebrating diverse Hispanic cultures. \nThe LACC was founded in 1969 in the Hilltop section of Wilmington \nserving and supporting the community and people that surround it.\n  Over the last 45 years, the LACC has focused on lifelong learning \nthat concentrates on the educational needs of client families, from \nquality pre-school programs to adult education; and life empowerment, \nfocusing on the immediate life needs families and individuals may face, \nfrom short term case management to a job placement or English language \nskills.\n  Since 1994, Maria Matos has been the executive director and driving \nforce behind the LACC. Her impact has been felt not just in the \nHispanic community, but throughout Wilmington and New Castle County. \nShe has contributed her leadership skills to such boards as the Medical \nCenter of Delaware, Grand Opera House, Delaware Community Foundation, \nand Advisory Council for the Fund for Women, as well as at the \ngrassroots level supporting the Hilltop Working Group, an alliance of \nresidents and legislators who work to promote the community's well-\nbeing.\n  In conclusion, we would like to congratulate Ms. Matos on her years \nof service to the LACC as well as the LACC on its 45 years of service \nto the community, and wish each of them luck in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5306-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL JAMES LIVINGSTON\n\n Mr. SCOTT. Madam President, I would like to take a moment \ntoday to honor Beaufort, SC resident, Maj. Gen. James E. Livingston, a \n33-year U.S. Marine Corps veteran and Medal of Honor recipient, for his \ntireless service to this country. He is truly an American patriot \nworthy of our recognition.\n  Born in Towns, GA, General Livingston knew from a young age that he \nwanted to serve his country. While enrolled at the Military College of \nGeorgia, he was a member of the nationally recognized Corps of Cadets. \nAfter graduating from Auburn University in 1962 with a degree in civil \nengineering, General Livingston rose through the ranks of the Marine \nCorps. From Vietnam to the Philippines and domestically, wherein he was \nthe first commander of the Marine Reserve Forces, General Livingston \ndistinguished himself with exceptional service all over the world. \nThroughout his long and storied career, General Livingston has made his \nmark as a man who leads by example.\n  General Livingston, serving as the operations officer for 3D \nBattalion, 7th Marines, oversaw Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation \nof Saigon. Despite the urgency and chaos of the situation, General \nLivingston led with poise and professionalism: characteristics that \nwould define his career. Due in large parts to General Livingston's \nleadership during Operation Frequent Wind, more than 7,000 American \ncivilians and Vietnamese people in a desperate situation were airlifted \nout of Saigon and to safety.\n  In 1968, while serving as the commanding officer, Company E, 2d \nBattalion, 4th Marines, General Livingston led his men on a determined \nassault on the village of Dai Do, where another Marine company had been \nisolated the night before when enemy forces seized the village. Despite \nbeing twice wounded by grenade fragments, General Livingston refused \nmedical treatment and continued to lead his men across 500 meters of \nopen rice fields. Having reestablished contact with the surrounded \nMarine Company, General Livingston then learned of a third Marine \nCompany leading an attack on nearby Dinh To village. Marshalling his \nresources, General Livingston consolidated the two companies and led a \nsupport effort to halt the aggressive enemy counter attack from Dinh \nTo. After being wounded a third time and rendered immobile, he remained \nin the combat zone and supervised the evacuation of his men. Only after \nhis fellow marines were safe did General Livingston allow himself to be \nevacuated. For his gallantry, bravery, and selflessness, General \nLivingston was awarded the Medal of Honor from President Richard Nixon \nin 1970.\n  In addition to the Medal of Honor, General Livingston also holds the \nNavy Distinguished Service Medal, the Silver Star, the Superior Service \nMedal, the Bronze Star, and the Purple Heart. It is because of men like \nJames Livingston that Americans sleep easy at night, knowing they are \nsafe from those who wish to inflict harm upon them.\n  It is an honor that this Saturday, August 2, General Livingston will \nbe the keynote speaker at my Vietnam Era Veterans Honor Ceremony in \nColumbia, SC where I will honor more than 1,500 veterans. General \nLivingston and his fellow veterans deserve to be recognized for their \ngallant efforts, and it will be my honor to stand with him on this \nspecial occasion.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in thanking Maj. Gen. James E. \nLivingston for a life and career dedicated to the protection of this \nNation, her ideals, and her citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5306-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO GEORGE C. WRIGHT\n\n Mr. COONS. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Tom Carper \nand myself, I wish to honor the exemplary service of the executive \ndirector of the Delaware League of Local Governments, George C. Wright \nand recognize his recent retirement. For over five decades, he has been \na tremendous and courageous leader serving in many positions throughout \nour great State. His hard work, perseverance, and dedication will truly \nbe missed.\n  Since the 1960s, George has played an active and integral role within \nDelaware. For six terms, he served as councilman in the town of Smyrna \nbefore serving as its mayor for 14 years. Since then, George has been a \ncrucial member and leader of the Delaware League of Local Governments. \nAs he steps down from his position as executive director, we join the \nmany Delawareans he has worked with in thanking him for his diligent \nefforts to improve and assist local governments through legislative \nadvocacy.\n  Born in Chesapeake City, MD and educated in the public school system \nthere, George studied at several distinguished universities including \nMaryland State College in Princess Anne and the University of Delaware. \nAfter his graduation, George began his career during the turbulent \n1960s as Head Start director in Smyrna, a town that was once denounced \nby former Attorney General David Buckson as having the worst race \nrelations in the State. George later went on to serve on the town's \ncouncil and as the chief of staffing at the Dover Air Force Base. In \n1981 he was able to overcome many racial barriers in order to become \nthe town of Smyrna and state of Delaware's first African-American \nmayor.\n  Most recently, as the executive director of the Delaware League of \nLocal Governments, George has successfully worked with 57 \nmunicipalities in Delaware to help forge a common voice across the \nState. George's work has been nothing short of inspirational and we are \nsincerely grateful for all that he has done on behalf of the towns, \ncities and counties in Delaware.\n  We wholeheartedly thank George for all of the work he has done for \nlocal governments of Delaware. His model leadership and dedication has \ntruly touched every corner of our great State. We offer our sincerest \ncongratulations on a job well done and wish him many happy, healthy, \nand successful years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5306-4", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5306-S5307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXCEPTIONAL CITIZENS' WEEK\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I wish to recognize and \ncongratulate the leadership and volunteers of New Hampshire's \nExceptional Citizens', EC, Week at Camp Fatima as the program marks its \n60th year of providing continuous service to children and adult campers \nwith special needs.\n  Held every year at Camp Fatima on the picturesque Upper Suncook Lake \nin\n\n[[Page S5307]]\n\nGilmanton Iron Works, EC Week is a non-sectarian outdoor camp program \nsponsored by the Catholic Diocese of Manchester. Attendance, which is \nfree for campers, is funded by generous contributions from individuals \nand businesses. During EC Week, campers have the opportunity to \nparticipate in a variety of traditional camping activities, giving them \na chance to enjoy the great outdoors and have some good old-fashioned \nsummer fun.\n  Borne of the idea that ``it would be great to allow these children \nthe same camping experience as other kids,'' Bill Haller, president of \nThe United Life and father of a child with Down syndrome; Dr. Tom \nWalker, a pediatrician at St. Paul's School; and the Rev. Richard O. \nBoner, associate pastor at St. John's Parish in Concord, who founded \nCamp Fatima for Boys, began work on this concept, starting EC Week in \n1954.\n  As they set out to create an entertaining and rewarding camp \nexperience, the program founders teamed up with student nurses from \nSacred Heart Hospital in Manchester, a group of Sisters of Mercy, a \ngroup of Sisters of St. Francis, and seminarians from St. John's \nSeminary, in preparation for the camp's launch. The first year 25 boys \nand girls attended the camp.\n  Since that first year, EC Week has grown immensely and now includes \n170 campers and more than 300 volunteers from around the country. It is \na unique and special experience that is treasured by so many, and has \nserved as a model for the creation of similar camps around the country.\n  As we celebrate the 60th anniversary of EC Week next month, I want to \ncommend the Diocese of Manchester and the EC Week staff and volunteers. \nTheir hard work and dedication has brightened the lives of thousands of \ncampers and allowed them to have exciting experiences they otherwise \nmay never get to enjoy. I have no doubt this outstanding program will \ncontinue to benefit and delight campers for generations to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5307-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JAMES A. HAUGHT\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I wish to recognize a dear \nfriend, a proud American and a passionate West Virginia leader, Jim \nHaught, who is celebrating his 90th birthday on August 6, 2014. I am \nincredibly grateful for Jim, for his loyal friendship and his \nunwavering support over the years. I am proud to celebrate his vast \nachievements and his many years of dedicated service to his community, \nto West Virginia, and to our Nation.\n  A native West Virginian, Jim was born in the small town of Weston and \nwas raised in New Martinsville. He was the proud son of Ben and Orpha \nHaught. With 11 siblings, there is no doubt that Jim learned early on \nabout the meaning of life's most important concepts, including \nleadership, sacrifice, and commitment. True to Jim's character, he also \nhad an eagerness and a passion for policy and government affairs from a \nvery young age.\n  Throughout his 90 years, and still today, Jim has always answered the \ncall of service--whether it was for our great Nation or for the \nbeautiful people of West Virginia. After graduating from Pine Grove \nHigh School, he joined the Navy and served proudly and honorably for 3 \nyears.\n  After returning home from the Navy, he left his hometown of New \nMartinsville to focus on his education at Salem College and then at \nGeorge Washington University in Washington, DC, where he was classmates \nwith Margaret Truman, the daughter of President Harry S. Truman. Jim \nthen went on to study law at West Virginia University and while there, \nfounded the university's Young Democratic Club in 1948. It was also at \nWest Virginia University that Jim first met my uncle, A. James Manchin. \nThe two became lifelong best friends.\n  Jim's commitment to his family and to the community continued after \nleaving West Virginia University. In 1952, Jim met his beautiful wife \nMelba in Parkersburg and soon thereafter the loving couple had their \nfour boys, Greg, Cameron, Benji, and Danny. To this day, his commitment \nto his family has undoubtedly always been his No. 1 priority in life.\n  Steadfast to his smalltown values, Jim has never been afraid to stand \nfor the principles he was taught at an early age, never forgetting his \nWest Virginia roots. He has always strived to make a positive \ndifference across our great State, and in 1958, Jim decided to run for \npublic office to represent Wood County in the West Virginia House of \nDelegates. He served for 2 years, until Jim embarked on a new journey \nin 1960.\n  As a staunch Democratic supporter, Jim and A. James together played \nan extraordinarily significant role in John F. Kennedy's Presidential \ncampaign in West Virginia. The duo worked tirelessly setting up county \norganizations in all of our State's 55 counties. They worked day and \nnight laying the groundwork, coordinating statewide efforts, and \ngathering the support that directly resulted in Kennedy's Presidential \nvictory. It was Jim's perseverance and energy that helped make JFK's \nPresidency a reality.\n  Jim and A. James' hard work and commitment to the campaign did not go \nunnoticed. When President Kennedy arrived in the White House, he \npersonally called Jim and offered him a position as the Director of \nFederal Housing, while A. James became the State Director of the \nFarmers Home Administration. Honored, Jim accepted the position and \nmoved to St. Albans in Kanawha County, where he remained active in his \ncommunity while working for the President.\n  It is not surprising to anyone who has had the pleasure of knowing \nhim, but Jim's success and his tremendous accomplishments have been \nrecognized on many levels.\n  Today, Jim continues to serve the people of West Virginia through the \nHansford Senior Center, a community center he established in St. Albans \nto help care for aging seniors in the area.\n  It has been an honor and privilege to know such an exceptional West \nVirginian. Jim's imprint will always be marked by his countless \ncontributions to the State of West Virginia. I join all West Virginians \nin wishing Jim a happy birthday and in celebrating his 90 years of \nsuccess, and I look forward to celebrating many more birthdays with my \ndear friend for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5307-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO GERRY COHEN\n\n Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, I wish to honor the service of a \ngreat North Carolinian, Gerry Cohen, who will retire in August as \nspecial counsel to the North Carolina General Assembly. For nearly 40 \nyears, Gerry Cohen has served the general assembly with incredible \nknowledge, distinction and commitment.\n  Gerry was first hired as a general assembly staff attorney in 1977 \nand later became the director of the bill drafting division before \ntaking on his final role as special counsel.\n  I had the pleasure to work with Gerry firsthand during my time as a \nState senator from 1999 to 2009. I found Gerry's extensive knowledge, \nlegendary memory and professionalism invaluable and truly unmatched.\n  Gerry will retire leaving a lasting mark on the institution he served \nover a long and illustrious career. His professionalism and grasp of \nthe issues have endeared him to Republicans and Democrats alike and \nearns him the title of ``statesmen.'' He will be truly missed and \nimpossible to replace.\n  Gerry earned a degree in political science from the University of \nNorth Carolina at Chapel Hill and later attended the UNC School of Law. \nAs a second-year law student, he served on the Chapel Hill Town Council \nbefore beginning his work for the North Carolina General Assembly. \nGerry also served on the board of the Raleigh Transit Authority between \n2009 and 2013.\n  North Carolina General Assembly members, both past and present, will \nsorely miss an institutional giant with an incredible grasp of the \nissues facing our State. Gerry and his wife intend to travel and enjoy \ntime with family and friends in the next phase of their lives and will \nfortunately not have to travel far to enjoy our State's picturesque \nmountains or beautiful coastline.\n  I wish Gerry and his family well and thank him for his incredible \nservice on behalf of North Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5307-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5307-S5308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING ADMIRAL CHARLES R. LARSON\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I wish to honor the extraordinary \nlife\n\n[[Page S5308]]\n\nand service of ADM Charles R. Larson. Admiral Larson passed away on \nJuly 26, 2014, in his Annapolis, MD, home. He leaves behind his beloved \nwife of 52 years, Sally, three loving daughters, and seven \ngrandchildren.\n  Throughout his 40 years of service, Admiral Larson exemplified the \nideals of a devoted public servant. After he graduated from the U.S. \nNaval Academy in 1958, he served tours of duty aboard the aircraft \ncarrier USS Shangri-la as an aviator and he served as a submariner on \nboard the nuclear submarines USS Nathan Hale, USS Nathanael Green, and \nUSS Bergal. After serving as Special Assistant to the Secretary of the \nInterior and naval aide to the President of the United States, he \nreturned to sea duty aboard the USS Sculpin. In 1990 Admiral Larson was \npromoted to the rank of four-star admiral. One year later, he assumed \nduties as commander in chief, U.S. Pacific Command.\n  Admiral Larson's career was marked with many notable accomplishments. \nHis naval service as both an aviator and a submariner was unique and \nadmired. In 1979, at the age of 43, he became the second-youngest \nadmiral in the history of the U.S. Navy. Admiral Larson's service is \nalso unique in that he served as both the 51st and 55th superintendant \nof the U.S. Naval Academy. Larson's second appointment as \nsuperintendant, while unusual, was something that the Navy desperately \nneeded. Prior to his second tour of duty as superintendant, the Naval \nAcademy was rocked by a cheating scandal. Admiral Larson was brought in \nto restore honor and integrity to his alma mater. The task was not an \neasy one, but he accomplished his mission by pursing two goals that he \noutlined when he took the job: ``No. 1: to develop character. No. 2: to \nprove the worth of the service academies to the people of the United \nStates''. By the time his second tour as superintendant was over, \nAdmiral Larson had succeeded in restoring the Naval Academy's \nreputation as one of America's premier educational and military \ninstitutions.\n  In closing, when I think of ADM Larson, I am reminded of a quote from \nanother famous Admiral, ADM Leighton Smith: ``The United States Navy is \nthe envy of every other navy in the world. They don't want to be like \nus--they want to be us.''\n  I believe this quote is true because of the outstanding devotion and \ncompetence of those who serve in our Navy. Ships and weapons systems \nare of little value if the service men and women operating them are not \nthe very best. Admiral Larson understood this, and his service helped \nthe Navy produce other exceptional leaders who have bravely defended \nand immeasurably enriched our Nation. Few could ask for a more \nhonorable legacy.\n  I believe that Admiral Larson's legacy is one of duty, honor, and a \nsincere devotion to serving and improving the Navy he loved. I ask that \nall Members of the Senate join me in remembering this extraordinary man \nand his admirable years of service to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5308-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MESKWAKI TRIBAL POWWOW CENTENNIAL\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, from August 7 through August 10 \nthe Meskwaki will be celebrating the 100th anniversary of their tribal \npowwow, and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate them \non this occasion. This is a unique event held annually on the only \nIndian settlement in the State of Iowa. During this celebration the \ntribe members celebrate and perform dances that have been handed down \nfor generations. It is a time of reaffirmation and hope and a time of \nfriendship.\n  The Annual Meskwaki Powwow originated from the traditional religious \nand social beliefs of the Meskwaki Tribe. This annual event is derived \nfrom the ``Green Corn Dance'' which originally took place during the \nharvesting of the crops. From 1902 to 1912, the tribe held the ``Field \nDays'' which would last for the week, with dancing, games, and horse \nracing. And then in 1912, the tribe made the decision to change the \nname from ``Field Days'' to ``Powwow''. This historic celebration \ncontinues to be held at the original location.\n  I would like to congratulate the Meskwaki on this joyous occasion and \nhope they will continue to celebrate their powwow for many more years \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5308-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MAGIC VALLEY VETERANS AND HOSPICE VISIONS\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I wish to pay special tribute to \nthe outstanding service of veterans living in the Magic Valley of Idaho \nand thank Heidi Walker and all the staff with Hospice Visions for the \nwork they do on behalf of veterans in the Magic Valley.\n  Hospice Visions has chosen to honor 12 veterans this year in a \nveterans recognition ceremony hosted by Genesis Healthcare at their \nTwin Falls Center. Veterans from the River Ridge, Twin Falls and \nBennett Hills facilities are among those being recognized. This year's \nhonorees are: Dennis Asmussen, who served in the Navy in Vietnam; Bill \nBenedict, who served in the Army during World War II; Jon Hindes, who \nserved in the Army in Korea and Vietnam; Levi Hussey, who served in the \nMarines in World War II; Benjamin Le baron, who served in the Navy \nduring World War II; Jay Richards, who served in the Army during the \nCold War; Byron J.

These \nveterans are being honored for their service to our Nation. Joining in \npaying tribute to these extraordinary Americans is a honor.\n  Occasions such as this remind us of the many veterans who are such \nimportant parts of our communities. Our freedoms are preserved because \nof their selfless service. They not only gave all for our country, but \nalso they continue to uplift our communities and other generations of \nreturning veterans and their families. Thank you also to the families \nof those who serve our country. You make sacrifices every day in \nsupporting your loved ones who served in the Armed Forces.\n  The ceremony also provides an opportunity to recognize the remarkable \nwork of Heidi Walker and the staff and administrators of Hospice \nVisions for their dedication to assisting our Nation's heroes. I have \nthe honor of presenting Heidi Walker and Hospice Visions with a Spirit \nof Idaho Award for going above and beyond in serving the Magic Valley's \naging, ill, and homebound veterans. Your commitment to the men and \nwomen who have served and your work to ensure they receive recognition \nfor their service are commendable. I understand Hospice Visions is a \nparticipant in the We Honor Veterans Program, a partnership between the \nNational Hospice and Palliative Care Organization and the Department of \nVeterans Affairs to better serve veteran patients in hospice-like \nfacilities. Heidi and Hospice Visions have given quality care to our \nNation's veterans and have been a great support to their families.\n  Thank you to the veterans of the Magic Valley for your service and to \nHeidi Walker and all those at Hospice Visions for your exemplary \ndedication to veterans and their families.

Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to Richard \nStruckhoff, the county clerk of Greene County, MO. He has been a quiet, \ntireless and efficient servant to the citizens of my home county for a \nrecord 27 years. He was appointed when Ronald Reagan was President and \nJohn Ashcroft was Governor. Then Governor Ashcroft wisely chose \nStruckhoff for the position he still holds today. Richard was on the \nstaff of another member of this body, U.S. Senator John Danforth, \nserving in the Senate district office in Springfield, MO.\n  I met Richard when I was the Greene County clerk and he was a news \nreporter for KWTO Radio in Springfield. Richard, with his trademark \nbeard, was then as he is today--easy to work with, soft-spoken, \ninsightful and a keen student of local politics. Struckhoff was part of \na pack of journalists who visited my office every day looking for\n\n[[Page S5309]]\n\nnuggets of public interest and features about elections and county \nnews. He won awards for his public affairs broadcasts at KWTO. Later he \nwent to work for Senator Danforth, and in 1987 when the Greene County \nclerk resigned, he was appointed. Richard says Danforth was a role \nmodel with his principled leadership, openness to many viewpoints, and \na devotion to his religious faith, all of which had an impact on \nStruckhoff's decision to seek elective office.\n  During his 27 years as clerk, he has seen a host of changes, but none \nmore dramatic than the implementation of the Help America Vote Act \nafter the 2000 presidential election. As the chief election official in \nGreene County, Struckhoff guided the effort to switch from more than 20 \nyears of punch-card voting to computerized scanner machines and a \nstatewide voter registration system. Struckhoff's small cadre of staff \nhas overseen elections, voter registration and education, tax law, \nlicenses, and county archives. He is seen as a role model by his \ncolleagues, pursuing public service in place of partisan politics. \nOther community leaders have praised his hard work, collaboration, and \ngood humor. That in itself is a remarkable record.\n  Struckhoff has been married to Micki for more than 40 years, and they \nhave three children and a host of grandchildren. Richard spends his \nfree time between elections on the road, seeing grandkids, singing in \nthe band, the ``Geezers,'' or playing music at church. In more recent \nmonths, Richard and Micki have begun traveling to shooting competitions \nin various locations, and they have both become good shots.\n  Richard is also a man of faith--deeply involved at Immaculate \nConception Catholic Church in the music program. He was born in St. \nLouis in 1952, came to Springfield in the late 1970s and graduated \nMissouri State University in 1988. We have been blessed by his \nleadership ever since.\n  Family, faith, music and guns: is there any doubt why we like to be \naround Richard Struckhoff? He is a funny guy with a charming smile and \na quick wit. He is a true public servant and my friend. I know he won't \nbe looking for things to do in retirement. His plate is full with \ngrandkids to mold, songs to sing and guns to shoot. We have Richard \nStruckhoff to thank for more than 27 years of fair elections in Greene \nCounty. I hope retirement brings many rewards to Richard and his \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5309-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BOULDER STATION HOTEL AND CASINO\n\n Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I wish to recognize and \ncongratulate Boulder Station Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on 20 years \nof business and excellence. Boulder Station's dedication to providing \nquality service and bettering its community is commendable, and I am \nproud to recognize it here today.\n  Since its grand opening on August, 23, 1994, Boulder Station has been \nan integral part of the Las Vegas community. Boulder Station not only \ncontributes to the Nevada economy by bringing tourists to our great \nState, but it also serves as a large employer of residents of Las \nVegas, currently employing 1,115 Nevadans, some of whom have worked for \nthe property since its opening day. The Boulder Station team members \nstrive to make the entire staff feel like a family. Their level of \ncorporate care and devotion is demonstrated through their exemplary \nguest service and generosity to local philanthropic causes. They \nbelieve it is both a privilege and responsibility to help build and \nmaintain a happy and healthy community, and by giving back they strive \nto assist others who may simply need a helping hand.\n  Boulder Station has worked to help improve education in Southern \nNevada as well. For 13 years, the property has partnered with Laura \nDearing Elementary, an at-risk elementary school, as part of the Smart \nStart Program. The partnership program has five components: the school \nreceives an annual award; a student incentive program is set up to \nimprove an area of need; the company sponsors a recognition program for \nteachers and staff; team members from the Boulder Station volunteer \ntheir time to help with school events and support teachers in the \nclassrooms; and the casino donates surplus computers and computer \nequipment to the partner schools. Boulder Station's commitment to \nbettering the community's local educational system is admirable, and I \nam proud Nevada is home to a business that has taken such an active \nrole in helping our youth.\n  The gaming industry plays an integral role in Nevada's economy. \nCasinos have also generated over 100,000 jobs for Nevadans and continue \nto be one of the largest employers in the State. Plain and simple, the \ntourism and hospitality industry is the lifeblood for businesses and \njob creation in Nevada.\n  I ask my colleagues and all of my fellow Nevadans to join me in \nrecognizing Boulder Station Hotel and Casino on 20 years of business \nand dedication to the Las Vegas community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5309-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                LANDAFF, NEW HAMPSHIRE 250TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I wish to honor the town of \nLandaff, New Hampshire, which is celebrating the 250th anniversary of \nits founding next month. I am proud to join citizens across the Granite \nState in recognizing this special milestone.\n  Landaff, a town in Grafton County, lies fully within the Connecticut \nRiver watershed, with the Ammonoosuc River to the northwest and the \nWild Ammonoosuc River to the south. The southern half of the town is \npart of the magnificent White Mountain National Forest.\n  The town of Landaff has a rich history. It is named after the Bishop \nof Llandaff, chaplain to King George III. After the town's first 60 \nsettlers failed to meet the requirements of the King's original grant, \nthe territory was re-granted to Dartmouth College in 1770.\n  The college contributed to the town's development by building roads, \na school and a saw mill. In 1773, however, the original owners desired \na return of their land and petitioned the Governor to revoke the \nDartmouth grant. The issue of the ownership of Landaff was drawn out in \nthe courts for the next 17 years. When the American Revolution \nconcluded, changes in the American legal system prompted the college to \ngive the town back to the people.\n  Today, Landaff's population remains around 360, with the patriotism \nand commitment of its residents reflected in part by their longstanding \nrecord of service in defense of our Nation.\n  One distinguished Landaff resident, Harry Chandler, was born in \nLandaff in 1864 and moved to Los Angeles, CA. Mr. Chandler eventually \nbecame the editor of the Los Angeles Times, but he never forgot the \nlittle town that raised him. He was said to have offered a job at the \nnewspaper to anyone from Landaff who showed up at his door.\n  Resident sage of Landaff, Moor Noyes, once made this observation \nabout the history of the town: ``Things ain't now as they use to was \nbeen and people don't do as they use to did then.'' Truer words have \nnever been spoken.\n  Landaff has contributed much to the culture and spirit of the State \nof New Hampshire. I am pleased to extend my warmest regards to the \npeople of Landaff as they celebrate the town's 250th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5309-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5309-S5310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            NEW HAMPSHIRE DAY TO END CHILDHOOD HOMELESSNESS\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, today I wish to recognize the \nNew Hampshire Day to End Childhood Homelessness. On September 4, 2014, \nFamilies in Transition, a Manchester-based nonprofit organization that \nhas long committed itself to ending the cycle of homelessness, will be \nhosting this important event.\n  Founded in 1991, Families in Transition was born from the belief that \nhaving a home is a basic human right. The organization has since been \nrecognized, both statewide and nationally, for its effectiveness in \nending homelessness through quality, affordable housing and \ncomprehensive services. Families in Transition focuses on addressing \nhomelessness by facilitating familial cohesion through specialized \nchildcare, family therapy, and positive social activities. Family and \nyouth services at Families in Transition are a vital part of efforts to \nhelp homeless children in New Hampshire.\n  The New Hampshire Day to End Childhood Homelessness event will bring \ncritical awareness and support to\n\n[[Page S5310]]\n\nthese children and the work of Families in Transition.\n  On behalf of New Hampshire I thank Families in Transition, its staff, \nvolunteers, and supporters for their determination to serve Granite \nStaters in need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5310-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RICHARD E. WRIGHT\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I wish to honor Chief Richard \nE. Wright for his lifelong commitment to the New Hampshire fire \nservice. Chief Wright retired in June after committing 70 years of his \nlife to the safety of Granite State residents. Through seven decades, \nhe served as a soldier, a firefighter, the fire chief for the town of \nLoudon, and as the chief coordinator for the Capital Area Mutual Aid \nCompact.\n  Chief Wright's service to the fire department began when he was only \n11 years old. His paper route included the Central Fire Station and the \nfire chief's home. Soon, he became a fixture at the station, and his \nhelpfulness earned him the unofficial title of ``Errand Boy Number \nOne.''\n  Upon graduating from Concord High School in 1950, he worked for the \nRumford Press. Then he served his country, enlisting in the U.S. Army \nin 1953. After a 2-year tour of duty in Germany, he returned to New \nHampshire as a sergeant.\n  Although Chief Wright had left the Army, his life of service had only \njust begun. He joined the Concord Fire Department call force in 1957 \nand then became a full-time firefighter in 1963. Soon Chief Wright was \nusing his skills to manage the Concord department's budget and handle \nadministrative tasks.\n  Through his instinct for business and management, Chief Wright helped \nto create the Capital Area Mutual Aid Fire Compact in 1965. To this \nday, the Mutual Aid Compact enables Concord and surrounding localities \nto share resources to fund their fire departments efficiently, saving \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  In 1970 he left full-time fire service to run his family business, \nWright Communications, although he continued to serve as a volunteer \nfirefighter in Concord for several years. Then in 1973 he was appointed \nchief coordinator of the Mutual Aid Compact and became full-time \ncoordinator in 1989. In addition to this position, he worked with the \nLoudon Fire Department, serving as their fire chief for 12 years.\n  Chief Wright retired from his role as Mutual Aid Compact coordinator \non June 14, 2014. Throughout his career, he has responded to fires and \ncalls from across central New Hampshire 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \nHe has coordinated resources in order to address major emergencies and \nkeep Granite State residents safe.\n  Chief Wright's service to New Hampshire is truly remarkable. I \ncongratulate him on his retirement and thank him for his lifetime of \ndedication to our great State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5310-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HELENA, MONTANA SESQUICENTENNIAL\n\n Mr. WALSH. Madam President, I wish to recognize Helena, MT, on \nthe occasion of its 150th birthday. Our capital city, which I am \nprivileged to call home, continues to contribute to the State of \nMontana and our Nation.\n  Four prospectors came to Montana territory looking for gold in the \n1860s, and they struck it rich when they discovered gold in the creek \nthat now runs under Helena's main street. They named the area Last \nChance Gulch. When news of the site spread, thousands of other migrants \nflooded the area, hoping to find success. To care for the growing \nmining population, shops, hotels, and saloons sprang up, and a small \ncity began to grow.\n  That settlement was officially named Helena on October 30, 1864.\n  Unlike other mining towns, Helena prospered after the gold rush \nended. Since it was near major roads and surrounded by fertile \nfarmland, Helena continued to thrive throughout the 20th century.\n  Helena has been an integral part of our State since before Montana \nbecame part of the United States--the city was named the capital of \nMontana territory in 1875, 14 years before Montana joined the Union.\n  The very first special forces unit of our Nation's military was based \nat Fort Harrison, just outside of Helena.\n  Today, Helena continues to flourish. Thousands of visitors come each \nyear to hike scenic paths, tackle nationally-rated mountain bike \ntrails, ski the slopes in Great Divide Ski area, enjoy the view of the \nSleeping Giant, and drink great local beers.\n  As Montana's capital, Helena is the center of the State government, \nand public servants continue to tackle today's tough issues and work to \ncreate a better Montana and country for all of us.\n  I want to congratulate Helena for its contributions to our State and \nour Nation. We look forward to the next 150 years being as exciting as \nthe last.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to recognize the 70th \nanniversary of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.\n  I am proud to stand here today to remember the heroism of the men and \nwomen who took part in the Warsaw Uprising. On August 1, 1944, the \nPolish Home Army was ordered to mobilize against the German forces. The \nRed Army had retreated to the outskirts of Warsaw and the Polish people \nbelieved the German forces would choose to withdraw. They choose this \nmoment to stand up and try to liberate Warsaw before the Soviet forces \ncould take control of the city.\n  The Polish Home Army consisted of 40,000 brave soldiers, including \n4,000 women. They lacked weapons and supplies but proved to be a \nchallenging force against the German Army. In response, Heinrich \nHimmler ordered all of the people of Warsaw killed and the city razed \nto the ground to stand as an example to the people of Europe.\n  The Polish Resistance fought bravely to liberate and protect their \ncapital and their nation. But the Nazis were determined to crush the \nresistance. After 63 days of fighting, the German Army overcame the \ncourageous Polish resistance. As a result, 85 percent of the city of \nWarsaw had been destroyed by the end of World War II.\n  The actions of the Polish people during the Warsaw Uprising serve as \nan inspiration to all people fighting for their right to freedom and \ndignity. To this day, their legacy stands as a testament to the Polish \ncharacter. It is for these reasons that I am honored to mark the 70th \nanniversary of the Warsaw Uprising, which serves as a symbol of heroism \nand the strength of the human spirit.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Madam President, as chairman of the subcommittee \nresponsible for funding and oversight of our Nation's foreign \nassistance budget, I have witnessed firsthand the significant gains \nachieved by many African countries over the last 20 years.\n  This progress has been driven by the ingenuity and hard work of the \nAfrican people, and has been supported by U.S. assistance provided by \nthe American people and others. I am pleased that so many African \nleaders will be coming to Washington next week for the U.S.-Africa \nSummit to discuss how we can continue to grow partnerships between the \nU.S. and their countries.\n  However, I am disappointed by the lack of attention to human rights \nand the rule of law in connection with the summit. There is no doubt \nthat for peace and equitable economic development to flourish on the \nAfrican continent, investment is needed to spur economic growth and \nsecurity cooperation is needed to foster stability. But without a \ncommitment to fundamental human rights and the rule of law, these \nefforts cannot be sustained.\n  That is why I support the administration's exclusion of three of \nAfrica's worst human rights abusers, Omar al-Bashir, Robert Mugabe, and \nIsaias Afwerki, who have no place in these discussions. But it is also \nwhy I am disappointed there will be leaders present who have been \ncredibly implicated in gross violations of human rights and significant \ncorruption, including President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of \nEquatorial Guinea. President Obiang has used events like these as \npropaganda to shed his image as a brutally corrupt dictator. He should \nnot be sitting down to an invitation-only dinner at the White House \nwhile his political opponents languish in jail.\n  While I support the intent of this summit, and the continued growth \nof our relationship with African leaders who are dedicated to improving \nthe lives of their people, I cannot support the hospitality provided to \nthose who use their offices to silence their critics and treat their \ncountries' natural resources as their own personal bank account.\n  I hope the White House and State Department will insist that the rule \nof law and fundamental freedoms including the freedoms of expression, \nassociation, and religion remain a common theme during discussions on \neconomic and security cooperation. These are not just American values, \nthey are universal human rights.\n  In the long run, our commitment to our own principle will ensure that \nthe assistance we provide yields sustainable results for the good of \nthe people of Africa and the United States.\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Madam President, before we close the Senate before the \nAugust recess, I just want to speak for 1 minute.\n  We all heard the exchange earlier between the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Menendez, and Senator Enzi, and Senator \nCarper also participated, about appointing ambassadors. I think it is a \nsad day for America when our gridlock, the gridlock that the Congress \nhas created, makes it to where we cannot appoint our ambassadors to go \noverseas to represent our great Nation and to be our representatives \nthere in these countries, many of which are struggling, and many of \nwhich have a lot of tensions either with us, the United States, or \ntheir neighbors or other countries in the world.\n  I think our country is suffering because of the gridlock and I must \nsay that the fault rests with all of us. We are elected to be leaders, \nand we are not showing leadership by not working through these \ndifficult issues and allowing the basics of government, including our \nambassadors to be appointed.\n  I must say there is a simple solution to all of this, and it is not \nsomething that is found in a new political science textbook, it is not \nsomething that some talking head on a TV show has proposed. There is \nsome ancient wisdom that we all should follow, and that is the Golden \nRule. We should do unto others as we would have others do unto us. If \nwe would follow that, if all of us would take that to heart and apply \nthat to our business here in the U.S. Senate and the business of the \nNation, it would be revolutionary in how we conduct our business.\n  That is the only way to fix it. You have to approach this job as a \npublic servant and to do what is right for the country, not for your \nparty or not for some individual agenda. I hope when we are all home \nduring the August recess we will hear some of that from our \nconstituents and we will bring that back in September and we will \nrededicate ourselves to getting the business of the Nation done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/31/senate-section/article/S5316-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 11 A.M.
